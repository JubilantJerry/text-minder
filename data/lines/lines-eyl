You need to tell the doctors to get him on Pralidoxime right away.
If they don't...
he's going to die.
Thanks, Doc.
Hey, how's Danny?
He's, uh, he's okay.
He's responding to the drugs.
I mean, it's still early, but, uh, they all seem to think he's going to pull through, so...
All right.
Thank God.
Yeah.
You were right about the sarin.
If they didn't found out when they did,
Danny would probably be dead right now.
Does he have a family?
Yeah, he's got an ex-wife and a little girl.
Danny said something about having Grace this weekend.
Ah, Rachel and Stan are in Maui.
Hey, can we see him?
Not right now.
The doctor said once he's stable they're going to move him to a recovery ward where he can have some visitors.
Look, guys, I know this is hard, and we all want to be here.
But, right now, we need to I.D. this vic, and we need to find out where he bought that milk.
Right.
Do you think this could be an act of terrorism?
Or a random act of mayhem, like the Tylenol scare in the '80s.
Either way, we need to make sure there's no further risk, okay.
So, you two, I need you to contact the milk distributor, find out where they sell their product, and pull everything off the shelves.
I don't care if we're even taking resources away from finding Sang Min.
Right now, this is our number one priority.
We're on it.
Kaye, can you coordinate with CDC?
Gotta make sure nothing else is contaminated.
Yeah, of course.
I can also send a sample to a contact at Langley.
He can run chemical analysis, maybe determine the source of the sarin.
Hey...
Thanks, Jenna.
Oh, please.
You're in crisis mode, you're down a man, I'm more than happy to pitch in.
Besides, I don't even really know if there's a job waiting for me back home.
Took three months leave of absence to hunt down the man who killed my fiancé, and the last time
I checked the CIA wasn't... super-keen on the whole, you know, personal vendetta thing.
So if you think that I can help you with your investigation...
Kaye.
Kaye.
Kaye!
Kaye!
Yeah.
Well, what I meant to say was
"Thank you for helping Danny." Okay?
You saved his life.
You're welcome.
Call me if you get something.
Okay.
Where are you going?
Uh...
I got a little something to take care of.
McGarrett.
SANG MIN You should have seen your face.
Bet I was the last person you expected to see, huh?
Have to say I was pretty surprised myself.
I'm guessing that bomb on the door was intended for Wo Fat.
Doesn't matter now, does it?
We both missed our shot.
But I might be able to give you a second chance.
What's it worth if I help you find him?
What's it worth?
Not much, okay?
Considering you've already burned us once.
Well, the situation has changed.
All right, you want to make a deal?
Great.
Here's what I'm prepared to offer you.
Hey, Gracie!
Uncle Steve!
Hey.
Hi, kiddo.
Where's Daddy?
Listen, Gracie,
Danno's, uh, Danno's not feeling the best, okay?
So I'm going to take you to the hospital.
We're going to go see him.
Is he going to be okay?
Is he going to be okay?
Let me tell you something about your father.
He might not talk like it, but he is one tough guy, and he's brave, as well.
Can you be brave like Danno?
Are you sure?
Then we should go see him.
What are you waiting for?
Come on.
Pae'aina Dairy products sell at over a hundred locations on the Island.
We pulled all of their milk cartons off the shelves.
CDC is doing some random testing, but so far none of the samples have turned up positive for sarin, except for the one that our victim drank from.
So it's looking like an isolated incident.
Now the question is, was it random or was our victim targeted?
Sarin seems like an odd choice for a murder weapon.
It's actually not as far-fetched as you might think.
Used to be that sarin was hard to get, but ever since 9/11 we've taken down so many terror cells that sarin brokers are looking for new customers.
Basically, anyone with cash and connections to the black market can get their hands on it.
Hey, got an I.D. on our vic.
Guy's name is Amoka Mulitalo, 57 years old.
Was arrested six months ago for misdemeanor trespassing.
Which is interesting, considering the house we found him in wasn't his own.
Well, whose house is it?
Jeff and Sheila Fallon.
Pay taxes in California, but keep this home as a vacation rental.
So, what's Amoka doing in their house drinking tainted milk?
My father was never the same after his auto accident.
He suffered from aphasia, impaired memory.
He just couldn't manage for himself.
So... we had him move in with us.
You filed a missing persons report for your father a few weeks ago.
That wasn't the first time, either, was it?
Sometimes... he'll go for a walk, forget how to get home.
If I couldn't find him,
I'll file a missing persons report.
Then, a few days later, the police will find him on the street or... at a shelter.
But this time...
I'm sorry, but... we've never seen him before.
I don't understand.
How did this man end up dead in our house?
We believe he was squatting there, and when he was in your home, he drank some milk from the refrigerator.
That milk was laced with sarin-- it's a compound that's used as a chemical weapon.
It killed him within minutes.
What is it?
We were supposed to come to Hawaii last week.
I asked our caretaker, Gabriel, to stock the refrigerator.
But we ended up canceling the trip.
So Gabriel's the one who bought the milk?
Yes.
When was the last time you spoke to him?
A few days ago, when we let him go.
You fired him?
Why?
We had given him a checkbook to cover expenses.
Bills, repairs and such.
Last week, we found he had been writing checks to himself.
I called him.
He denied it at first, but... eventually, he came clean.
I told him to keep the money and leave us his key.
How did he take that?
Not well.
He was very upset.
You think the caretaker planted the sarin?
Well, the man has a history of violence.
He served time for aggravated assault in several home-invasion robberies, plus he was just fired, which does give him motive.
But it doesn't give him means, and sarin's not exactly easy to find.
I mean, how does a local caretaker get his hands on it?
Right.
I'm still running background.
But Chin and Kono are on their way to ask him that very question.
Okay, I got to go, okay?
Just keep me posted.
Yeah, sure thing.
Hey, Doc, how's he going?
Ready for some visitors.
All right.
Let's go, Gracie.
STEVE Looks like he's sleeping.
Danno!
Monkey!
Mm!
Mm!
I made this for you.
You did?
Look at this.
This is me.
See, this is a masterpiece.
Look at that.
I mean, she's an artist, no?
It's beautiful.
So I'm gonna make a nice space on the refrigerator and move some stuff around.
This is going dead center.
Thank you.
How you feeling?
Uh...
I don't know, I feel like everything hurts.
Head feels like it's gonna explode.
It's, like, the worst hangover I ever had.
What's a hangover?
It's, uh, you'll figure it out, you'll learn about it one day when you're about, what, 35?
35, thirty... 60.
40 years old.
Thank you.
Don't mention it.
Listen, since you're, uh, since you're looking so... so good now,
I'm gonna head back to the office, okay?
I'll swing by and pick her up later.
She can stay with me until, uh, until Rachel gets back.
How does that sound?
What do you think?
Okay.
You okay?
I got everything I need right here.
I'm good.
Huh?
Huh?
Hey.
You kidnap Miley Cyrus and put her in your backpack, or is that a cell phone?
Stan bought it for me.
He did?
Fabulous.
Go answer it.
First boy that calls, I'm gonna whip that thing into the Pacific Ocean, okay?
Hi, Mommy.
Yeah, I'm with Daddy.
He's in the hospital.
Mommy wants to talk to you.
Hi, Rachel.
No, I'm fine.
Would you please stop?
I said I'm fine.
I like hospital food;
you know that.
I checked in for the weekend;
I like it here, it's nice.
Oh, yeah.
This place, they make a kick-ass loco moco.
Yeah?
Too bad we won't be staying for lunch.
Gabriel Delgado?
I'm going out the front!
Five-O!
Stay down and don't move.
Look, I told you, my son... he's sick.
He's got leukemia.
First five years of his life, I'm locked up.
I finally get out of prison,
I can't even pay his hospital bill.
What kind of father does that make me?
So is that why you stole from the Fallons?
I got another job driving the airport shuttle.
I was gonna put the money back in their account as soon as
I got paid.
But they found out before you could, right?
And you knew if they reported the crime, it was back to prison for you.
That's why you tried to kill them.
What?
Did you buy groceries for the Fallons last week?
I did.
Well, we found sarin inside a milk carton that you put in their fridge.
Why don't you tell us about that?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I don't even know what... sarin is.
Oh, really?
Let me show you.
This is sarin.
And that's what sarin does to you.
Oh, my God.
Amoka.
What, you know him?
Yeah.
Yeah, I-I take my boy to Blessed People's Mission.
They have a free clinic once a week.
Amoka sometimes sleeps at their shelter.
Kind man.
Even with all his own problems, he would always ask about my son.
I knew he was having a hard time there, so I told him about the rock.
What rock?
So, the Fallons hid a spare key at their property.
We found it in the backyard, and Gabriel admitted to telling Amoka about it.
Said that he stayed there for a few nights when the shelter got overcrowded.
And we believe him?
I spoke to the mission;
story checks out.
Apparently, Amoka stayed at the shelter off and on for two months.
Same dates as Gabriel's son was getting treatment.
If Gabriel planted sarin in the milk, the last thing he's gonna want to do is let a hungry homeless guy come and stay at the house before the targets return.
So we just lost our only suspect.
The good news is we may have picked up a new one.
I pulled a fresh print off the spare key.
It belongs to Elliot Connor-- his fingerprints are on file with the SEC.
How does he know Jeff and Sheila Fallon?
Well, in addition to being Jeff's brother-in-law, he's also an employee.
He's the COO of Jeff's company.
They do big business manufacturing industrial storage equipment.
Check this out.
According to International Business News, there have been rumors about friction between
Jeff and Elliot.
Apparently some of the board meetings have gotten contentious.
Sounds like motive.
You guys go talk to Jeff, see what he's got to say about it, and I'll go see Elliot.
Look, I already gave you my statement.
Well, if you want to bring me in again, you know where to find me.
I may as well tell you, 'cause you're gonna find out.
I returned the money to I.A.
It was the only way to keep Uncle Keako out of prison.
Where did you even come up with $200,000?
Got a loan from somebody.
Borrowed against the house.
This is crazy.
All I.A. has to do is run the serial numbers, and they'll know they won't match the ones that were stolen.
Actually, they can't do that.
Inventory logs for the Asset Forfeiture Locker when missing years ago.
How do you know that?
Everybody in the department knows it.
It's the worst-kept secret on the island.
I never heard about it.
That's 'cause you never walked a beat.
Somewhere, right now, there are two cops telling this story over coffee and malasadas.
Cuz... you've been carrying this for a long time.
You took the blame for a crime you didn't commit, and you lost your job... your friends... and your family.
And now you have a chance to get out from under all this.
And what?
You're gonna throw it all away, put yourself into debt, and go to prison?
Excuse me.
We'd like to see Elliot Connor.
Sorry, he's in a meeting now.
See if you can free him up for us.
Rumors of a rift between me and Jeff are nonsense.
Have there been disagreements?
Of course, but that's normal when you're managing a business with someone.
Well, just out of curiosity,
Mr. Connor, what were your disagreements about?
Jeff relocated me to Hawaii to run the Pacific base of operations.
The company's planning a big push into Asia.
We had some differences of opinion on marketing strategy.
That's it.
One of the advantages of working with my brother-in-law is that we can slug it out at the office, but at the end of the day, it's family first.
Work always comes second.
Sounds like you're close.
That's nice.
So, uh, tell me something.
Jeff and Sheila-- do they ever have you come by the house, check on the property?
No, they have a caretaker who stays there when they're away.
All right, then, why did we find your fingerprint on the spare key that was hidden outside the house?
You know, I did use that key once to drop off some papers-- the Q4 financial report.
I wanted Jeff to review it as soon as he arrived.
Please don't lie to us.
I'm not.
You shifted in your chair and you touched your face as you were answering the question.
Those are both signs of deception.
Plus, you added unnecessary details about delivering the papers just to make your lie sound more credible.
Does Jeff know that you're using his house to cheat on his sister?
What?
That's absurd.
Wow, mock outrage-- that's a bad one.
Tan line on your finger there.
Forget to put your wedding band back on after your last hookup?
Look, here's what I think's going on, okay?
Either you've been using Jeff's house to carry on an affair and that's why we found your print on the key, or you were in the house trying to kill your partner.
Which is it?
We haven't used the house in months not since Jeff confronted me about it, and that's the real reason things have been tense here at work.
It has nothing to do with business.
Well, with all due respect,
Elliott, you were using his house to cheat on his sister.
I can hardly blame him for being upset.
I know it's terrible.
Jeff asked me to break it off with Chloe, and I'm going to.
Just haven't gotten around to it yet?
We're going to need to talk to Chloe, okay, to corroborate this.
Go ahead.
She's right outside.
The secretary?
That's original.
Can I ask you a question?
So, what do you need a slingshot for?
Doesn't make any sense to me.
I mean, they're birds.
Can't they fly?
These birds don't have wings.
Oh, that explains it.
Now I know why they're so angry.
Thank you for clarifying.
Howzit, Jersey?
Hey, big dog, what's going on?
Grace, you remember Kamekona.
Hi.
What up, shorty?
Figured you guys need some grub.
I know hospital foods are the worst and the portions-- very small.
That's very sweet of you.
Fried chicken?
Filipino-style.
Best on the island, brah.
You know, Gracie, when I was a little keiki like you, my mama used to bring me this chicken every time I was sick.
Fried chicken isn't good for you.
It has cholesterol and causes heart disease.
Nah, a little bit of grease is good for you.
Helps the insides stay lubricated.
Drumstick or thigh?
Um, I'm gonna go-- I like white meat.
Is there a breast?
Sorry, all gone.
That was a long drive, brah.
I know, I know.
Well, I didn't call you here for the chicken.
Gracie, put your headphones on, please.
So... your boy Sang Min has resurfaced.
Heard he bounced a few months ago.
He's back?
In a big way.
Looks like he took a swing at some heavy hitters and he missed.
My guess is he's looking for a way off the Island, so I need you to get on the coconut wireless, make a couple calls.
You found him for us once, you can do it again, right?
Sure, let me use your phone.
What's wrong with your phone?
I don't bring 'em to the hospitals no more, brah.
You heard about the signals interfering with the pacemakers?
It's true.
Okay, you can use my phone.
Will you wipe your greasy paws off before you touch my phone, though?
What grease?
Yeah, they look like...
That's sufficient.
Hey.
You got something?
Yeah, I got a call from your CIA contact.
They found a chemical match to our sarin.
Turns out it's the same strand used by a Chechen terror group in a botched Moscow attack five years ago, and the Russian FSB identified the supplier as Mikhail Yursky, and get this--
Mr. Yursky arrived in Hawaii five days ago under a fake passport.
Time line matches the murder.
Then that's our killer.
Now all we have to do is find him.
Police!
Police!
Go, go, go!
Clear.
You're all secure.
Hey, Mikhail's not here.
What do you got?
We found a credit card under the same name as his fake passport.
He just purchased a flight to Borneo.
Leaves tonight at 7:00.
All right, notify the TSA.
We'll have the sheriff's department cover the flight and we'll leave a unit here at the hotel in case he comes back.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, I just got a fresh hit.
His card's being used at an ATM right now-- Central Pacific Bank on Alakawa.
That's a couple blocks away.
We're on the way.
Okay, I'll see if I can stall him for you.
Now you might want to try checking the magnetic strip.
Maybe clean it.
Oh, you're good.
Perfect.
Not good, not good.
Steve, he's on the move.
Got him-- right there.
Got him.
All units, be advised.
Suspect is in a maroon sedan traveling north on Alakawa.
Hey!
Stand back, the canister has a leak.
He's been exposed.
I'll call for an ambulance, get HPD Hazmat as well.
Go, go.
Yeah, we're at an alleyway behind the 1500 block of Alakawa.
Chin, he's done, he's dead.
Uh, chuck the ambulance.
Send the M.E. and the Hazmat team.
Okay, all right.
Hey.
What the hell?
Are we ready for that extra credit?
Extra credit?
You're telling me that this guy is not from around here?
No, Dad, SpongeBob lives in a pineapple under the sea.
Well, what else could be more Hawaiian than that?
Huh?
Mommy.
Daddy's not sick anymore.
I am so happy to see that.
Hey.
You didn't have to come.
Yes, I did.
All right, well, once it's deemed safe, have HPD process the car for evidence.
Hazmat team just finished checking the canisters in Mikhail's trunk-- empty with no signs of toxins.
Well, he was about to leave the island with them.
I'm guessing he was going to use the canisters to traffic the sarin.
Yeah, what's still not adding up, though, is why a bioweapons dealer with terrorist ties would target two innocent people from the mainland.
What's going on?
Commander McGarrett.
David Akahoshi, Internal Affairs.
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?
I came to return something to Mr. Kelly.
The serial numbers on these bills don't match the stolen money, which means you're trying to cover for your uncle.
Those inventory logs disappeared years ago, so those serial numbers don't exist.
Actually, they do.
After the forfeiture locker was robbed,
I.A. kept waiting for you to slip up and spend the money somewhere.
We figured that you were being careful, so we had the asset forfeiture division put the word out that their inventory records had been lost.
It was all a lie.
If you thought we couldn't trace the serial numbers, maybe you would finally start spending the money, but that never happened because you never stole it.
Chin, this has gone too far.
You got your money back.
Let this go.
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
I know you were just trying to protect your family, which is why I am not going to charge you with obstruction of justice.
I'm not even going to ask where you got that money, but your uncle stole from the Honolulu Police Department, which means he stole from the people of Hawaii, and he's going to have to answer for that.
I myself am going to ask where you got this money.
Marcum.
The bookie?
I signed the deed to my house over to him.
Return it.
Get your deed back.
Steve...
I didn't have a choice.
Listen to me, all right?
If you did this for your uncle, you don't have to explain anything else to me.
Uh...
You guys need to see this.
So, any respectable chemist can synthesize sarin;
the trick is not killing yourself in the process.
Because in addition to having a short half-life, sarin's also extremely volatile, making storage a challenge.
The ideal container is electro-polished aluminum, double-walled with a fail-safe coupling valve-- but those can be difficult to procure.
That's right, because the FBI monitors large sales of these things to make sure that they're not being used to traffic chemical weapons.
Exactly.
Which is why it's so impressive that we found 36 of these canisters in Mikhail's trunk.
Check out who the manufacturer is.
Fallon Global?
That's Jeff and Elliot's company.
So Mikhail ends up getting his canisters from them, and his sarin ends up at Jeff's house.
That's not all-
- I pulled Mikhail's phone records.
Guess who he called the day he landed?
Mr. Connor.
Have you got a minute?
I've never seen this man before in my life.
That's funny, 'cause he called here the other day.
Three times.
I didn't speak with him.
Oh, yeah?
Phone records show the calls came into your direct line, and you spoke for a total of 12 minutes.
We think we might know what you were talking about, too.
You see, Mikhail, he wanted equipment that your company produces so he could store his sarin.
You wanted your brother- in-law out of the picture so you could run the company.
What's it called?
Quid pro quo?
No.
I was thinking of something else.
Oh, yeah.
Conspiracy to solicit murder.
These calls, when did they happen?
Thursday, the 13th.
I was on the Big Island last week.
I didn't get back until Saturday.
You can check with the hotel.
Well, then who took the calls?
Only person who answers my calls is my secretary.
She's gone.
Suspect's name is Chloe Ballantine.
I need you to lock down the entire building right away.
Right now.
Steve!
Put your hands on the wheel.
Put your hands on the wheel.
Elliot wanted to be with me.
We were happy together.
But Jeff and Sheila ordered him to end the affair, and you couldn't accept that, could you?
How'd a local girl like you get mixed up with a terrorist like Mikhail, anyway?
Take a look at this.
Hey.
Look at the photo.
Look at the photo.
His name was Amoka.
He had a daughter, and he had grandchildren.
And now he's dead because of you.
Mikhail contacted our office looking to purchase a certain product we make.
But Legal did a background check, and they refused the purchase order.
So a couple days later, Mikhail calls the office, offers me $20,000.
All I had to do was fake some invoices.
But instead of taking the money, you asked him to commit murder.
No.
I took the cash, too.
My, oh, my, aren't you the opportunistic one.
Let me ask you something, though.
Why sarin?
There are plenty of easier ways to kill people.
That's why.
That's why, isn't it?
Because it's big and it's bold.
And you thought the cops would think it was a terrorist attack, and they'd be so busy dealing with mass panic that they'd never think of murder.
It's pretty well calculated,
I got to say.
You know what else?
I don't think you ever loved Elliot.
Not at all.
He was a payday for you.
In your twisted logic,
Jeff and Sheila were the only thing stopping you from cashing in.
And with them out of the way,
Elliot could take control of the company, right?
And the two of you could be free to carry on your relationship.
He was gonna divorce his wife and marry me.
But what good was that without money?
Well, you know what?
Now you got nothing.
Which is a real shame, because, uh... you could do with that money right now to pay for a lawyer.

It's called the Order of the Rising Sun.
It was awarded to a Japanese pilot who bombed Pearl Harbor.

My grandfather served at Pearl, and he died on the Arizona.

Entry team, fall back.
Arson, explosives.
I need an ETA on rescue.
- Boss, he's on the move.
I'm going in.
Stay here, surround the perimeter.
I'm headed toward the back of the house.
Rear team has been mobilized, is searching for the target.
Boss, he's moving upstairs.
I got eyes on the target, but it's not Wo Fat.
It's Sang Min.
I repeat, Sang Min.
- Please repeat.
- I'll say again.
Sang Min.
Wo Fat wasn't in the house.
Kaye, get down.
- You all right?
Stay here, please.
- Yeah.
Okay?
Hey, I got him.
He just went into a house three doors down from the safe house.
All right, he's in a white Cadillac sedan.
Plate number Charlie, tango, eight, three, two, Romeo.
Call it in, Kono, every agency.
Listen to me.
Sang Min knows that we're onto him.
- He's gonna try to flee the island.
- Yeah.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't there a car attached to you?
- Oh, weird.
- All right, APB is out.
Okay, who is Sang Min?
Fugitive, human trafficker, all-around scumbag.
Known associate of Victor Hesse, which puts him in the same circles
- as Wo Fat.
- Okay, so he could've been holing up
- at Wo Fat's safe house.
- Or he was taking a shot at him.
The front door was rigged with the explosive charge, right?
I think Sang Min's expecting Wo Fat to be walking through that door.
- Why would he try to kill him?
- I think it was a preemptive strike.
Sang Min knows Wo Fat doesn't like loose ends.
Which is exactly what he became once he escaped from prison.
Danny.
- Danny.
Danny.
Whoa, whoa.
Danny, are you hit?
No.
Something's not right.
I can't breathe.
- Guys, his pulse is slow.
- Okay, I'll call an ambulance.
- My chest.
I can't breathe.
- We got help on the way.
Just tell me what happened.
There's a body, no pulse.
Officer Kalakaua, I need an ambulance...
- Stay with him.
Yeah.
Stop.
Stop right there.
- What is it?
- I don't know.
Whatever he died from might be biological.
We have to get Danny to a hospital right now.
Steve, over here.
Hang in there.
He's starting to convulse.
Danny, Danny.
Hey.
Stay with me, Danny.
Stay with me.
BP is 72 over 40, breathing slow and shallow.
- How long since the last exposure?
- About 20, 30 minutes.
What kind of toxin?
- My team's working on it.
You better hurry because I don't know how much time he has.
- I need to get McGarrett on the phone.
- So, what are we looking at here?
Victim inside died from exposure to a chemical weapon,
- nerve agent to be exact.
- How can you be sure?
I spent two years with the CIA's Biological Threat Assessment Team.
One of our case studies was the subway attack in '95.
Right.
Terrorists released sarin on multiple trains.
- Whole subway system was affected.
- Our victim has the same symptoms.
Facial ulcerations, petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes, constricted pupils.
Everything's localized around the head, which makes me believe that he ingested the toxin orally.
So someone spiked the milk that our victim drank.
But sarin is also transdermal, which means Danny was exposed when he touched the victim to check for a pulse.
- McGarrett.
Hey, it's Kaye.
Listen to me.
Danny has been exposed to sarin.
You need to tell the doctors to get him on pralidoxime right away.
If they don't, he's gonna die.
Thanks, doc.
Hey.
How's Danny?
He's, uh...
He's okay.
He's responding to the drugs.
It's still early, but, uh, they all seem to think he's gonna pull through, so...
- Okay.
- Thank God.
Yeah.
You were right about the sarin.
And if they didn't find out,
Danny would probably be dead right now.
- Does he have a family?
- He's got an ex-wife and a little girl.
Danny said something about having Grace this weekend.
Oh, I bet she was staying on Maui.
- Hey, can we see him?
- Not right now.
Once he's stable, they're gonna move him to a recovery ward where he can have some visitors.
Look, guys, I know this is hard and we all wanna be here.
But right now we need to ID this vic and find out where he bought that milk.
You think this could be terrorism?
Or a random act of mayhem like the Tylenol scare in the '80s.
Either way, we need to make sure there's no further risk.
So you two, I need you to contact the milk distributor, find out where they sell the product and pull everything off the shelves.
Don't care if we're taking resources from finding Sang Min.
Now this is our number one priority.
We're on it.
Kaye, can you coordinate with CDC, make sure nothing else is contaminated?
Yeah, of course.
I'd also send a sample to a contact at Langley.
He can run chemical analysis, maybe determine the source of the sarin.
Hey.
- Thanks, Jenna.
- Oh, please.
Crisis mode, down a man.
I'm more than happy to pitch in.
Besides, I don't even know if there's a job waiting for me back home.
I took three months leave to hunt the man who killed my fiancé.
The CIA wasn't super keen on the whole personal vendetta thing.
- So if you think that I can help you...
- Kaye, Kaye.
- Yeah.
- What I meant to say was thank you for helping Danny, okay?
You saved his life.
You're welcome.
Call me if you get something.
Where are you going?
Uh, I got a little something to take care of.
McGarrett.
You should've seen your face.
Bet I was the last person you were expecting to see, huh?
I have to say, I was pretty surprised myself.
I'm guessing that bomb on the door was intended for Wo Fat.
It doesn't matter now, does it?
We both missed our shot.
But I might be able to give you a second chance.
- What's it worth if I help you find him?
- What's it worth?
Not much.
Okay?
Considering you've already burned us once.
- Well, the situation has changed.
- All right.
You wanna make a deal?
Great.
Here's what I'm prepared to offer you.
- Hey, Gracie.
- Uncle Steve.
Hey.
Hey, kiddo.
Where's daddy?
Listen, Gracie, Danno's, uh, not feeling the best, okay?
Gonna take you to the hospital.
We're gonna go see him.
- Is he going to be okay?
- Is he gonna be okay?
Let me tell you about your father.
He might not talk like it, but he's one tough guy.
And he's brave as well.
Can you be brave like Danno?
Are you sure?
Then we should go see him.
What are you waiting for?
Come on.
Pae'aina Dairy Products sell at over a hundred locations on the island.
We pulled all their milk off the shelves.
CDC is doing some random testing, but so far none of the samples have turned positive for sarin except for the one that our victim drank from.
So it's looking like an isolated incident.
Now the question is, was it random or was our victim targeted?
Sarin seems like an odd choice for a murder weapon.
It's actually not as far-fetched as you might think.
Used to be that sarin was hard to get, but ever since 9/11, we've taken down so many terror cells that sarin brokers are looking for new customers.
Basically, anyone with cash and connections to the black market
- can get their hands on it.
- Hey, I got an ID on our vic.
The guy's name is Amoka Mulitalo.
Fifty-seven years old, was arrested six months ago for misdemeanor trespassing, which is interesting, considering the house we found him in wasn't his own.
- Well, whose house is it?
- Jeff and Sheila Fallon.
Paid taxes in California, but, uh, keep this home as a vacation rental.
So, what's Amoka doing in their house drinking tainted milk?
My father was never the same after his auto accident.
He suffered from aphasia, impaired memory.
He just couldn't manage for himself.
So we had him move in with us.
You filed a missing persons report for your father a few weeks ago.
- Wasn't the first time either, was it?
- Sometimes he'll go for a walk, forget how to get home.
If I couldn't find him, I file a missing persons report.
Then a few days later, the police will find him on the street or in a shelter.
But this time...
I'm sorry, but I've never seen him before.
I don't understand.
How did this man end up dead in our house?
We believe he was squatting there.
And when he was in your home, he drank some milk from the refrigerator.
That milk was laced with sarin.
It's a compound that's used as a chemical weapon.
It killed him within minutes.
What is it?
We were supposed to come to Hawaii last week.
I asked our caretaker, Gabriel, to stock the refrigerator.
But we ended up canceling the trip.
So Gabriel's the one who bought the milk?
Yes.
When was the last time you spoke to him?
A few days ago.
- We let him go.
- You fired him.
Why?
We had given him a checkbook to cover expenses, bills, repairs and such.
Last week, we found he had been writing checks to himself.
I called him.
He denied it at first, but eventually he came clean.
I told him to keep the money and leave us his key.
- How did he take that?
- Not well.
He was very upset.
You think the caretaker planted the sarin?
Well, the man has a history of violence.
He served time for aggravated assault in several home invasion robberies.
Plus, he was just fired, which does give him motive.
It doesn't give him means.
And sarin's not exactly easy to find.
How does a local caretaker get it?
Right.
I'm still running background, but Chin and Kono are on their way to ask him that very question.
Okay, I gotta go.
Okay?
Just keep me posted.
Yeah, sure thing.
Hey, doc, how's he doing?
- Ready for some visitors.
- All right.
Gracie, let's go see Danno.
Looks like he's sleeping.
- Danno.
- Monkey.
Hey.
Ah.
- I made this for you.
- You did?
Look at this.
This is me.
This is you.
This is a masterpiece.
Look at that.
I mean, she's an artist, no?
It's beautiful.
I'm gonna make a nice space on the refrigerator, move some stuff around.
This is going dead center.
Thank you.
How are you feeling?
Uh, I don't know.
I feel like everything hurts.
My head feels like it's gonna explode.
Like the worst hangover I've ever had.
What's a hangover?
It's, uh...
You'll figure it out.
You'll learn about it one day when you're about, what, 35?
- Thirty-five, 30...
Sixteen.
- Forty years old.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, don't mention it.
Listen, since you're, uh, looking so good,
I'm gonna head back to the office, okay?
I'll swing by, pick her up later.
She can stay with me until Rachel gets back.
How's that sound?
- What do you think?
Okay.
You okay?
Yeah, I got everything I need right here.
I'm good.
Pound it out.
Huh?
Hmm?
Hey.
Kidnap Miley Cyrus and put her in your backpack
- or is there a cell phone?
- Stan bought it for me.
He did?
Fabulous.
Go answer it.
First boy that calls, I'm gonna whip that thing in the Pacific Ocean, okay?
- Hi, Mommy.
Yeah, I'm with Daddy.
- Don't tell her.
He's in the hospital.
Mommy wants to talk to you.
Hi, Rachel.
No, I'm fine.
Would you please stop?
I said I'm fine.
I like hospital food, you know that.
I checked in for the weekend.
I like it here.
There you go.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah?
This place, they make a kick-ass loco moco.
Yeah?
Too bad we won't be staying for lunch.
Gabriel Delgado.
Going out the front.
Five-0.
Stay down and don't move.
Look, I told you, my son, he's sick.
He's got leukemia.
First five years of his life, I'm locked up.
I finally get out of prison, I can't even pay his hospital bill.
What kind of father does that make me?
So is that why you stole from the Fallons?
I got another job driving the airport shuttle.
I was gonna put the money back in the account as soon as I got paid.
But they found out before you could, right?
And you knew if they reported the crime, it was back to prison for you.
That's why you tried to kill them.
What?
Did you buy groceries for the Fallons last week?
I did.
Well, we found sarin inside a milk carton that you put in the fridge.
Why don't you tell us about that?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I don't even know what sarin is.
Really?
Let me show you.
This is sarin.
And that's what sarin does to you.
Oh, my God.
Amoka.
- What, you knew him?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I take my boy to Blessed People's Mission.
They have a free clinic once a week.
Amoka sometimes sleeps at their shelter.
Kind man.
Even with all his own problems, he would always ask about my son.
I knew he was having a hard time there, so I told him about the rock.
What rock?
So the Fallons hid a spare key at their property.
We found it in the backyard, and Gabriel admitted to telling Amoka about it.
Said he stayed there for a few nights when shelter got overcrowded.
- And we believe him?
- I spoke to the mission.
Checks out.
Apparently, Amoka stayed at the shelter off and on for two months.
The same dates as Gabriel's son was getting treatment.
If Gabriel planted sarin in the milk, last thing he's gonna wanna do is let a hungry, homeless guy come and stay at the house before targets return.
- So we just lost our only suspect.
- The good news is, we may have picked up a new one.
I pulled a fresh print off the spare key.
It belongs to Elliot Connor.
His fingerprints are on file with the SEC.
How does he know Jeff and Sheila Fallon?
Well, Jeff's brother-in-law, he's also an employee.
He's a COO of Jeff's company.
They do big business, manufacturing industrial storage equipment.
Check this out.
According to International Business News, there have been rumors about friction between Jeff and Elliot.
Some of their board meetings have gotten contentious.
- Sounds like motive.
- You go talk to Jeff, see what he's got to say about it.
You and I will go see Elliot.
Look, I already gave you my statement.
Well, if you wanna bring me in again, you know where to find me.
I may as well tell you because you're gonna find out.
I returned the money to IA.
It's the only way to keep Uncle Keako out of prison.
Where did you even come up with $200,000?
Got a loan from somebody.
Borrowed against the house.
This is crazy.
All IA has to do is run the serial numbers and they won't match the ones that were stolen.
They can't do that.
Inventory logs for the asset forfeiture locker went missing years ago.
- How do you know that?
- Everybody in the department knows.
- The worst-kept secret on the island.
- I never heard about it.
That's because you never walked the beat.
Somewhere right now, there are two cops telling this story over coffee and malasadas.
Coz, you've been carrying this for a long time.
You took the blame for a crime you didn't commit.
And you lost your job, friends, and your family.
Now you have a chance to get out from under all of it.
And what?
You're gonna throw it all away, put yourself into debt and go to prison?
Here you go.
Uh, excuse me.
We'd like to see Elliot Connor.
Sorry, he's in a meeting now.
See if you can free him up for us.
Rumors of a rift between me and Jeff are nonsense.
Have there been disagreements?
Of course.
But that's normal when you're managing a business with someone.
Well, just out of curiosity, Mr. Connor, what were your disagreements about?
Jeff relocated me to Hawaii to run the Pacific base of operations.
The company's planning a big push into Asia.
We had some differences of opinion on marketing strategy.
That's it.
The advantages of working with my brother-in-law is that we can slug it out at the office, but at the end of the day, it's family first.
Work always comes second.
It sounds like you're close.
That's nice.
So, uh, tell me something.
Jeff and Sheila, do they ever have you come by the house, check on the property?
No.
They have a caretaker who stays there when they're away.
Right.
Why did we find your fingerprint on the spare key that was hidden outside the house?
You know, I did use that key once to drop off some papers.
The, uh, Q4 financial report.
I wanted Jeff to review it as soon as he arrived.
- Please don't lie to us.
- I'm not.
You shifted in your chair and touched your face as you were answering the question.
Those are both signs of deception.
Plus, you added unnecessary details about delivering the papers just to make your lie sound more credible.
Does Jeff know that you're using his house to cheat on his sister?
What?
That's absurd.
Mock outrage.
That's a bad one.
That tan line on your finger there.
Forget to put your wedding band back on after your last hookup?
Look, here's what I think's going on, okay?
Either you've been using Jeff's house to carry on an affair, and that's why we found your print on the key.
Or you were in the house trying to kill your partner.
Which is it?
We haven't used the house in months.
Not since Jeff confronted me about it.
That's the real reason things have been tense here at work.
It has nothing to do with business.
Well, with all due respect, Elliot, you're using his house to cheat on his sister.
I can hardly blame him for being upset.
I know it's terrible.
Jeff asked me to break it off with Chloe and I'm going to.
Just haven't gotten around to it yet?
We're gonna need to talk to Chloe, okay?
- To corroborate this.
- Go ahead.
She's right outside.
The secretary?
That's original.
Can I ask you a question?
So, what do you need a slingshot for?
It doesn't make any sense to me.
I mean, they're birds.
Can't they fly?
These birds don't have wings.
Oh, that explains it.
Now I know why they're so angry.
Thank you for clarifying.
Howzit, Jersey?
Hey, big dog.
What's going on?
Grace, you remember Kamekona?
- Hi.
- What up, shorty?
I figured you guys need some grub by now.
Hospital foods are the worst.
And the portions, very small.
That's very sweet of you.
Fried chicken?
Filipino style.
Best on the island, brah.
You know, Gracie, when I was a little keiki like you, my mama used to bring me this chicken every time I was sick.
Fried chicken isn't good for you.
It has cholesterol and causes heart disease.
A little bit of grease is good for you.
Helps the insides stay lubricated.
Drumstick or thigh?
Um, I'm gonna go, uh...
I like white meat.
Is there a breast?
Sorry, all gone.
That was a long drive, brah.
I know.
I know.
I didn't call you here for the chicken.
Gracie, put your headphones on, please.
So our boy, Sang Min, has resurfaced.
I heard he bounced a few months ago.
He's back?
In a big way.
Looks like he took a swing at heavy hitters and he missed.
My guess is he's looking for a way off the island.
So I need you to get on the coconut wireless, make a couple calls.
You found him for us once, you can do it again, right?
Sure.
Let me use your phone.
What's wrong with your phone?
I don't bring them to the hospitals no more, brah.
You heard about the signals interfering with the pacemakers?
It's true.
Okay, you can use my phone.
Will you wipe your greasy paws off before you touch my phone, though?
- Grease.
- Yeah, they're ugly.
That's...
That's sufficient.
Hey.
You got something?
Yeah, I got a call from your CIA contact.
They found a chemical match to our sarin.
Turns out it's the same strand used by a Chechen terror group in a botched Moscow attack five years ago.
And the Russian FSB identified the supplier as Mikhail Yursky.
And get this, Mr. Yursky arrived in Hawaii five days ago under fake passport.
Timeline matches the murder.
Then that's our killer.
Now all we have to do is find him.
Clear.
Back is clear.
Hey, Mikhail's not here.
- What do you got?
- Found a credit card under the same name as his fake passport.
He purchased a flight to Borneo, leaves tonight at 7:00.
All right, notify the TSA, let the Sheriff's Department cover the flight, and we'll leave a unit at the hotel in case he comes back.
Whoa.
Hey, I just got a fresh hit.
His card's being used at an ATM right now.
Central Pacific Bank on Alakawa.
Couple of blocks away.
We're on the way.
Okay, I'll see if I can stall him for you.
You might wanna try checking the magnetic strip.
Maybe clean it.
Oh, you're good.
Oh, not good, not good.
- Steve, he's on the move.
- Got him.
Right there.
Got it.
Please be advised.
Suspect is in a maroon sedan traveling north on Alakawa.
Hey!
Stay back.
The canister has a leak.
- He's been exposed.
- I'll call an ambulance.
- Get H.P.D. and HAZMAT as well.
- Go, go.
Yeah, this is Kelly, Five-0.
Yeah, we're in an alleyway behind the 1500 block of Alakawa.
Chin.
- He's done.
He's dead.
- Uh, check the ambulance.
Yeah, send the ME and the HAZMAT team instead.
Yeah, all right.
Hey.
What the hell?
- Are we ready for that extra credit?
- Extra credit.
You're telling me that this guy is not from around here?
No, Dad.
Spongebob lives in a pineapple under the sea.
Well, what else could be more Hawaiian than that, huh?
Mommy.
Daddy's not sick anymore.
I am so happy to see that.
Hey.
You didn't have to come here.
Yes, I did.
Thank you.
Get another one.
All right, well, once his team's safe, have H.P.D. process the car for evidence.
HAZMAT team just finished checking the canisters in Mikhail's trunk.
Empty with no signs of toxins.
He was about to leave the island with them.
I guess he was gonna use the canisters to traffic the sarin.
What's still not adding up though is why a bioweapons dealer with terrorist ties would target two innocent people from the mainland.
What's going on?
Commander McGarrett, David Akahoshi, Internal Affairs.
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?
I came to return something to Mr. Kelly.
The serial numbers on these bills don't match the stolen money, which means you're trying to cover for your uncle.
Those inventory logs disappeared years ago, so those serial numbers don't exist.
Actually, they do.
After the forfeiture locker was robbed,
IA kept waiting for you to slip up and spend the money somewhere.
We figured that you were being careful.
So we had the asset forfeiture division put the word out that their inventory records had been lost.
It was all a lie.
If you thought we couldn't trace the serial numbers, maybe you would finally start spending the money.
But that never happened, because you never stole it.
Chin, this has gone too far.
You got your money back.
- Let this go.
- I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
I know you were just trying to protect your family, which is why I am not gonna charge you with obstruction of justice.
I'm not even gonna ask where you got that money, but your uncle stole from the Honolulu Police Department, which means he stole from the people of Hawaii.
And he's gonna have to answer for that.
I, myself, am gonna ask where you got this money.
Markham.
The bookie?
I signed the deed to my house over to him.
Return it.
Get your deed back.
- Steve, I didn't have a choice.
- Listen to me, all right?
You did this for your uncle.
You don't have to explain anything else to me.
Uh...
You guys need to see this.
So any respectable chemist can synthesize sarin.
The trick is not killing yourself in the process.
In addition to having a short half life, sarin is also extremely volatile, making storage a challenge.
The ideal container is electropolished aluminum, double-walled with failsafe coupling valve, but those can be difficult to procure.
Right, because the FBI monitors large sales of these things to make sure that they're not used to traffic chemical weapons, right?
Exactly.
Which is why it's so impressive that we found 36 of these canisters in Mikhail's trunk.
Check out who the manufacturer is.
Fallon Global.
That's Jeff and Elliot's company.
So Mikhail ends up getting his canisters from them, and his sarin ends up at Jeff's house.
That's not all.
I pulled Mikhail's phone records.
Guess who he called the day he landed?
Mr. Connor.
You got a minute?
I've never seen this man before in my life.
That's funny, because he called here the other day, three times.
- I didn't speak with him.
- Oh, yeah?
Phone records show calls came into your direct line.
You spoke for a total of 12 minutes.
We might know what you were talking about.
See, Mikhail, he wanted equipment that your company produces so he could store his sarin.
You wanted your brother-in-law out so you could run the company.
What's it called?
- Quid pro quo?
- No, I was thinking of something else.
Oh, yeah.
Conspiracy to solicit murder.
These calls, when did they happen?
Thursday, the 13th.
I was on the big island last week.
I didn't get back until Saturday.
- You can check with the hotel.
- Then who took the calls?
Only person who takes my calls is my secretary.
She's gone.
Suspect's name is Chloe Ballantine.
I need you to lock down the entire building right away.
Right now.
Steve!
Put your hands on the wheel.
Put your hands on the wheel.
Elliot wanted to be with me.
We were happy together.
But Jeff and Sheila ordered him to end the affair, and you couldn't accept that, could you?
How'd a local girl like you get mixed up with a terrorist like Mikhail anyway?
Take a look at this.
Hey.
Look at the photo.
Look at the photo.
His name was Amoka.
He had a daughter and he had grandchildren.
And now he's dead because of you.
Mikhail contacted our office looking to purchase a certain product we make.
But legal did a background check and they refused the purchase order.
So a couple days later, Mikhail calls the office, offers me $20,000.
All I had to do was fake some invoices.
But instead of taking the money, you asked him to commit murder.
No.
I took the cash too.
My, oh, my.
Aren't you the opportunistic one?
Let me ask you something, though.
Why sarin?
There are plenty of easier ways to kill people.
That's why.
That's why, isn't it?
It's big and it's bold.
You thought the cops would think it was a terrorist attack, and they'd be so busy dealing with mass panic that they'd never think of murder.
It's pretty well calculated, I gotta say.
You know what else?
I don't think you ever loved Elliot.
Not at all.
He was a payday for you.
In your twisted logic,
Jeff and Sheila were the only things stopping you from cashing in on that.
And with them out of the way,
Elliot could take control of the company, right?
The two of you could be free to carry on your relationship.
He was gonna divorce his wife and marry me.
But what good was that without money?
Well, you know what?
Now you got nothing.
Which is a real shame, because, uh, you could do with that money right now to pay for a lawyer.
You got another envelope?
Yeah.
I found this medal inside.
It's called the Order of the Rising Sun.
It was awarded to a Japanese pilot who bombed Pearl Harbor.
How did it end up in your father's toolbox?
I don't know.
My grandfather served at Pearl.
He died on the Arizona.
Maybe the same person who mailed my dad the postcards from Osaka
- mailed it to him.
- Why is it being returned to you now?
Everything that you've received has had something to do with Wo Fat.
What is his connection to this medal?
I'll know when I find him.
No, that's it.
The real one.
Would you go to the beach with us?
I'd love nothing more than go to the beach with you.
But I'm kind of low on sick days, so I gotta get to work.
We'll hang out later, okay?
All right?
Come here.
Hey, thanks for taking care of me in the hospital today, okay?
- I love you.
- Love you too.
All right.
My lady.
In a way, I'm glad that this happened.
Oh, you are?
You're glad that, uh, I got poisoned and almost died.
Okay, not glad exactly, but grateful, because the truth is, I was looking for any excuse to come home.
I thought you liked Maui, but I'm glad I could help.
Stan only booked this trip to see if we could save our marriage.
I don't know that there's anything left to save.
That's good.
- You should get to work.
- Yeah.
- We'll talk later?
- I look forward to it, yes.
Hey, I'm gone ten minutes, and everybody's just standing around doing nothing, huh?
- Can't keep a good man down, huh?
I'm sorry.
Do we know you?
- Look at you.
- Ha, ha, welcome back, brother.
Thank you.
Yeah, yeah.
So a couple people told me, uh, I owe you a thank you.
- A hug will do.
- A hug will do?
- Okay, I'll take that.
Thank you.
Ha, ha.
Sidebar.
What's up?
You and Rachel?
How long has that been going on?
Uh, a little while.
- Were you ever gonna tell me, or?
- Was I ever...?
Ha, ha.
You know, uh, we have become very close.
Did you say gotten...
We've gotten very close?
- Yeah, yeah.
- One near-death experience and you go warm and cuddly on me?
- Come on.
Come on.
- You wanna hug me now?
- Good to have you back, bud.
McGarrett?
Put your hands in the air.
Get on your knees, right now.
- How did you get in here?
- I need your help.
He's clean.
- Told you I'm not gonna cut any deals.
You don't understand.
I'll plead to any charge.
Take the maximum sentence, as long as you place me under protective custody.
Oh, yeah, what happened?
Wo Fat.
I tried to make things right with him.
What did he say?
He told me he's not gonna rest until I'm dead.
And that when I am, he's gonna come for you next.
STEVE:
Hey, guys, come in here.
Come on here, listen up.
Our target's name is Wo Fat.
Thermal imaging shows one heat signature in the safe house, so we know he's alone.
Do not let that fool you.
This guy is a major arms dealer, with known terrorist affiliations and over a dozen kills to his name.
He's more than likely carrying a weapon, and he's most definitely dangerous.
So stay focused.
Be aware of your surroundings at all times, all right?
Let's go.
Gearing up, huh?
Yeah.
Good for you.
You forgot one thing, though.
KAYE:
What are you doing?
What are you doing with those?
!
You're not a field agent, okay?
You're an analyst.
Are you kidding me?
It is my intel that got us here.
I cannot believe you're going to freeze me out now.
Look, I understand how much this means to you.
But you're not going to get hurt on my watch, okay?
Let's go, guys!
Let's go, move out.
(two beeps)
DANNY:
Steve, you all right?
!
(gunfire)
Break contact!
(over radio):
Barricade!
Gunshots fired!
Copy that.
Entry team, fall back!
KONO:
Boss, he's on the move!
I'm going in!
Stay here.
Surround the perimeter.
KONO (over radio):
I'm have him heading toward the back of the house.
(siren wailing)
KONO:
Boss, he's moving upstairs!
(creaking)
I got eyes on the target, but it's not Wo Fat.
It's Sang Min.
Please repeat.
I say again:
Sang Min.
Wo Fat wasn't in the house.
(car engine revs)
(tires screech)
DANNY:
Kaye, get down!
You all right?
Stay here.
Please.
Okay?
Hi, I got him.
He just went into a house three doors down from the safe house.
(tires screech)
STEVE:
All right... he's in a white Cadillac sedan.
Plate number:
Charlie-Tango 832 Romeo.
Call it in, Kono.
Every agency.
Listen to me...
Sang Min knows that we're onto him.
He's going to try to flee the Island.
Yeah.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't there a car attached to you?
Oh, weird.
(cell phone beeps) All right, APB is out.
Okay, who is Sang Min?
Fugitive, human trafficker, all-around scumbag.
He's also a known associate of Victor Hesse, which puts him in the same circles as Wo Fat.
Okay, so he could've been holing up at Wo Fat's safe house.
Or he was taking a shot at him.
The front door was rigged with the explosive charge, right?
I think Sang Min was expecting
Wo Fat to be walking through that door.
Why-why would he try to kill him?
I think it was a preemptive strike.
Sang Min knows that Wo Fat doesn't like loose ends.
Which is exactly what he became once he escaped from prison.
(coughing) Danny!
(hacking cough) Danny!
Danny!
Danny, you hit?
No.
But something's not right.
I can't breathe.
(wheezes) Guys, his pulse is slow.
Okay, I'm going to call an ambulance.
My chest, I don't know.
I can't breathe.
All right, we got help on the way, okay?
Just tell me what happened?
(wheezes) Uh, there's a body.
No pulse.
KONO:
This is Officer Kalakaua.
I need an ambulance at Stay with him.
1408 Palolo Avenue.
(wheezing)
Stop!
Stop right there!
What is it?
I don't know.
But whatever he died from, it might be biological.
You have to get Danny to a hospital right now.
KONO:
Steve!
CHIN:
Hang in there, hang in there.
He's starting to convulse!
STEVE:
Danny!
Danny!
Hey, stay with me, Danny!
Stay with me!

(doors crash)
BP's 72 over 40.
Breathing slow and shallow.
How long since his last exposure?
Uh, 20, 30 minutes.
DOCTOR:
Do we know what kind of toxin we're dealing with?
STEVE:
I don't know.
My team's still working on it.
DOCTOR:
You better hurry, because I don't know how much time he has.
(laborious breathing)
(detector clicking slowly)
(rapid clicking)
(indistinct police radio communication)
I need to get McGarrett on the phone.
All right, so... what are we looking at here?
Victim inside died from exposure to a chemical weapon;
a nerve agent, to be exact.
How can you be sure?
I spent two years with the CIA's Biological Threat Assessment Team.
One of our case studies was the subway attack in '95...
Right, right, right.
Terrorists released sarin on multiple trains.
Whole subway system was affected.
And our victim inside has the same symptoms:
Facial ulcerations, petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes, constricted pupils--
Everything is localized around the head, which makes me believe that he ingested the toxin orally.
So someone spiked the milk that our victim drank.
Sarin is also transdermal, which means that Danny was exposed when he touched the victim to check for a pulse.
(phone line ringing)
(phone rings) McGarrett.
Hey, it's Kaye.
Listen to me.
Danny has been exposed to sarin.
You need to tell the doctors to get him on Pralidoxime right away.
If they don't...
he's going to die.
Thanks, Doc.
Hey, how's Danny?
He's, uh, he's okay.
He's responding to the drugs.
I mean, it's still early, but, uh, they all seem to think he's going to pull through, so...
All right.
Thank God.
Yeah.
You were right about the sarin.
If they didn't found out when they did,
Danny would probably be dead right now.
Does he have a family?
Yeah, he's got an ex-wife and a little girl.
Danny said something about having Grace this weekend.
Ah, Rachel and Stan are in Maui.
Hey, can we see him?
Not right now.
The doctor said once he's stable they're going to move him to a recovery ward where he can have some visitors.
Look, guys, I know this is hard, and we all want to be here.
But, right now, we need to I.D. this vic, and we need to find out where he bought that milk.
Right.
Do you think this could be an act of terrorism?
Or a random act of mayhem, like the Tylenol scare in the '80s.
Either way, we need to make sure there's no further risk, okay.
So, you two, I need you to contact the milk distributor, find out where they sell their product, and pull everything off the shelves.
I don't care if we're even taking resources away from finding Sang Min.
Right now, this is our number one priority.
We're on it.
Kaye, can you coordinate with CDC?
Gotta make sure nothing else is contaminated.
Yeah, of course.
I can also send a sample to a contact at Langley.
He can run chemical analysis, maybe determine the source of the sarin.
Hey...
Thanks, Jenna.
Oh, please.
You're in crisis mode, you're down a man, I'm more than happy to pitch in.
Besides, I don't even really know if there's a job waiting for me back home.
Took three months leave of absence to hunt down the man who killed my fiancé, and the last time
I checked the CIA wasn't... super-keen on the whole, you know, personal vendetta thing.
So if you think that I can help you with your investigation...
Kaye.
Kaye.
Kaye!
Kaye!
Yeah.
Well, what I meant to say was
"Thank you for helping Danny." Okay?
You saved his life.
You're welcome.
Call me if you get something.
Okay.
Where are you going?
Uh...
I got a little something to take care of.
(school bell rings, children shouting, talking)
(cell phone rings, beeps) McGarrett.
SANG MIN (over phone):
You should have seen your face.
Bet I was the last person you expected to see, huh?
Have to say I was pretty surprised myself.
I'm guessing that bomb on the door was intended for Wo Fat.
Doesn't matter now, does it?
We both missed our shot.
But I might be able to give you a second chance.
What's it worth if I help you find him?
What's it worth?
Not much, okay?
Considering you've already burned us once.
Well, the situation has changed.
All right, you want to make a deal?
Great.
Here's what I'm prepared to offer you.
Hey, Gracie!
Uncle Steve!
Hey.
Hi, kiddo.
Where's Daddy?
Listen, Gracie,
Danno's, uh, Danno's not feeling the best, okay?
So I'm going to take you to the hospital.
We're going to go see him.
Is he going to be okay?
Is he going to be okay?
Let me tell you something about your father.
He might not talk like it, but he is one tough guy, and he's brave, as well.
Can you be brave like Danno?
Are you sure?
Then we should go see him.
What are you waiting for?
Come on.
KAYE:
Pae'aina Dairy products sell at over a hundred locations on the Island.
We pulled all of their milk cartons off the shelves.
CDC is doing some random testing, but so far none of the samples have turned up positive for sarin, except for the one that our victim drank from.
So it's looking like an isolated incident.
Now the question is, was it random or was our victim targeted?
Sarin seems like an odd choice for a murder weapon.
It's actually not as far-fetched as you might think.
Used to be that sarin was hard to get, but ever since 9/11 we've taken down so many terror cells that sarin brokers are looking for new customers.
Basically, anyone with cash and connections to the black market can get their hands on it.
CHIN:
Hey, got an I.D. on our vic.
Guy's name is Amoka Mulitalo, 57 years old.
Was arrested six months ago for misdemeanor trespassing.
Which is interesting, considering the house we found him in wasn't his own.
Well, whose house is it?
Jeff and Sheila Fallon.
Pay taxes in California, but keep this home as a vacation rental.
KAYE:
So, what's Amoka doing in their house drinking tainted milk?
WOMAN:
My father was never the same after his auto accident.
He suffered from aphasia, impaired memory.
He just couldn't manage for himself.
So... we had him move in with us.
You filed a missing persons report for your father a few weeks ago.
That wasn't the first time, either, was it?
Sometimes... he'll go for a walk, forget how to get home.
If I couldn't find him,
I'll file a missing persons report.
Then, a few days later, the police will find him on the street or... at a shelter.
But this time...
MAN:
I'm sorry, but... we've never seen him before.
I don't understand.
How did this man end up dead in our house?
We believe he was squatting there, and when he was in your home, he drank some milk from the refrigerator.
That milk was laced with sarin-- it's a compound that's used as a chemical weapon.
It killed him within minutes.
What is it?
SHEILA:
We were supposed to come to Hawaii last week.
(sighs) I asked our caretaker, Gabriel, to stock the refrigerator.
But we ended up canceling the trip.
So Gabriel's the one who bought the milk?
Yes.
When was the last time you spoke to him?
A few days ago, when we let him go.
You fired him?
Why?
We had given him a checkbook to cover expenses.
Bills, repairs and such.
Last week, we found he had been writing checks to himself.
JEFF:
I called him.
He denied it at first, but... eventually, he came clean.
I told him to keep the money and leave us his key.
How did he take that?
Not well.
He was very upset.
You think the caretaker planted the sarin?
Well, the man has a history of violence.
He served time for aggravated assault in several home-invasion robberies, plus he was just fired, which does give him motive.
But it doesn't give him means, and sarin's not exactly easy to find.
I mean, how does a local caretaker get his hands on it?
Right.
I'm still running background.
But Chin and Kono are on their way to ask him that very question.
Okay, I got to go, okay?
Just keep me posted.
Yeah, sure thing.
Hey, Doc, how's he going?
Ready for some visitors.
All right.
Let's go, Gracie.
STEVE (whispering):
Looks like he's sleeping.
(Steve whispers gently)
Danno!
(weakly):
Monkey!
Mm!
Mm!
I made this for you.
You did?
Look at this.
This is me.
See, this is a masterpiece.
Look at that.
I mean, she's an artist, no?
It's beautiful.
So I'm gonna make a nice space on the refrigerator and move some stuff around.
This is going dead center.
Thank you.
How you feeling?
Uh...
I don't know, I feel like everything hurts.
Head feels like it's gonna explode.
It's, like, the worst hangover I ever had.
What's a hangover?
It's, uh, you'll figure it out, you'll learn about it one day when you're about, what, 35?
35, thirty... 60.
40 years old.
Thank you.
Don't mention it.
Listen, since you're, uh, since you're looking so... so good now,
I'm gonna head back to the office, okay?
I'll swing by and pick her up later.
She can stay with me until, uh, until Rachel gets back.
DANNY:
How does that sound?
What do you think?
Okay.
You okay?
I got everything I need right here.
I'm good.
Huh?
Huh?
(pop music playing) Hey.
You kidnap Miley Cyrus and put her in your backpack, or is that a cell phone?
Stan bought it for me.
He did?
Fabulous.
Go answer it.
First boy that calls, I'm gonna whip that thing into the Pacific Ocean, okay?
Hi, Mommy.
Yeah, I'm with Daddy.
He's in the hospital.
Mommy wants to talk to you.
Hi, Rachel.
(clears throat) No, I'm fine.
(laughs) Would you please stop?
I said I'm fine.
I like hospital food;
you know that.
I checked in for the weekend;
I like it here, it's nice.
KONO:
Oh, yeah.
This place, they make a kick-ass loco moco.
Yeah?
Too bad we won't be staying for lunch.
CHIN:
Gabriel Delgado?
KONO:
I'm going out the front!
Five-O!
Stay down and don't move.
DELGADO:
Look, I told you, my son... he's sick.
He's got leukemia.
First five years of his life, I'm locked up.
I finally get out of prison,
I can't even pay his hospital bill.
What kind of father does that make me?
So is that why you stole from the Fallons?
I got another job driving the airport shuttle.
I was gonna put the money back in their account as soon as
I got paid.
But they found out before you could, right?
And you knew if they reported the crime, it was back to prison for you.
That's why you tried to kill them.
What?
Did you buy groceries for the Fallons last week?
I did.
KONO:
Well, we found sarin inside a milk carton that you put in their fridge.
Why don't you tell us about that?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I don't even know what... sarin is.
Oh, really?
Let me show you.
This is sarin.
And that's what sarin does to you.
Oh, my God.
Amoka.
What, you know him?
Yeah.
Yeah, I-I take my boy to Blessed People's Mission.
They have a free clinic once a week.
Amoka sometimes sleeps at their shelter.
Kind man.
Even with all his own problems, he would always ask about my son.
I knew he was having a hard time there, so I told him about the rock.
What rock?
(rattles)
CHIN:
So, the Fallons hid a spare key at their property.
We found it in the backyard, and Gabriel admitted to telling Amoka about it.
Said that he stayed there for a few nights when the shelter got overcrowded.
And we believe him?
I spoke to the mission;
story checks out.
Apparently, Amoka stayed at the shelter off and on for two months.
Same dates as Gabriel's son was getting treatment.
If Gabriel planted sarin in the milk, the last thing he's gonna want to do is let a hungry homeless guy come and stay at the house before the targets return.
So we just lost our only suspect.
The good news is we may have picked up a new one.
I pulled a fresh print off the spare key.
It belongs to Elliot Connor-- his fingerprints are on file with the SEC.
How does he know Jeff and Sheila Fallon?
Well, in addition to being Jeff's brother-in-law, he's also an employee.
He's the COO of Jeff's company.
They do big business manufacturing industrial storage equipment.
Check this out.
According to International Business News, there have been rumors about friction between
Jeff and Elliot.
Apparently some of the board meetings have gotten contentious.
Sounds like motive.
You guys go talk to Jeff, see what he's got to say about it, and I'll go see Elliot.
CHIN:
Look, I already gave you my statement.
Well, if you want to bring me in again, you know where to find me.
I may as well tell you, 'cause you're gonna find out.
I returned the money to I.A.
It was the only way to keep Uncle Keako out of prison.
Where did you even come up with $200,000?
Got a loan from somebody.
Borrowed against the house.
(whispers):
This is crazy.
All I.A. has to do is run the serial numbers, and they'll know they won't match the ones that were stolen.
Actually, they can't do that.
Inventory logs for the Asset Forfeiture Locker when missing years ago.
How do you know that?
Everybody in the department knows it.
It's the worst-kept secret on the island.
I never heard about it.
That's 'cause you never walked a beat.
Somewhere, right now, there are two cops telling this story over coffee and malasadas.
Cuz... you've been carrying this for a long time.
You took the blame for a crime you didn't commit, and you lost your job... your friends... and your family.
And now you have a chance to get out from under all this.
And what?
You're gonna throw it all away, put yourself into debt, and go to prison?
(elevator bell dings)
Excuse me.
We'd like to see Elliot Connor.
Sorry, he's in a meeting now.
See if you can free him up for us.
Rumors of a rift between me and Jeff are nonsense.
Have there been disagreements?
Of course, but that's normal when you're managing a business with someone.
KAYE:
Well, just out of curiosity,
Mr. Connor, what were your disagreements about?
Jeff relocated me to Hawaii to run the Pacific base of operations.
The company's planning a big push into Asia.
We had some differences of opinion on marketing strategy.
That's it.
One of the advantages of working with my brother-in-law is that we can slug it out at the office, but at the end of the day, it's family first.
Work always comes second.
Sounds like you're close.
That's nice.
So, uh, tell me something.
Jeff and Sheila-- do they ever have you come by the house, check on the property?
No, they have a caretaker who stays there when they're away.
All right, then, why did we find your fingerprint on the spare key that was hidden outside the house?
(chuckles)
You know, I did use that key once to drop off some papers-- the Q4 financial report.
I wanted Jeff to review it as soon as he arrived.
Please don't lie to us.
I'm not.
You shifted in your chair and you touched your face as you were answering the question.
Those are both signs of deception.
Plus, you added unnecessary details about delivering the papers just to make your lie sound more credible.
STEVE:
Does Jeff know that you're using his house to cheat on his sister?
What?
That's absurd.
KAYE:
Wow, mock outrage-- that's a bad one.
Tan line on your finger there.
Forget to put your wedding band back on after your last hookup?
Look, here's what I think's going on, okay?
Either you've been using Jeff's house to carry on an affair and that's why we found your print on the key, or you were in the house trying to kill your partner.
Which is it?
We haven't used the house in months not since Jeff confronted me about it, and that's the real reason things have been tense here at work.
It has nothing to do with business.
KAYE:
Well, with all due respect,
Elliott, you were using his house to cheat on his sister.
I can hardly blame him for being upset.
I know it's terrible.
Jeff asked me to break it off with Chloe, and I'm going to.
Just haven't gotten around to it yet?
STEVE:
We're going to need to talk to Chloe, okay, to corroborate this.
Go ahead.
She's right outside.
The secretary?
That's original.
Can I ask you a question?
So, what do you need a slingshot for?
Doesn't make any sense to me.
I mean, they're birds.
Can't they fly?
These birds don't have wings.
Oh, that explains it.
Now I know why they're so angry.
Thank you for clarifying.
Howzit, Jersey?
Hey, big dog, what's going on?
Grace, you remember Kamekona.
Hi.
What up, shorty?
Figured you guys need some grub.
I know hospital foods are the worst and the portions-- very small.
DANNY:
That's very sweet of you.
Fried chicken?
Filipino-style.
Best on the island, brah.
You know, Gracie, when I was a little keiki like you, my mama used to bring me this chicken every time I was sick.
Fried chicken isn't good for you.
It has cholesterol and causes heart disease.
Nah, a little bit of grease is good for you.
Helps the insides stay lubricated.
Drumstick or thigh?
Um, I'm gonna go-- I like white meat.
Is there a breast?
Sorry, all gone.
That was a long drive, brah.
I know, I know.
Well, I didn't call you here for the chicken.
Gracie, put your headphones on, please.
So... your boy Sang Min has resurfaced.
Heard he bounced a few months ago.
He's back?
In a big way.
Looks like he took a swing at some heavy hitters and he missed.
My guess is he's looking for a way off the Island, so I need you to get on the coconut wireless, make a couple calls.
You found him for us once, you can do it again, right?
(sighs)
Sure, let me use your phone.
What's wrong with your phone?
I don't bring 'em to the hospitals no more, brah.
You heard about the signals interfering with the pacemakers?
It's true.
Okay, you can use my phone.
Will you wipe your greasy paws off before you touch my phone, though?
What grease?
Yeah, they look like...
That's sufficient.
STEVE:
Hey.
You got something?
Yeah, I got a call from your CIA contact.
They found a chemical match to our sarin.
Turns out it's the same strand used by a Chechen terror group in a botched Moscow attack five years ago, and the Russian FSB identified the supplier as Mikhail Yursky, and get this--
Mr. Yursky arrived in Hawaii five days ago under a fake passport.
Time line matches the murder.
Then that's our killer.
Now all we have to do is find him.
Police!
Police!
Go, go, go!
Clear.
You're all secure.
(phone auto-dialing)
Hey, Mikhail's not here.
What do you got?
We found a credit card under the same name as his fake passport.
He just purchased a flight to Borneo.
Leaves tonight at 7:00.
All right, notify the TSA.
We'll have the sheriff's department cover the flight and we'll leave a unit here at the hotel in case he comes back.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, I just got a fresh hit.
His card's being used at an ATM right now-- Central Pacific Bank on Alakawa.
That's a couple blocks away.
We're on the way.
Okay, I'll see if I can stall him for you.
Now you might want to try checking the magnetic strip.
Maybe clean it.
Oh, you're good.
Perfect.
(car horn honks)
Not good, not good.
Steve, he's on the move.
CHIN:
Got him-- right there.
Got him.
(siren wailing)
(tires screeching)
(horn honks)
(tires screeching)
CHIN:
All units, be advised.
Suspect is in a maroon sedan traveling north on Alakawa.
(siren wailing)
(tires screeching)
(tires screeching)
(siren wailing)
Hey!
(grunting)
(gasping)
Stand back, the canister has a leak.
He's been exposed.
I'll call for an ambulance, get HPD Hazmat as well.
Go, go.
Yeah, we're at an alleyway behind the 1500 block of Alakawa.
Chin, he's done, he's dead.
Uh, chuck the ambulance.
Send the M.E. and the Hazmat team.
Okay, all right.
Hey.
What the hell?
Are we ready for that extra credit?
Extra credit?
You're telling me that this guy is not from around here?
No, Dad, SpongeBob lives in a pineapple under the sea.
Well, what else could be more Hawaiian than that?
Huh?
Mommy.
Daddy's not sick anymore.
I am so happy to see that.
Hey.
(sighs)
You didn't have to come.
Yes, I did.
CHIN:
All right, well, once it's deemed safe, have HPD process the car for evidence.
Hazmat team just finished checking the canisters in Mikhail's trunk-- empty with no signs of toxins.
Well, he was about to leave the island with them.
I'm guessing he was going to use the canisters to traffic the sarin.
Yeah, what's still not adding up, though, is why a bioweapons dealer with terrorist ties would target two innocent people from the mainland.
What's going on?
Commander McGarrett.
David Akahoshi, Internal Affairs.
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?
I came to return something to Mr. Kelly.
The serial numbers on these bills don't match the stolen money, which means you're trying to cover for your uncle.
Those inventory logs disappeared years ago, so those serial numbers don't exist.
Actually, they do.
After the forfeiture locker was robbed,
I.A. kept waiting for you to slip up and spend the money somewhere.
We figured that you were being careful, so we had the asset forfeiture division put the word out that their inventory records had been lost.
It was all a lie.
If you thought we couldn't trace the serial numbers, maybe you would finally start spending the money, but that never happened because you never stole it.
KONO:
Chin, this has gone too far.
You got your money back.
Let this go.
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
I know you were just trying to protect your family, which is why I am not going to charge you with obstruction of justice.
I'm not even going to ask where you got that money, but your uncle stole from the Honolulu Police Department, which means he stole from the people of Hawaii, and he's going to have to answer for that.
I myself am going to ask where you got this money.
Marcum.
The bookie?
I signed the deed to my house over to him.
Return it.
Get your deed back.
Steve...
I didn't have a choice.
Listen to me, all right?
If you did this for your uncle, you don't have to explain anything else to me.
Uh...
You guys need to see this.
KAYE:
So, any respectable chemist can synthesize sarin;
the trick is not killing yourself in the process.
Because in addition to having a short half-life, sarin's also extremely volatile, making storage a challenge.
The ideal container is electro-polished aluminum, double-walled with a fail-safe coupling valve-- but those can be difficult to procure.
That's right, because the FBI monitors large sales of these things to make sure that they're not being used to traffic chemical weapons.
Exactly.
Which is why it's so impressive that we found 36 of these canisters in Mikhail's trunk.
Check out who the manufacturer is.
Fallon Global?
That's Jeff and Elliot's company.
So Mikhail ends up getting his canisters from them, and his sarin ends up at Jeff's house.
That's not all-
- I pulled Mikhail's phone records.
Guess who he called the day he landed?
Mr. Connor.
Have you got a minute?
I've never seen this man before in my life.
That's funny, 'cause he called here the other day.
Three times.
I didn't speak with him.
Oh, yeah?
Phone records show the calls came into your direct line, and you spoke for a total of 12 minutes.
STEVE:
We think we might know what you were talking about, too.
You see, Mikhail, he wanted equipment that your company produces so he could store his sarin.
You wanted your brother- in-law out of the picture so you could run the company.
What's it called?
Quid pro quo?
No.
I was thinking of something else.
Oh, yeah.
Conspiracy to solicit murder.
These calls, when did they happen?
Thursday, the 13th.
(sighs) I was on the Big Island last week.
I didn't get back until Saturday.
You can check with the hotel.
Well, then who took the calls?
Only person who answers my calls is my secretary.
She's gone.
Suspect's name is Chloe Ballantine.
I need you to lock down the entire building right away.
CHIN:
Right now.
Steve!
Put your hands on the wheel.
Put your hands on the wheel.
BALLANTINE:
Elliot wanted to be with me.
We were happy together.
But Jeff and Sheila ordered him to end the affair, and you couldn't accept that, could you?
STEVE:
How'd a local girl like you get mixed up with a terrorist like Mikhail, anyway?
Take a look at this.
Hey.
Look at the photo.
Look at the photo.
His name was Amoka.
He had a daughter, and he had grandchildren.
And now he's dead because of you.
(sighs) Mikhail contacted our office looking to purchase a certain product we make.
But Legal did a background check, and they refused the purchase order.
So a couple days later, Mikhail calls the office, offers me $20,000.
All I had to do was fake some invoices.
But instead of taking the money, you asked him to commit murder.
No.
I took the cash, too.
My, oh, my, aren't you the opportunistic one.
Let me ask you something, though.
Why sarin?
There are plenty of easier ways to kill people.
That's why.
That's why, isn't it?
Because it's big and it's bold.
And you thought the cops would think it was a terrorist attack, and they'd be so busy dealing with mass panic that they'd never think of murder.
It's pretty well calculated,
I got to say.
You know what else?
I don't think you ever loved Elliot.
Not at all.
He was a payday for you.
In your twisted logic,
Jeff and Sheila were the only thing stopping you from cashing in.
And with them out of the way,
Elliot could take control of the company, right?
And the two of you could be free to carry on your relationship.
He was gonna divorce his wife and marry me.
But what good was that without money?
Well, you know what?
Now you got nothing.
Which is a real shame, because, uh... you could do with that money right now to pay for a lawyer.

You got another envelope?
Yeah.
Found this medal inside.
It's called the Order of the Rising Sun.
It was awarded to a Japanese pilot who bombed Pearl Harbor.
How did it end up in your father's toolbox?
(sighs) I don't know.
My grandfather served at Pearl, and he died on the Arizona.
Maybe the same person who mailed my dad the postcards from Osaka mailed it to him.
Why is it being returned to you now?
Everything that you've received so far has had something to do with Wo Fat.

No, that's the real one, huh?

I'd love nothing more than to go to the beach with you,

I love you.
Love you, too.
All right.

In a way, I'm glad this happened.
Oh, you are?
You're glad that, uh,
I got poisoned and almost died.
Okay, not glad, exactly, but grateful.
The truth is, I was looking for any excuse to come home.
I thought you liked Maui, but I'm glad I could help.
Stan only booked this trip to see if we could save our marriage.

Ese no bueno.
A homeless blanket touched me!
Yeah.
Toddlers and Tiaras.
Five-year-old anorexics forced to get spray tans.
Hey!
I was watching whatever that was.
You're going to break something.
Give me that!
Now you broke something.
I hope that's a child murderer.
Close enough.
Hey, doughboy.
I'm here for my dough.
What are you talking about, Robert?
I'm here for my alimony check, which I'll take in cash.
Here you go, Robert.
What?
Why are we giving him alimony?
We're not.
I am.
It was the only way I could get him to finalize the divorce.
I never heard about this.
Oh, that's because I never told you.
Remember?
Oh, yeah.
$600, $700, $800.
Ex-husband.
Best job I ever had.
Well, second best.
In this experiment, we will be testing the effects of massive amounts of high-quality marijuana on a man's ability to play video games while having sex.
Science!
Give it!
Ow!
I got a booger with your wrist's name on it.
Aah!
Right in the bridge!
Oh, getting the watery eye.
Water, not tears!
Natural.
Now that I'm flush, I'm gonna go see what that Chevron with the Techron's all about.
No!
No leave!
Get your mitts off me, Romney.
You want to keep getting this monthly 'mony money, you've got to do something for it.
Hey, give me, ugh!
And you can start by taking your kids for the day.
My kids?
!
This is alimony, not child support.
Aw, do I really get to go with you, Dad?
Can I, Dad?
Can I?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
All right, fine, I'll take them.
Terrific!
Roberta, you and Rallo are going--
- With our dad.
I heard.
You always think you're talking quieter than you are.
I'll go, but I'm keeping my earbuds in the whole time.
Wish you had mouthbuds.
See?
I heard that, too!
Ah, finally,
I can hear myself think.
I wonder how the Captain Tennille met.
I would hate to smell the inside of his hat.
Mmm.
Nice to have time for these thoughts.
Dad, will you check the toilet for monsters?
I have to go the "sit" kind.
Daddy, please, no!
I don't want to go with Mr. Robert!
He's felonious!
Need time alone.
Whatever you're paying him, I'll double it.
I'll miss you.
You'll be fine.
I like being home!
If you don't like what you're doing, use your "emer-gination."
Bye...
All right, they're gone.
That means we have the house all to ourselves.
And the bedroom.
Hm-hm!
We can do whatever we want.
Oh, yes!
Consumer Reports says that toaster oven we got is the best in the price range!
Hootie hoo!
Now, all the dogs are blindfolded so it's a fair fight.
But if they start wilding out, we're going to have to scram right quick.
Junior, they'll come after you first, 'cause they'll smell your salty meat sweat.
But you're big;
you can handle them.
That genie was right.
Salty meat sweat was a bad wish.
Oh, what a day.
Watched Eve's Bayou, long nap, watched Eve's Bayou again, another nap, back to the Bayou, ordered in, had them bring it upstairs to the bedroom, ate it, and here we are.
Fool, be quiet.
I'm trying to watch Eve's Bayou.
Eve's Bayou's on!
I thought it wasn't supposed to be on HBO Urban East until midnight.
It's past midnight.
So... the kids came home, right?
No Rallo!
No Junior!
No Roberta!
No clean towels!
They're in the dryer!
Who's gonna fold them now that Junior's gone?
!
Calm down.
I'll just call Robert.
All right, I'll get it!
Hello?
No, you listen to me, Drake!
The CIA wants their microchip back, they got to dig it out of my brain themselves!
Wait, why is my ear bleeding?
Oh, God, they're trying to take it!
Squeaky, you've been compromised.
You're putting us all in danger.
I'm sorry, Squeaky.
It's just the game.
You got to get before you get got.
He's not picking up.
Cleveland, how can you take a shower when the kids are missing?
!
You know I shower when I'm scared.
Oh, thank God!
Robert, where the hell were you?
!
Clowning around with these turkeys.
Boy, you crazy.
Gobble, gobble.
Are you okay, Junior?
Oh, yeah!
Mr. Robert took us to Chick-fil-A.
Oh, man.
Kid ate five sandwiches.
And remember how many chicken sandwiches I ate?
Kid's a genius, too.
He taught me a pattern for the Ms. Pac-Man machine.
Two-thirds.
I-I ate two-thirds of a sandwich.
Gave the rest to a bird.
Now I call this kid Pac-Man.
'Cause he's round and eats everything in sight.
Whoa, whoa.
Where-where did that come from?
Pac-Man's good people.
Bad, Rallo!
Well, Robert, since you and the Pac-Man hit it off so well, maybe you should take him more often.
That way I could spend more time with my Popsicle-stick houses.
Hmm?
Don't worry, me and the big guy'll hang out again.
See you, Pac-Man.
Stay black, man.
Later, Rallo.
Oh, I'm 'bout to start acting out hard-core.
Relax.
This is just temporary.
Like lesbianism at women's colleges.
So let me be the first to say, you are all officially college graduates.
WOMEN We need to talk.
You're a pretty little house.
I want to put you by the seashore and grow old in you.
Spend my days inside you, making houses of even tinier materials, such as toothpicks.
So then, Dumbledore put on the invisibility cloak and entered the Deathly Hallows.
Oh, man, that's crazy.
So how do you know this dude, again?
Well, it looks like you two had fun.
I'll say!
Pac-Man here taught me Morse code.
All right, see you tomorrow.
Dot-dot-dash-dot, dot-dash, dot-dash-dot, dash.
Oh, you sick!
You're taking him out again tomorrow?
Yeah, I'm gonna give him some pointers on getting with that girl he likes.
Elayne Boosler?
!
No, you know, Joanna.
From school?
She's all the boy talks about.
Huh.
I don't remember him mentioning a Joanna to me.
Or that he goes to school.
I'm not surprised.
Do you realize this chump's never even had
"the talk" with Junior?
You haven't?
I'm going to do it when he becomes a man, on his 18th birthday, and is headed to university.
Yeah, well, since you ain't man enough,
I'm gonna give Junior the sex talk.
Later, fool.
I'm gonna give him the sex talk!
You're not the expert just because you've had sex with four of the six women I've had sex with, plus a lot more.
And I really wish I wasn't shouting this out the door in front of the neighbors and our Lord!
Amen!
Sure is beautiful out here, isn't it, Junior?
I guess so.
The perfect setting for a father-son talk.
Waves tickling our toes, salt air filling our lungs, seashells everywhere.
Do you hear the ocean, Daddy?
I wanna talk to a octopus!
Just a moment, Junior.
Daddy's on the phone.
Yep, mm-hmm, yeah.
I'll let him know.
Junior, the ocean says there's a girl at school you're sweet on.
The ocean knows about Joanna?
Mm-hmm.
And I know you're becoming a man, and there's a few things you should know.
Icebreaker; did that.
Shell phone bit; that worked.
Becoming a man-- here we go.
In nature, certain things are meant to fit together.
Like a bird in its nest, or a hand in a glove, or a hot dog in a donut.
So being a man means I can eat donut dogs?
Perhaps I was less than clear.
Let me skip ahead.
When a woman truly loves a man, she lies down in bed next to him, takes his most special treasure... and cuts it-- and that's why you have a belly button.
And... my cards seem to be out of order.
Well, you basically get it.
Now, as for Joanna, try to initiate physical contact.
Arrange to have a soda sprayed all over her shirt-- ask the albino kid, he's dying to be included in something.
Then just happen to walk by with a roll of paper towels.
And that will work?
If I know soda as well as I think I do-- yeah, it'll work.
Talk to me.
How'd it go with Joanna?
Tell me everything.
I asked her to the movies.
She said "no."
What?
!
Did you do the soda thing?
Yeah, the albino kid missed his cue.
Mm.
He's probably beating himself up worse than we ever could.
You know what, Dad?
Thanks for your help, but I think I'm just not ready for girls yet.
Well, then why don't you and I go to the movies tonight?
It'll be great.
We'll sneak in some drinks, sneak in some popcorn-- heck, we could even take us a couple po' boys in there.
What do you say, champ?
I think I'm just gonna chill out in my room.
That po' , po ' boy.
Now all I can think about is eating a s-s-s-sandwich at the m-m-m-movies.
You're not fooling anybody sneaking that food into the theater.
Just keep moving.
The soup's starting to burn.
Hey, there's Robert.
And there's Joanna.
Robert's dating Joanna?
!
Oh, Junior's gonna be devastated.
And I can't imagine Joanna's father will be...
Oh, no, there's Junior.
That must have been awkward, riding between Robert and Joanna on the way to their creepy date.
Cleveland, Junior's on the date with Joanna.
But that doesn't make sense.
Junior told me she said no.
Thanks for the ride, Mr. Brown.
Thanks for the gas money, Joanna.
See you after the show, Dad.
Are you ready to order?
We're gonna need a minute.
I can't believe Junior's calling Robert "Dad."
I carried that boy for nine months.
It was when he was 12.
He was scared to touch the ground.
Convinced himself everything was hot lava.
Maybe that's part of the problem, Cleveland.
You baby him.
Robert treats him like a man.
Mm, used to treat me like a man, too.
What does that mean?
Bye-bye.
Hey, Dad, let me cop a hit off that juice bag.
I thought Robert was your dad.
That's right.
I saw you at...
"the theatre."
Why would you call Robert "Dad"?
Well, the thing is-- and I'm sorry to have to get real like this-- but he's cooler than you, Dad.
C-c-cooler?
Yeah, I mean, your idea?
That whole albino mess?
I never stood a chance.
But Robert, he knows what women want.
Yep.
Look, Dad, I'm not trying to replace you with Robert.
And you best believe I'm still coming to you for things like taxes and the best laundry detergent.
Wisk.
Right.
So, you cool?
Yeah, I'm cool.
No, no, Dad.
You're not cool.
This a-guy, he sweet but he no listen.
Junior's wrong about me.
I'm cool, right, guys?
Course you're cool, bro.
Would I call you bro if you weren't cool?
Probably would.
I call everybody bro.
'Sup, bro.
I don't know, Cleveland, I have to admit, when I imagined having a black friend in my mind,
I was picturing more of an Isaac Hayes type.
He is pretty cool.
Maybe if I shaved my head...
Nah, I got that hot dog roll back there.
That wouldn't look good at all.
Hey, I'm way cooler than Robert.
If only there was some way to prove it.
"Coolympics." What?
!
"The Coolympics." A rigorous series of events judged by a panel of experts experts to determine which contestant is cooler.
I know what a damn Coolympics is, fool.
Well, I challenge you to one of those.
It's obviously the only way
I can win back the love of my son.
Please!
Every four years, some nerd challenges me to a Coolympics.
And I ain't lost yet.
I'm in.
See you at the Coolympics, chump.
Come on, Pac-Man.
Waka-waka- waka-waka-waka...
You're Coolympicking against him?
Listen, dummy.
There's only one way you're gonna win this thing, and that's if I coach you.
You want me to win?
No, I want him to lose.
My dad ditched me just like Junior ditched you.
Time to make him pay.
Yeah.
♪ We're gonna make him pay... ♪ Stop it.
♪ We're gonna make him pay ♪ That's the problem right here.
This is not cool.
♪ We're gonna make him pay ♪ Put me down.
Welcome, one and all, to the Coolympics.
Remember, we have absolutely no street permits for this event, so if the cops come, run like hell.
And now to our contestants,
Cleveland Lou Albano Brown and Robert.
And now, to judge this epic battle, we've gathered the three coolest men alive, who agreed to be here because they were misled about the nature of this competition.
From the L-B-C, Mr. Calvin "Snoop Dogg" Broadus.
If you wanna see my giraffe naked, go to Snoop Dogg-dot-tv.
I also got a tiger having sex with a pelican.
Nice.
Our next judge takes a lot of credit while gravity does the work.
Please welcome the only professional skateboarder in the universe, Tony Hawk.
Even my board gets mad play.
He's so radical.
Oh, and here's our final judge, all the way from Cloud City--
Lando Calrissian.
You no good, low-down, Coolympians.
Just kidding.
I'm nice.
And cool.
I've never heard of these judges.
And Cleveland Brown has lost the first event--
"Recognizing Cool People."
Aw.
We move on to our second event,
"Getting A Hot Bartender's Attention."
And... go!
Excuse me, sir...
Uh, are you in line?
If I could just scoot by...
Oh... uh...
Hi.
Uh, pardon, when you get a second, may I get an iced Earl Grey please?
With a cherry.
Time.
Let's see what the judges thought.
Snoop?
The guy gettin' ass always wins.
You got that right, friend.
Okay, our next event is "Looking Cool In Jeans."
Gentlemen, show us what you got.
Oh, he went acid-washed.
We got this one.
What the...
Jean shorts?
That's not what I picked out for you.
Called an audible.
When you've got the legs, you show 'em off.
Not bad.
Now turn around and make it clap.
Beg pardon?
Aw, no, that's a dude!
Man, I'm up outta here!
See y'all.
Man, I'm gone.
Whee!
For our final event-- and just for a little tension, let's say whoever wins this wins the whole thing--
"Who Can Get Michael Buble on the Phone the Fastest?"
Who the is Michael Buble?
Michael, is that you?
It's Cleveland.
I got him!
I got Buble on the phone!
I win the Coolympics!
I win!
Trick event.
Michael Buble ain't cool.
Sorry, buddy.
I had no choice.
And by a score of 85 to nothing,
Robert wins the Coolympics.
Whatever, I don't care.
86 to nothing.
Wait a minute!
I have something to say.
Wow.
Thought it would take a little more time to get your attention.
Okay, what I want to say is this--
I did all this because I want my son to love me.
And if that's not cool, then I don't want to be cool.
Good, 'cause you're not.
Who said that?
Me, but I'm speaking for everyone.
Is that true?
Yes.
All I wanted to do was make my dad jealous and you're too lame to even help me do that.
Jealous?
Why?
Because you ditched me for Cleveland Junior.
Come on, Rallo, Junior needs help.
Look where he comes from.
That's assault.
I'm gonna sue you all.
But you came from my groins.
You were born cool.
Hey, Junior.
Where's your little girlfriend?
Tony Hawk said he was gonna show her how to do a backside ollie, but we all know what that means.
Well, that's understandable.
Did you mean all that embarrassing stuff you said about doing this for my love?
Yeah.
I thought that was nice.
And being nice is more important than being cool.
And maybe this makes me uncool, but I love you...
Dad.
It does make you uncool.
Come on, son.
Let's go home.
What a stressful experience.
I'm definitely sleeping in your bed tonight.
That's fine, 'cause I'm not!
Works every time.
Aw, who could blame her?
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
A universe of stars shines down on one special planet.
Our planet.
Our home.
The only planet we know that has life.
Life began when the Earth was young and it started small... when one tiny molecule managed to make a copy of itself.
Since then... since that magical moment... life has swept across the globe... filling every corner of our world.
Today there are some 5 million different species on the planet.
5 million different ways of staying alive.
This is a story that connects us all.
It's a story of hope and of triumph.
A story of our journey through life.
Every life begins with a birth.
And every mother must choose where her baby's life begins.
A Weddell seal has come to this desert of snow and ice to have her pup.
The pup is only a few hours old and is helpless.
He is entirely dependent on his mother.
It may be spring, but the temperature can still drop to minus 20 degrees and winds of 70 miles an hour roar across the ice.
All his mother can do is try to shelter him with her own body.
Trust that she can keep her infant alive.
So why has she chosen here, of all places, to have her pup?
It's because here, they're safe from their enemies.
ln the middle of this vast frozen sea, no predator can reach her or her baby.
but there's no food here.
So the mother keeps this ice hole open, the only route to her hunting ground.
And it must become his hunting ground, too.
She has to persuade him into the water.
He's not keen.
And who can blame him?
but he soon discovers this is where he was born to be.
Now, life's adventure can begin.
Wherever you look in the world, so much of growing up depends on the skill and determination of your parents.
These snow monkeys live in a volcanic mountain range in the cold North.
They have wonderfully thick furry coats, but they still feel the cold.
And the winter here is hard on the little ones.
Some snow monkeys have discovered there is a better way.
Steamy hot thermal springs.
These resourceful mothers bring their babies here to escape the worst of the winter in a long warm bath.
ln here, the water is a delightful 100 degrees.
So why aren't all the monkeys in the pool?
Well, it's a privilege which is jealously guarded.
Inside the pool, a royal family.
A queen and a ruling dynasty of snow monkeys.
Outside the pool... everyone else.
The youngest princess can luxuriate because she has an extended family determined to give her the best in life.
Not everyone has the advantage of such a supportive family.
Some have to depend on a dedicated single mother.
And here she is.
A strawberry poison arrow frog no bigger than your fingernail.
She's laid her eggs on the forest floor.
For most frog mothers that would be the job done.
but her maternal instinct is so strong she guards them until they've hatched, and then she moves her tadpoles out of danger.
She hitches a tadpole on her back, then sets off.
Surprisingly, she starts to climb.
And this is what she's looking for:
a special plant way up in the branches of a tree, ¤0 feet above the ground.
There's water trapped in its leaves that makes it a perfect nursery pool.
She has to leave him because she still has 4 more tadpoles waiting on the forest floor, and each must be carried up to its own private nursery.
There's nothing to eat in these pools, so she feeds each tadpole with one of her own unfertilized eggs.
A single egg won't sustain a hungry tadpole for long, so every few days, she has to climb back up to each youngster... and do it all over again.
One day, this fine young frog emerges from his pool, and leaves his devoted mother behind.
(growling)
(adult gorilla snorting)
There are fathers who do their bit, too.
A male silverback gorilla left in charge.
(upbeat music)
(snorting) but he's not what you might call a hands-on dad.
(snorting)
(growling)
(birds chirping)
(distant growling)
(growling)
babysitting.
It's so exhausting.
(growling)
(screaming)
(distant whooping)
(distant thumping)
That sound is another male.
A rival.
A challenge.
(whooping)
(echoing sound effects)
The rival would steal his territory, and that would be the end of his family and everything he holds dear.
(distant whooping)
(distant thumping)
(whooping)

No reply.
(soft music)
When it comes to the important things in life, he's actually a pretty good dad.
(wind gusting)
(whimpering)
Often, being a good parent comes naturally.
but there are times when you have to learn the hard way.
This baby elephant was born last night to a first-time mother.
These are the first steps on a life that could last 70 years, if the baby survives these critical early days.
To produce enough milk to feed her calf, the mother must find water.
The baby has no option, she has to join the march.
(soft music)
She manages 5 miles, but there's still a long way to go.
(growling)
(soft music)
(trumpeting)
(growling)
(trumpeting)
She's not sure what to make of a waterhole.
(whimpering) And no idea how to get out of it.
As the herd moves deeper into the swamp, the young mother and her calf follow.
This is dangerous.
(trumpeting) baby elephants can get fatally stuck in mud.
(calf crying)
The mother's trying to help, but she's actually pushing her baby deeper into the mud.
(trumpeting)
The grandmother sees the problem.
(trumpeting)
She barges her daughter out of the way just in time.
(soft music)
Whether it's a baby elephant or a baby frog, a snow monkey or a gorilla,
they're all cared for by parents who do their best to keep them safe.
Too soon, childhood ends... (trumpeting) ...and they'll discover it's time to make their own way in the world.
The lifelong search for food begins.
(birds chirping) Imagine trying to feed 10 million hungry mouths.
Well, that's the challenge facing the inhabitants of this underground city.
The city is surrounded by grassland.
Unfortunately its citizens, grass-cutter ants, can't actually eat grass.
(crunching)
(thumping)
(upbeat music)
Yet they collect every blade of grass they can, and they carry it all the way back to the colony.
(upbeat music)
And they do this all day.
Every day.
365 days a year.
(upbeat music)
So why are they doing it?
The answer lies deep underground.
(cringing)
They chop it up and feed it to a fungus that can eat grass.
And then they eat the fungus.
The anthill is a massive underground farm.
It's a perfect arrangement, except that the fungus produces so much carbon dioxide it poisons the air down here.
The ants have sorted that problem, too.
They've built specially designed ventilation shafts to keep their air clean.
They're farmers, architects and engineers.
Each individual ant has a brain the size of a pinhead.
but somehow, together, they have invented a solution to feeding themselves that we would be proud to match.
Sometimes in life, the best way is to follow your own path.
Choose food that no one else has a taste for.
(distant squawking)
Here's a lammergeier, a huge bearded vulture, scanning the ground for his next meal.
(squawking)
(distant squawking)
A lot of rival scavengers have beaten him to this carcass.
(squawking)
but a lammergeier is happy to miss out on the meat.
It's the bones he's after.
Why?
because inside, they are full of rich marrowfat.
The problem: how to get at it.
(epic music)
Here's how.
(cawing)
Now the juices in his stomach - as corrosive as battery acid - can get to work dissolving the bone.
(squawking)
Every young lammergeier wants to learn the trick.
It's not as easy as it looks.
And a beginner needs to be closely watched.
(angry squawking) lf at first you don't succeed... try...
(squawking) try... try again.
A unique and inventive way to get food.
One that lammergeiers have made their own.
(crickets chirring)
For centuries, these rocks have been a special place for preparing food by a really clever animal.
ln fact it's so clever it's changed the way we think about animals and even about ourselves.
These caves are home to a monkey:
the brown tufted capuchin.
Capuchins love palm nuts.
The problem is they're incredibly tough to crack, even harder than bone.
(birds chirping)
An old hand knows that first a nut should be peeled.
Then given a week or so drying in the sun.
Here's some he prepared earlier.
Long ago, these clever capuchins worked out that this is what they needed to finish the job.
Now the final step.
(soft dramatic music)
(music intensifying)
We used to think only humans were clever enough to use tools like this.
(joyful music)
Youngsters watch and imitate their elders, just as human toddlers do.
(thumping)
They learn very early that to do a job properly, you've gotta have the right tool.
(fly buzzing) lt takes 8 years to become a master nutcracker.
(birds squawking)
ln many parts of the world, you need more than just skill.
You need courage to find food.
(birds squawking)
A couple of weeks ago, this ibex gave birth to her kids at the top of this cliff, out of the reach of predators.
Now they need food and water.
And that is down in the valley.
Getting there is going to be tough.
(pebbles falling down)
(hooves echoing)
(wind gusting)
(birds squawking)
Trailing behind, this little one is almost down, when she runs right into trouble.
(dramatic music)
The kid has never seen a fox before but she knows she must run for her life.
One wrong turn, one hesitation and the ibex's short life will be over.
The kid has the good sense to make for a place where only an ibex could stand.
(soft music)
Today the little kid made all the right choices... and the fox goes home hungry.
(birds chirping)
So being a hunter isn't always easy.
You have to be at the top of your game to survive.
(crunching)
A praying mantis.
Sharp-eyed and lightning quick.
A perfect hunter.
And a cricket, a perfect meal.
(sound effects)
but he's outgunned by something even more deadly:
a chameleon.
She can camouflage her skin to melt into the background.
She can move her eyes independently to lock on to her target.
Her tongue is a guided missile, striking her victims at 50 feet a second.
And it comes totally out of the blue.
Delicious.
You don't have to work alone.
You can be part of a team.
Get it right and it can totally change your life.
ln this corner of Africa, things are changing.
Fast.
(birds squawking)
(soft music)
Cheetahs hunt alone.
They're very fast, but not strong enough to take down a big animal.
And the zebra know it.
but this cheetah is different.
He doesn't hunt alone.
He's joined forces with not just 1, but his 2 brothers.
As fast as ever, and now 3 times as strong.
They're turning their sights on much bigger prey.
(distant zebra crying)
An ostrich knows a lone cheetah is too small and weak to worry about.
but these brothers have changed the rules.
(dramatic music)
(ostrich squawking)
The female is slow to react and the cheetahs switch target.
(squawking)
(groaning)
(cheetahs panting)
These brothers have figured out how successful a team can be.
Strange circular scars on the sea floor are the mark of a spectacularly successful team.
Cunning, coordinated and creative.
These dolphins have worked out that fish out of water are much easier to catch.
(puffing)
by beating her tail down hard, this bottlenose dolphin stirs up the seabed.
And by swimming in a circle, she creates a ring of mushrooming mud around a shoal of fish.
A fishing net... made of mud.
As the net pulls tighter and tighter, the fish are trapped, till there's only one way out... straight into the mouths of the waiting dolphins.
(classical music)
(birds chirping)
What can you do if you're a hunter that doesn't move, can't move?
There's only one option:
lure your victim in.
(fly buzzing)
The Venus flytrap does just that:
making itself irresistible, oozing sugary nectar around the brim of each leaf.
bait for hungry visitors.
The triggers, fine hairs, which only work when 2 of them are touched within 20 seconds.
(metallic clanging) One... (clock ticking)
(metallic clanging) ...two.
(buzzing) (dramatic music)
(fly squirming)
Once the plant has digested the fly, the trap reopens and resets itself, ready for its next meal.
It works brilliantly, except... if it eats all the visiting flies, there'll be nobody left to pollinate its flowers.
No baby flytraps next year.
So it sends up its flowers on stems a foot long, well away from the traps below.
(birds chirping)
Up here, flies can safely graze on nectar.
ln return, they fertilize the flowers.
(buzzing)
Down below, business as usual.
When it comes to the truly ruthless pursuit of prey... there is one hunter you don't want to meet.
The Komodo dragon, the biggest lizard on the planet.
10-feet long and weighing 300 pounds.
It's the height of the dry season.
Perfect times for a dragon.
(insects buzzing) (growling) ln the pitiless heat, buffalo concentrate at the shrinking waterholes.
The dragon is wary of getting too close.
A jab from those horns, even a kick from those legs could badly injure him.
He knows all he needs is just one bite.
It's just a nip, a flesh wound, but it alerts the other dragons close-by.
Like sharks, they're attracted by blood.
(grunting)
They gather round and watch the buffalo's every move... for days.
The wound doesn't heal.
This is the Komodo dragon's secret weapon.
lts bite injected a poisonous cocktail of bacteria and venom.
As days turn into weeks, the buffalo weakens.
And the dragons wait.
That's all they have to do.
Just bear the hunger, watch, and wait for the poison to take effect.
(snorting)
(groaning)
The buffalo died in the night.
(flies buzzing)
The dragons can eat almost their own body weight in one meal.
They strip the buffalo to the bone in under 3 hours.
Hunters.
Resourceful, imaginative, determined.
They seem to hold all the aces.
So what can you do if you're the one being hunted?
beneath this tree lives a tiny creature called a sengi.
And she has a plan.
One needing speed, agility, and a very good memory.
She's cleared an intricate network of trails all around her territory.
And she's memorized every twist and turn of this maze.
And here's why.
(dramatic music)
The monitor lizard is very fast in short bursts.
but she's the one with the agility to take the tight corners.
(dramatic music)
And she makes the most of home advantage.
She's not only outrun the lizard, she's outwitted him.
(insects buzzing)
Home safe, in time to suckle her baby.
Her escape plan has kept them both alive.
For every hunter who thinks he's invincible, there's an escape artist to gladden your heart.
(soft music)
Meet the pebble toad.
And his sworn enemy, the toad-eating tarantula.
The pebble toad has no armour.
He crawls very slowly... and hopping is quite beyond him.
On the face of it, no contest.
(gulping) but he's not called a pebble toad for nothing.
(dramatic music)
He rolls like a pebble and he bounces like a pebble... right out of danger.
(birds chirping)
Now meet the Jesus Christ lizard.
He may look relaxed, but he's actually about to do something quite miraculous.
(squawking)
That hunter's too close.
Time to go.
(rhythmic music)
(soft music)
We'd have to run at more than 65 miles an hour to do this.
He's got a talent for walking on water and a name to match.
(joyful music)
There are places where there's simply nowhere to run.
Then your best chance is to hide in a crowd.
Each individual fish joins the shoal to save its own skin, but the synchronized flash of silver makes it hard for the hunter to pick out a victim.
(joyful music)
(squawking)
Unfortunately, a crowd attracts attention.
And the fish find themselves at the centre of a feeding frenzy.
(dramatic music)
A shoal reduced to a few survivors, this time by calm, surgical precision.
Sailfish combine speed with skilful swordplay to pick off one fish after another.
So is there anywhere to escape?
(epic music)
Fish... that fly.
Escaping the clutches of a hunter is not just about self-preservation.
Often there is even more at stake.
(dramatic music)
Red-billed tropicbirds coming home from a fishing trip.
(squawking)
Frigate birds patrolling offshore.
Waiting.
They don't want to kill him;
they want to steal his fish.
It's easier than catching their own.
Another ambush.
(squawking)
There goes the fish.
Another victory for the robbers.
It's nesting time here in Tobago and this chick is hungry.
lts father has yet to battle his way through.
(dramatic music)
Frigate birds are faster, but tropicbirds are quicker on the turn.
(squawking)
(chirping)
He didn't fight off his attackers to feed himself.
He did it for his chick.
(chirping)
because nothing is more important to him than family.
It's tempting to think that the story of life is just about survival, staying alive,
but living here is an animal who turns that idea on its head because in life, there is one greater purpose, one greater goal.
(breathing)
This giant octopus is looking for a new home.
(breathing)
It has to be just right.
She's planning on raising a family, and living there for the rest of her life.
(breathing)
These translucent curtains of eggs are her first brood.
Her only brood.
A giant octopus has only one chance to be a mother.
For 6 long months, she dare not leave her eggs unprotected for a moment.
Not even to feed.
She's prepared to starve herself to death... for the sake of her young.
(soft music)
She softly blows water over her eggs to encourage them to hatch.
As her life ebbs away, she sees her babies born into the world.
They mean so much to her she's willing to die for them.
but she lives on, in her children and in the generations to come.
(birds chirping)
(soft music)
To raise that next generation, we all dream of finding the perfect partner, the love of our life.
It's why, every spring, these beautiful birds fly north to find each other again after a long, lonely winter apart.
To celebrate their reunion, the male gives her the most romantic gift he can.
A fish.
but the female still wants to test her partner's true commitment, so she invites him to join her in a dance.
(soft music)
(splashing)
(birds chirping)
This stag beetle is in search of his perfect mate, and he thinks he's going to find her at the top of this tree.
And sure enough here she is, waiting.
but the love life of a beetle is never that simple.
Those aren't horns on his head.
They're jaws.
The male Darwin's beetle has some of the biggest jaws in nature... for fighting rivals.
(squeaking)
The bigger the jaws, the better the fighter.
Just as well that armour's tough.
(amusing music)
A second rival.
And another.
One more.
And yet another.
Here she is at last.
After all he's been through, she doesn't seem that impressed.
(amusing music)
Unfortunately for her, the hurling habit dies hard.
(squeaking)
When it comes to winning a mate, males may think they call the shots, but often it's the females that do the choosing.
This is a female humpback whale and she's ready to mate.
As well as making a scene, she's releasing her scent into the water, attracting males from far and wide.
(whale singing)
but the minute they turn up, she swims away, enticing her suitors to chase her.
They challenge for the one position that counts:
to swim right behind her.
They're doing exactly what she wants.
She wants them to fight.
(whales singing)
(epic music)
40-ton males lash out at each other.
It's an epic battle where there can only be one winner.
(dramatic music)
Only when the female is sure that the strongest male has won will she allow him to take his place at her side to be her mate.
(whales singing)
(whale singing)
A year later, she comes back to Tonga with her perfect newborn calf.
Her whole story, her whole life has brought her to this moment.
Every living thing on our planet shares the same desire:
not just to live, but to foster new life.
And we're no different.
(soft music)
We see so much of us in them... and them in us.
Whether it's intelligence or ingenuity strength, grace or determination.
Courage... even love.
Their lives... our lives... all life on Earth will be richer if we choose to remember everything we have in common.
To remember we share one planet... one future.
(dramatic music)
(narrator):
A universe of stars shines down on one special planet.
Our planet.
Our home.
The only planet we know that has life.
(wildebeest mooing)
Life began when the Earth was young and it started small... when one tiny molecule managed to make a copy of itself.
Since then... since that magical moment... life has swept across the globe... filling every corner of our world.
(epic music)
(squawking)
Today there are some 5 million different species on the planet.
5 million different ways of staying alive.
(epic music)
(roaring)
This is a story that connects us all.
It's a story of hope and of triumph.
A story of our journey through life.
(wind blowing)
Every life begins with a birth.
And every mother must choose where her baby's life begins.
(soft music)
A Weddell seal has come to this desert of snow and ice to have her pup.
The pup is only a few hours old and is helpless.
He is entirely dependent on his mother.
(whimpering)
(barking)
(licking)
It may be spring, but the temperature can still drop to minus 20 degrees and winds of 70 miles an hour roar across the ice.
All his mother can do is try to shelter him with her own body.
Trust that she can keep her infant alive.
So why has she chosen here, of all places, to have her pup?
It's because here, they're safe from their enemies.
ln the middle of this vast frozen sea, no predator can reach her or her baby.
(barking)
but there's no food here.
So the mother keeps this ice hole open, the only route to her hunting ground.
And it must become his hunting ground, too.
She has to persuade him into the water.
He's not keen.
And who can blame him?
but he soon discovers this is where he was born to be.
(soft music)
(muffled seal cries)
Now, life's adventure can begin.
Wherever you look in the world, so much of growing up depends on the skill and determination of your parents.
These snow monkeys live in a volcanic mountain range in the cold North.
They have wonderfully thick furry coats, but they still feel the cold.
And the winter here is hard on the little ones.
Some snow monkeys have discovered there is a better way.
Steamy hot thermal springs.
These resourceful mothers bring their babies here to escape the worst of the winter in a long warm bath.
ln here, the water is a delightful 100 degrees.
So why aren't all the monkeys in the pool?
Well, it's a privilege which is jealously guarded.
(screaming)
Inside the pool, a royal family.
A queen and a ruling dynasty of snow monkeys.
Outside the pool... everyone else.

ln this corner of Africa, things are changing.
Fast.
(birds squawking)
(soft music)
Cheetahs hunt alone.
They're very fast, but not strong enough to take down a big animal.
And the zebra know it.
but this cheetah is different.
He doesn't hunt alone.
He's joined forces with not just 1, but his 2 brothers.
As fast as ever, and now 3 times as strong.
They're turning their sights on much bigger prey.
(distant zebra crying)
An ostrich knows a lone cheetah is too small and weak to worry about.
but these brothers have changed the rules.
(dramatic music)
(ostrich squawking)
The female is slow to react and the cheetahs switch target.
(squawking)
(groaning)
(cheetahs panting)
These brothers have figured out how successful a team can be.
Strange circular scars on the sea floor are the mark of a spectacularly successful team.
Cunning, coordinated and creative.
These dolphins have worked out that fish out of water are much easier to catch.
(puffing)
by beating her tail down hard, this bottlenose dolphin stirs up the seabed.
And by swimming in a circle, she creates a ring of mushrooming mud around a shoal of fish.
A fishing net... made of mud.
As the net pulls tighter and tighter, the fish are trapped, till there's only one way out... straight into the mouths of the waiting dolphins.
(classical music)
(birds chirping)
What can you do if you're a hunter that doesn't move, can't move?
There's only one option:
lure your victim in.
(fly buzzing)
The Venus flytrap does just that:
making itself irresistible, oozing sugary nectar around the brim of each leaf.
bait for hungry visitors.
The triggers, fine hairs, which only work when 2 of them are touched within 20 seconds.
(metallic clanging) One... (clock ticking)
(metallic clanging) ...two.
(buzzing) (dramatic music)
(fly squirming)
Once the plant has digested the fly, the trap reopens and resets itself, ready for its next meal.
It works brilliantly, except... if it eats all the visiting flies, there'll be nobody left to pollinate its flowers.
No baby flytraps next year.
So it sends up its flowers on stems a foot long, well away from the traps below.
(birds chirping)
Up here, flies can safely graze on nectar.
ln return, they fertilize the flowers.
(buzzing)
Down below, business as usual.
When it comes to the truly ruthless pursuit of prey... there is one hunter you don't want to meet.
The Komodo dragon, the biggest lizard on the planet.
10-feet long and weighing 300 pounds.
It's the height of the dry season.
Perfect times for a dragon.
(insects buzzing) (growling) ln the pitiless heat, buffalo concentrate at the shrinking waterholes.
The dragon is wary of getting too close.
A jab from those horns, even a kick from those legs could badly injure him.
He knows all he needs is just one bite.
It's just a nip, a flesh wound, but it alerts the other dragons close-by.
Like sharks, they're attracted by blood.
(grunting)
They gather round and watch the buffalo's every move... for days.
The wound doesn't heal.
This is the Komodo dragon's secret weapon.
lts bite injected a poisonous cocktail of bacteria and venom.
As days turn into weeks, the buffalo weakens.
And the dragons wait.
That's all they have to do.
Just bear the hunger, watch, and wait for the poison to take effect.
(snorting)
(groaning)
The buffalo died in the night.
(flies buzzing)
The dragons can eat almost their own body weight in one meal.
They strip the buffalo to the bone in under 3 hours.
Hunters.
Resourceful, imaginative, determined.
They seem to hold all the aces.
So what can you do if you're the one being hunted?
beneath this tree lives a tiny creature called a sengi.
And she has a plan.
One needing speed, agility, and a very good memory.
She's cleared an intricate network of trails all around her territory.
And she's memorized every twist and turn of this maze.
And here's why.
(dramatic music)
The monitor lizard is very fast in short bursts.
but she's the one with the agility to take the tight corners.
(dramatic music)
And she makes the most of home advantage.
She's not only outrun the lizard, she's outwitted him.
(insects buzzing)
Home safe, in time to suckle her baby.
Her escape plan has kept them both alive.
For every hunter who thinks he's invincible, there's an escape artist to gladden your heart.
(soft music)
Meet the pebble toad.
And his sworn enemy, the toad-eating tarantula.
The pebble toad has no armour.
He crawls very slowly... and hopping is quite beyond him.
On the face of it, no contest.
(gulping) but he's not called a pebble toad for nothing.
(dramatic music)
He rolls like a pebble and he bounces like a pebble... right out of danger.
(birds chirping)
Now meet the Jesus Christ lizard.
He may look relaxed, but he's actually about to do something quite miraculous.
(squawking)
That hunter's too close.
Time to go.
(rhythmic music)
(soft music)
We'd have to run at more than 65 miles an hour to do this.
He's got a talent for walking on water and a name to match.
(joyful music)
There are places where there's simply nowhere to run.
Then your best chance is to hide in a crowd.
Each individual fish joins the shoal to save its own skin, but the synchronized flash of silver makes it hard for the hunter to pick out a victim.
(joyful music)
(squawking)
Unfortunately, a crowd attracts attention.
And the fish find themselves at the centre of a feeding frenzy.
(dramatic music)
A shoal reduced to a few survivors, this time by calm, surgical precision.
Sailfish combine speed with skilful swordplay to pick off one fish after another.
So is there anywhere to escape?
(epic music)
Fish... that fly.
Escaping the clutches of a hunter is not just about self-preservation.
Often there is even more at stake.
(dramatic music)
Red-billed tropicbirds coming home from a fishing trip.
(squawking)
Frigate birds patrolling offshore.
Waiting.
They don't want to kill him;
they want to steal his fish.
It's easier than catching their own.
Another ambush.
(squawking)
There goes the fish.
Another victory for the robbers.
It's nesting time here in Tobago and this chick is hungry.
lts father has yet to battle his way through.
(dramatic music)
Frigate birds are faster, but tropicbirds are quicker on the turn.
(squawking)
(chirping)
He didn't fight off his attackers to feed himself.
He did it for his chick.
(chirping)
because nothing is more important to him than family.
It's tempting to think that the story of life is just about survival, staying alive,
but living here is an animal who turns that idea on its head because in life, there is one greater purpose, one greater goal.
(breathing)
This giant octopus is looking for a new home.
(breathing)
It has to be just right.
She's planning on raising a family, and living there for the rest of her life.
(breathing)
These translucent curtains of eggs are her first brood.
Her only brood.
A giant octopus has only one chance to be a mother.
For 6 long months, she dare not leave her eggs unprotected for a moment.
Not even to feed.
She's prepared to starve herself to death... for the sake of her young.
(soft music)
She softly blows water over her eggs to encourage them to hatch.
As her life ebbs away, she sees her babies born into the world.
They mean so much to her she's willing to die for them.
but she lives on, in her children and in the generations to come.
(birds chirping)
(soft music)
To raise that next generation, we all dream of finding the perfect partner, the love of our life.
It's why, every spring, these beautiful birds fly north to find each other again after a long, lonely winter apart.
To celebrate their reunion, the male gives her the most romantic gift he can.
A fish.
but the female still wants to test her partner's true commitment, so she invites him to join her in a dance.
(soft music)
(splashing)
(birds chirping)
This stag beetle is in search of his perfect mate, and he thinks he's going to find her at the top of this tree.
And sure enough here she is, waiting.
but the love life of a beetle is never that simple.
Those aren't horns on his head.
They're jaws.
The male Darwin's beetle has some of the biggest jaws in nature... for fighting rivals.
(squeaking)
The bigger the jaws, the better the fighter.
Just as well that armour's tough.
(amusing music)
A second rival.
And another.
One more.
And yet another.
Here she is at last.
After all he's been through, she doesn't seem that impressed.
(amusing music)
Unfortunately for her, the hurling habit dies hard.
(squeaking)
When it comes to winning a mate, males may think they call the shots, but often it's the females that do the choosing.
This is a female humpback whale and she's ready to mate.
As well as making a scene, she's releasing her scent into the water, attracting males from far and wide.
(whale singing)
but the minute they turn up, she swims away, enticing her suitors to chase her.
They challenge for the one position that counts:
to swim right behind her.
They're doing exactly what she wants.
She wants them to fight.
(whales singing)
(epic music)
40-ton males lash out at each other.
It's an epic battle where there can only be one winner.
(dramatic music)
Only when the female is sure that the strongest male has won will she allow him to take his place at her side to be her mate.
(whales singing)
(whale singing)
A year later, she comes back to Tonga with her perfect newborn calf.
Her whole story, her whole life has brought her to this moment.
Every living thing on our planet shares the same desire:
not just to live, but to foster new life.
And we're no different.
(soft music)
We see so much of us in them... and them in us.
Whether it's intelligence or ingenuity strength, grace or determination.
Courage... even love.
Their lives... our lives... all life on Earth will be richer if we choose to remember everything we have in common.
To remember we share one planet... one future.
(dramatic music)

Blu-ray Subtitling:
CNST, Montreal
A universe of stars shines down on one special planet.
Our planet.
Our home.
The only planet we know that has life.
Life began when the Earth was young and it started small... when one tiny molecule managed to make a copy of itself.
Since then... since that magical moment... life has swept across the globe... filling every corner of our world.
Today there are some 5 million different species on the planet.
5 million different ways of staying alive.
This is a story that connects us all.
It's a story of hope and of triumph.
A story of our journey through life.
Every life begins with a birth.
And every mother must choose where her baby's life begins.
A Weddell seal has come to this desert of snow and ice to have her pup.
The pup is only a few hours old and is helpless.
He is entirely dependent on his mother. but the temperature can still drop to minus 20 degrees and winds of 70 miles an hour roar across the ice.
All his mother can do is try to shelter him with her own body.
Trust that she can keep her infant alive.
to have her pup?
they're safe from their enemies.
no predator can reach her or her baby.
but there's no food here.
the only route to her hunting ground.
too.
She has to persuade him into the water.
He's not keen.
And who can blame him?
but he soon discovers this is where he was born to be.
life's adventure can begin. so much of growing up depends on the skill and determination of your parents.
These snow monkeys live in a volcanic mountain range in the cold North.
but they still feel the cold.
And the winter here is hard on the little ones.
Some snow monkeys have discovered there is a better way.
Steamy hot thermal springs.
These resourceful mothers bring their babies here to escape the worst of the winter in a long warm bath.
the water is a delightful 100 degrees.
So why aren't all the monkeys in the pool?
it's a privilege which is jealously guarded.
a royal family.
A queen and a ruling dynasty of snow monkeys.
Outside the pool... everyone else.
The youngest princess can luxuriate because she has an extended family determined to give her the best in life.
Not everyone has the advantage of such a supportive family.
Some have to depend on a dedicated single mother.
And here she is.
A strawberry poison arrow frog no bigger than your fingernail.
She's laid her eggs on the forest floor.
For most frog mothers that would be the job done. and then she moves her tadpoles out of danger. then sets off.
she starts to climb.
And this is what she's looking for:
30 feet above the ground.
There's water trapped in its leaves that makes it a perfect nursery pool.
She has to leave him because she still has 4 more tadpoles and each must be carried up to its own private nursery. so she feeds each tadpole with one of her own unfertilized eggs. she has to climb back up to each youngster... and do it all over again. and leaves his devoted mother behind.
(growling)
(adult gorilla snorting) too.
A male silverback gorilla left in charge.
(upbeat music)
(snorting) but he's not what you might call a hands-on dad.

(birds chirping)
(distant growling)
(growling)
babysitting.
It's so exhausting.
(growling)
(screaming)
(distant whooping)
(distant thumping)
That sound is another male.
A rival.
A challenge.
(whooping)
(echoing sound effects) and that would be the end of his family and everything he holds dear.
(distant whooping)
(distant thumping)
(whooping)
(echoing sound effects)
No reply.
(soft music) he's actually a pretty good dad.
(wind gusting)
(whimpering) being a good parent comes naturally.
but there are times when you have to learn the hard way.
This baby elephant was born last night to a first-time mother. if the baby survives these critical early days.
the mother must find water.
she has to join the march.
(soft music) but there's still a long way to go.
(growling)
(soft music)
(trumpeting)
(growling)
(trumpeting)
She's not sure what to make of a waterhole.
(whimpering) And no idea how to get out of it. the young mother and her calf follow.
This is dangerous.
(trumpeting) baby elephants can get fatally stuck in mud.
(calf crying) but she's actually pushing her baby deeper into the mud.
(trumpeting)
The grandmother sees the problem.
(trumpeting)
She barges her daughter out of the way just in time.
(soft music) they're all cared for by parents who do their best to keep them safe.
childhood ends... (trumpeting) ...and they'll discover it's time to make their own way in the world.
The lifelong search for food begins.
(birds chirping)
Imagine trying to feed 10 million hungry mouths.
that's the challenge facing the inhabitants of this underground city.
The city is surrounded by grassland. can't actually eat grass.
(crunching)
(thumping)
(upbeat music) and they carry it all the way back to the colony.
(upbeat music)
And they do this all day.
Every day.
365 days a year.
(upbeat music)
So why are they doing it?
The answer lies deep underground.
(cringing)
They chop it up and feed it to a fungus that can eat grass.
And then they eat the fungus.
The anthill is a massive underground farm. except that the fungus produces so much carbon dioxide it poisons the air down here.
too.
They've built specially designed ventilation shafts to keep their air clean.
architects and engineers.
Each individual ant has a brain the size of a pinhead. they have invented a solution to feeding themselves that we would be proud to match.
the best way is to follow your own path.
Choose food that no one else has a taste for.
(distant squawking) scanning the ground for his next meal.
(squawking)
(distant squawking)
A lot of rival scavengers have beaten him to this carcass.
(squawking)
but a lammergeier is happy to miss out on the meat.
It's the bones he's after.
they are full of rich marrowfat.
The problem: how to get at it.
(epic music)
Here's how.
(cawing)
Now the juices in his stomach - as corrosive as battery acid - can get to work dissolving the bone.
(squawking)
Every young lammergeier wants to learn the trick.
It's not as easy as it looks.
And a beginner needs to be closely watched.
(angry squawking) lf at first you don't succeed... try...
(squawking) try... try again.
A unique and inventive way to get food.
One that lammergeiers have made their own.
(crickets chirring)
these rocks have been a special place for preparing food by a really clever animal.
ln fact it's so clever it's changed the way we think about animals and even about ourselves.
These caves are home to a monkey:
the brown tufted capuchin.
Capuchins love palm nuts.
even harder than bone.
(birds chirping)
An old hand knows that first a nut should be peeled.
Then given a week or so drying in the sun.
Here's some he prepared earlier.
these clever capuchins worked out that this is what they needed to finish the job.
Now the final step.
(soft dramatic music)
(music intensifying)
We used to think only humans were clever enough to use tools like this.
(joyful music) just as human toddlers do.
(thumping) you've gotta have the right tool.
(fly buzzing)
It takes 8 years to become a master nutcracker.
(birds squawking)
you need more than just skill.
You need courage to find food.
(birds squawking)
this ibex gave birth to her kids out of the reach of predators.
Now they need food and water.
And that is down in the valley.
Getting there is going to be tough.
(pebbles falling down)
(hooves echoing)
(wind gusting)
(birds squawking) when she runs right into trouble.
(dramatic music)
The kid has never seen a fox before but she knows she must run for her life.
one hesitation and the ibex's short life will be over.
The kid has the good sense to make for a place where only an ibex could stand.
(soft music)
Today the little kid made all the right choices... and the fox goes home hungry.
(birds chirping)
So being a hunter isn't always easy.
You have to be at the top of your game to survive.
(crunching)
A praying mantis.
Sharp-eyed and lightning quick.
A perfect hunter.
a perfect meal.
(sound effects)
but he's outgunned by something even more deadly:
a chameleon.
She can camouflage her skin to melt into the background.
She can move her eyes independently to lock on to her target. striking her victims at 50 feet a second.
And it comes totally out of the blue.
Delicious.
You don't have to work alone.
You can be part of a team.
Get it right and it can totally change your life.
things are changing.
Fast.

Cheetahs hunt alone. but not strong enough to take down a big animal.

So why has she chosen here, of all places, to have her pup?
It's because here, they're safe from their enemies.
ln the middle of this vast frozen sea, no predator can reach her or her baby.
but there's no food here.
So the mother keeps this ice hole open, the only route to her hunting ground.
And it must become his hunting ground, too.
She has to persuade him into the water.
He's not keen.

The youngest princess can luxuriate because she has an extended family determined to give her the best in life.
Not everyone has the advantage of such a supportive family.
Some have to depend on a dedicated single mother.
And here she is.
A strawberry poison arrow frog no bigger than your fingernail.
She's laid her eggs on the forest floor.
For most frog mothers that would be the job done.
but her maternal instinct is so strong she guards them until they've hatched, and then she moves her tadpoles out of danger.
She hitches a tadpole on her back, then sets off.
Surprisingly, she starts to climb.
And this is what she's looking for:
a special plant way up in the branches of a tree, 30 feet above the ground.
There's water trapped in its leaves that makes it a perfect nursery pool.
She has to leave him because she still has 4 more tadpoles waiting on the forest floor, and each must be carried up to its own private nursery.
There's nothing to eat in these pools, so she feeds each tadpole with one of her own unfertilized eggs.
A single egg won't sustain a hungry tadpole for long, so every few days, she has to climb back up to each youngster... and do it all over again.
One day, this fine young frog emerges from his pool, and leaves his devoted mother behind.
There are fathers who do their bit, too.
A male silverback gorilla left in charge.
but he's not what you might call a hands-on dad.
babysitting.
It's so exhausting.
That sound is another male.
A rival.
A challenge.
The rival would steal his territory, and that would be the end of his family and everything he holds dear.
No reply.
When it comes to the important things in life, he's actually a pretty good dad.
Often, being a good parent comes naturally.
but there are times when you have to learn the hard way.
This baby elephant was born last night to a first-time mother.
These are the first steps on a life that could last 70 years, if the baby survives these critical early days.
To produce enough milk to feed her calf, the mother must find water.
The baby has no option, she has to join the march.
She manages 5 miles, but there's still a long way to go.
She's not sure what to make of a waterhole.
And no idea how to get out of it.
As the herd moves deeper into the swamp, the young mother and her calf follow.
This is dangerous.
baby elephants can get fatally stuck in mud.
The mother's trying to help, but she's actually pushing her baby deeper into the mud.
The grandmother sees the problem.
She barges her daughter out of the way just in time.
Whether it's a baby elephant or a baby frog, a snow monkey or a gorilla,
they're all cared for by parents who do their best to keep them safe.
Too soon, childhood ends and they'll discover it's time to make their own way in the world.
The lifelong search for food begins.
Imagine trying to feed 10 million hungry mouths.
Well, that's the challenge facing the inhabitants of this underground city.
The city is surrounded by grassland.
Unfortunately its citizens, grass-cutter ants, can't actually eat grass.
Yet they collect every blade of grass they can, and they carry it all the way back to the colony.
And they do this all day.
Every day.
365 days a year.
So why are they doing it?
The answer lies deep underground.
They chop it up and feed it to a fungus that can eat grass.
And then they eat the fungus.
The anthill is a massive underground farm.
It's a perfect arrangement, except that the fungus produces so much carbon dioxide it poisons the air down here.
The ants have sorted that problem, too.
They've built specially designed ventilation shafts to keep their air clean.
They're farmers, architects and engineers.
Each individual ant has a brain the size of a pinhead.
but somehow, together, they have invented a solution to feeding themselves that we would be proud to match.
Sometimes in life, the best way is to follow your own path.
Choose food that no one else has a taste for.
Here's a lammergeier, a huge bearded vulture, scanning the ground for his next meal.
A lot of rival scavengers have beaten him to this carcass.
but a lammergeier is happy to miss out on the meat.
It's the bones he's after.
Why?
because inside, they are full of rich marrowfat.
The problem: how to get at it.
Here's how.
Now the juices in his stomach - as corrosive as battery acid - can get to work dissolving the bone.
Every young lammergeier wants to learn the trick.
It's not as easy as it looks.
And a beginner needs to be closely watched.
If at first you don't succeed... try... try... try again.
A unique and inventive way to get food.
One that lammergeiers have made their own.
For centuries, these rocks have been a special place for preparing food by a really clever animal.
ln fact it's so clever it's changed the way we think about animals and even about ourselves.
These caves are home to a monkey:
the brown tufted capuchin.
Capuchins love palm nuts.
The problem is they're incredibly tough to crack, even harder than bone.
An old hand knows that first a nut should be peeled.
Then given a week or so drying in the sun.
Here's some he prepared earlier.
Long ago, these clever capuchins worked out that this is what they needed to finish the job.
Now the final step.
We used to think only humans were clever enough to use tools like this.
Youngsters watch and imitate their elders, just as human toddlers do.
They learn very early that to do a job properly, you've gotta have the right tool.
It takes 8 years to become a master nutcracker.
ln many parts of the world, you need more than just skill.
You need courage to find food.
A couple of weeks ago, this ibex gave birth to her kids at the top of this cliff, out of the reach of predators.
Now they need food and water.
And that is down in the valley.
Getting there is going to be tough.
Trailing behind, this little one is almost down, when she runs right into trouble.
The kid has never seen a fox before but she knows she must run for her life.
One wrong turn, one hesitation and the ibex's short life will be over.
The kid has the good sense to make for a place where only an ibex could stand.
Today the little kid made all the right choices... and the fox goes home hungry.
So being a hunter isn't always easy.
You have to be at the top of your game to survive.
A praying mantis.
Sharp-eyed and lightning quick.
A perfect hunter.
And a cricket, a perfect meal.
but he's outgunned by something even more deadly:
a chameleon.
She can camouflage her skin to melt into the background.
She can move her eyes independently to lock on to her target.
Her tongue is a guided missile, striking her victims at 50 feet a second.
And it comes totally out of the blue.
Delicious.
You don't have to work alone.
You can be part of a team.
Get it right and it can totally change your life.
ln this corner of Africa, things are changing.
Fast.
Cheetahs hunt alone.
They're very fast, but not strong enough to take down a big animal.
And the zebra know it.
but this cheetah is different.
He doesn't hunt alone.
He's joined forces with not just 1, but his 2 brothers.
As fast as ever, and now 3 times as strong.
They're turning their sights on much bigger prey.
An ostrich knows a lone cheetah is too small and weak to worry about.
but these brothers have changed the rules.
The female is slow to react and the cheetahs switch target.
These brothers have figured out how successful a team can be.
Strange circular scars on the sea floor are the mark of a spectacularly successful team.
Cunning, coordinated and creative.
These dolphins have worked out that fish out of water are much easier to catch.
by beating her tail down hard, this bottlenose dolphin stirs up the seabed.
And by swimming in a circle, she creates a ring of mushrooming mud around a shoal of fish.
A fishing net... made of mud.
As the net pulls tighter and tighter, the fish are trapped, till there's only one way out... straight into the mouths of the waiting dolphins.
What can you do if you're a hunter that doesn't move, can't move?
There's only one option:
lure your victim in.
The Venus flytrap does just that:
making itself irresistible, oozing sugary nectar around the brim of each leaf.
bait for hungry visitors.
The triggers, fine hairs, which only work when 2 of them are touched within 20 seconds.
One two.
Once the plant has digested the fly, the trap reopens and resets itself, ready for its next meal.
It works brilliantly, except... if it eats all the visiting flies, there'll be nobody left to pollinate its flowers.
No baby flytraps next year.
So it sends up its flowers on stems a foot long, well away from the traps below.
Up here, flies can safely graze on nectar.
ln return, they fertilize the flowers.
Down below, business as usual.
When it comes to the truly ruthless pursuit of prey... there is one hunter you don't want to meet.
The Komodo dragon, the biggest lizard on the planet.
10-feet long and weighing 300 pounds.
It's the height of the dry season.
Perfect times for a dragon.
ln the pitiless heat, buffalo concentrate at the shrinking waterholes.
The dragon is wary of getting too close.
A jab from those horns, even a kick from those legs could badly injure him.
He knows all he needs is just one bite.
It's just a nip, a flesh wound, but it alerts the other dragons close-by.
Like sharks, they're attracted by blood.
They gather round and watch the buffalo's every move... for days.
The wound doesn't heal.
This is the Komodo dragon's secret weapon.
lts bite injected a poisonous cocktail of bacteria and venom.
As days turn into weeks, the buffalo weakens.
And the dragons wait.
That's all they have to do.
Just bear the hunger, watch, and wait for the poison to take effect.
The buffalo died in the night.
The dragons can eat almost their own body weight in one meal.
They strip the buffalo to the bone in under 3 hours.
Hunters.
Resourceful, imaginative, determined.
They seem to hold all the aces.
So what can you do if you're the one being hunted?
beneath this tree lives a tiny creature called a sengi.
And she has a plan.
One needing speed, agility, and a very good memory.
She's cleared an intricate network of trails all around her territory.
And she's memorized every twist and turn of this maze.
And here's why.
The monitor lizard is very fast in short bursts.
but she's the one with the agility to take the tight corners.
She's not only outrun the lizard, she's outwitted him.
Home safe, in time to suckle her baby.
Her escape plan has kept them both alive.
For every hunter who thinks he's invincible, there's an escape artist to gladden your heart.
Meet the pebble toad.
And his sworn enemy, the toad-eating tarantula.
The pebble toad has no armour.
He crawls very slowly... and hopping is quite beyond him.
On the face of it, no contest.
but he's not called a pebble toad for nothing.
He rolls like a pebble and he bounces like a pebble... right out of danger.
Now meet the Jesus Christ lizard.
He may look relaxed, but he's actually about to do something quite miraculous.
That hunter's too close.
Time to go.
We'd have to run at more than 65 miles an hour to do this.
He's got a talent for walking on water and a name to match.
There are places where there's simply nowhere to run.
Then your best chance is to hide in a crowd.
Each individual fish joins the shoal to save its own skin, but the synchronized flash of silver makes it hard for the hunter to pick out a victim.
Unfortunately, a crowd attracts attention.
And the fish find themselves at the centre of a feeding frenzy.
A shoal reduced to a few survivors, this time by calm, surgical precision.
Sailfish combine speed with skilful swordplay to pick off one fish after another.
So is there anywhere to escape?
Fish... that fly.
Escaping the clutches of a hunter is not just about self-preservation.
Often there is even more at stake.
Red-billed tropicbirds coming home from a fishing trip.
Frigate birds patrolling offshore.
Waiting.
They don't want to kill him;
they want to steal his fish.
It's easier than catching their own.
Another ambush.
There goes the fish.
Another victory for the robbers.
It's nesting time here in Tobago and this chick is hungry.
lts father has yet to battle his way through.
Frigate birds are faster, but tropicbirds are quicker on the turn.
He didn't fight off his attackers to feed himself.
He did it for his chick.
because nothing is more important to him than family.
It's tempting to think that the story of life is just about survival, staying alive,
but living here is an animal who turns that idea on its head because in life, there is one greater purpose, one greater goal.
This giant octopus is looking for a new home.
It has to be just right.
She's planning on raising a family, and living there for the rest of her life.
These translucent curtains of eggs are her first brood.
Her only brood.
A giant octopus has only one chance to be a mother.
For 6 long months, she dare not leave her eggs unprotected for a moment.
Not even to feed.
She's prepared to starve herself to death... for the sake of her young.
She softly blows water over her eggs to encourage them to hatch.
As her life ebbs away, she sees her babies born into the world.
They mean so much to her she's willing to die for them.
but she lives on, in her children and in the generations to come.
To raise that next generation, we all dream of finding the perfect partner, the love of our life.
It's why, every spring, these beautiful birds fly north to find each other again after a long, lonely winter apart.
To celebrate their reunion, the male gives her the most romantic gift he can.
A fish.
but the female still wants to test her partner's true commitment, so she invites him to join her in a dance.
This stag beetle is in search of his perfect mate, and he thinks he's going to find her at the top of this tree.
And sure enough here she is, waiting.
but the love life of a beetle is never that simple.
Those aren't horns on his head.
They're jaws.
The male Darwin's beetle has some of the biggest jaws in nature... for fighting rivals.
The bigger the jaws, the better the fighter.
Just as well that armour's tough.
A second rival.
And another.
One more.
And yet another.
Here she is at last.
After all he's been through, she doesn't seem that impressed.
Unfortunately for her, the hurling habit dies hard.
When it comes to winning a mate, males may think they call the shots, but often it's the females that do the choosing.
This is a female humpback whale and she's ready to mate.
As well as making a scene, she's releasing her scent into the water, attracting males from far and wide.
but the minute they turn up, she swims away, enticing her suitors to chase her.
They challenge for the one position that counts:
to swim right behind her.
They're doing exactly what she wants.
She wants them to fight.
40-ton males lash out at each other.
It's an epic battle where there can only be one winner.
Only when the female is sure that the strongest male has won will she allow him to take his place at her side to be her mate.
A year later, she comes back to Tonga with her perfect newborn calf.
Her whole story, her whole life has brought her to this moment.
Every living thing on our planet shares the same desire:
not just to live, but to foster new life.
And we're no different.
We see so much of us in them... and them in us.
Whether it's intelligence or ingenuity strength, grace or determination.
Courage... even love.
Their lives... our lives... all life on Earth will be richer if we choose to remember everything we have in common.
To remember we share one planet... one future.
BBC_One_Life Trancelated , Re-Sync Edit Ruvini_Chandima_Jeewanthi
A universe of stars shines down on one special planet.
Our planet.
Our home.
The only planet we know that has life.
Life began when the Earth was young and it started small... when one tiny molecule managed to make a copy of itself.
Since then... since that magical moment... life has swept across the globe... filling every corner of our world.
Today there are some 5 million different species on the planet.
5 million different ways of staying alive.
This is a story that connects us all.
It's a story of hope and of triumph.
A story of our journey through life.
Every life begins with a birth.
And every mother must choose where her baby's life begins.
A Weddell seal has come to this desert of snow and ice to have her pup.
The pup is only a few hours old and is helpless.
He is entirely dependent on his mother.
It may be spring, but the temperature can still drop to minus 20 degrees and winds of 70 miles an hour roar across the ice.
All his mother can do is try to shelter him with her own body.
Trust that she can keep her infant alive.
So why has she chosen here, of all places, to have her pup?
It's because here, they're safe from their enemies.
ln the middle of this vast frozen sea, no predator can reach her or her baby.
but there's no food here.
So the mother keeps this ice hole open, the only route to her hunting ground.
And it must become his hunting ground, too.
She has to persuade him into the water.
He's not keen.
And who can blame him?
but he soon discovers this is where he was born to be.
Now, life's adventure can begin.
Wherever you look in the world, so much of growing up depends on the skill and determination of your parents.
These snow monkeys live in a volcanic mountain range in the cold North.
They have wonderfully thick furry coats, but they still feel the cold.
And the winter here is hard on the little ones.
Some snow monkeys have discovered there is a better way.
Steamy hot thermal springs.
These resourceful mothers bring their babies here to escape the worst of the winter in a long warm bath.
ln here, the water is a delightful 100 degrees.
So why aren't all the monkeys in the pool?
Well, it's a privilege which is jealously guarded.
Inside the pool, a royal family.
A queen and a ruling dynasty of snow monkeys.
Outside the pool... everyone else.
The youngest princess can luxuriate because she has an extended family determined to give her the best in life.
Not everyone has the advantage of such a supportive family.
Some have to depend on a dedicated single mother.
And here she is.
A strawberry poison arrow frog no bigger than your fingernail.

She has to leave him because she still has 4 more tadpoles waiting on the forest floor, and each must be carried up to its own private nursery.
There's nothing to eat in these pools, so she feeds each tadpole with one of her own unfertilized eggs.
A single egg won't sustain a hungry tadpole for long, so every few days, she has to climb back up to each youngster... and do it all over again.
One day, this fine young frog emerges from his pool, and leaves his devoted mother behind.

One needing speed, agility, and a very good memory.
She's cleared an intricate network of trails all around her territory.
And she's memorized every twist and turn of this maze.
And here's why.
(dramatic music)
The monitor lizard is very fast in short bursts.
but she's the one with the agility to take the tight corners.
(dramatic music)
And she makes the most of home advantage.
She's not only outrun the lizard, she's outwitted him.
(insects buzzing)
Home safe, in time to suckle her baby.
Her escape plan has kept them both alive.
For every hunter who thinks he's invincible, there's an escape artist to gladden your heart.
(soft music)
Meet the pebble toad.
And his sworn enemy, the toad-eating tarantula.
The pebble toad has no armour.
He crawls very slowly... and hopping is quite beyond him.
On the face of it, no contest.
(gulping) but he's not called a pebble toad for nothing.
(dramatic music)
He rolls like a pebble and he bounces like a pebble... right out of danger.
(birds chirping)
Now meet the Jesus Christ lizard.
He may look relaxed, but he's actually about to do something quite miraculous.
(squawking)
That hunter's too close.
Time to go.
(rhythmic music)
(soft music)
We'd have to run at more than 65 miles an hour to do this.
He's got a talent for walking on water and a name to match.
(joyful music)
There are places where there's simply nowhere to run.
Then your best chance is to hide in a crowd.
Each individual fish joins the shoal to save its own skin, but the synchronized flash of silver makes it hard for the hunter to pick out a victim.
(joyful music)
(squawking)
Unfortunately, a crowd attracts attention.
And the fish find themselves at the centre of a feeding frenzy.
(dramatic music)
A shoal reduced to a few survivors, this time by calm, surgical precision.
Sailfish combine speed with skilful swordplay to pick off one fish after another.
So is there anywhere to escape?
(epic music)
Fish... that fly.
Escaping the clutches of a hunter is not just about self-preservation.
Often there is even more at stake.
(dramatic music)
Red-billed tropicbirds coming home from a fishing trip.
(squawking)
Frigate birds patrolling offshore.
Waiting.
They don't want to kill him;
they want to steal his fish.
It's easier than catching their own.
Another ambush.
(squawking)
There goes the fish.
Another victory for the robbers.
It's nesting time here in Tobago and this chick is hungry.
lts father has yet to battle his way through.
(dramatic music)
Frigate birds are faster, but tropicbirds are quicker on the turn.
(squawking)
(chirping)
He didn't fight off his attackers to feed himself.
He did it for his chick.
(chirping)
because nothing is more important to him than family.
It's tempting to think that the story of life is just about survival, staying alive,
but living here is an animal who turns that idea on its head because in life, there is one greater purpose, one greater goal.
(breathing)
This giant octopus is looking for a new home.
(breathing)
It has to be just right.
She's planning on raising a family, and living there for the rest of her life.
(breathing)
These translucent curtains of eggs are her first brood.
Her only brood.
A giant octopus has only one chance to be a mother.
For 6 long months, she dare not leave her eggs unprotected for a moment.
Not even to feed.
She's prepared to starve herself to death... for the sake of her young.
(soft music)
She softly blows water over her eggs to encourage them to hatch.
As her life ebbs away, she sees her babies born into the world.
They mean so much to her she's willing to die for them.
but she lives on, in her children and in the generations to come.
(birds chirping)
(soft music)
To raise that next generation, we all dream of finding the perfect partner, the love of our life.
It's why, every spring, these beautiful birds fly north to find each other again after a long, lonely winter apart.
To celebrate their reunion, the male gives her the most romantic gift he can.
A fish.
but the female still wants to test her partner's true commitment, so she invites him to join her in a dance.
(soft music)
(splashing)
(birds chirping)
This stag beetle is in search of his perfect mate, and he thinks he's going to find her at the top of this tree.
And sure enough here she is, waiting.
but the love life of a beetle is never that simple.
Those aren't horns on his head.
They're jaws.
The male Darwin's beetle has some of the biggest jaws in nature... for fighting rivals.
(squeaking)
The bigger the jaws, the better the fighter.
Just as well that armour's tough.
(amusing music)
A second rival.
And another.
One more.
And yet another.
Here she is at last.
After all he's been through, she doesn't seem that impressed.
(amusing music)
Unfortunately for her, the hurling habit dies hard.
(squeaking)
When it comes to winning a mate, males may think they call the shots, but often it's the females that do the choosing.
This is a female humpback whale and she's ready to mate.
As well as making a scene, she's releasing her scent into the water, attracting males from far and wide.
(whale singing)
but the minute they turn up, she swims away, enticing her suitors to chase her.
They challenge for the one position that counts:
to swim right behind her.
They're doing exactly what she wants.
She wants them to fight.
(whales singing)
(epic music)
40-ton males lash out at each other.
It's an epic battle where there can only be one winner.
(dramatic music)
Only when the female is sure that the strongest male has won will she allow him to take his place at her side to be her mate.
(whales singing)
(whale singing)
A year later, she comes back to Tonga with her perfect newborn calf.
Her whole story, her whole life has brought her to this moment.
Every living thing on our planet shares the same desire:
not just to live, but to foster new life.
And we're no different.
(soft music)
We see so much of us in them... and them in us.
Whether it's intelligence or ingenuity strength, grace or determination.
Courage... even love.
Their lives... our lives... all life on Earth will be richer if we choose to remember everything we have in common.
To remember we share one planet... one future.

Am I good?
Is it clear?
I can't tell.
I'm clear.
not clear.
- Oh!
What's that idiot doing in my blind spot?
Everyone's in your blind spot.
This car is nothing but blind spots.
- It's not a car.
It's a parade float.
Now am I clear?
- I don't know.
All I see is a giant foot.
- It's not a giant foot.
It's a giant flipper.
That's it.
I'm going for it.
- Great.
Now we have to go to the car wash.
- Oh, no.
I'm getting out here.
What are you, crazy?
You're on the side of a freeway!
It's dangerous!
- Not as dangerous as riding in that thing.
Suit yourself.
Am I clear?
I'm going for it!
Look!
There goes our car.
Is that a parade float?
It's not a parade float.
It's my parade float.
- Is it made out of paper mâché?
Papier-mâché, yes.
- What will happen when it gets wet?
It's going to get wet?
Turn off the water!
Turn off the water!
Turn off the water!
Turn off the water!
Turn off the water!
Aah!
Eek!
Ooh!
My eye!
My eye!
Oh, my eye!
- Daffy?
Don't move!
I'm getting the first aid kit!
- Oh, no!
Let me see your eye!
It's all that's left--
My beautiful parade float is gone!
We--we never even got to be in a parade!
You going to be ok?
He'll be ok.
Probably just needs a little time.
Maybe that's enough time.
Daffy?
Bugs!
I knew it!
I knew you'd come through for me.
I knew if I stayed in here long enough
And sobbed loud enough,
You'd make me another parade float.
It wasn't easy.
There were days when I wanted to give up,
When I wanted to come out of my room, maybe take a shower.
But I persevered.
I stayed in my room,
And I sobbed even louder,
Because I knew that you needed that time and that motivation,
And I was right.
Thank you, brother.
So, where is it?
Where's my new, beautiful parade float?
- I didn't make you a parade float.
- I'm fine.
I'm disappointed, but I'm fine.
- Why can't you just drive a normal car?
- Normal cars are for normal people.
I'm not normal!
I'll give you that.
You're my best friend.
You know me better than anyone.
You see what a horrible person I am.
That's why I have to drive a parade float--
To distract the rest of the world from seeing it!
- You're going to need something better than a parade float.
Better than a parade float?
Better than a parade float...
I'll take it.
Not since my parade float
Have I felt that a vehicle so expressed my essence.
How much?
375,000.
- Dollars?
- Yes.
American dollars?
- I'm not giving you $375,000 for a yacht.
But you're my best friend.
That's what best friends do.
No, they don't.
- Fair enough.
Will you give me $375,000,
Which I will donate to the charity of my choice?
- Daffy, no one's going to give you $375,000.
- of course I'll give you $375,000.
- I knew I could count on you, Porky.
- You poor thing.
I didn't even know you were sick.
But when's the operation?
- Tonight, so let's wrap this up.
- Can I ask why you didn't go to Bugs for the money?
- Because you're my best friend.
I know that I can ask you for anything,
Just as you know that you can ask me for anything.
- Could you turn on that lamp for me?
I can't see the combination.
Do it yourself.
Here you go.
This is only $350,000.
But it's all I have.
- Porky, you are making this very hard for me.
Do you think I like having to come to my best friend for money?
Can you imagine what this is like for me,
How awkward this is?
What's that in the back of the safe?
A gold watch?
- But that was my great-grandfather's.
- "randall pig"?
It's engraved?
That's going to kill its resale value.
I'm going to need more than this.
Give me your debit card.
- But that's the money I live on.
- Porky, I can't sit here and argue with you.
The surgery's, like, in 10 minutes.
- You're right.
Take the debit card.
"take the debit card" what?
- Take the debit card, please?
- Fine.
As a favor to you, I'll take the debit card.
What is this, wool?
All right.
I guess I'll take the coat, too.
Maybe I can get a couple of bits for this.
feel better!
Wait a second.
Now, how am I going to live?
Whoo-hoo!
I'm free!
I've never felt so alive!
The high seas, the wind in my hair,
The salt on my skin!
I am a sailor!
I am sailing!
What an unbelievable rush!
Whoo-hoo!
Porky?
What are you doing?
Eating garbage.
- Is that something you've always done,
Or is that a new thing?
- Are you going to finish that?
- I tried calling you, but your phone's been disconnected.
Why is it so dark in here, and cold?
- I couldn't pay my bills.
- Why not?
I gave all my money to Daffy.
- Why would you give all your money to Daffy?
- For his kidney transplant.
Do you know how he's doing?
Let's go find out.
Ahh.
I should have bought a yacht with Porky's money years ago.
Nice boat.
- She's a real beauty, isn't she?
The Queen of the Ocean.
That's why I named her that.
A fitting name for the successor to my parade float.
Which,y the way, which was also named "Queen of the Ocean."
- How's the kidney?
- Kidney?
Oh, I just told Porky that so he'd give me the money for the yacht.
Mmm.
Good shrimp.

Yeow!
Ooh... wait!
That's a Tiffany lamp.
- that you bought with my money!
Aah!
How could you lie to me?
- I'm sorry.
I thought if I told you what the money was for,
You wouldn't give it to me.
I wouldn't have!
You just proved my point.
How am I the bad guy here?
Ok.
I've had enough.
Well, maybe just one more.
All right.
Break it up.
- Here's what we're going to do.
Daffy, you're going to sell this thing
And give Porky his money back.
- Are you crazy?
I already lost my parade float!
I'm not about to lose my yacht.
- Well, you're about to lose a friend.
- Yeah, but those are easy to get when you have a yacht.
Uh, guys?
Where's the dock?
But that's impossible.
I tied a shank knot to this cleat,
Tied a sheepshead knot here,
A double rolling hitch here,
A simple, yet elegant bow here.
And a square knot here.
- Uh-huh.
And what kind of knot did you tie to the dock?
what are we going to do?
We're stranded in the middle of the ocean!
I always knew I'd die this way!
- All right.
Let's not panic.
We'll just put up the sail and sail back.
Where's the sail?
I didn't get one.
What?
I didn't have enough money.
I was forced to choose between a sail
And this jacuzzi.
So if anyone's to blame, it's Porky.
- I gave you everything I had.
I'm completely broke!
- The fact that you're not more financially successful is not my fault.
- What?
Is it me?
It's him, right?
- We'll just radio the coast guard for help.
- Nope.
No radio.
- What?
There wasn't enough money,
Not after I got the second jacuzzi.
I have an idea.
Let's all take a long, hot soak in the jacuzzi.
It will relax us, which will allow us
To think of a way out of our predicament.
I'll take the master jacuzzi.
You two take that one.
Ha.
Ah!
Ooh!
Ahh.
Ahh.
I think I have our answer.
Porky should swim back and get help.
Off you go, Porky.
- Hey, what are you doing?
Stop!
What do you think you're doing?
No one's swimming anywhere.
We're sailing back.
Where'd you get a sail?
It's your bedsheets.
- What?
Those are 1,500 thread count egyptian cotton!
Do you know how much these sheets cost?
More than lifejackets!
That's why there are no lifejackets on board!
Well, that, and they make you look stupid.
Aah!
- He's unconscious!
What should we do?
- Psst.
Porky.
Untie me.
- I can't.
I'm under direct orders not to.
- You know, Porky, being out here in the middle of the ocean
Has really made me reevaluate some things.
I see now that it's not money or things that matter.
It's friends-- best friends.
And you, Porky Pig, you are my best friend.
Do you really mean it?
Have you ever known me to lie?
- Yes.
You lied about needing a kidney transplant.
That's in the past.
Now, please, untie me
So I can give my best friend a great big hug.
You won't regret this.
now, go swim and get help.
Aah!
Porky!
- Well, I guess it's just me now,
All alone on a yacht,
Stranded in the middle of the ocean
With no lifejackets and no idea how to sail.
Bugs!
Porky!
Wait for me!
hmm.
These are coming with me.
Mmm.
It's like being caressed by an angel.
I regret nothing!
Except not buying those life jackets!
It was a dream.
It was all a dream.
That explains why I was such a horrible person
And did all those horrible things.
Ehh...
Not a dream.
You are a horrible person,
And you did do those horrible things.
Then what happened?
- We were picked up by a passing ship.
You nearly drowned in your stupid bedsheets.
- What about "The Queen of the Ocean"?
Did she survive?
- Yeah.
It was towed back to shore.
oh, thank goodness!
It is things that matter!
This proves it!
- We sold it and got Porky's money back.
Ohh!
- I have good news and bad news.
The good news is there's no complications from the near drowning.
The bad news is we ran some tests,
And it looks like you're going to need...
A kidney transplant.
- Huh.
Ironic.
How much does one of those cost?
I don't know.
About $375,000.
But I'm sure you have insurance.
Well, I may not have insurance,
But at least I have a best friend.
Right, Bugs and/or Porky?
- I see you've decided to rebuild your parade float.
- Well, I couldn't ask my best friend to do it,
Not after you paid for my kidney transplant.
Don't mention it.
Shame they couldn't also throw in a brain transplant.
I won't forget this!
It was a tremendous act of generosity,
And I shall forever be in your debt.
- uh, Daffy, can I take a break?
I'm still not feeling 100% since the surgery.
Oh, here we go.
How many times are you going to throw it in my face
That you gave me your kidney?
You still have the other one!
- I got to get a new best friend.
We're not coming back here again, are we?
I'll show you retaliation.
Spirit, I command you leave here.
No, no!
- Christ compels you.
- No!
Please!
No, I'm not ready!
No, no, Annie.
No!
No!
No!
I don't know what we're waiting for to happen.
Don't forget me, will you?
I have to go.
What do we do?
We're going to get her back.
So she dies, and six months later, he dies.
That's Catholics for you.
So it goes to the son.
I says to him, "You want to get rid."
He fancies himself as a landlord now.
I says, "You've been watching too much Property Ladder."
He just shrugs and scratches himself with his keys.
So, um, it was, um, it was a bed and breakfast?
I saw their ad in the free paper.
"A slice of heaven in Barry."
I bet heaven doesn't have chemical toilets.
- So, it's the three of you, is it?
- A friend will be joining us.
Well, that's...
Yeah, we hope so.
It's... it's not definite.
No, no, she should be here pretty soon.
I don't know what's taking her so long.
Do what you want, as long as the rent's covered.
We've been trying to shift this place for months.
I reckon it's haunted.
No, there's nothing here.
Do you know what really, really excited us?
It was the, um...
It was the basement gym.
- Oh, yeah.
- See, she's excited.
Could we...
Could we have a have a look?
Depends on how good you are at handling disappointment.
Come on.
I'll just go this way.
Basil!
Four weeks since the attack in Box Tunnel that left 20 people dead, and the police have yet to make an arrest.
However...
Mitchell?
Mitchell?
Can you hear me?
- Annie!
- Help, Mitchell, I'm so scared.
Oh, my God, can you see me?
Are you OK?
Oh, God, Annie...
I think "gym" was more a statement of intent.
Is it sound?
Is it soundproof?
Is it soundproof?
It's just, um, I can get pretty... when I'm, um, working out.
"Feel the burn!" "Who's your daddy?"
- "Say what you see."
- Oh, God.
Do you want me to get his nibs from upstairs?
Oh, no, you're fine, we're cool.
They're looking at it now.
I don't know, English or something.
Working at the hospital, apparently.
Isn't it brilliant?
We can transform in here.
Not at the same time, obviously, but you can have it for the full moon tomorrow.
I thought we were transforming in the country.
Yeah, at a last resort.
We don't know the area.
We'd have to find two separate places, miles apart.
No, this is ideal.
I thought this is what you wanted - a place of our own.
Yeah, but it isn't, is it?
It's you, me and Count Dupree upstairs.
He saved our lives.
He's changed.
Something's...
Something's happened to him.
You must have noticed.
We've lost Annie, we're all over the place.
They call this the waiting room.
We wait here until... they know where they want us to go.
Have they told you where?
They're going to build a special room, just for me...
They're going to lock the door and they're going to burn the key.
- What... what does that mean?
- It's hell, Mitchell.
They're going to take me to hell.
Annie, Annie, listen to me.
I'm coming to get you.
- We just need to find out what...
- Ta-ra now.
I know.
There's tit-all on, these days.
Thank God for Terry Pratchett is all I'm saying.
Annie was there.
She was on the screen.
- What?
You're kidding.
- Is she OK?
What did she say?
We're running out of time.
Um...
It's... it's our friend.
She's... she's in...
Midsomer Murders.
OK, look.
I've had a powwow with my boss, and how's this?
Sign now and we'll give the place a spruce.
Lose the swirly carpet, get some stripped floorboards, blinds and stuff.
Make it look all catalogue-y.
OK, how long will that take?
Two weeks, tops.
I know a couple of Polish fellas.
Peasant stock.
Very driven.
- OK, right.
No, we want to move in now.
- Really?
- Please, can we?
- Mitchell?
Yeah, whatever.
But it's...
Well, look at it!
It's fine.
We wouldn't want to change a thing, would we?
We...
We just can't wait to start... um... our Hawaiian dream.
- And he's a werewolf?
- Benicio Del something.
He's a Spanish actor.
The special effects are amazing, Dad.
I've seen the pictures.
Anyway, there's an 11 am screening for OAPs.
I thought you'd feel at home.
Ah...
I don't know.
Makes it seem trivial.
You liked The English Patient.
Because there weren't any werewolves in The English Patient.
It had elegance.
Is there nudity?
We shouldn't go if there's nudity.
- In The Wolfman, Dad?
- Hmm.
I doubt it.
There's a lady on the poster, but she's wearing a blouse.
Ah, we can't afford two tickets.
I'll sneak you in through the fire exit.
We'd do that when I was a kid.
Fine.
But I want you to have a nap afterwards.
And a proper lunch.
Big day tomorrow.
Where are you going?
Bit of window shopping.
You know that funfair we passed?
It's closed down.
There might be copper wire in there.
- Iron, maybe.
Stuff we can sell.
- You want me to cause a distraction?
Tom, these people, they work for a living.
Cheers, Dad.
They're really going to show The Wolfman to a load of OAPs?
Mm-hm.
Even old people are weird now.
Hang about, here he comes.
That's him.
Yeah, that's got to be him, man.
Let's roll.
Ow-wooo!
Come on, doggy!
Where's the other one?
Look... we heard there was two of you... so... where... is... he?
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
What do you think?
Mmm?
I had a little left over from the food shop, and I thought it might be nice to have something for, you know, us.
Hence...... and hence...
It was either that or off-peak gym membership.
You made absolutely the right decision.
- Really?
- Mmm.
- Ow!
- What?
What?
What is that?
- Oh.
- Pen.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Ow!
Hair stuck, glasses!
- Oh, is it?
Oh.
Oh, shit, sorry.
Oh, hang on, it's really tangled.
- George!
Ee, ah!
- It's really tangled.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Sssh, don't pull away.
- Quickly!
- OK!
- Ohh!
- You all right?
- Yeah, fine.
Right, where were we?
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Have you got a radio?
- What?
!
- I need a radio.
I have an idea.
- Mitchell.
- Ow!
- Ow!
Mitchell.
What are you doing?
!
Cheers.
Just give me a bloody kiss.
- Oh, look, forget about it.
- He's just ruined everything.
Fine!
Another night.
Come on, Annie, come on.
Sean Hancock.
Diagnosed a year ago with malignant melanoma.
Secondaries in the brain and lung.
He's on a morphine infusion and maintenance fluids, but his condition's deteriorating rapidly.
- We're talking hours now.
- Wait a sec...
You're doing this now?
It's a full moon, we've just moved into a new house.
There's enough going on without you crossing over into the afterlife.
We could be waiting weeks for another opportunity like this.
There could be consequences.
I don't care.
She's our friend and we lost her.
- I don't want to lose you as well!
- I am doing this.
I'll take everything they've got.
Death, God, the Devil - none of it frightens me!
Right, well, I feel totally reassured
Look, we all saw Annie on that screen, we saw how terrified she is, and this is the only idea we've got.
- Thank you.
- But I want one of us in there with you.
What?
!
Death is a personal, private moment and we're gate-crashing.
I want that man treated with dignity and kindness.
# Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad... #
What's that you're doing?
- It's a prayer.
It's Jewish.
- Yeah...
I'm not great with religious rituals.
Aw.
Tough
- # Shema... #
- Is he even Jewish?
It doesn't matter.
His body's let him down, medicine's let him down.
- It's a gesture of sympathy.
- I'm trying to get in the zone here.
I refer you to my earlier statement of "tough".
# Shema Yisrael... #
I can't remember the rest.
Five letters.
Something, A, something, something, something.
The clue is just the letters H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O.
Mitchell!
The answer's "water".
Yes, it's the letters H to O.
H2O - it's the molecular formula for water.
Get in.
OK, give me another one.
Is that it?
Is he dead now?
That's me!
Shit, I look awful!
Sean, isn't it?
Sean, you've been very ill.
I'm so sorry, but I'm afraid you've just died.
- What happens now?
- You're going on a journey.
No, it's OK, it's cool.
I'm coming with you.
Are you...
Death?
No!
No, I'm not Death.
Sean...
- Hi.
- This is John.
He's going to make sure you get there safely.
What's that?
That's for you.
That's what happens next.
OK, boys, let's get going.
Oh, yeah, you need to get it.
When you're ready...
Take your time.
Goodbye, Sean.
Is this it?
Is it all over now?
Yeah.
You did good, Sean.
You can rest now.
None of this was your fault.
Anything that happened would have happened a lot sooner and a lot worse if I hadn't had met you.
Just come back.
Mitchell, isn't it?
I'm Lia.
How's it going?
- Where's the guy I was with?
- Sean?
Well, I don't know.
He'll have his own stuff to do.
- You're my guide, then?
- Yes.
What's got two thumbs and just lucked out?
Hello!
No, I've always been lucky.
You should rub me.
I'm serious.
Rub me.
Do you know who I am...
Lia?
Well, I know you're a vampire.
Can I say that?
Or are you funny about the word?
Because I've got this cousin who's in a wheelchair and I called him disabled once - he ran over my foot!
What else?
Just that you're... really hot.
Have we met... before?
H12.
H12?
What does that mean?
It's a riddle.
I love riddles, don't you?
Like the one about the midget.
So there's this midget who gets into a lift and...
I've just given away the answer.
Am I rambling?
So this is purgatory.
I remember this.
Well, strictly speaking, it's your purgatory.
We've all got a corridor, filled with all the good things and the bad, and...
Well, you've been busy.
So... we choose a door?
Do we?
I'm asking you.
Yes.
It's like a quiz show.
And tonight's star prize - someone's soul.
Frickin' weird quiz show.
After you.
And just so you know, I will be looking at your arse.
- Why are we here?
- I don't even know where here is.
France.
July 17th, 1917.
Who's the guy?
Corporal Arthur Hanley.
Don't drink that.
- I wasn't going to.
- It's poisoned.
I wasn't going to.
Poisoned?
I didn't want him to feel any pain.
You killed him?
Shit!
So you've been a vampire since... well, since before my dad was born.
What are you doing?
Look, Annie isn't here.
This is a waste of time.
Well, we must be here for a reason.
Maybe we're meant to find a clue, or something.
Who was he?
Mitchell!
Tell me about the guy.
He was my first.
I was recruited by the vampires about four weeks earlier.
But I ran away...
found my regiment again.
I didn't want to believe what had happened to me.
But then the hunger came.
I'd steal from the medical supplies, a little bit every day.
When I had enough...
I slipped it into his tea...
Where are you now?
Running away.
That's my captain.
He thought I was deserting, but...
I was running to find Herrick.
I was one of them now.
How did it make you feel?
How do you think?
I killed my friend.
The shame of that.
The horror, knowing what I was now.
You know, it's funny, because most people would've walked into a minefield and found a way to end it all.
But you didn't.
And I think that's really brave.
Sorry - why didn't you do that?
I wasn't going to let it win.
Quite right!
I'm sure that's what Arthur would have wanted.
You running around with lots of girls and stuff for another century.
What?
Arthur wasn't the only victim, was he?
I don't understand.
You!
You numpty!
You're the other victim.
You had your humanity ripped away from you.
- Right.
Yeah, yeah.
- What did you think I meant?
Nothing.
I knew what you meant.
Actually...
I'm the victim.
A minute ago, you were in here wearing a uniform, and I missed it.
- Will you stop?
!
Mitchell?
Mitchell?
- Annie, I'm here.
- They're getting ready to move me.
They're taking me to the room.
Which room?
There are all these doors...
Which room, Annie?
There's going to be a parade.
They'll scatter ashes in front of me like petals, they said...
I'm coming to get you.
I swear, I'm on my way.
Annie?
They're coming.
They've got drums.
They're cheering.
- Annie!
- I can hear children cheering.
Must be a concept album.
Hey, look.
Come on.
Spit-spot.
What are you doing?
Why have you got a chicken on a string?
No, no, wait.
I want to talk to you!
Reason Is Treason)
# Here come the morning and I'll say goodbye
# But I don't turn around Cos the reason is treason
# Here come the morning and I'll say goodbye to you
# Here come the morning And I'll say goodbye
# But I don't turn around Cos the reason is treason... #
Ohhh!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy, soldier.
There was a young guy, he ran through here.
No need to panic, nothing happens till it gets dark.
Now, then, are you here to watch or play?
- Sorry?
Play?
Play what?
- See how the mood takes you.
My sciatica's back, so I'm just going to watch Sue and Peter in the Volvo, and touch myself.
Um, no, um...
Sorry, there was a young guy...
- Whoa, what's this?
...he just came through...
Listen, we don't do funny stuff here.
- You'll have to go to Swansea for that.
- Huh?
You'll catch on.
No, I like to think we're a friendly bunch.
We're on Myspace, and last year, all the fellas shaved their heads for Comic Relief.
So, that is Alan and Judith.
Now, Judith - and I hope she won't mind me telling you this... will give you a tit-wank you'll never forget!
Look, she's blushing.
Sorry, Ju, but credit where credit's due, eh, love?
You don't understand.
There was...
I want a young guy...
Oh, so men are your preferred brand?
Well, in that case, you'll be wanting lan in the people-carrier.
Now...
Don't move!
Just stop now.
We hadn't started!
- Please leave a message.
- Nina.
I've been arrested.
I don't know what to do.
I've been arrested!
Listen...
No, listen...
You have to let me go.
I have a very serious medical condition.
A medical condition, it's serious.
No!
Mitchell!
Tell me where Annie is.
You're supposed to be my fucking guide.
Take me to her now!
Oh, that's nice.
Toilet talk.
I'm missing Countryfile for this.
Is this a joke to you?
Jesus Christ!
There's no point, Mitchell, I'm already dead.
You'll get yourself all hot and sweaty for no...
Actually... try it.
Who are you?
- How do I know you?
- H12.
Why do you keep saying that?
We'd better make tracks.
Which door now for a Brucey Bonus?
I so should have worn a leotard.
OK.
That one.
- Oh, God.
- Where are we now?
Sheffield.
December 24th 1960.
This is ridiculous.
We're supposed to be finding Annie.
Well, maybe she's hiding.
Yoo-hoo!
- Annie!
- Don't go around there.
Oh.
I guess you ran out of poison.
What was her name?
S
- S-Sally.
We met in a pub, came back here.
We got pretty drunk.
- It was quite chaotic.
- Mitchell... it's very important that you tell me the truth.
When it got chaotic with Sally, were you topless?
I'm building up an image here that'll come in handy later, if you know what I'm saying!
I'm kidding, I'm kidding!
I'm not.
You know, I'm a bit confused.
With the soldier guy, you'd just become a vampire, so it was all new and overwhelming...
I was a victim.
Yes, you were a victim, we agreed on that.
But this is different somehow.
You screwed her, I'm guessing.
Then what did you use to kill her?
Oh, my God!
You used the pot of her little Christmas tree.
So that's what people mean when they say, "Christmas does my head in!"
- I was out of control.
- You were in control enough to have sex.
- The soldier guy?
- His name was Arthur.
Oh, sorry, sorry.
I should be a bit more respectful about the people you kill.
There was stuff in his room you could have taken - money - but you didn't.
- It was all about the hunger.
- What are you getting at?
Nothing.
I just think it's curious.
With Arthur, it was kind for him and torture for you.
But with Sally, there was drinks, there was sex...
Someone could look at this and think you enjoyed it.
Why are you bringing me to these places?
To punish me?
Is that it?
You chose the door.
Next time, pick one where you're building an orphanage on the other side.
It's a compulsion.
It was a compulsion.
- I am not that man any more.
- Brilliant!
Then there should be nothing stopping you from getting Annie back.
Mitchell!
Mitchell, please!
Mitchell, they're outside!
- Tell me where she is.
- You know what to do.
What are you?
!
Of course I don't!
What happens next is your choice.
Mitchell, they're coming for me now!
They're going to take me to the room.
Mitchell, please!
I'm frightened...
Coming?
Mitchell, please!
I'm so frightened.
Mitchell!
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Are you all in for a mauling?
Do the children of the night want to see a fight?
So, shall I introduce you to tonight's combatants?
Well, there ain't a lot I can tell you about our first noble warrior, on account of the fact we picked him up yesterday and he ain't said a fucking word since!
The silent-but-violent type, no doubt.
We're going to welcome him into our bosom, ain't we?
Treat him like a member of the family... our pet dog!
He's hairy.
Oh, he's scary.
The mute most hirsute.
The canine destined for the big time.
The creature who's pleased to meet ya!
Ladies and gentlemen... the Beast!
Who Let The Dogs Out?
)
And facing him tonight... plucked from the streets a mere two-and-a-half hours ago.
He don't know where he is, bless him.
The Children-of-Darwin's champion.
The man with the plan.
The spunky monkey.
Mr Paul Jameson.
I've a serious medical condition.
No, please!
No.
Please.
Please, please, please, please!
You have to let me out.
We'll be fine.
We hadn't even started.
It's a legal grey area.
You all right there, chum?
It's coming.
Oi, soon as he turns, stick him one right in the bollocks.
I've got money on you to live for two minutes.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
Uh, hello?
I think there's something wrong with this chap in here.
- Kill me.
- What did you say?
It's the only way you'll survive.
I'm not killing you!
Kill me or I will tear your fucking head off!
Sorry, miss, you shouldn't be down here.
Have you got someone in custody called George Sands?
Are you a friend of his?
As I said to the nine-year-old in reception, he's a patient of mine.
He has a serious medical condition and needs constant supervision and medication.
Did he tell you that he's got a medical condition?
Well, when we processed him, he might have mentioned something.
And you still brought him in.
You didn't think to contact the hospital or?
Oh, man, we're going to have fun with you.
We found him in a well-known dogging location.
That man has serious mental problems.
He's a...
He's... basically nuts, OK?
And it's, um...
It's... it's... contagious.
- Are you all right, miss?
- No, I am...
I am...
I am really annoyed.
Gareth, maybe we should...
sort of let this lady have him.
Yeah, I think that would be a good idea...
Get his belongings.
No!
No, this isn't anything to do with...
what was going on.
Listen!
Listen, I never...
He was on the floor!
Ah, come on!
Oh, good.
All right, George?
Right, let's get you ba-a-ack to the ward.
But don't think for a moment that you've heard the last of this.
Thank you.
Dogging?
You were caught dogging?
We need to find somewhere to transform.
I only got your message because I went upstairs to use the toilet.
No.
There's something down here.
- Well, you can transform in here.
- What will you do?
I don't know.
But we can't be together, we'll kill each other.
We haven't got a choice.
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry for all this.
I know.
We could have had the house redecorated after all.
Oh, shit, yes.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Four, three, two, one... full moon!
You don't have to do this.
You could go back to George and your old life and say you tried to get Annie back, but it was impossible.
They'll understand.
It was brave of you to even try.
No.
I need to do this.
OK, then.
End of the line.
I've got to say I was kind of hurt that you didn't recognise me, given you remembered so much about the other two.
I guess you were a bit preoccupied that night.
- What?
I didn't catch that.
- I'm sorry.
Oh, you're sorry?
I couldn't help it.
I was angry and...
- The hunger...
- Yeah, yeah.
No control.
It's a compulsion.
Blah, blah, blah.
Anyway, let me introduce you to the guys.
Your 12 good men and true.
Although there is 20 of us, and nine are women, but I'll crack on.
So this is Donna.
She was a primary school teacher.
All the kids in her class have been having nightmares since you killed her.
Some have even needed counselling.
Funny, isn't it - the ripples of your actions?
That's Glenn, the driver.
Your first victim.
Remember him?
Five kids - can you believe it?
And that's Mary.
She'd just recovered from breast cancer.
She was given a whole new lease of life, she was.
Until you tore her throat out, obviously.
Next to her is Dean...
Please... please stop.
I don't know what I can say.
Don't say anything.
Because every word that comes out of your mouth is a fucking excuse.
It's misdirection.
- I'm not trying to trick you.
- Not us.
- You're lying to yourself.
- I'm trying to change.
How's that working out for you?
- It wasn't just me, anyway.
It was Daisy.
- Oh, you're doing it again.
I was 22.
I had a peanut allergy.
I wanted to be a vet.
I had a little brother that I loved more than anything in the world.
Those are the things that make a human being.
Do you taste them in our blood?
The arrogance, to call yourself the victim!
- How dare you insult us like that!
- I didn't mean to insult you.
- You were flirting with me.
- I just wanted you to like me.
And there we have it!
You want forgiveness every day.
You get a smile from me, and it proves you're not completely evil.
You do a thousand small, nice things and you put them against the bad.
You actually do the sums in your head, don't you?
Why did you come here?
- For Annie, or for you?
- For Annie.
Crossing into purgatory - that's a big deposit in the good account.
No, I just want Annie back.
Which one of us does that wipe off the slate?
Donna?
Glenn?
Me?
None of you.
It...
- I don't know what you want me to do.
- I want you to stop hiding!
I'm not hiding.
"I'm a victim.
I'm better now.
Daisy made me do it."
- I'm not...
- You're not what?
I'm not a victim.
So you're what?
What?
Misunderstood?
I'm an animal!
I don't deserve mercy or forgiveness.
I'm a murderer.
I couldn't help myself.
I loved it.
The sensation, the power.
I was dead, but I'd never felt so alive.
I wasn't human any more.
I'd lost my conscience, I was free, and that's what I was addicted to.
I hacked my way through the world.
I left a trail of blood a thousand miles long.
And I loved it.
I'm a disease.
I'm a plague.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Budge up.
You can have Annie back.
But there's a price.
I'll stay.
I want you to take me to all my victims.
I want to feel it.
I want to suffer.
I don't want to hide any more.
I just want her back.
It's not that simple.
The time and cause of your death have already been set, but there are things that need to happen first.
You see, you're the final piece in someone else's story.
And they need to complete their journey, and in order to do that... they have to kill you.
What?
You're going to be killed by a werewolf.
A wolf-shaped bullet.
Bang.
Who?
- We'll see you soon, Mitchell.
- You're letting me go?
Well, as punishments go, it's pretty cruel and interesting, isn't it?
Loving that arse!
Oh, oh, oh!
- Hey, what's all this?
- Oh!
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
For a second I thought...
No.
It's OK, baby, we're OK.
- Ew!
- Ooh-hoo-hoo!
- Someone needs a tic tac.
- Wolf breath!
Ew!
Come on, let's get going.
When we transformed, did... did we?
Oh.
Nice.
Annie, isn't it?
I'm Lia.
Sorry about all this palaver.
It's been chaos here.
Lots of people turning up early, everyone's in a bit of a tizz.
You're going to take me to the room now?
Oh, the train station.
Oh, sorry!
This was for my three o'clock.
No, you're free to go.
- I...
I can go?
Really?
- Yeah.
You will still be dead.
I should make that clear.
Your body... you know...
It's been over two years, nobody really wants to see that.
And, um... will I come back here one day?
Well, we all end up here eventually.
The problem with you was, you came through the wrong door, but next time, you'll come through the right one, and it'll be Boggle and piña coladas 24/7.
Well, spit-spot.
Mitchell's waiting.
Is anything going on between you guys?
I mean, he came to purgatory to find you.
Puts my ex-boyfriend's tattoo into perspective.
We're just friends.
You'd be so adorable, you two.
I could eat you up.
- I'm dead.
- So is he.
I think it's meant to happen.
I think it's... fate.
What happened to you, Lia?
A very bad thing.
But it's OK.
We play the long game here.
Mitchell?
Mitchell!
You saved me.
You saved me, too.
And what happened?
Did you?
Was there, like, I don't know, some kind of trade-off?
Nothing.
There was nothing.
Mind games, that's all.
I don't believe a word of it.
Um... where are we?
This isn't Bristol.
No.
That's the, um, the other thing.
We've sort of moved to Wales.
- Wales?
!
- Yeah, Barry Island.
I want to go back.
- To Bristol?
- No, to purgatory!
My name is Annie Claire Sawyer, and two years ago I died.
But in so many ways, that's when my life began.
In the company of horrors, I learnt about friendship and loyalty, sacrifice and courage.
Humanity isn't a species, it's a state of mind.
It can't be defeated - it moves mountains, it saves souls.
We were blessed as much as we were cursed.
In this little enclave of the lost...
I witnessed the very best of being human.
We were safe here... while outside, the monsters prowled.
You lost me 50 quid.
But am I cross?
No.
No, I'm not, as it goes, cos it's clear to me that you've got exceptional talent.
You're what's known in the trade as a real animal.
I'm going to look after you.
Get you a chewy toy... a bowl...
Are you hungry?
Hm?
No?
Well, you had a late supper, didn't you?
Hmm.
My name... is McNair.
McNair...
McNair the Bear would be a good name if you were a bear, but you're not, you're a dog!
You're my dog.
My mad dog.
Mad Dog McNair.
Oi, what do you reckon?
Mad Dog McNair.
No, you misunderstand.
You see, I told you my name... because I want it to be the last thing you ever hear.
Stake and chips, anyone?
- How did you know I was here?
- Spidey sense, Dad.
- It wasn't your fault.
- Right, come on.
There's more coming.
Tom.
Dad, I saw another one.
There's another one of us.
You're a worryingly easy man to find.
I'm here to discuss the Box Tunnel 20.
Do you want to know what I'm feeling, George?
Hungry.
There's a wolf-shaped bullet with his name on it.
Mitchell's going to get got.
How am I going to manage if he's giving it all...
"Let's go out with the lads, find some women, drink them dry. "
Last season on Being Human...
Close it.
(Mother):
Traitor!
You can rot underground.
You did things... horrible things.
- You're somewhere else?
- Limbo.
And the pain!
It's like I'm trapped... forever.
I need to go to limbo.
I have to save Nick and Stevie.
(Screaming)
Aidan?
Josh?
I think I made a big mistake!
It was you.
(Nora):
If you kill Ray, your maker... (Screaming) you don't just cure yourself.
- No, no!
Get out!
- Oh my God!
You cure whoever you made.
Put it down!
Nora.
(Gunshots)
I think it's a mistake to let a Jewish werewolf loose on a crustacean.
- I said it.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Great.
Regardless of what your people think of shellfish, your knife skills are shoddy.
How is this better than just boiling it?
This way is faster and it numbs the brains stem.
Oh, really?
I think it does.
It's what I've heard.
There he is, future of medicine.
As a way to die, that's not a bad way.
It's not as bad as say, getting hunted down by a pack of werewolves for sport.
Uh...
That's good times.
Yeah.
You know what else is really a crummy way to go?
What?
Is when you think your best friend is gonna meet you in the woods to help you kill Ray, and he bails, leaving you vulnerable and exposed and dying alone in the woods.
(Sighing)
I think you're overthinking it.
The point is, we all have to die.
It's the natural order of things.
Uh, no, no.
No, we don't.
We don't have to die.
Seriously, don't mess with Sally, 'cause she's very serious about the whole balance of the universe thing.
Oh, come on.
Like kill-you-in-the-face serious.
No.
No, we don't.
We don't have to die.
Aidan, sorry, bud.
We all have to die.
Even you, sweetie.
No, no.
No, we don't.
We don't have to die.
We're not going to die.
We're not going to die.
* Oh, that's the way it goes *
We're not going to die.
(Raspy):
We're not going to die.
♪ No time for lullabies ♪
We're not going to die.
We're not going to die.
♪ No time for lullabies... ♪
I'm not going to die.
(Gasping)
(Screaming)
* Here we are in the pale moon light *
♪ Telling me your lies ♪
So have you had success before, contacting the... beyond?
You want very much to find your friend.
I sense great love there.
How long has it been?
It's been over a year.
(Chuckles)
I've called every psychic, medium, ghost whisperer.
That's not really a thing.
I've called all of you.
And I...
I don't know,
I'm really starting to get scared that it's too late.
You need to open yourself.
Ok.
(Exhaling slowly)
Josh?
Josh?
Yeah?
Are we doing... we're doing this?
Yeah.
- All right.
- I'm sorry.
We've been to a lot of psychics.
Did I mention that?
I just want to say before we, um, before we begin... (Sighing)
I'm not, um...
I'm not gonna buy a candle... or tea.
Ok.
Shall we begin?
I see... the woods.
There... there was a fight.
Nora.
A bullet in me is the same as a bullet in him, sweetheart!
Nora, he's... he's right.
Shoot me, save yourself.
Shoot me!
Do it!
- Now, Josh!
- What?
Take the gun!
It's the only way to cure both of us!
He's dying.
That's why you have to finish it!
(Groans)
(Screaming)
(Grunting)
(Groans)
(Ray groaning)
What did you see?
Darkness.
And then laughter.
Yes, tears and then laughter.
What?
Laughter always saves you two.
I'm dead inside.
I swear, if we have to go to another psychic, you're gonna be trying to contact me on the other side.
But how else do people like us find people like Sally and Aidan?
You know what's messed up?
I've gotten to the point where I think to myself:
"Well, my ghost friend, she's just in limbo, so we should be able to find her, like, no problem.
But my vampire friend, he's God knows where."
Who knows if he's even alive?
Hey.
You have a candle for that?
Come here.
We exist, ok?
Sally, Aidan... they exist.
(Car honking)
Which means that we have to exist in a world where finding them is a possibility.
Yeah.
(Bird chirping)
(Wind whistling)
Come on!
Sally, wait!
It's not gonna work.
Maybe the fact that you say the exact same thing every time we get to the door is what's messing us up.
Maybe we could just try it one time without you yelling "It's not gonna work" in my face.
I'm just saying the other 784 times you tried it, it hasn't worked.
Have we been doing this for that long?
I'm low-balling it.
At least we're together when we're here.
The rest of the time...
(Doorknob rattling)
Told you.
One of these times,
Aidan and Josh will be there for us and this will all be over.
We just have to believe that, ok?
No!
No!
Aidan!
Josh!
I'm here!
(Sobbing)
I'm right here!
We need a nurse here!
(Telephone ringing)
Who's this?
Found him by Porter Square.
Lesions on his neck.
He was stressing on the ride.
Couldn't even get his vitals.
(Snarls)
You know what?
I'm just gonna take him.
Aidan Waite, do you know him?
(Breathing heavily)
Everybody knew him back in the day.
Where is he?
Think I got time to keep tabs on him?
You know something.
No one knows anything anymore.
This sickness.
What is it?
I've seen it in other vampires.
You get the lesions and then it seems fast, 2-3 days.
It's in the blood, right?
Is there a cure?
Does he know where he is?
No.
Get the hell away from me!
Why don't you let us die in peace?
I'm sorry.
No, I'm...
You can't get enough, can you, watching us rot?
Friggin' werewolves!
I'd watch myself if I were you.
(Coughs)
Ok.
This is it.
We'll wait until the moon gets high and then we'll know.
What if Brynn was wrong?
What if killing Ray... what if it didn't cure us?
We could still be wolves.
And God, I...
I told you to kill him.
No.
- Yes, I did.
- No.
I never should've told you that.
I'd do it all over again just to save you.
But if it didn't work...
It will.
Nora.
Nora?
Oh my God!
I can't believe it!
(Snarling)
The house-call thing's good, right?
I like a psychic who's willing to travel.
It also makes it about 10,000 times easier for them to scam us based on our magazine subscriptions, but "whatevs"!
I think the fact that we get
Garden and Gun and The New Yorker really keeps people guessing.
Yeah, and throw Highlights in there, you have the insanity trifecta.
Oh, did you finish this paperwork she wanted us to fill out?
No.
I started it.
It's like we're preparing for a supernatural colonoscopy.
She's very thorough.
Is she walking away?
- 'Cause you drank water after 10:00?
- No.
No, I'm serious.
This woman right here walking away, you think that's her?
Excuse me?
Sorry, wait!
Excuse me!
Are you looking for 3638 Mayford?
I'm sorry.
I can't go into that house.
I've been here before.
(Grunting)
(Gasping)
It's gotten worse since then.
Much worse.
I can feel the pain from that house out here.
You were the one who tried to exorcize Sally.
He wanted me to.
But I didn't, just like I can't help you right now.
- I'm sorry.
- No, wait!
If you had contact with Sally before, don't you think that maybe you could get it back now?
So she isn't here?
No.
She went away.
We used to hear her sometimes in the radio, just, you know, for a second or two and then static.
That's how we knew that she was somewhere.
It's been months since we've even heard that.
We need to bring her home.
You can't just do that, crossing dimensions back and forth.
It's not like driving from Pennsylvania into Delaware to buy a keg.
I didn't think it was like that, so...
This is just beyond what I can do.
I wish I could give you some comfort, but I...
No, wait!
This is not about our comfort.
We've been trying to bring her back for over a year now.
At a certain point, it's gotta be too late, don't you think?
I mean, we can't let that happen.
Please.
Help us.
Ok.
Um...
You can go here and ask for Ms. Gilchrist.
But please don't tell her you got this from me.
My involvement ends here.
Thank you.
Good luck.

Aidan?

I didn't die this way.
I know.
You took pills.
(Sighing)
This is your limbo, Stevie... watching your family go on without you.
It's happening again.
Yes.
(Panting)
We'll get out.
You're saying that again.
Josh, I'm here!
Come answer the door!
I'm right here!
(Sobbing)
(Panting)
Miss Gilchrist?
- Hi.
- Hi!
Miss Miss Gilchrist?
Donna.
Donna.
We were... we were told that you could help us, um, find a friend.
Not here.
In the kitchen.
Ok.
(Thudding)
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Mother, you'll forgive me.
This will be my salvation.
Ok, there, buddy.
Just relax now, ok?
I'm here to help, you hear me?
I'm a friend.
Can you move?
Well, I ain't gonna lie to you, bro.
You look rough.
But it's all good.
You see, Mickey's got you now.
Let me get you set up here.
And guess what?
You are safe.
How long has she been gone?
Uh, over a year. 15 months.
And what makes you think that she wants to come back?
Well, because limbo, if that's... if that's what you call it, sounds pretty much like the worst place ever.
The point of limbo is that it hovers in between.
There is always someplace worse.
So you've been there and you've come back?
I didn't say that.
All right.
Just tell me right now.
Is there a way back?
You could not pull it off.
- Is that a dare?
- What do you mean?
I don't know how you got to me, and God knows if you were given the proper warning, but what lies ahead for you is more intense than your Haftarah portion of the demise of Filene's Basement.
Try us.
$2,000.
I mean, yeah.
Yeah, that's...
Ok.
The money is the least of it.
You wanna bring a soul back from limbo, then you gotta have a real line to pull them in.
Blood magic.
You have to bring me a heart.
A heart, like a human?
Sure.
Well, we work at a hospital, so...
- Exactly.
- We can do that.
It's a heart, it's...
Ok.
The heart of someone you killed.
This is insane.
Yeah!
Oh, that's it?
That's all?
So you looked at us and you saw a J-Crew ad and you figured you'd scare us into, I don't know, like, paying you 2 grand and oh, just the heart of a guy I killed.
I didn't say a guy, but that's interesting.
You know, I'm getting really fed up with you psychics.
I am not a psychic!
Exactly!
Exactly!
So what exactly... what the hell are you?
You look in a book?
You got books?
We have a ton of books at home!
I can follow a book!
Of course you can.
Look, could you test this for me?
Knees soft, right?
Listen, you want your friend back, you bring me a heart.
(Slaps counter)
(Crow cawing)
I never thought we'd be back here.
(Sighing)
I know.
Are you ok?
I know it's... but to bring Sally back, this way... this way, it would be worth something, what I did to him.
Your humanity is worth what we did.
(Wheezing)
There he is.
What is this?
Why don't you shut your bloodsucking face until I tell you you can speak, ok?
All that time down in a pine box... rolling in your own stink, bet you never thought that you were the lucky one.
They're all dead, bro.
And the ones that ain't, well, they think that you got what they need.
And they are willing to pay mightily for it.
You're pure.
At least that's what they want to believe, like them African guys who think they can cure their AIDS by banging virgins.
Oh, crazy bastards.
What the hell are you talking about?
There we are.
You just be my honey pot.
That's all you be, hmm?
(Groaning)
(Grunting)
We were the only two who knew about this.
Now, Donna...
She's calling the cops, Nora.
(Grunts)
I just worry that it's getting out of control!
Yeah, now it's getting out of control.
(Panting)
(Flies buzzing)
(Gasps)
Do you wanna at least talk about this?
That night?
I know we're never gonna ever really be able to get past it.
But it was getting to the point where I wasn't seeing his face every time I closed my eyes, where you weren't waking up in a cold sweat.
(Grunting)
It was as close to normal as you and I might get.
I just don't want you to suffer anymore.
(Grunting)
(Panting)
I can't...
I can't do this.
I'll never cut through the breast plate with this.
(Josh clearing throat)
Oh, you have to come by during dinner prep?
How is a witch entrusted with feeding the needy?
I'm just wondering.
Why would you insult her?
I'm nervous.
This is weird.
Please, just give me that, ok?
We have it.
Ooh!
Not too tidy, is it?
You know, we went through kind of a lot to find ourselves right here right now with you, and so, yes, it's a little messy.
But the man was not in the best state.
Mm-hmm.
So, you know what, though?
That's the heart.
We found it.
So how does this spell work?
Why a heart?
Why that heart?
Well, it has to be a heart that you stopped, because the life, I mean, the force of life was in your hands.
The heart is everything.
We use it in the incantation, in the salve.
(Chuckling)
Salve.
And so, uh, what's the salve for?
Is it to make our hands clean afterwards or something?
It's poetic, I guess.
Josh.
I don't know, Nora.
Uh, the salve is for the body.
For your friend's body.
Oh!
Come on, kids.
You can't split hairs with the soul.
If you're bringing her back, you're bringing her back from the dead.
(Man):
This is what we agreed on.
No, that's not what we agreed on.
That's not what we agreed on.
That's for 2 pints of pure.
What you want now, that's a whole new ballgame.
See now, if you want that much, you're gonna have to buy the whole cow.
The whole cow don't come cheap, friend.
This is all the money I can offer you.
Well, then why don't you get your ass out of here?
(Grunting)
(Groaning)
Hello, brother.
(Sighing)
(Gasping)
(Groans)
Are you insane?
That blood could kill you!
Come on!
(Grunting)
Mother's dead.
They're all dead or disappeared in search of untainted blood.
A human virus, flu, spread around the world.
They got their vaccines and took their drugs, but us, any of our brothers who fed from a tainted human, this.
You're... you're sick?
A few days ago, one of ours brought home tainted meat.
We should've been more careful, but the hunger... they sent me to Boston to find help or a cure.
I found better, brother.
I found you.
(Coughing)
(Both grunting)
This is...
I know.
I know.
I know.
Just can't think about it, ok?
I gave the guy $200.
I told him we'd out by dawn.
Wasn't he... (Panting) like, oddly calm about the whole thing, as if people bribe him all the time to dig up bodies?
Oh, they definitely do.
(Both panting)
But do you think anyone does what we're doing?
We're bringing Sally back.
As what?
As Sally.
(Grunting)
Oh my God!
Ok.
Let's get her out of here.
OK.
(* Man singing rock 'n' roll on stereo *)
You're about to be eaten by a pack of rabid, virus-stricken, Amish vampires.
(Josh chuckling)
Holy crap, Aidan!
What exactly do you expect me to do about it?
Uh, blow a rape whistle.
On the other hand, let's face it, you know, if you're gonna go, there are less original ways to...
What, you're saying that Aidan should die for style points?
I'm not gonna die.
I'm not going to die.
It kind of looks like you are, though.
Oh!
Pfft!
Bishop!
Uh, excuse me, we were trying to have a conversation.
Yeah, I know.
I was trying to nap through it.
Aidan, listen.
It is an insult to my memory that you would rather imagine these two throwing daisies on your grave than getting up and actually doing something about this.
Look, Atlee is sick.
He's not even one of the scary Amish.
Come on, man!
Hey!
I know you're not thinking clearly because your head was cut off, but Aidan isn't exactly at fighting weight right now.
I'm not fighting.
I've played out every battle in my head, every act of revenge, every act of malice.
And I'm telling you, I'm done.
(Sighing)
Oh, God.
Finally, I'm done.
(Clearing throat)
Oh, come on, man!
Would you just give me a break?
I don't need to make you understand that you are not a part of this.
No, you don't.
Hmm... that's weird, 'cause you made me a part of it.
You put me in the front seat.
I am in your head, remember?
That is something that I've been meaning to forget.
You cannot forget who you are.
You were a warrior when I found you.
I made you one of the best there is.
Now fight.
Yeah, I kind of get it now.
He's super compelling.
I kind of want to make out with him.
(Honking, tires screeching)
(Grunting)
(Groaning)
I'm to share you with my brothers, but look at you, so frail, emaciated.
They would kill each other over what?
Scraps?
I'm going die, Aidan, if you don't save me now.
(Growling)
Aaah!
Sorry.
The thing to remember is that she won't be human, not really.
Yeah, but she'll look human, right?
Because that just seems like a big leap from here.
So then what?
Does that make her a zombie?
Zombies are in a trance-like state.
They're unaware of what they've become.
You know, there's no consciousness.
Your friend will be aware, and that could prove to be a problem.
What does that mean?
When she awakes, you need to make her understand...
I mean, once she recovers from the possibly horrifying shock that she's topside... that she cannot pick up where she left off.
There's no running home to mother.
Her mother's dead.
I don't care.
No reunions, no people from her past.
That's the catch.
Do you understand?
Got it.
Got it.
Listen, I hate to keep coming back to this, but she'll be ok, right?
I just...
I can hear the conversation with her now.
And Sally would kill me if I brought her back and she's got, like, you know, worm holes in her face.
The salve restores the body.
The incantation reanimates it.
Are you ready?
This is your last chance to say no.
Yeah.
Yeah, uh, yeah.
(Clears throat)
Absolutely.
Absolutely, yeah.
Just like, uh, just like being at a day spa, right?
It's like a... it's like a mud wrap?
Right?
Only instead of mud, it's, like, the heart of a man that I killed.
No, it's otherwise a completely normal.
- Ok, please stop talking.
- All right.
(Speaking foreign language)
Sally!
Sally, wait!
No, guys.
We have to keep trying!
Sally, we've been thinking about this.
When do you guys have time to conspire?
During the running.
Yeah.
Oh, and when you're screaming.
You know, we have time there too.
It's not gonna be different this time, Sally.
It's ok.
Who knows?
Maybe if you admit it, it will get you out of here.
No, guys.
This is gonna get us out of here.
(Sighing)
(Door opening)
(Speaking foreign language)
Is it working?
You don't think you'll know if it's working?
I didn't think it'd take this long.
- Josh.
- No, I mean... do we have any proof?
Do we?
I mean, it's not like we can check her references.
You tell me, Donna.
Is there a recently revived corpse in Nantucket that we should call?
This is so the wrong time to be doing this.
No, you know, he should understand that there are no guarantees.
What the hell does that mean?
Where she is, it's like an ocean.
It's endless.
All we can do is throw her a life raft, shine a light on it.
It is up to her whether or not to climb on board.
It's up to Sally.
Mm-hmm.
But this will not work unless you have faith.
Like, in God?
You're talking to me about God?
Why do you wear a Star of David?
Because when I wear it,
I remember believing in a world that makes sense.
Right now, I'm standing in a soup kitchen, hovering over my friend's dead body, having just rubbed the bits of a man's heart that I murdered on her.
How is this... how is this happening?
How?
Josh.
- No, no.
Nora, no.
- Josh.
No, no, no.
All I've ever wanted to do was make things right for you.
But it's insane to think that I could save anyone.
You, Julia, Aidan.
Aidan is God knows where!
Sally's here, but my God!
How do we know that this is gonna work?
We're waiting for her to take a raft!
Why would she want to come back to this?
It's ok.
It's gonna be ok, ok?
It has to be ok.
I'm telling you, this is it.
Go in.
You go in.
It's your door.
Well, what if it has an Indiana Jones hair-trigger thing and it closes behind me the second I walk through?
(Chuckling)
If there's a chance for us to leave this place, you two are gonna take it.
(Nick):
How do we know what's behind that door?
You could find Zoe again.
You could stop dying in front of your parents' house, watching them night after night.
You two are going through that door.
Now!
This can't be it.
(Inhaling)
Ah!
(Chuckling)
Oh my God!
(Wheezing)
(Groaning)
It didn't work.
I don't understand.
Your blood is supposed to be pure.
You were supposed to cure me.
(Rustling)
(Tires screeching)
What do you think it'll feel like when she wakes up?
Confusing.
Wouldn't it be?
I mean, there's the Sally that we know, and then there's...
This is Sally.
Or it will be.
We'll help her.
Do you think she'll even want to be here?
It's gotta be better than the alternative.
Doesn't it?
I mean... (Wheezing)
(Gasps)
Sally.
(Wheezing)
Ssst...
It's ok.
We're here.
- It's all right, sweetheart.
- Just take your time.
Yeah, take your time.
Just say it.
(Wheezing)
Ssstevie... and Nick... here.
It's ok, Sally.
Did she just say that Stevie Nicks is here?
No, obviously not.
Well, then obviously, that's exactly what she said.
- Why would she say that?
- She said Stevie Nicks is here.
Stevie!
Stevie!
Stevie and Nick.
Stevie and Nick?
On the life raft.
They jumped on the life raft.
Sally, where are they?
(Gasps)
With me.
Oh my God!
What if they just woke up inside their coffins?
(Birds chirping)
(Speaking foreign language)
Now, what are we going to do with you?

Spirit, I command you leave here.
No, no...!
- Christ compels you.
- No!
Please!
No.
I'm not ready!
- No, no...!
- No...!
No...!
I don't know what's happened.
Don't forget me, will you?
I have to go.
What do we do?
We're going to get her back.
...So she dies, and six months later, he dies.
That's Catholics for you.
So it goes to the son.
I says to him, you want to get rid.
He fancies himself as a landlord now.
I says, you've been watching too much Property Ladder.
He just shrugs and scratches himself with his keys.
So, um, it was, it was a bed and breakfast?
I saw their ad in the free paper.
"A slice of heaven in Barry."
I bet heaven doesn't have chemical toilets.
- So it's the three of you, is it?
- A friend will be joining us.
Well, that's...
Yeah, we hope so.
It's...
It's not definite.
No, no, she should be here pretty soon.
I don't know what's taking her so long.
Do what you want as long as the rent's covered.
We've been trying to shift this place for months.
I reckon it's haunted.
No, there's nothing here.
Do you know what really, really excited us?
It was the, um, it was the basement gym.
- Oh, yeah.
- See, she's excited.
Could we have a have a look?
Depends how good you are at handling disappointment.
- Come on.
- I'll just go this way.
"Basil!"
...Four weeks since the attack in Box Tunnel that left 20 people dead, and the police have yet to make an arrest.
However...
Mitchell?
Mitchell?
Can you hear me?
- Annie!
- Help, Mitchell, I'm so scared.
Annie, can you see me?
Are you OK?
Oh, God, Annie...!
I think "gym" was more a statement of intent.
Is it soundproof?
It's just, I can get pretty...
Rarrr!
Rarrr!
...when I'm, er, working out.
"Feel the burn." "Who's your daddy?"
"Say what you see."
Oh, God.
Do you want me to get his nibs from upstairs?
Oh, no, you're fine, we're cool.
They're looking at it now.
I don't know, English or something.
Working at the hospital, apparently.
Isn't it brilliant?
.
We can transform in here.
Not at the same time obviously but you can have it for the full moon tomorrow.
I thought we were transforming in the country.
Yeah, at a last resort.
We don't know the area, we'd have to find two separate places, miles apart.
No, this is ideal.
I thought this is what you wanted - a place of our own.
But it isn't, is it?
It's you, me and Count Dupree upstairs.
He saved our lives.
He's changed.
Something's, something's happened to him.
You must have noticed.
We've lost Annie, we're all over the place.
They call this the waiting room.
We wait here until...they know where they want us to go.
Have they told you where?
They're going to build a special room, just for me, they're going to lock the door and they're going to burn the key.
- What, what does that mean?
!
- It's Hell, Mitchell.
They're going to take me to Hell.
Annie, Annie, listen to me.
I'm coming to get you.
We just need to find out what...
Ta-ra now.
I know.
There's tit all on these days.
Thank God for Terry Pratchett, is all I'm saying.
Annie was there.
She was on the screen.
- What?
You're kidding.
- Is she OK?
What did she say?
We're running out of time.
Um, it's our friend, she's in Midsomer Murders.
OK, look.
I've had a pow-wow with my boss, and how's this?
Sign now and we'll give the place a spruce.
Lose the swirly carpet, get some stripped floorboards, blinds and stuff.
Make it look all catalogue-y.
OK, how long will that take?
Two weeks, tops.
I know a couple of Polish fellas.
Peasant stock.
Very driven.
OK, right.
No, we want to move in now.
Really?
- Please, can we?
- Mitchell?
Yeah, whatever.
But it's... well, look at it!
It's fine.
We wouldn't want to change a thing, would we?
We just can't wait to start... our Hawaiian dream.
- And he's a werewolf?
- Benicio del something.
He's a Spanish actor.
The special effects are amazing, Dad.
I've seen the pictures.
Anyway, there's an 11am screening for OAPs.
I thought you'd feel at home.
I don't know.
Makes it seem trivial.
You liked 'The English Patient'.
Because there weren't any werewolves in 'The English Patient'.
It had elegance.
Is there nudity?
We shouldn't go if there's nudity.
In 'The Wolfman', Dad?
I doubt it.
There's a lady on the poster, but she's wearing a blouse.
Ah, we can't afford two tickets.
I'll sneak you in through the fire exit.
We'd do that when I was a kid.
Fine.
But I want you to have a nap afterwards.
And a proper lunch.
Big day tomorrow.
Where you going?
Bit of window shopping.
You know that funfair we passed?
It's closed down.
There might be copper wire in there.
- Iron, maybe.
Stuff we can sell.
- You want me to cause a distraction?
Tom.
These people, they work for a living.
They're really going to show 'The Wolfman' to a load of OAPs?
Mm-hm.
Even old people are weird now.
Hang about, here he comes.
That's him.
Yeah, that's got to be him, man.
Let's roll.
Ow-wooo!
Come on, doggy!
Where's the other one?
Look...we heard there was two of you... ..so... where... is... he?
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
What do you think?
I had a little left over from the food shop, and I thought it might be nice to have something for, you know, us.
Hence... and hence...
It was either that or...
off-peak gym membership.
You made absolutely the right decision.
Really?
- Ow.
- What?
What?
What is that?
Pen.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Ow!
Hair stuck, glasses...!
Oh, is it?
Oh, shit, sorry.
Oh, hang on, it's really tangled.
Ee, ow!
Wait, wait, wait.
Sssh, don't pull away.
Quickly.
Oh!
- You all right?
- Yeah, fine.
Right, where were we?
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Have you got a radio?
- What?
!
I need a radio.
I have an idea.
- Mitchell.
Ow!
- Mitchell.
What are you doing?
!
Cheers.
Just give me a bloody kiss.
Oh, look, forget about it.
He's ruined everything.
Another night.
Come on, Annie, come on.
Sean Hancock.
Diagnosed a year ago with malignant melanoma.
Secondaries on the brain and lung.
He's on a morphine infusion and maintenance fluids but his condition's deteriorating rapidly.
- We're talking hours now.
- Wait a sec, you're doing this now?
It's a full moon, we've just moved into a new house.
There's enough going on without you crossing over into the afterlife.
We could be waitin weeks for another opportunity like this.
There could be consequences.
I don't care about the consequences, she's our friend and we lost her.
- And I don't want to lose you as well!
- I am doing this.
I'll take everything they've got.
Death, God, the Devil - none of it frightens me!
- I feel totally reassured.
- We all saw Annie on that screen in the cottage, we saw how terrified she is, and this is the only idea we've got.
- Thank you.
- But I want one of us in there with you.
What?
!
Death is a personal, private moment and we're gate-crashing.
I want that man treated with dignity and kindness.
♪ Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu
- # Adonai Echad... #
- What's that you're doing?
It's a prayer.
It's Jewish.
Yeah, I'm not great with religious rituals.
Aw...
Tough.
- Is he even Jewish?
- It doesn't matter.
His body's let him down, medicine's let him down.
It's a gesture of sympathy.
I'm trying to get in the zone here.
I refer you to my earlier statement of "tough".
♪ Shema Yisrael... ♪
I can't remember the rest.
Five letters.
Something, 'A', something, something, something.
The clue is just the letters H I J K L M N O.
Mitchell!
The answer's water.
Yes, it's the letters H to O.
H2O, it's the molecular formula for water.
Get in.
OK, give me another one.
Is that it?
Is he dead now?
That's me.
Shit, I look awful!
Sean, isn't it?
Sean, you've been very ill.
I'm so sorry but I'm afraid you've just died.
- What happens now?
- You're going on a journey.
No, it's OK, it's cool.
I'm coming with you.
Are you...
Death?
No!
No, I'm not Death.
Sean...
Hi.
This is John.
He's going to make sure you get there safely.
What's that?
That's for you.
That's what happens next.
OK, boys, let's get going.
Oh, yeah, you need to get it.
When you're ready, take your time.
Goodbye, Sean.
Is this it?
Is it all over now?
Yeah.
You did good, Sean.
You can rest now.
None of this was your fault.
Anything that happened would have happened a lot sooner and a lot worse if I hadn't have met you.
Just come back.
Mitchell, isn't it?
I'm Lia.
How's it going?
- Where's the guy I was with?
- Sean?
Well, I don't know.
He'll have his own stuff to do.
- You're my guide, then?
- Yes.
What's got two thumbs and just lucked out?
Hello.
No, I've always been lucky.
You should rub me.
I'm serious.
Rub me.
Do you know who I am, "Lia"?
Well, I know you're a vampire.
Can I say that?
Or are you funny about the word?
Because I've got this cousin who's in a wheelchair and I called him disabled once and he ran over my foot.
What else?
Just that you're really hot.
Have we met...before?
H12.
H12?
What does that mean?
It's a riddle.
I love riddles, don't you?
Like the one about the midget.
So there's this midget who gets into a lift and...
I've just given away the answer.
Am I rambling?
So this is Purgatory.
I remember this.
Well, strictly speaking it's your purgatory.
You know we've all got a corridor, filled with all the good things and the bad and... well, you've been busy.
- So... we choose a door?
- Do we?
I'm asking you.
Yes.
It's like a quiz show.
And tonight's star prize - someone's soul.
Frickin' weird quiz show.
After you.
And just so you know, I will be looking at your arse.
- Why are we here?
- I don't even know where here is.
France.
July 17th, 1917.
Who's the guy?
Corporal Arthur Hanley.
- Don't drink that.
- I wasn't going to.
- It's poisoned.
- I wasn't going to.
Poisoned?
I didn't want him to feel any pain.
You killed him?
Shit, so you've been a vampire since... ..since before my dad was born.
- What are you doing?
- Look, Annie isn't here.
- This is a waste of time.
- But we must be here for a reason.
Maybe we're meant to find a clue or something.
Who was he?
Mitchell.
Tell me about the guy.
He was my first.
I was recruited by the vampires about four weeks earlier.
But I ran away, found my regiment again.
I didn't want to believe what had happened to me.
But then the hunger came.
I'd steal from the medical supplies, a little bit every day.
When I had enough,
I slipped it into his tea...
Where are you now?
Running away.
That's my captain.
He thought I was deserting, but...
I was running to find Herrick.
I was one of them now.
How did it make you feel?
How do you think?
I killed my friend.
The shame of that.
The horror.
Knowing what I was now.
You know it's funny, because... most people would've walked into a minefield and found a way to end it all.
But you didn't.
And I think that's really brave.
Sorry, why didn't you do that?
I wasn't going to let it win.
Quite right.
I'm sure that's what Arthur would have wanted.
You running round with lots of girls and stuff for another century.
What?
Arthur wasn't theonly victim, was he?
I don't understand.
You!
You numpty!
You're the other victim.
You had your humanity ripped away from you.
- Right.
Yeah, yeah.
- What did you think I meant?
Nothing.
I knew what you meant.
Actually...
I'm the victim.
A minute ago, you were in here wearing a uniform and I missed it.
- Will you stop?
!
- Mitchell?
Mitchell?
- Annie, I'm here.
- They're getting ready to move me.
They're taking me to the room.
Which room?
There are all these doors...
Which room, Annie?
There's going to be a parade.
They'll scatter ashes in front of me like petals, they said...
I'm coming to get you.
I swear, I'm on my way.
- Annie?
- They're coming.
They've got drums.
They're cheering.
- Annie?
!
- I can hear children cheering.
Must be a concept album.
Hey, look.
Come on.
Spit spot.
What are you doing?
Why have you got a chicken on a string?
No, no, wait.
I want to talk to you!
Whoah!
Whoah, easy soldier.
There was a young guy, he ran through here.
No need to panic, nothing happens till it gets dark.
Now, then, are you here to watch or play?
- Sorry?
Play?
Play what?
- See how the mood takes you.
My sciatica's back, so I'm just going to watch Sue and Peter in the Volvo and touch myself.
Um, no, sorry, there was a young guy, he came through here.
What's this?
Listen, we don't do funny stuff here.
- You'll have to go to Swansea for that.
- Huh?
You'll catch on.
No, I like to think we're a friendly bunch.
We're on MySpace, and last year all the fellas shaved their heads for Comic Relief.
So, that is Alan and Judith.
Now, Judith and I hope she won't mind me telling you this - will give you a tit-wank you'll never forget!
Look, she's blushing.
Sorry, Ju, but credit where credit's due, eh, love?
You don't understand.
There was...
I want a young guy...
So men are your preferred brand?
Well, in that case you'll be wanting Ian in the people carrier.
Now...
Don't move!
Just stop now.
We hadn't started.
Move, move.
- Please leave a message.
- Nina...
I've been arrested.
I don't know what to do.
I've been arrested!
Listen, no.
You have to let me go.
I have a very serious medical condition.
A medical condition, it's serious.
No, please.
No!
Tell me where Annie is.
You're supposed to be my fucking guide, take me to her now!
Oh, that's nice.
Toilet talk.
I'm missing Countryfile for this.
Is this a joke to you?
Jesus Christ...!
There's no point, Mitchell, I'm already dead.
You'll get yourself all hot and sweaty for no...
Actually...try it.
Who are you?
- How do I know you?
- H12.
Why do you keep saying that?
We'd better make tracks.
Which door now for a Brucey Bonus?
I so should have worn a leotard.
OK.
That one.
- Oh, God.
- Where are we now?
Sheffield.
December 24th, 1960.
This is ridiculous.
We're supposed to be finding Annie.
Well, maybe she's hiding.
Yoo-hoo!
- Annie!
- Don't go around there.
Oh.
Guess you ran out of poison.
What was her name?
Sally.
We met in a pub, came back here.
We got pretty drunk.
- It was quite chaotic.
- Mitchell... it's very important that you tell me the truth.
When it got chaotic with Sally, were you topless?
I'm building up an image here that'll come in handy later, if you know what I'm saying!
I'm kidding, I'm kidding!
I'm not.
You know, I'm a bit confused.
With the soldier guy, you'd just become a vampire so it was all new and overwhelming...
- I was a victim.
- Yes, you were a victim, we agreed on that.
But this is different somehow.
You screwed her, I'm guessing.
Then what did you use to kill her?
Oh, my God, you used the pot of her little Christmas tree.
So that's what people mean when they say, "Christmas does my head in!"
- I was out of control.
- You were in control enough to have sex.
- The soldier guy?
- His name was Arthur.
Oh, sorry, sorry.
I should be a bit more respectful about the people you kill.
There was stuff in his room you could've taken, money, but you didn't.
- It was all about the hunger.
- What are you getting at?
Nothing.
I just think it's curious.
With Arthur, it was kind for him and torture for you.
But with Sally,...
there was drinks, there was sex...
Someone could look at this and think you enjoyed it.
Why are you bringing me to these places?
To punish me?
Is that it?
You chose the door.
Next time pick one where you're building an orphanage on the other side.
It's a compulsion.
It WAS a compulsion.
- I'm not that man any more.
- Brilliant.
Then there should be nothing stopping you getting Annie back.
Mitchell!
Mitchell, please!
Mitchell, they're outside!
- Tell me where she is.
- You know what to do.
What are you...?
!
Of course I don't!
What happens next is your choice.
Mitchell, they're coming for me now,
They're going to take me to the room.
Mitchell, please!
I'm frightened...
Coming?
Mitchell, please!
I'm so frightened.
Mitchell...!
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Are you all in for a mauling?
Do the children of the night want to see a fight?
So shall I introduce you to tonight's combatants?
Well, there ain't a lot I can tell you about our first noble warrior on account of the fact we picked him up yesterday and he ain't said a word fucking since.
The silent but violent type,... no doubt.
We're going to welcome him into our bosom, ain't we?
Treat him like a member of the family.
Our pet DOG!
He's hairy, oh, he's scary.
The mute most hirsute.
The canine destined for the big time.
The creature who's plea-ea-eased to meet ya!
Ladies and gentlemen...
..The Beast!
And facing him tonight... plucked from the streets a mere two and a half hours ago.
He doesn't know where he is, bless him.
The Children of Darwin's champion.
The man with the plan.
The spunky monkey.
..Mr Paul Jameson.
..Serious medical condition.
No, please!
No.
Please.
Please, please, please, please you have to let me out.
We'll be fine.
We hadn't even started.
It's a legal grey area.
You all right there, chum?
It's coming.
Oi, soon as he turns, stick him one right in the bollocks.
I've got money on you to live for two minutes.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
A- a-argh!
Hello?
I think there's something wrong with this chap in here.
- Kill me.
- What did you say?
It's the only way you'll survive.
I'm not killing you!
Kill me or I will tear your fucking head off!
Sorry, Miss, you shouldn't be down here.
Have you got someone in custody called George Sands?
Are you a friend of his?
I said to the nine-year-old in reception, he's a patient of mine.
He has a serious medical condition and needs constant supervision and medication.
Did he tell you that he's got a medical condition?
When we processed him, he might have mentioned something.
And you still brought him in.
You didn't think to contact the hospital or...?
- Oh, man, we're going to have fun with you.
- We found him in awell-known dogging location.
That man has serious mental problems.
He's a...
Oh...!
He's...basically nuts, OK?
And it's, um, it's, it's...
contagious.
- Are you all right, Miss?
- No, I am...really annoyed.
Gareth, maybe we should...sort of let this lady have him.
- Yeah, I think that would be a good idea...
Argh!
- Get his belongings.
No, this isn't anything to do with...what was going on.
Listen, I never...
Ah, come on!
Oh, good.
All right, George?
Right, let's get you ba-a-a-ack to the ward.
But don't think for a moment that you've heard the last of this.
Thank you.
- Dogging?
You were caught dogging?
- We need to find somewhere to transform.
I only got your message because I went upstairs to use the toilet.
No.
There is something down here.
You can transform in here.
- What will you do?
- I don't know.
But we can't be together, we'll kill each other.
We haven't got a choice.
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry for all this.
I know.
A- a-a-agh!
We could have had the house redecorated after all.
Oh, shit, yes.
I love you.
I love you too.
- A- a-a-a-gh!
- A- a-a-a-gh!
..Four, three, two, one... full moon!
You don't have to do this.
You could go back to George and your old life and say you tried to get Annie back but it was impossible.
They'll understand.
It was brave of you to even try.
No.
I need to do this.
OK, then.
End of the line.
I've got to say I was kind of hurt that you didn't recognise me, given you remembered so much about the other two.
I guess you were a bit preoccupied that night.
Yeah, so...
What?
I didn't catch that.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you're sorry!
I couldn't help it.
I was angry and...
- The hunger...
- Yeah, yeah.
No control.
It's a compulsion.
Blah, blah, blah.
Anyway,...
let me introduce you to the guys.
Your "twelve good men and true", although there is twenty of us, and nine are women.
But I'll crack on.
So this is Donna.
She was a primary school teacher.
All the kids in her class have been having nightmares since you killed her.
Some have even needed counselling.
Funny, isn't it - the ripples of your actions?
That's Glenn, the driver.
Your first victim, remember him?
Five kids, can you believe it?
And that's Mary.
She'd just recovered from breast cancer.
She was given a whole new lease of life, she was.
Until you tore her throat out, obviously.
And next to her is Dean...
Please... please stop.
I don't know what I can say.
Don't say anything.
Because every word that comes out of your mouth is a fucking excuse.
It's misdirection.
- I'm not trying to trick you.
- Not us.
- You're lying to yourself.
- I'm trying to change.
How's that working out for you?
- It wasn't just me, anyway, it was Daisy.
- You're doing it again.
I was 22.
I had a peanut allergy.
I wanted to be a vet.
I had a little brother that I loved more than anything in the world.
Those are the things that make a human being.
Do you taste THEM in our blood?
The arrogance, to call yourself the victim!
How dare you insult us like that!
I didn't mean to insult you.
- You were flirting with me.
- I just wanted you to like me.
And there we have it!
You want forgiveness, every day.
You get a smile from me, and it proves you're not completely evil.
You do a thousand small nice things and you put them against the bad.
You actually do the sums in your head, don't you?
Why did you come here?
- For Annie or for you?
- For Annie.
Crossing into Purgatory.
That's a big deposit in the 'good' account.
- No, I just want Annie back.
- Which one of us does that wipe off the slate?
Donna?
Glenn?
Me?
None of you.
- I don't know what you want me to do.
- I want you to stop hiding.
I'm not hiding.
"I'm a victim.
I'm better now.
Daisy made me do it."
- I'm not...
- You're not what?
- I'm not a victim.
- So you're what?
What, misunderstood?
I'm an animal!
I don't deserve mercy or forgiveness.
I'm a murderer.
I couldn't help myself.
I loved it.
The sensation, the power.
I was dead but I'd never felt so alive.
I wasn't human any more.
I'd lost my conscience, I was free and that's what I was addicted to.
I hacked my way through the world.
I left a trail of blood a thousand miles long.
And I loved it.
I'm a disease.
I'm a plague.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Budge up.
You can have Annie back.
But there's a price.
I'll stay.
I want you to take me to all my victims.
I want to feel it.
I want to suffer.
I don't want to hide any more.
I just want her back.
It's not that simple.
The time and cause of your death have already been set but there are things that need to happen first.
You see, you're the final piece in someone else's story.
And they need to complete their journey, and in order to do that... ..they have to kill you.
What?
You're going to be killed by a werewolf.
A wolf-shaped bullet.
Bang.
Who?
- We'll see you soon, Mitchell.
- You're letting me go?
Well, as punishments go, it's pretty cruel and interesting, isn't it?
Loving that arse!
Oh, oh, oh!
- Hey, what's all this?
- Oh!
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
For a second I thought...
No.
It's OK, baby, we're OK.
- Oo...!
Oo!
- Someone needs a Tic-Tac.
- Wolf breath!
- Oo!
Come on, let's get going.
When we transformed, did we...?
Oh.
Nice.
Annie, isn't it?
I'm Lia.
Sorry about all this palaver.
It's been chaos here.
Lots of people turning up early, everyone's in a bit of a tizz.
You're going to take me to the room now?
Oh, the train station.
Oh, sorry, this was for my three o'clock.
No, you're free to go.
- I...
I can go?
Really?
- Yeah.
You will still be dead.
I should make that clear.
Your body... you know... it's been over two years, nobody really wants to see that.
And, um... will I come back here one day?
Well, we all end up here eventually.
The problem with you was, you came through the wrong door.
But next time, you'll come through the right one and it'll be Boggle and pina coladas 24/7.
Well, spit-spot.
Mitchell's waiting.
Is anything going on between you guys?
I mean, he came to Purgatory to find you.
Puts my ex-boyfriend's tattoo into perspective.
We're just friends.
You'd be so adorable, you two.
I could eat you up.
- I'm dead.
- So is he.
I think it's meant to happen.
I think it's fate.
What happened to you, Lia?
A very bad thing.
It's OK.
We play the long game here.
Mitchell?
Mitchell!
You saved me.
You saved me too.
And what happened?
Did you...?
Was there like, I don't know, some kind of trade-off?
Nothing.
There was nothing.
Mind games, that's all.
I don't believe a word of it.
Um...where are we?
This isn't Bristol.
No.
That's the, um, the other thing.
We've sort of moved to Wales.
- Wales?
!
- Yeah, Barry Island.
I want to go back.
- To Bristol?
- No, to Purgatory!
My name is Annie Claire Sawyer and two years ago I died.
But in so many ways, that's when my life began.
In the company of horrors, I learnt about friendship and loyalty, sacrifice and courage.
Humanity isn't a species, it's a state of mind.
It can't be defeated - it moves mountains, it saves souls.
We were blessed as much as we were cursed.
In this little enclave of the lost...
..I witnessed the very best of being human.
We were safe here...
..while outside, the monsters prowled.
You lost me 50 quid.
But am I cross?
No.
No, I'm not, as it goes, cos it's clear to me you've got exceptional talent.
You're what's known in the trade as a real animal.
I'm going to look after you.
Get you a chewy toy... ..a bowl?
Are you hungry?
Hm?
No?
Well, you had a late supper, didn't you?
Hmm.
My name... ..is McNair.
McNair.
McNair the Bear would be a good name if you were a bear, but you're not, you're a dog!
You're MY dog, my mad dog,
Mad Dog McNair.
Oi, did you hear me?
Mad Dog McNair.
No, you misunderstand.
You see, I told you my name... ..because I want it to be the last thing you ever hear.
A- a-a-rgh!
Stake and chips, anyone?
- How did you know I was here?
- Spidey sense, Dad.
- It wasn't your fault.
- Right, come on.
There's more coming.
Tom.
Dad, I saw another one.
There's another one of us.
You're a worringly easy man to find.
I'm here to discuss the Box Tunnel twenty.
Do you want to know what I am feeling, George?
Hungry.
There's a wolf-shaped bullet with his name on it.
- Mitchell's going to get got.
- How am I going to manage if he's all...?
Let's go out with the lads, find some women, drink them dry.
Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd.
We're not coming back here again, are we?
I saw your retaliation.
Spirit, I command you leave here.
No, no...!
- Christ compels you.
- No!
Please!
No.
I'm not ready!
- No, no...!
- No...!
No...!
I don't know what's happened.
Don't forget me, will you?
I have to go.
What do we do?
We're going to get her back.
...So she dies, and six months later, he dies.
That's Catholics for you.
So it goes to the son.
I says to him, you want to get rid.
He fancies himself as a landlord now.
I says, you've been watching too much Property Ladder.
He just shrugs and scratches himself with his keys.
So, um, it was, it was a bed and breakfast?
I saw their ad in the free paper.
"A slice of heaven in Barry."
I bet heaven doesn't have chemical toilets.
- So it's the three of you, is it?
- A friend will be joining us.
Well, that's...
Yeah, we hope so.
It's...
It's not definite.
No, no, she should be here pretty soon.
I don't know what's taking her so long.
Do what you want as long as the rent's covered.
We've been trying to shift this place for months.
I reckon it's haunted.
No, there's nothing here.
Do you know what really, really excited us?
It was the, um, it was the basement gym.
- Oh, yeah.
- See, she's excited.
Could we have a have a look?
Depends how good you are at handling disappointment.
- Come on.
- I'll just go this way.
"Basil!"
...Four weeks since the attack in Box Tunnel that left 20 people dead, and the police have yet to make an arrest.
However...
Mitchell?
Mitchell?
Can you hear me?
- Annie!
- Help, Mitchell, I'm so scared.
Annie, can you see me?
Are you OK?
Oh, God, Annie...!
I think "gym" was more a statement of intent.
Is it soundproof?
It's just, I can get pretty...
Rarrr!
Rarrr!
...when I'm, er, working out.
"Feel the burn." "Who's your daddy?"
"Say what you see."
Oh, God.
Do you want me to get his nibs from upstairs?
Oh, no, you're fine, we're cool.
They're looking at it now.
I don't know, English or something.
Working at the hospital, apparently.
Isn't it brilliant?
.
We can transform in here.
Not at the same time obviously but you can have it for the full moon tomorrow.
I thought we were transforming in the country.
Yeah, at a last resort.
We don't know the area, we'd have to find two separate places, miles apart.
No, this is ideal.
I thought this is what you wanted - a place of our own.
But it isn't, is it?
It's you, me and Count Dupree upstairs.
He saved our lives.
He's changed.
Something's, something's happened to him.
You must have noticed.
We've lost Annie, we're all over the place.
They call this the waiting room.
We wait here until...they know where they want us to go.
Have they told you where?
They're going to build a special room, just for me, they're going to lock the door and they're going to burn the key.
- What, what does that mean?
!
- It's Hell, Mitchell.
They're going to take me to Hell.
Annie, Annie, listen to me.
I'm coming to get you.
We just need to find out what...
Ta-ra now.
I know.
There's tit all on these days.
Thank God for Terry Pratchett, is all I'm saying.
Annie was there.
She was on the screen.
- What?
You're kidding.
- Is she OK?
What did she say?
We're running out of time.
Um, it's our friend, she's in Midsomer Murders.
OK, look.
I've had a pow-wow with my boss, and how's this?
Sign now and we'll give the place a spruce.
Lose the swirly carpet, get some stripped floorboards, blinds and stuff.
Make it look all catalogue-y.
OK, how long will that take?
Two weeks, tops.
I know a couple of Polish fellas.
Peasant stock.
Very driven.
OK, right.
No, we want to move in now.
Really?
- Please, can we?
- Mitchell?
Yeah, whatever.
But it's... well, look at it!
It's fine.
We wouldn't want to change a thing, would we?
We just can't wait to start... our Hawaiian dream.
- And he's a werewolf?
- Benicio del something.
He's a Spanish actor.
The special effects are amazing, Dad.
I've seen the pictures.
Anyway, there's an 11am screening for OAPs.
I thought you'd feel at home.
I don't know.
Makes it seem trivial.
You liked 'The English Patient'.
Because there weren't any werewolves in 'The English Patient'.
It had elegance.
Is there nudity?
We shouldn't go if there's nudity.
In 'The Wolfman', Dad?
I doubt it.
There's a lady on the poster, but she's wearing a blouse.
Ah, we can't afford two tickets.
I'll sneak you in through the fire exit.
We'd do that when I was a kid.
Fine.
But I want you to have a nap afterwards.
And a proper lunch.
Big day tomorrow.
Where you going?
Bit of window shopping.
You know that funfair we passed?
It's closed down.
There might be copper wire in there.
- Iron, maybe.
Stuff we can sell.
- You want me to cause a distraction?
Tom.
These people, they work for a living.
They're really going to show 'The Wolfman' to a load of OAPs?
Mm-hm.
Even old people are weird now.
Hang about, here he comes.
That's him.
Yeah, that's got to be him, man.
Let's roll.
Ow-wooo!
Come on, doggy!
Where's the other one?
Look...we heard there was two of you... ..so... where... is... he?
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
What do you think?
I had a little left over from the food shop, and I thought it might be nice to have something for, you know, us.
Hence... and hence...
It was either that or...
off-peak gym membership.
You made absolutely the right decision.
Really?
- Ow.
- What?
What?
What is that?
Pen.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Ow!
Hair stuck, glasses...!
Oh, is it?
Oh, shit, sorry.
Oh, hang on, it's really tangled.
Ee, ow!
Wait, wait, wait.
Sssh, don't pull away.
Quickly.
Oh!
- You all right?
- Yeah, fine.
Right, where were we?
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Have you got a radio?
- What?
!
I need a radio.
I have an idea.
- Mitchell.
Ow!
- Mitchell.
What are you doing?
!
Cheers.
Just give me a bloody kiss.
Oh, look, forget about it.
He's ruined everything.
Another night.
Come on, Annie, come on.
Sean Hancock.
Diagnosed a year ago with malignant melanoma.
Secondaries on the brain and lung.
He's on a morphine infusion and maintenance fluids but his condition's deteriorating rapidly.
- We're talking hours now.
- Wait a sec, you're doing this now?
It's a full moon, we've just moved into a new house.
There's enough going on without you crossing over into the afterlife.
We could be waitin weeks for another opportunity like this.
There could be consequences.
I don't care about the consequences, she's our friend and we lost her.
- And I don't want to lose you as well!
- I am doing this.
I'll take everything they've got.
Death, God, the Devil - none of it frightens me!
- I feel totally reassured.
- We all saw Annie on that screen in the cottage, we saw how terrified she is, and this is the only idea we've got.
- Thank you.
- But I want one of us in there with you.
What?
!
Death is a personal, private moment and we're gate-crashing.
I want that man treated with dignity and kindness.
♪ Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu
- # Adonai Echad... #
- What's that you're doing?
It's a prayer.
It's Jewish.
Yeah, I'm not great with religious rituals.
Aw...
Tough.
- Is he even Jewish?
- It doesn't matter.
His body's let him down, medicine's let him down.
It's a gesture of sympathy.
I'm trying to get in the zone here.
I refer you to my earlier statement of "tough".
♪ Shema Yisrael... ♪
I can't remember the rest.
Five letters.
Something, 'A', something, something, something.
The clue is just the letters H I J K L M N O.
Mitchell!
The answer's water.
Yes, it's the letters H to O.
H2O, it's the molecular formula for water.
Get in.
OK, give me another one.
Is that it?
Is he dead now?
That's me.
Shit, I look awful!
Sean, isn't it?
Sean, you've been very ill.
I'm so sorry but I'm afraid you've just died.
- What happens now?
- You're going on a journey.
No, it's OK, it's cool.
I'm coming with you.
Are you...
Death?
No!
No, I'm not Death.
Sean...
Hi.
This is John.
He's going to make sure you get there safely.
What's that?
That's for you.
That's what happens next.
OK, boys, let's get going.
Oh, yeah, you need to get it.
When you're ready, take your time.
Goodbye, Sean.
Is this it?
Is it all over now?
Yeah.
You did good, Sean.
You can rest now.
None of this was your fault.
Anything that happened would have happened a lot sooner and a lot worse if I hadn't have met you.
Just come back.
Mitchell, isn't it?
I'm Lia.
How's it going?
- Where's the guy I was with?
- Sean?
Well, I don't know.
He'll have his own stuff to do.
- You're my guide, then?
- Yes.
What's got two thumbs and just lucked out?
Hello.
No, I've always been lucky.
You should rub me.
I'm serious.
Rub me.
Do you know who I am, "Lia"?
Well, I know you're a vampire.
Can I say that?
Or are you funny about the word?
Because I've got this cousin who's in a wheelchair and I called him disabled once and he ran over my foot.
What else?
Just that you're really hot.
Have we met...before?
H12.
H12?
What does that mean?
It's a riddle.
I love riddles, don't you?
Like the one about the midget.
So there's this midget who gets into a lift and...
I've just given away the answer.
Am I rambling?
So this is Purgatory.
I remember this.
Well, strictly speaking it's your purgatory.
You know we've all got a corridor, filled with all the good things and the bad and... well, you've been busy.
- So... we choose a door?
- Do we?
I'm asking you.
Yes.
It's like a quiz show.
And tonight's star prize - someone's soul.
Frickin' weird quiz show.
After you.
And just so you know, I will be looking at your arse.
- Why are we here?
- I don't even know where here is.
France.
July 17th, 1917.
Who's the guy?
Corporal Arthur Hanley.
- Don't drink that.
- I wasn't going to.
- It's poisoned.
- I wasn't going to.
Poisoned?
I didn't want him to feel any pain.
You killed him?
Shit, so you've been a vampire since... ..since before my dad was born.
- What are you doing?
- Look, Annie isn't here.
- This is a waste of time.
- But we must be here for a reason.
Maybe we're meant to find a clue or something.
Who was he?
Mitchell.
Tell me about the guy.
He was my first.
I was recruited by the vampires about four weeks earlier.
But I ran away, found my regiment again.
I didn't want to believe what had happened to me.
But then the hunger came.
I'd steal from the medical supplies, a little bit every day.
When I had enough,
I slipped it into his tea...
Where are you now?
Running away.
That's my captain.
He thought I was deserting, but...
I was running to find Herrick.
I was one of them now.
How did it make you feel?
How do you think?
I killed my friend.
The shame of that.
The horror.
Knowing what I was now.
You know it's funny, because... most people would've walked into a minefield and found a way to end it all.
But you didn't.
And I think that's really brave.
Sorry, why didn't you do that?
I wasn't going to let it win.
Quite right.
I'm sure that's what Arthur would have wanted.
You running round with lots of girls and stuff for another century.
What?
Arthur wasn't theonly victim, was he?
I don't understand.
You!
You numpty!
You're the other victim.
You had your humanity ripped away from you.
- Right.
Yeah, yeah.
- What did you think I meant?
Nothing.
I knew what you meant.
Actually...
I'm the victim.
A minute ago, you were in here wearing a uniform and I missed it.
- Will you stop?
!
- Mitchell?
Mitchell?
- Annie, I'm here.
- They're getting ready to move me.
They're taking me to the room.
Which room?
There are all these doors...
Which room, Annie?
There's going to be a parade.
They'll scatter ashes in front of me like petals, they said...
I'm coming to get you.
I swear, I'm on my way.
- Annie?
- They're coming.
They've got drums.
They're cheering.
- Annie?
!
- I can hear children cheering.
Must be a concept album.
Hey, look.
Come on.
Spit spot.
What are you doing?
Why have you got a chicken on a string?
No, no, wait.
I want to talk to you!
Whoah!
Whoah, easy soldier.
There was a young guy, he ran through here.
No need to panic, nothing happens till it gets dark.
Now, then, are you here to watch or play?
- Sorry?
Play?
Play what?
- See how the mood takes you.
My sciatica's back, so I'm just going to watch Sue and Peter in the Volvo and touch myself.
Um, no, sorry, there was a young guy, he came through here.
What's this?
Listen, we don't do funny stuff here.
- You'll have to go to Swansea for that.
- Huh?
You'll catch on.
No, I like to think we're a friendly bunch.
We're on MySpace, and last year all the fellas shaved their heads for Comic Relief.
So, that is Alan and Judith.
Now, Judith and I hope she won't mind me telling you this - will give you a tit-wank you'll never forget!
Look, she's blushing.
Sorry, Ju, but credit where credit's due, eh, love?
You don't understand.
There was...
I want a young guy...
So men are your preferred brand?
Well, in that case you'll be wanting Ian in the people carrier.
Now...
Don't move!
Just stop now.
We hadn't started.
Move, move.
- Please leave a message.
- Nina...
I've been arrested.
I don't know what to do.
I've been arrested!
Listen, no.
You have to let me go.
I have a very serious medical condition.
A medical condition, it's serious.
No, please.
No!
Tell me where Annie is.
You're supposed to be my fucking guide, take me to her now!
Oh, that's nice.
Toilet talk.
I'm missing Countryfile for this.
Is this a joke to you?
Jesus Christ...!
There's no point, Mitchell, I'm already dead.
You'll get yourself all hot and sweaty for no...
Actually...try it.
Who are you?
- How do I know you?
- H12.
Why do you keep saying that?
We'd better make tracks.
Which door now for a Brucey Bonus?
I so should have worn a leotard.
OK.
That one.
- Oh, God.
- Where are we now?
Sheffield.
December 24th, 1960.
This is ridiculous.
We're supposed to be finding Annie.
Well, maybe she's hiding.
Yoo-hoo!
- Annie!
- Don't go around there.
Oh.
Guess you ran out of poison.
What was her name?
Sally.
We met in a pub, came back here.
We got pretty drunk.
- It was quite chaotic.
- Mitchell... it's very important that you tell me the truth.
When it got chaotic with Sally, were you topless?
I'm building up an image here that'll come in handy later, if you know what I'm saying!
I'm kidding, I'm kidding!
I'm not.
You know, I'm a bit confused.
With the soldier guy, you'd just become a vampire so it was all new and overwhelming...
- I was a victim.
- Yes, you were a victim, we agreed on that.
But this is different somehow.
You screwed her, I'm guessing.
Then what did you use to kill her?
Oh, my God, you used the pot of her little Christmas tree.
So that's what people mean when they say, "Christmas does my head in!"
- I was out of control.
- You were in control enough to have sex.
- The soldier guy?
- His name was Arthur.
Oh, sorry, sorry.
I should be a bit more respectful about the people you kill.
There was stuff in his room you could've taken, money, but you didn't.
- It was all about the hunger.
- What are you getting at?
Nothing.
I just think it's curious.
With Arthur, it was kind for him and torture for you.
But with Sally,...
there was drinks, there was sex...
Someone could look at this and think you enjoyed it.
Why are you bringing me to these places?
To punish me?
Is that it?
You chose the door.
Next time pick one where you're building an orphanage on the other side.
It's a compulsion.
It WAS a compulsion.
- I'm not that man any more.
- Brilliant.
Then there should be nothing stopping you getting Annie back.
Mitchell!
Mitchell, please!
Mitchell, they're outside!
- Tell me where she is.
- You know what to do.
What are you...?
!
Of course I don't!
What happens next is your choice.
Mitchell, they're coming for me now,
They're going to take me to the room.
Mitchell, please!
I'm frightened...
Coming?
Mitchell, please!
I'm so frightened.
Mitchell...!
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Are you all in for a mauling?
Do the children of the night want to see a fight?
So shall I introduce you to tonight's combatants?
Well, there ain't a lot I can tell you about our first noble warrior on account of the fact we picked him up yesterday and he ain't said a word fucking since.
The silent but violent type,... no doubt.
We're going to welcome him into our bosom, ain't we?
Treat him like a member of the family.
Our pet DOG!
He's hairy, oh, he's scary.
The mute most hirsute.
The canine destined for the big time.
The creature who's plea-ea-eased to meet ya!
Ladies and gentlemen...
..The Beast!
And facing him tonight... plucked from the streets a mere two and a half hours ago.
He doesn't know where he is, bless him.
The Children of Darwin's champion.
The man with the plan.
The spunky monkey.
..Mr Paul Jameson.
..Serious medical condition.
No, please!
No.
Please.
Please, please, please, please you have to let me out.
We'll be fine.
We hadn't even started.
It's a legal grey area.
You all right there, chum?
It's coming.
Oi, soon as he turns, stick him one right in the bollocks.
I've got money on you to live for two minutes.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
A- a-argh!
Hello?
I think there's something wrong with this chap in here.
- Kill me.
- What did you say?
It's the only way you'll survive.
I'm not killing you!
Kill me or I will tear your fucking head off!
Sorry, Miss, you shouldn't be down here.
Have you got someone in custody called George Sands?
Are you a friend of his?
I said to the nine-year-old in reception, he's a patient of mine.
He has a serious medical condition and needs constant supervision and medication.
Did he tell you that he's got a medical condition?
When we processed him, he might have mentioned something.
And you still brought him in.
You didn't think to contact the hospital or...?
- Oh, man, we're going to have fun with you.
- We found him in awell-known dogging location.
That man has serious mental problems.
He's a...
Oh...!
He's...basically nuts, OK?
And it's, um, it's, it's...
contagious.
- Are you all right, Miss?
- No, I am...really annoyed.
Gareth, maybe we should...sort of let this lady have him.
- Yeah, I think that would be a good idea...
Argh!
- Get his belongings.
No, this isn't anything to do with...what was going on.
Listen, I never...
Ah, come on!
Oh, good.
All right, George?
Right, let's get you ba-a-a-ack to the ward.
But don't think for a moment that you've heard the last of this.
Thank you.
- Dogging?
You were caught dogging?
- We need to find somewhere to transform.
I only got your message because I went upstairs to use the toilet.
No.
There is something down here.
You can transform in here.
- What will you do?
- I don't know.
But we can't be together, we'll kill each other.
We haven't got a choice.
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry for all this.
I know.
A- a-a-agh!
We could have had the house redecorated after all.
Oh, shit, yes.
I love you.
I love you too.
- A- a-a-a-gh!
- A- a-a-a-gh!
..Four, three, two, one... full moon!
You don't have to do this.
You could go back to George and your old life and say you tried to get Annie back but it was impossible.
They'll understand.
It was brave of you to even try.
No.
I need to do this.
OK, then.
End of the line.
I've got to say I was kind of hurt that you didn't recognise me, given you remembered so much about the other two.
I guess you were a bit preoccupied that night.
Yeah, so...
What?
I didn't catch that.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you're sorry!
I couldn't help it.
I was angry and...
- The hunger...
- Yeah, yeah.
No control.
It's a compulsion.
Blah, blah, blah.
Anyway,...
let me introduce you to the guys.
Your "twelve good men and true", although there is twenty of us, and nine are women.
But I'll crack on.
So this is Donna.
She was a primary school teacher.
All the kids in her class have been having nightmares since you killed her.
Some have even needed counselling.
Funny, isn't it - the ripples of your actions?
That's Glenn, the driver.
Your first victim, remember him?
Five kids, can you believe it?
And that's Mary.
She'd just recovered from breast cancer.
She was given a whole new lease of life, she was.
Until you tore her throat out, obviously.
And next to her is Dean...
Please... please stop.
I don't know what I can say.
Don't say anything.
Because every word that comes out of your mouth is a fucking excuse.
It's misdirection.
- I'm not trying to trick you.
- Not us.
- You're lying to yourself.
- I'm trying to change.
How's that working out for you?
- It wasn't just me, anyway, it was Daisy.
- You're doing it again.
I was 22.
I had a peanut allergy.
I wanted to be a vet.
I had a little brother that I loved more than anything in the world.
Those are the things that make a human being.
Do you taste THEM in our blood?
The arrogance, to call yourself the victim!
How dare you insult us like that!
I didn't mean to insult you.
- You were flirting with me.
- I just wanted you to like me.
And there we have it!
You want forgiveness, every day.
You get a smile from me, and it proves you're not completely evil.
You do a thousand small nice things and you put them against the bad.
You actually do the sums in your head, don't you?
Why did you come here?
- For Annie or for you?
- For Annie.
Crossing into Purgatory.
That's a big deposit in the 'good' account.
- No, I just want Annie back.
- Which one of us does that wipe off the slate?
Donna?
Glenn?
Me?
None of you.
- I don't know what you want me to do.
- I want you to stop hiding.
I'm not hiding.
"I'm a victim.
I'm better now.
Daisy made me do it."
- I'm not...
- You're not what?
- I'm not a victim.
- So you're what?
What, misunderstood?
I'm an animal!
I don't deserve mercy or forgiveness.
I'm a murderer.
I couldn't help myself.
I loved it.
The sensation, the power.
I was dead but I'd never felt so alive.
I wasn't human any more.
I'd lost my conscience, I was free and that's what I was addicted to.
I hacked my way through the world.
I left a trail of blood a thousand miles long.
And I loved it.
I'm a disease.
I'm a plague.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Budge up.
You can have Annie back.
But there's a price.
I'll stay.
I want you to take me to all my victims.
I want to feel it.
I want to suffer.
I don't want to hide any more.
I just want her back.
It's not that simple.
The time and cause of your death have already been set but there are things that need to happen first.
You see, you're the final piece in someone else's story.
And they need to complete their journey, and in order to do that... ..they have to kill you.
What?
You're going to be killed by a werewolf.
A wolf-shaped bullet.
Bang.
Who?
- We'll see you soon, Mitchell.
- You're letting me go?
Well, as punishments go, it's pretty cruel and interesting, isn't it?
Loving that arse!
Oh, oh, oh!
- Hey, what's all this?
- Oh!
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
For a second I thought...
No.
It's OK, baby, we're OK.
- Oo...!
Oo!
- Someone needs a Tic-Tac.
- Wolf breath!
- Oo!
Come on, let's get going.
When we transformed, did we...?
Oh.
Nice.
Annie, isn't it?
I'm Lia.
Sorry about all this palaver.
It's been chaos here.
Lots of people turning up early, everyone's in a bit of a tizz.
You're going to take me to the room now?
Oh, the train station.
Oh, sorry, this was for my three o'clock.
No, you're free to go.
- I...
I can go?
Really?
- Yeah.
You will still be dead.
I should make that clear.
Your body... you know... it's been over two years, nobody really wants to see that.
And, um... will I come back here one day?
Well, we all end up here eventually.
The problem with you was, you came through the wrong door.
But next time, you'll come through the right one and it'll be Boggle and pina coladas 24/7.
Well, spit-spot.
Mitchell's waiting.
Is anything going on between you guys?
I mean, he came to Purgatory to find you.
Puts my ex-boyfriend's tattoo into perspective.
We're just friends.
You'd be so adorable, you two.
I could eat you up.
- I'm dead.
- So is he.
I think it's meant to happen.
I think it's fate.
What happened to you, Lia?
A very bad thing.
It's OK.
We play the long game here.
Mitchell?
Mitchell!
You saved me.
You saved me too.
And what happened?
Did you...?
Was there like, I don't know, some kind of trade-off?
Nothing.
There was nothing.
Mind games, that's all.
I don't believe a word of it.
Um...where are we?
This isn't Bristol.
No.
That's the, um, the other thing.
We've sort of moved to Wales.
- Wales?
!
- Yeah, Barry Island.
I want to go back.
- To Bristol?
- No, to Purgatory!
My name is Annie Claire Sawyer and two years ago I died.
But in so many ways, that's when my life began.
In the company of horrors, I learnt about friendship and loyalty, sacrifice and courage.
Humanity isn't a species, it's a state of mind.
It can't be defeated - it moves mountains, it saves souls.
We were blessed as much as we were cursed.
In this little enclave of the lost...
..I witnessed the very best of being human.
We were safe here...
..while outside, the monsters prowled.
You lost me 50 quid.
But am I cross?
No.
No, I'm not, as it goes, cos it's clear to me you've got exceptional talent.
You're what's known in the trade as a real animal.
I'm going to look after you.
Get you a chewy toy... ..a bowl?
Are you hungry?
Hm?
No?
Well, you had a late supper, didn't you?
Hmm.
My name... ..is McNair.
McNair.
McNair the Bear would be a good name if you were a bear, but you're not, you're a dog!
You're MY dog, my mad dog,
Mad Dog McNair.
Oi, did you hear me?
Mad Dog McNair.
No, you misunderstand.
You see, I told you my name... ..because I want it to be the last thing you ever hear.
A- a-a-rgh!
Stake and chips, anyone?
- How did you know I was here?
- Spidey sense, Dad.
- It wasn't your fault.
- Right, come on.
There's more coming.
Tom.
Dad, I saw another one.
There's another one of us.
You're a worringly easy man to find.
I'm here to discuss the Box Tunnel twenty.
Do you want to know what I am feeling, George?
Hungry.
There's a wolf-shaped bullet with his name on it.
- Mitchell's going to get got.
- How am I going to manage if he's all...?
Let's go out with the lads, find some women, drink them dry.

We're not coming back here again, are we?
I'll show you retaliation.
(SCREAMING)
Spirit, I command you leave here.
- (SCREAMS)
- No, no!
- Christ compels you.
- No!
Please!
No, I'm not ready!
No, no, Annie.
No!
No!
No!
I don't know what we're waiting for to happen.
Don't forget me, will you?
I have to go.
What do we do?
We're going to get her back.
So she dies, and six months later, he dies.
That's Catholics for you.
So it goes to the son.
I says to him, "You want to get rid."
He fancies himself as a landlord now.
I says, "You've been watching too much Property Ladder."
He just shrugs and scratches himself with his keys.
So, um, it was, um, it was a bed and breakfast?
I saw their ad in the free paper.
"A slice of heaven in Barry."
I bet heaven doesn't have chemical toilets.
- So, it's the three of you, is it?
- A friend will be joining us.
Well, that's...
Yeah, we hope so.
It's... it's not definite.
No, no, she should be here pretty soon.
I don't know what's taking her so long.
Do what you want, as long as the rent's covered.
We've been trying to shift this place for months.
I reckon it's haunted.
No, there's nothing here.
Do you know what really, really excited us?
It was the, um...
It was the basement gym.
- Oh, yeah.
- See, she's excited.
Could we...
Could we have a have a look?
Depends on how good you are at handling disappointment.
Come on.
I'll just go this way.
(DINGS BELL) Basil!
Four weeks since the attack in Box Tunnel that left 20 people dead, and the police have yet to make an arrest.
However... (INTERFERENCE ON TV)
Mitchell?
Mitchell?
Can you hear me?
- Annie!
- Help, Mitchell, I'm so scared.
Oh, my God, can you see me?
Are you OK?
Oh, God, Annie...
I think "gym" was more a statement of intent.
Is it sound?
Is it soundproof?
Is it soundproof?
It's just, um, I can get pretty... (ROARS) when I'm, um, working out.
"Feel the burn!" "Who's your daddy?"
- (CHUCKLES) "Say what you see."
- Oh, God.
(PHONE RINGS)
Do you want me to get his nibs from upstairs?
Oh, no, you're fine, we're cool.
They're looking at it now.
I don't know, English or something.
Working at the hospital, apparently.
Isn't it brilliant?
We can transform in here.
Not at the same time, obviously, but you can have it for the full moon tomorrow.
I thought we were transforming in the country.
Yeah, at a last resort.
We don't know the area.
We'd have to find two separate places, miles apart.
No, this is ideal.
I thought this is what you wanted - a place of our own.
Yeah, but it isn't, is it?
It's you, me and Count Dupree upstairs.
He saved our lives.
He's changed.
Something's...
Something's happened to him.
You must have noticed.
We've lost Annie, we're all over the place.
(SIGHS)
They call this the waiting room.
We wait here until... they know where they want us to go.
Have they told you where?
They're going to build a special room, just for me...
They're going to lock the door and they're going to burn the key.
- What... what does that mean?
- It's hell, Mitchell.
They're going to take me to hell.
Annie, Annie, listen to me.
I'm coming to get you.
- We just need to find out what...
- Ta-ra now.
I know.
There's tit-all on, these days.
Thank God for Terry Pratchett is all I'm saying.
Annie was there.
She was on the screen.
- What?
You're kidding.
- Is she OK?
What did she say?
We're running out of time.
Um...
It's... it's our friend.
She's... she's in...
Midsomer Murders.
OK, look.
I've had a powwow with my boss, and how's this?
Sign now and we'll give the place a spruce.
Lose the swirly carpet, get some stripped floorboards, blinds and stuff.
Make it look all catalogue-y.
OK, how long will that take?
Two weeks, tops.
I know a couple of Polish fellas.
Peasant stock.
Very driven.
- OK, right.
No, we want to move in now.
- Really?
- Please, can we?
- Mitchell?
Yeah, whatever.
But it's...
Well, look at it!
It's fine.
We wouldn't want to change a thing, would we?
We...
We just can't wait to start... um... our Hawaiian dream.
(HE CHUCKLES)
- And he's a werewolf?
- Benicio Del something.
He's a Spanish actor.
The special effects are amazing, Dad.
I've seen the pictures.
Anyway, there's an 11 am screening for OAPs.
I thought you'd feel at home.
Ah...
I don't know.
Makes it seem trivial.
You liked The English Patient.
Because there weren't any werewolves in The English Patient.
It had elegance.
Is there nudity?
We shouldn't go if there's nudity.
- In The Wolfman, Dad?
- Hmm.
I doubt it.
There's a lady on the poster, but she's wearing a blouse.
Ah, we can't afford two tickets.
I'll sneak you in through the fire exit.
We'd do that when I was a kid.
Fine.
But I want you to have a nap afterwards.
And a proper lunch.
Big day tomorrow.
Where are you going?
Bit of window shopping.
You know that funfair we passed?
It's closed down.
There might be copper wire in there.
- Iron, maybe.
Stuff we can sell.
- You want me to cause a distraction?
Tom, these people, they work for a living.
Cheers, Dad.
They're really going to show The Wolfman to a load of OAPs?
Mm-hm.
Even old people are weird now.
Hang about, here he comes.
That's him.
Yeah, that's got to be him, man.
Let's roll.
Ow-wooo!
Come on, doggy!
Where's the other one?
Look... we heard there was two of you... so... where... is... he?
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
(MUSIC PLAYS SOFTLY ON RADIO)
(CLEARS THROAT) What do you think?
Mmm?
I had a little left over from the food shop, and I thought it might be nice to have something for, you know, us.
Hence... (CLEARS THROAT)... and hence...
It was either that or off-peak gym membership.
You made absolutely the right decision.
- Really?
- Mmm.
(SHE GIGGLES)
- Ow!
- What?
What?
What is that?
- Oh.
- Pen.
(SHE CLEARS HER THROAT)
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Ow!
Hair stuck, glasses!
- Oh, is it?
Oh.
Oh, shit, sorry.
Oh, hang on, it's really tangled.
- George!
Ee, ah!
- It's really tangled.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Sssh, don't pull away.
- Quickly!
- OK!
- Ohh!
- You all right?
- Yeah, fine.
Right, where were we?
- Hello.
- Hello.
(FOOTSTEPS)
- Have you got a radio?
- What?
!
- I need a radio.
I have an idea.
- Mitchell.
- Ow!
- Ow!
Mitchell.
What are you doing?
!
Cheers.
(SHE GASPS)
Just give me a bloody kiss.
- Oh, look, forget about it.
- He's just ruined everything.
Fine!
Another night.
Come on, Annie, come on.

Sean Hancock.
Diagnosed a year ago with malignant melanoma.
Secondaries in the brain and lung.
He's on a morphine infusion and maintenance fluids, but his condition's deteriorating rapidly.
- We're talking hours now.
- Wait a sec...
You're doing this now?
It's a full moon, we've just moved into a new house.
There's enough going on without you crossing over into the afterlife.
We could be waiting weeks for another opportunity like this.
There could be consequences.
I don't care.
She's our friend and we lost her.
- I don't want to lose you as well!
- I am doing this.
I'll take everything they've got.
Death, God, the Devil - none of it frightens me!
Right, well, I feel totally reassured(!
)
Look, we all saw Annie on that screen, we saw how terrified she is, and this is the only idea we've got.
- Thank you.
- But I want one of us in there with you.
What?
!
Death is a personal, private moment and we're gate-crashing.
I want that man treated with dignity and kindness.
(LABOURED BREATHING)
# Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad... #
What's that you're doing?
- It's a prayer.
It's Jewish.
- Yeah...
I'm not great with religious rituals.
Aw.
Tough(!
)
- # Shema... #
- Is he even Jewish?
It doesn't matter.
His body's let him down, medicine's let him down.
- It's a gesture of sympathy.
- I'm trying to get in the zone here.
I refer you to my earlier statement of "tough".
# Shema Yisrael... #
I can't remember the rest.
Five letters.
Something, A, something, something, something.
The clue is just the letters H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O.
Mitchell!
The answer's "water".
Yes, it's the letters H to O.
H2O - it's the molecular formula for water.
Get in.
OK, give me another one.
(GASPS)
(MONITOR BEEPS)
- (MONITOR EMITS CONSTANT TONE)
- Is that it?
Is he dead now?
That's me!
Shit, I look awful!
MITCHELL:
Sean, isn't it?
Sean, you've been very ill.
I'm so sorry, but I'm afraid you've just died.
- What happens now?
- You're going on a journey.
No, it's OK, it's cool.
I'm coming with you.
Are you...
Death?
No!
No, I'm not Death.
Sean...
- Hi.
- This is John.
He's going to make sure you get there safely.
(SINISTER WHOOSHING)
What's that?
That's for you.
That's what happens next.
OK, boys, let's get going.
(MITCHELL SHIVERS THEN EXHALES)
Oh, yeah, you need to get it.
When you're ready...
Take your time.
Goodbye, Sean.
Is this it?
Is it all over now?
Yeah.
You did good, Sean.
You can rest now.
None of this was your fault.
Anything that happened would have happened a lot sooner and a lot worse if I hadn't had met you.
Just come back.
Mitchell, isn't it?
I'm Lia.
How's it going?
- Where's the guy I was with?
- Sean?
Well, I don't know.
He'll have his own stuff to do.
- You're my guide, then?
- Yes.
What's got two thumbs and just lucked out?
Hello!
No, I've always been lucky.
You should rub me.
(GIGGLES)
I'm serious.
Rub me.
Do you know who I am...
Lia?
Well, I know you're a vampire.
Can I say that?
Or are you funny about the word?
Because I've got this cousin who's in a wheelchair and I called him disabled once - he ran over my foot!
What else?
Just that you're... really hot.
Have we met... before?
H12.
H12?
What does that mean?
It's a riddle.
I love riddles, don't you?
Like the one about the midget.
So there's this midget who gets into a lift and...
I've just given away the answer.
Am I rambling?
So this is purgatory.
I remember this.
Well, strictly speaking, it's your purgatory.
We've all got a corridor, filled with all the good things and the bad, and...
Well, you've been busy.
So... we choose a door?
Do we?
I'm asking you.
Yes.
It's like a quiz show.
And tonight's star prize - someone's soul.
Frickin' weird quiz show.
After you.
And just so you know, I will be looking at your arse.
(# CRACKLY RECORDING OF "Keep The Home Fires Burning")
- Why are we here?
- I don't even know where here is.
France.
July 17th, 1917.
Who's the guy?
Corporal Arthur Hanley.
Don't drink that.
- I wasn't going to.
- It's poisoned.
I wasn't going to.
Poisoned?
I didn't want him to feel any pain.
You killed him?
Shit!
So you've been a vampire since... well, since before my dad was born.
(DOOR RATTLING)
What are you doing?
Look, Annie isn't here.
This is a waste of time.
Well, we must be here for a reason.
Maybe we're meant to find a clue, or something.
Who was he?
Mitchell!
Tell me about the guy.
He was my first.
I was recruited by the vampires about four weeks earlier.
But I ran away...
found my regiment again.
I didn't want to believe what had happened to me.
But then the hunger came.
I'd steal from the medical supplies, a little bit every day.
When I had enough...
I slipped it into his tea...
- (GUNSHOT, MAN SHOUTING)
Where are you now?
Running away.
That's my captain.
He thought I was deserting, but...
I was running to find Herrick.
I was one of them now.
How did it make you feel?
How do you think?
I killed my friend.
The shame of that.
The horror, knowing what I was now.
You know, it's funny, because most people would've walked into a minefield and found a way to end it all.
But you didn't.
And I think that's really brave.
Sorry - why didn't you do that?
I wasn't going to let it win.
Quite right!
I'm sure that's what Arthur would have wanted.
You running around with lots of girls and stuff for another century.
What?
Arthur wasn't the only victim, was he?
I don't understand.
You!
You numpty!
You're the other victim.
You had your humanity ripped away from you.
- Right.
Yeah, yeah.
- What did you think I meant?
Nothing.
I knew what you meant.
Actually...
I'm the victim.
A minute ago, you were in here wearing a uniform, and I missed it.
- Will you stop?

- OVER RADIO:

Mitchell?
- Annie, I'm here.
- They're getting ready to move me.
They're taking me to the room.
Which room?
There are all these doors...
Which room, Annie?
There's going to be a parade.
They'll scatter ashes in front of me like petals, they said...
I'm coming to get you.
I swear, I'm on my way.
- (WHIMPERS)
- Annie?
They're coming.
They've got drums.
They're cheering.
- Annie!
- I can hear children cheering.
Must be a concept album.
Hey, look.
Come on.

No, no, wait.
I want to talk to you!

Easy, soldier.
There was a young guy, he ran through here.
No need to panic, nothing happens till it gets dark.
Now, then, are you here to watch or play?
- Sorry?
Play?
Play what?
- See how the mood takes you.
My sciatica's back, so I'm just going to watch Sue and Peter in the Volvo, and touch myself.
Um, no, um...
Sorry, there was a young guy...
- Whoa, what's this?
...he just came through...
Listen, we don't do funny stuff here.
- You'll have to go to Swansea for that.
- Huh?
You'll catch on.
No, I like to think we're a friendly bunch.
We're on Myspace, and last year, all the fellas shaved their heads for Comic Relief.

- Please leave a message.
- Nina.
I've been arrested.
I don't know what to do.
I've been arrested!
Listen...
No, listen...
You have to let me go.
I have a very serious medical condition.
A medical condition, it's serious.
No!
Mitchell!
Tell me where Annie is.
You're supposed to be my fucking guide.
Take me to her now!
Oh, that's nice.
Toilet talk.
I'm missing Countryfile for this.
Is this a joke to you?
Jesus Christ!
There's no point, Mitchell, I'm already dead.
You'll get yourself all hot and sweaty for no...
Actually... try it.
Who are you?
- How do I know you?
- H12.
Why do you keep saying that?
We'd better make tracks.
Which door now for a Brucey Bonus?
I so should have worn a leotard.
OK.
That one.
(BRASS BAND PLAYING A CAROL)
- Oh, God.
- Where are we now?
Sheffield.
December 24th 1960.
This is ridiculous.
We're supposed to be finding Annie.
Well, maybe she's hiding.
Yoo-hoo!
- Annie!
- Don't go around there.
Oh.
I guess you ran out of poison.
What was her name?
S-S-Sally.
We met in a pub, came back here.
We got pretty drunk.
- It was quite chaotic.
- Mitchell... it's very important that you tell me the truth.
When it got chaotic with Sally, were you topless?
I'm building up an image here that'll come in handy later, if you know what I'm saying!
(GIGGLES)
I'm kidding, I'm kidding!
I'm not.
You know, I'm a bit confused.
With the soldier guy, you'd just become a vampire, so it was all new and overwhelming...
I was a victim.
Yes, you were a victim, we agreed on that.
But this is different somehow.
You screwed her, I'm guessing.
Then what did you use to kill her?
Oh, my God!
You used the pot of her little Christmas tree.
So that's what people mean when they say, "Christmas does my head in!"
- I was out of control.
- You were in control enough to have sex.
- The soldier guy?
- His name was Arthur.
Oh, sorry, sorry.
I should be a bit more respectful about the people you kill.
There was stuff in his room you could have taken - money - but you didn't.
- It was all about the hunger.
- What are you getting at?
Nothing.
I just think it's curious.
With Arthur, it was kind for him and torture for you.
But with Sally, there was drinks, there was sex...
Someone could look at this and think you enjoyed it.
Why are you bringing me to these places?
To punish me?
Is that it?
You chose the door.
Next time, pick one where you're building an orphanage on the other side.
It's a compulsion.
It was a compulsion.
- I am not that man any more.
- Brilliant!
Then there should be nothing stopping you from getting Annie back.

Have you got someone in custody called George Sands?
Are you a friend of his?
As I said to the nine-year-old in reception, he's a patient of mine.
He has a serious medical condition and needs constant supervision and medication.
Did he tell you that he's got a medical condition?
Well, when we processed him, he might have mentioned something.
And you still brought him in.
You didn't think to contact the hospital or?
Oh, man, we're going to have fun with you.
We found him in a well-known dogging location.
(SCREAMING)

It was brave of you to even try.
No.
I need to do this.
OK, then.
End of the line.
I've got to say I was kind of hurt that you didn't recognise me, given you remembered so much about the other two.
I guess you were a bit preoccupied that night.

- What?
I didn't catch that.
- I'm sorry.
Oh, you're sorry?
I couldn't help it.

Blah, blah, blah.
Anyway, let me introduce you to the guys.
Your 12 good men and true.
Although there is 20 of us, and nine are women, but I'll crack on.
So this is Donna.
She was a primary school teacher.
All the kids in her class have been having nightmares since you killed her.
Some have even needed counselling.
Funny, isn't it - the ripples of your actions?
That's Glenn, the driver.
Your first victim.
Remember him?
Five kids - can you believe it?
And that's Mary.
She'd just recovered from breast cancer.
She was given a whole new lease of life, she was.
Until you tore her throat out, obviously.
Next to her is Dean...
Please... please stop.
I don't know what I can say.
Don't say anything.
Because every word that comes out of your mouth is a fucking excuse.
It's misdirection.
- I'm not trying to trick you.
- Not us.
- You're lying to yourself.
- I'm trying to change.
(LAUGHS)
How's that working out for you?
- It wasn't just me, anyway.
It was Daisy.
- Oh, you're doing it again.
I was 22.
I had a peanut allergy.
I wanted to be a vet.
I had a little brother that I loved more than anything in the world.
Those are the things that make a human being.
Do you taste them in our blood?
The arrogance, to call yourself the victim!
- How dare you insult us like that!
- I didn't mean to insult you.
- You were flirting with me.
- I just wanted you to like me.
And there we have it!
You want forgiveness every day.
You get a smile from me, and it proves you're not completely evil.
You do a thousand small, nice things and you put them against the bad.
You actually do the sums in your head, don't you?
Why did you come here?
- For Annie, or for you?
- For Annie.
Crossing into purgatory - that's a big deposit in the good account.
No, I just want Annie back.
Which one of us does that wipe off the slate?
Donna?
Glenn?
Me?
None of you.
It...
- I don't know what you want me to do.
- I want you to stop hiding!
I'm not hiding.
"I'm a victim.
I'm better now.
Daisy made me do it."
- I'm not...
- You're not what?
I'm not a victim.
So you're what?
What?
Misunderstood?
I'm an animal!
I don't deserve mercy or forgiveness.
I'm a murderer.
I couldn't help myself.
I loved it.
The sensation, the power.
I was dead, but I'd never felt so alive.
I wasn't human any more.
I'd lost my conscience, I was free, and that's what I was addicted to.
I hacked my way through the world.
I left a trail of blood a thousand miles long.
And I loved it.
I'm a disease.
I'm a plague.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Budge up.
You can have Annie back.
But there's a price.
I'll stay.
I want you to take me to all my victims.
I want to feel it.
I want to suffer.
I don't want to hide any more.
I just want her back.
It's not that simple.
The time and cause of your death have already been set, but there are things that need to happen first.
You see, you're the final piece in someone else's story.
And they need to complete their journey, and in order to do that... they have to kill you.
What?
(SOFTLY) You're going to be killed by a werewolf.
A wolf-shaped bullet.
Bang.
Who?
(CHUCKLES)
- We'll see you soon, Mitchell.
- You're letting me go?
Well, as punishments go, it's pretty cruel and interesting, isn't it?
(SPITS)
Loving that arse!
Oh, oh, oh!
- Hey, what's all this?
- Oh!
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
For a second I thought...
No.
It's OK, baby, we're OK.
- Ew!
- Ooh-hoo-hoo!
- Someone needs a tic tac.
- Wolf breath!
Ew!
Come on, let's get going.
When we transformed, did... did we?
Oh.
Nice.
Annie, isn't it?
I'm Lia.
Sorry about all this palaver.
It's been chaos here.
Lots of people turning up early, everyone's in a bit of a tizz.
You're going to take me to the room now?
Oh, the train station.
Oh, sorry!
This was for my three o'clock.
No, you're free to go.
- I...
I can go?
Really?
- Yeah.
You will still be dead.
I should make that clear.
Your body... you know...
It's been over two years, nobody really wants to see that.
And, um... will I come back here one day?
Well, we all end up here eventually.
The problem with you was, you came through the wrong door, but next time, you'll come through the right one, and it'll be Boggle and piña coladas 24/7.
Well, spit-spot.
Mitchell's waiting.
Is anything going on between you guys?
I mean, he came to purgatory to find you.
Puts my ex-boyfriend's tattoo into perspective.
We're just friends.
You'd be so adorable, you two.
I could eat you up.
- I'm dead.
- So is he.
I think it's meant to happen.
I think it's... fate.
What happened to you, Lia?
A very bad thing.
But it's OK.
We play the long game here.
Mitchell?
Mitchell!
You saved me.
You saved me, too.
And what happened?
Did you?
Was there, like, I don't know, some kind of trade-off?
Nothing.
There was nothing.
Mind games, that's all.
I don't believe a word of it.
Um... where are we?
This isn't Bristol.
No. (COUGHS) That's the, um, the other thing.
We've sort of moved to Wales.
- Wales?
!
- Yeah, Barry Island.
I want to go back.
- To Bristol?
- No, to purgatory!
My name is Annie Claire Sawyer, and two years ago I died.
But in so many ways, that's when my life began.
In the company of horrors, I learnt about friendship and loyalty, sacrifice and courage.
(INAUDIBLE)
Humanity isn't a species, it's a state of mind.
It can't be defeated - it moves mountains, it saves souls.
We were blessed as much as we were cursed.
In this little enclave of the lost...
I witnessed the very best of being human.
We were safe here... while outside, the monsters prowled.
You lost me 50 quid.
But am I cross?
No.
No, I'm not, as it goes, cos it's clear to me that you've got exceptional talent.
You're what's known in the trade as a real animal.
I'm going to look after you.
Get you a chewy toy... a bowl...
Are you hungry?
Hm?
No?
Well, you had a late supper, didn't you?
(LAUGHS)
Hmm.
My name... is McNair.
McNair...
McNair the Bear would be a good name if you were a bear, but you're not, you're a dog!
You're my dog.
My mad dog.
Mad Dog McNair.
Oi, what do you reckon?
Mad Dog McNair.
No, you misunderstand.
You see, I told you my name... because I want it to be the last thing you ever hear.
(SCREAMING AND SQUELCHING)
(GURGLING)
Stake and chips, anyone?
(GURGLING)
(CRACKING)
- How did you know I was here?
- Spidey sense, Dad.
- It wasn't your fault.
- Right, come on.
There's more coming.
Tom.
Dad, I saw another one.
There's another one of us.
You're a worryingly easy man to find.
I'm here to discuss the Box Tunnel 20.
Do you want to know what I'm feeling, George?
Hungry. (HISSES)
There's a wolf-shaped bullet with his name on it.
Mitchell's going to get got.
How am I going to manage if he's giving it all...
"Let's go out with the lads, find some women, drink them dry. "
The events and characters in this show have been fictionalised based on history.
MAGNIFICENT CENTURY
Guess who this is.
-Lady Daye!
-Yes!
This one?
Dance, dance, dance.
Who is this?
Sümbül!
Do it again!
Dance, dance, dance.
How could he do this to me?
I was his one true love!
How?
Please, my sultan.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
I wish I hadn't told you what happened.
Mahidevran?
What happened?
Why are you crying?
Look what happened, Hatice.
Here I am waiting for him tonight and His Majesty is in his chamber with a Russian slave.
My brother is the padishah.
We can't discuss his choices.
It is not for us.
Mahidevran.
You are a haseki.
His favourite woman.
Don't act like an inexperienced concubine.
And who is this?
Overseer Nigar.
Hürrem.
"Hümrem.
Hümrem."
Hürrem.
Say it again.
Hürrem.
What does it mean?
Hürrem?
Hürrem means the one who makes us smile.
From now on, your name is Hürrem.
Alexandra is here.
Alex!
What happened?
How was it, Alex?
Tell us!
It's been two days.
Why didn't the sultan let you go?
What did he tell you?
Come on, Alex!
Tell us!
-Come on, Alex!
-I am not Alex anymore.
There is no Alexandra.
Everyone will call me Hürrem.
Hürrem.
Do you understand?
Where did this come from?
Did the angels tell you so?
Sultan Süleyman whispered it into my ear last night.
Hürrem.
Hürrem.
Hürrem, he said.
Alexandra died.
Hürrem was born.
İbrahim, we're not going to the school, right?
No.
We are going to the mosque for the Friday prayer.
Then we will hear the people, for their wishes and praises.
Am I going to pray too?
Yes, it will be your lesson for today.
You will learn how to perform a prayer.
From now on, you will pray every Friday with His Majesty at Hagia Sophia.
I will pray for my father, I want him to love me play with me and take me hunting.
Sümbül Agha is here.
He awaits an audience.
Why are you late, Sümbül Agha?
I've been waiting since this morning.
What did the chief soothsayer say?
He said it was too long to say, so he wrote it down.
Read it to me.
"We asked about Sultan Süleyman Khan our tenth padishah who ascended the throne 10 centuries after the Hegira.
The fact that we have 10 fingers and 10 toes and the fact that the Holy Book was revealed in 10 chapters in the tenth month the fact that the Old Testament has 10 commandments that our prophet spread Islam with his 10 followers shows that our tenth padishah represents the perfect number...
Hagia Sophia ...and that he is the caliph of Allah on Earth that he will own every land from where the sun rises to where it sets.
We have concluded that he is a person that comes once in a century, and his reign will go beyond the land and the sea."
My padishah!
My padishah!
My padishah!
My padishah!
My padishah!
Long live the padishah and the empire!
Don't be arrogant, Allah is greater!
Long live the padishah!
May your sword be sharp!
Long live the padishah!
Don't be proud, my padishah!
Allah is greater than you!
May your sword be sharp!
Tell me.
Come on.
So strong.
And so handsome.
You spent two nights there.
What did you do?
I told you it was not going to be one night, but 1001 nights.
I knew you could do it.
You love me, right?
You wouldn't put a spell on me.
Pack your things, Alexandra.
You are moving out of the wing.
You will have a new chamber.
My name is Hürrem.
Alexandra is forbidden.
His Majesty gave her the name.
We are supposed to call her Hürrem.
If that's the name she is given, we will call her that.
Hürrem is not a Russian slave anymore, she is now a favourite concubine.
Here you go, Lady Daye.
Hürrem.
Lady Hürrem.
Our sultan sent this for you.
Kiss her hand, fool.
Thank her.
His Majesty sent you a gift.
Hürrem?
Yes.
His Majesty gave her the name.
She said we have to call her Hürrem now.
She said, "Alexandra died.
Hürrem was born."
Hürrem.
Hürrem with the eyes of a snake.
The snake.
Don't act like a child.
Be smart.
Elevation to this floor and this chamber is important.
But staying here and going further is more important.
You have many rivals.
They will try laying traps for you.
Keep your eyes open.
Don't fight everyone.
Who am I talking to?
You are just playing.
This is no place for games.
Let's dance!
Hürrem!
Good job.
Come on, Mustafa!
Hold it tighter, Mustafa!
Strike!
Your Majesty.
These are the Friday petitions.
Would you like to see them?
Of course.
Let's see what my subjects want.
Pick one and read it.
Come on, Mustafa!
"Your Majesty we are merchants in Galata.
We trade in cotton.
But the taxes bear hard on us.
We are aware that paying taxes to the empire is our duty.
But the Venetians buy cheap goods from us and sell our goods abroad for large profits since they pay less customs tax.
We surrender ourselves to your justice."
Did you hear that, Piri Pasha?
What did I tell you?
Double the taxes for the Venetians.
And lower the merchants' minimum price.
I will deliver your orders to the chief treasurer.
Any more, Pargalı?
The Janissaries and Akinjis want to go on campaign.
A big one.
They are saying, "The infidels have large spoils of war waiting to be taken.
We should go and take it."
Just yesterday, Ferhat Pasha took 7000 janissaries to deal with that traitor Canberdi Gazali.
A large campaign requires long preparation.
Rhodes is my first goal.
When the navy and the cannons are ready I will conquer Rhodes which my late father and grandfather failed to conquer.
Come on, Mustafa!
Strike!
Where is my Mustafa?
He left with İbrahim this morning.
He was going to be with His Majesty during the Friday Parade.
Mustafa is your treasure.
He should have your full attention.
His happiness and a good upbringing.
You will always be happy, Mahidevran.
I don't want to see a sad sultan in this harem.
Hatice, my daughter.
Get everyone together for tonight.
Let's plan an entertainment with music and food.
It would cheer us all up.
That would be great.
I'll take care of it and tell Daye.
If you allow me, I would like to check on Mustafa.
Wait, I'm coming too.
I want to see everyone with a smile at the dinner.
Of course, Mother.
Excuse me.
You played the violin beautifully last night.
I've missed it.
Hürrem loved it too.
She asked about you.
-Hürrem?
-Alexandra is no more.
I named her Hürrem.
Hürrem means joyful, cheerful and bright.
Very poetic.
You gave her a beautiful name, Your Majesty.
Hürrem might make me take up writing poems again.
It's time to wake Muhibbi up.
Muhibbi's poems are high literature.
Muhibbi says:
My friend, I sent my heart out to you.
It is impossible for it to come back again.
Your eyebrows are like a bow.
Whenever you point your arrow at my heart I wouldn't call myself a man if I didn't put my chest forward to the head of that arrow.
O friend!
You have my heart.
If you are coming to take my life now I have already given it up for this cause.
Even I forgot it, how did you remember?
Nice poem.
This Muhibbi guy seems like a decent poet, right?
Look, look, look.
Beg for forgiveness or I'll take your head!
Forgive me, my prince.
Spare my life.
Father, I beat your soldiers!
But you can't beat me!
Come here!
Mustafa, run!
He will beat you!
-Hold it tight!
-Good job!
Come here!
Take this!
Come here!
Make way!
Come here!
Guard yourself!
Come!
Did he exhaust you?
Not at all.
Mustafa gives us joy and happiness.
Come here!
I will beat you now!
You are cheating!
I won!
No, I won.
Accept the defeat.
Fathers don't cheat.
Mustafa, that's enough for today.
We should not keep His Majesty busy.
You can take him, he's been swinging swords for hours.
Come on, Mustafa.
Go with your mother.
You can go, Hatice.
Hürrem!
Come, Hürrem!
There is entertainment.
What is she doing there?
Watching us from up there like she is the host.
She was promoted to the favourites' wing.
Lady Hürrem.
Invite her here.
But, my sultan, the valide sultan is here.
She might say something.
Are you trying to tell me what to do, Gülşah?
Come to your senses.
Go and do what I told you.
My ancestor, Sultan Mehmed, besieged Rhodes with 180 ships.
He didn't succeed.
Then my grandfather Bayezıt tried.
As a result of the Venetians' plots, the knights of Rhodes captured my Great Uncle Cem.
They held him hostage for use against us.
My uncle is dead now, but his children are still held there.
Are we building 200 galleys now?
We have to build 300, or even 400 of them.
Egypt is ours.
But the Rhodians command the Mediterranean.
The earliest we can start this campaign is in spring.
Perhaps even later.
But even if we can't capture Rhodes right away it would be good if we start stirring things up from the inside.
If you can't beat them, frustrate them?
I am not saying that.
Aristotle does.
He was the mentor of Alexander the Great.
"It is difficult to swallow a big bite.
Divide it before eating," he said.
Divide and conquer.
A good policy.
Find some Greek people, İbrahim.
Mix with the people, sniff around the bazaar.
Choose a few men to be sent to Rhodes to trade.
They are to open businesses and gain power there.
They will open the gates for us when the time comes.
Alexandra!
I heard that you were a good dancer.
Dance for us, Alexandra.
Come on.
Good job, Alexandra.
You are a skilful entertainer.
Hürrem.
What did you say?
My name is Hürrem.
Not Alexandra.
Sultan Süleyman said so.
Don't be disrespectful, Alexandra.
You are disrespectful!
Take her.
Take her to the dungeons!
I don't want to see this woman!
Let me go!
Let me go!
I am Hürrem!
I am Hürrem!
-Let me go!
-Move!
-Move!
-Let me go!
-Let me go!
-Get inside!
Lock the door.
Maybe you will learn something.
Come back here!
No fear.
No fear.
I am Hürrem.
Hürrem!
Is her cell really bad?
I heard there were mice as big as cats.
And it is dark.
Now she can dance with the mice.
Mother!
Father!
Let me go!
Are we animals?
Don't buy from the Persians!
Buy from your countrymen!
These are from Tabriz!
Buy some Bursa silk!
Only for three gold coins!
Buy with silver!
Can I help you, sir?
Forget shopping, we can chat.
-Would you like some sharbat?
-Thank you.
How is business?
Do you earn well?
We earn enough.
Since Sultan Süleyman came, the soldiers earned some money.
And they paid their debts to us.
We're doing fine.
But the taxes could be lower.
The Jewish jewellers are happy.
So you know things are good.
Yes.
Who is that man over there?
What is he doing?
Him?
That's Matrakçı Nasuh.
He is a weird guy.
Wanders around the roofs and falls on his head.
He writes and draws things.
And he is wicked smart.
He never forgets something he sees.
Matrakçı, come down here and socialize!
I am thirsty.
I will come down if you buy me a drink.
He never pays for anything.
Let him come, I will buy him something.
Come, Matrakçı!
Where are you from, sir?
-Üsküdar.
-I can tell.
He looks noble.
Not an immigrant like us.
Greetings.
-Greetings.
-Why do they call you Matrakçı?
Because I beat them all in matrak and take all their money.
You play for money?
No, I play with the music.
I know you.
Wait, I drew you.
Okay, wait.
Nice drawing.
I want to play a game of matrak with you.
But we play for money.
Sure.
Don't whine when I take your money.
Maybe I will take your gold.
Give me enough Bursa silk for two shirts please.
Yes, sir.
-How is this one?
-Good.
Matrakçı Nasuh Effendi.
Get up.
Your Majesty.
I want to introduce you to Matrakçı Nasuh Effendi.
He is a skilful muralist a math genius and a matrak master.
Is this true?
I would stop any lie from being told, my Sultan.
Let's see how you play.
Also he plays for money.
So you will take the sultan's money and brag about it to others, then?
I won't tell.
-I certainly won't.
-Good.
Bring the matrak sets!
You will get out of here if you beg for forgiveness, Russian girl.
No forgiveness.
No?
No forgiveness.
No fear.
My name is Hürrem.
The sultan gave my name on sacred Thursday.
Don't even bring her water.
Let her rot in here.
Ready!
Let it be a fair fight!
Begin!
One!
Two!
Three!
Three!
Four!
Where are you, Süleyman?
Where are you?
-Sümbül Agha!
-Yes, Your Majesty.
Prepare Lady Hürrem and send her to my chamber.
Hürrem?
The Ruthenian concubine Alexandra.
Her name is Hürrem.
What happened?
Hürrem is being punished in the dungeons, my sultan.
What punishment?
Who is punishing her?
Who dared to do that?
-I--
-Speak!
The valide sultan gave the order.
Get her out of there immediately.
-I said, go!
-Yes, Your Majesty.
Open the door.
Allah!
Sümbül?
Where are you flying to?
We are getting Hürrem out.
His Majesty heard.
What if Valide Sultan hears about it?
You can listen to Valide Sultan.
I will listen to His Majesty.
Lady Daye, come with me if you don't want to fly without wings.
Get up!
Let me go!
Let me go!
His Majesty is letting you out!
Take her.
Move.
How could this happen, İbrahim?
Why don't you know about this?
It is forbidden for me to enter the harem.
How could I know?
Something happened between the women.
You should have known, İbrahim.
If you are carrying this seal if you are my concierge, you have to know everything.
If not, it is your fault.
Clean her up immediately.
Hurry!
Hurry up!
Where has she been?
She looks awful.
If you really want to know, I can send you there too.
Allah give me patience!
-Open your eyes, Hürrem.
-Hürrem!
Stop playing games.
You're out now.
Hürrem!
Pull yourself together.
I am starting to get angry.
Don't try my patience, Hürrem!
Get up!
Hürrem?
Hürrem?
Süleyman.
It's over, Hürrem.
It's over, just rest.
Bring the physician.
Give her food and drink and make her well.
You are glowing like the sun, my sultan.
You look happy.
Yes, I am well.
I slept well.
I haven't been able to sleep for so many nights.
Now I am at peace.
And there is order.
-Last night, Hürrem--
-Don't talk about that Russian!
That Hürrem....
Forgive me, my sultan.
Eat this too, my lion cub, so that you can be strong.
But I'm full.
I also ate at my mother's.
I want to see my father.
Wait, he should be here soon.
What if he doesn't?
He will.
He does every morning.
He won't start his day without taking my blessing.
Will you eat this one for me?
Come on, darling.
Good job.
Tell me, İbrahim.
What do I have to do today?
The chief treasurer and Piri Pasha will present the new law regarding the taxes.
Good.
The Polish ambassador will visit at noon.
There are three more delegates at the inn.
-Any more news?
-Lady Hürrem is feeling better.
I am being informed constantly, just as you commanded.
Are you going to see your mother?
Come on, İbrahim.
We have more important business to do.
My sultan.
We were going to tally the harem's treasury today.
When will you be available?
We can do that later.
His Majesty heard about what happened last night.
Heard what?
What are you whispering about?
Tell me too.
He ordered Sümbül Agha to release her.
So we had to.
I see, Daye.
And now he is punishing his mother.
It's almost noon and he still isn't here.
He overruled my decision for a disrespectful concubine.
Was it very dark in there?
-Were you afraid?
-No.
Eat two more spoons of molasses.
It will give you strength.
Can I stay with you, Hürrem?
This chamber is amazing.
I heard the sultan was here, tell me!
Maria!
Go downstairs.
-You have cleaning to do.
-Isn't she allowed in here?
She is not.
You focus on getting better.
Come on!
Ayşe, take care of Hürrem.
-Don't worry.
-Move, Maria!
Previously on "Nurse Jackie"...
You see my wife every day.
What do you wanna say?
You gotta know what I'm talking about.
We have a problem.
- There is no we.
- Kevin knows.
- I'm here to see Jackie Peyton.
- And you are?
- Her husband.
- Jackie's not married.
You pull me in here and tell me I can't administer meds and you expect me not to push you?
I don't want H.R. launching a full-fledged investigation, because then I'll have no say in the matter.
It's been two weeks, Gloria.
I wanna get on with my life.
I will prescribe what I think is best for you in your situation to get you clean.
You're trying to buy your statues back?
I want them back for the chapel,
Coop wants them back for his wedding.
It's a win-win.
I took a couple of patches, might have been four.
I took six.
And I've never been to Haiti.
You shouldn't be talking about this.
Why not?
It's true.
Anyways, if it's sunny out, all you need is a magnifying glass and you can make a fire, easy.
I don't need a magnifying glass.
Show me later.
What about tumors?
I get 'em all the time.
I got tumors like you can't believe.
All over.
Sometimes they hide.
Have a seat, Mr. Digby.
If you don't let me see a doctor in like...
Five minutes, I'm gonna call an ambulance and take my business to another hospital.
You wanna use my phone?
No?
Okay, have a seat.
You're not going to like what I have to say.
- Try me.
H.R. has issued mandatory urine tests for the nurses in my department.
Failure to comply will be met with termination.
Today?
Tomorrow?
- When?
- Today.
And just so we understand each other, this is not coming from my office.
It's straight from H.R.
Either way, I don't pee on command.
- Hey.
- Hey, Slater.
- We get to pee in a cup today.
- So I heard.
- Want half a bagel?
- No, thank you.
I'm reducing.
Find me when you're ready, both of you.
If I'm not in my office, I'll be in the chapel.
I'm getting my statues back.
Nothing can stop me now.
Hey!
Are you their boss?
You tell her to let me in!
Is it your turn?
You see that?
I'm having a seizure.
Where's the camera?
I'm gonna have a seizure and die.
And my lawyer's gonna sue the hospital.
You're gonna get shut down.
And I won't care because I'm gonna be rich.
You'll be dead.
Urine samples.
Have a nice day.
- What if she wanted half a bagel?
- I'd be fucked.
I thought I'd get a jump on the pee test.
- Wanna see?
- Sure.
All right, vitamin b, zinc, ginger, aspirin.
I load up about eight hours before-
Jacks the numbers around.
I like to smoke a little weed.
It's not worth losing your job.
Yeah, no, you're right.
Pound the fluids.
Helps increase the output- a nice watery sample.
- So does that just work for pot or-
- Yeah.
Tox screens are a bitch.
Help yourself.
No, I'm good.
Do I got time for a smoke?
Most blood I ever saw.
He's a civil war collector.
He was cleaning his Confederate sword- what is that code for?
We're talking about nerds, not perverts.
A person can be both.
So he was cleaning his sword with Windex and a rag.
All four fingers- whoosh, down to the bone.
I feel bad for the patients who are, you know, stupid.
Um, it's a guy I'm dating.
Works in ICU, so...
- Raise the bar, Thor.
- 7:00 sharp!
Front row, chapel.
Be there.
Got an awesome birthday/wedding cake.
Right, Jackie?
Jackie's on cake duty.
- Best cake ever.
- Wow, you're in scrubs.
Is it for your birthday?
Happy Birthday, by the way.
Thank you, Zoey.
But don't everyone say it all at once.
I want today to be sprinkled with joy.
So if you could spread it out a little, catch me in the hall, the elevator- wherever.
And since everyone's dying to know what I'm doing in scrubs, it's in case a patient pukes on me.
Tuxedo, locked and loaded.
One tux, two ties.
Four shoes.
Where's Slater?
I need an opinion.
- He's in admitting.
- Yo, slates!
I need some help with the tie.
Birthday boy's getting hitched.
Did you guys get him anything?
I turned him into Cooper Duper.
That was my gift.
And I apparently bought him a cake, so he's fine.
Don't tell me you spent your money on Coop.
What?
I believe in birthdays.
You are officially on cake duty.
EMS., one minute away.
Boiler exploded.
30-year-old male with a foot of pipe stuck in his stomach.
All right, page O'Hara.
Call the O.R.
Witnessed explosion.
30-year-old male, found down.
Two lines wide open.
He's breathing on his own.
He needs to go straight to the O.R.
Do not pass go.
Do not collect $200.
Seriously, straight to surgery.
I need to stabilize him first.
Lenny, let's go.
Inside, now.
Look at me.
It's like a candle, okay?
He's gonna go out like that.
You'll be stabilizing him for the morgue.
Come on, let me take him up.
Write in his hand.
It's- in his- write in his hands-
All right, Zoey, take him up now.
There's another one coming.
35-year-old male, crawling around at the scene, breathing on his own.
B.P.'S 180/100.
Valium in the field, five mil.
- I think he might be blind.
- Got it.
All right.
Are you gonna chicken out?
- No.
Are you?
- Nope.
Told ya.
It's okay, I'm Jackie.
You're at All Saints.
Sir, sir, can you hear me?
Sir?
"My name is David Bonvino.
I am deaf and blind.
In case of emergency, call my brother."
Okay, you handle the meds.
I'll make the call.
- Urine test.
- Leave me alone.
Oh shit.
What if it's a family member?
- I've never done this.
- You got it, Boo.
- Hello?
- Zoey?
- Jackie?
- Jackie Jackie?
- We'll take him from here.
- Wait.
Cool your jets.
He's trying to say something.
I got a guy here, deaf and blind, and a card that says in case of emergency call the brother.
- Do you have a brother?
- He can't sign.
Write in his hand.
Write in his hand.
Um, he can't sign.
Write in his hand.
You're gonna be all right, man.
The guy with the pipe sticking out of his gut- that's his brother.
Here, I'm gonna write in his hand.
- Gloves?
- No, I'm good.
"U R OK."
Okay?
"Is he OK.?"
Uh...
Um, I'm gonna tell him yes.
"Y-e-s." Okay?
What, you have a better answer?
Yeah, he's okay.
God, Fi, what did you do?
We made a fire.
I got caught.
Answer your fuckin' phone.
Nope.
Hey, Jackie.
Too much?
It's either him or me.
You gotta pick.
Sorry, Coop.
You may have won the battle, but I'll win the war.
Watch me.
Best man, just sayin'.
- Oh, I know that look.
- Do you?
Because if you did, you'd know to keep that thought to yourself.
Guess I should have picked Coop.
Oh man, this day-
People gotta leave me alone.
Deaf, blind, tumor, pee test- man, I need a fuckin' break.
Yeah, you do.
It's Kevin.
- Don't pick that up.
- What?
What are you afraid of?
He's in Queens.
You think he's gonna crawl through the phone
- and be magically standing here?
- Eddie, leave it alone.
No, fuck it.
You be afraid if you want.
Me, I'm done running.
Hey, Kev.
What can I do for you?
Yeah, do me a favor.
Go find my wife and tell her to pick up her goddamn phone.
All right, well, I'll see if anyone knows where she's at.
- Is everything okay?
- Listen to me, Eddie.
Tell her she can blow me off all she wants after she calls me back, but she has to call me now.
Tell her.
- Everybody okay?
- Call him back.
You were right, you should've picked Coop.
I always knew this day would come.
Yeah, me too.
If you're avoiding the urine test,
I want you to tell me now.
No, actually I'm avoiding my husband, but thanks for thinking of me.
No running in the halls!
Oh, come on!
Where are your shoes?
Anyone seen my crackhead?
You gotta be more specific.
Vegetarian?
Jackie's got her in five.
- Quit poking me!
- Stop.
Stay still or they're gonna restrain you, okay?
Let's get the IV Started, get some fluids in you, a little IV valium.
You're gonna feel much better, okay?
- You give her valium yet?
- No.
How about you do the valium?
I'll do the zofran.
Man, I tried for an hour to get a line in.
- So I escaped.
Totally dehydrated.
She was up all night throwing up.
It was the bacon, not the crack.
- It was not the crack.
- No?
Monica here ate 2 pounds of bacon after not eating meat for six years.
- I see.
- I was tweaking and starving at the same time, which is practically impossible.
And then all of a sudden, I smelled bacon.
And I was like, "bacon!
Starving!
Seize the moment!"
I'm Mr. seize-the-moment.
Just ask Jackie.
Excuse me just a minute.
Hey, what's going on?
Everything checks out, so I've got a van waiting.
We're gonna take him home.
He'll be more comfortable there.
Oh, he looks pretty comfortable where he is.
But there's nothing wrong with him, and we need the bed.
Just let me do my job, okay?
Um, you need a hand getting him dressed?
- No, I got it.
- Okay.
Bonvino, pipe guy- is he dead or alive?
Alive.
Intensive care.
Oh good.
Oh, this is O'Hara's patient.
Shit.
You gotta keep him in his gown.
But I have a van waiting.
No, I totally fucked up.
You gotta help me out here.
I was supposed to have him up to ICU an hour ago.
I am gonna get killed.
See, they gotta keep him for serial CT's and observation.
- Sorry.
- I have to call upstairs.
Okay, you do that.
Thor!
- As fast as you can, okay?
- But I'm supposed to meet.
Coop's bride by the front entrance in case she needs help with her hair.
Tell your friend in the ICU To put him next to his brother.
I want them to be together.
Do whatever you gotta do.
- I will take care of the bride's hair.
- No-
Just go.
- But-
- Go!
But you can't-
I went to, like, 10 places.
No one sells wedding cakes.
It's a world of birthdays out there.
I'm sure it'll be fine.
Don't worry about it.
Shh shh!
You think that's the bride?
She seems really nervous.
Whoo!
Here, you hold these.
I'm gonna run and get a cart.
Come on.
Go inside, go inside.
Come on, honey, go inside.
Go inside.
Yes!
What?
Oh God.
No no no.
Oh God.
Ugh.
T minus one till my "Ave Maria."
- Ooh, nice cart.
- Urology.
Five more minutes and then back to work.
That's a lot of sugar, people.
- Hurry hurry hurry.
- Sorry I'm late.
d Ave Maria d
d gratia plena d
d Maria gratia plena d
d Maria gratia plena... d
- I think the bride is a no-show.
- No!
That's really rude.
d Gratia plena. d
- I look like an idiot.
- No.
No, not at all.
Everybody's together, the chapel looks like a chapel again, and it's because of you.
You did it.
Look how happy Akalitus is.
That is not easy.
I feel like an asshole.
- You got me a horse and carriage.
- Not exactly.
No one's- no one's ever gonna wanna marry me.
That's not true.
Thank you for my statues, Dr. Cooper.
It might be kind of dumb, but...
Too soon, Zoey, but thanks.
No, it's for your birthday.
It's from all of us.
d Happy Birthday to you d d Happy Birthday to you d d Happy Birthday, dear Dr. Cooper... d
- My work here is done.
- Let's go.
d Happy Birthday to you. d
- Yay.
- Happy Birthday.
Tough break, Coop.
It didn't turn out like I thought.
It never does.
- Just... peddle.
- Yeah.
Coop!
Wait up.
Slide over.
Somebody get that, please?
Not so fast.
It's time.
Anything you want to tell me?
Nope.
You saw his face.
You should feel more bad for him.
I do.
I feel horrible for him.
My heart goes out to the guy.
Well, it doesn't look like it.
Zoey, I took a urine test I know I'm gonna pass.
Let me enjoy it, okay?
Mr. Peyton, welcome!
- And what a pleasure.
- Zoey, right?
Correctamundo.
Sam, I'd like you to meet Jackie's husband,
- Mr. Peyton.
- Nice to meet you.
Willkommen.
Bienvenue.
Welcome to All Saints.
You must be the girls.
We're kind of in a hurry.
Is Jackie around?
Ah, yes.
I will go find Mrs. Peyton.
- Excuse us.
- Jacks!
Kinda busy.
- Kevin's in admitting...
- Oh, God damn it.
...with the girls.
- Hope you're happy.
- I'm not.
What do I do?
Tell me what to do.
Your daughters are so pretty!
Okay, private moment.
I see that, but I have to pee really bad.
I'm sorry.
Stay calm.
Everything will be fine.
Oh, the tall one is her daughter.
She's 100.
I'm sorry, granddaughter- great-granddaughter.
- Better.
Thank you.
- Sorry for your loss.
All right, fine.
I'll take the girls and keep them busy with X-rays and sugar until I hear from you.
Jackie?
How does a person even get to be that old?
Well, for starters, a person doesn't fuck the pharmacist.
It's so much bigger than that.
Aw, what the fuck am I doing?
I just peed in a cup.
We all know how that's gonna turn out.
Kev's out there with his head full of accusations- most of them true, by the way.
- What?
- She's dead and I'm jealous.
How fucked up is that?
Oh God, please don't get dreary on me.
Come on.
Let's get it over with.
Hello.
I'm looking for a Grace and Fiona Peyton?
I can't see-
Wow, what a cool surprise, you guys.
So Dr. O'Hara's gonna show you around.
Daddy and I are gonna talk a little bit, okay?
I don't think you'll be so happy when you find out what I did.
- I bet I will.
- I bet you won't.
Are you guys gonna be long?
You got your books just in case, okay?
- Thank you.
- Fine.
Right, bring your books.
Absolutely no homework allowed.
Follow me.
We shall go and look at broken things.
You brought the girls?
Really?
I gotta get this off my chest, Jackie.
And I don't wanna do it at the house with the girls in the next fucking room.
Okay?
Tunie's at work.
What else am I supposed to do?
You're the dad.
You're supposed to hold it in.
Follow me.
- Extra wedding cake.
- We have tons.
No, thank you.
It's not like I wanna be doing this, okay?
This is the hardest thing I've ever done.
Will you look at me?
One's on meds, the other one's starting fires.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Whatever we're doing is messing them up.
Well, I disagree.
We were married in a church.
We had two little girls.
It's not just a piece of paper.
- Oh my God, just spit it out.
- I'm trying.
I've been trying for weeks.
All right, I'm here.
I'm all yours, okay?
Just say what you fuckin' gotta say.
You can't just step outside a marriage and fuck someone else because things got hard and expect the marriage to survive.
- Kevin-
- Just let me say it.
I had an affair.
Things got so bad, so hopeless and lonely, even in the same room- and I just-
I-I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
I fucked up.
It's over.
It will never happen again.
You gotta believe me, Jackie.
- Believe me.
- I...
What am I supposed to say?
I don't know.
"I love you"?
"I forgive you"?
Something like that.
Pack your bags.
d Oh woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean d d you're the meanest old woman that I ever seen d d I guessed if you said so d d I have to pack my things and go d
- d that's right... d
- Fuck 'em.
d Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back d d no more, no more, no more, no more d
Previously on "Nurse Jackie"...
You see my wife every day.
What do you wanna say?
You gotta know what I'm talking about.
We have a problem.
- There is no we.
- Kevin knows.
- I'm here to see Jackie Peyton.
- And you are?
- Her husband.
- Jackie's not married.
You pull me in here and tell me I can't administer meds and you expect me not to push you?
I don't want H.R. launching a full-fledged investigation, because then I'll have no say in the matter.
It's been two weeks, Gloria.
I wanna get on with my life.
I will prescribe what I think is best for you in your situation to get you clean.
You're trying to buy your statues back?
I want them back for the chapel,
Coop wants them back for his wedding.
It's a win-win.
I took a couple of patches, might have been four.
I took six.
And I've never been to Haiti.
You shouldn't be talking about this.
Why not?
It's true.
Anyways, if it's sunny out, all you need is a magnifying glass and you can make a fire, easy.
I don't need a magnifying glass.
Show me later.
What about tumors?
I get 'em all the time.
I got tumors like you can't believe.
All over.
Sometimes they hide.
Have a seat, Mr. Digby.
If you don't let me see a doctor in like...
Five minutes, I'm gonna call an ambulance and take my business to another hospital.
You wanna use my phone?
No?
Okay, have a seat.
You're not going to like what I have to say.
- Try me.
H.R. has issued mandatory urine tests for the nurses in my department.
Failure to comply will be met with termination.
Today?
Tomorrow?
- When?
- Today.
And just so we understand each other, this is not coming from my office.
It's straight from H.R.
Either way, I don't pee on command.
- Hey.
- Hey, Slater.
- We get to pee in a cup today.
- So I heard.
- Want half a bagel?
- No, thank you.
I'm reducing.
Find me when you're ready, both of you.
If I'm not in my office, I'll be in the chapel.
I'm getting my statues back.
Nothing can stop me now.
Hey!
Are you their boss?
You tell her to let me in!
Is it your turn?
You see that?
I'm having a seizure.
Where's the camera?
I'm gonna have a seizure and die.
And my lawyer's gonna sue the hospital.
You're gonna get shut down.
And I won't care because I'm gonna be rich.
You'll be dead.
Urine samples.
Have a nice day.
- What if she wanted half a bagel?
- I'd be fucked.
I thought I'd get a jump on the pee test.
- Wanna see?
- Sure.
All right, vitamin b, zinc, ginger, aspirin.
I load up about eight hours before-
Jacks the numbers around.
I like to smoke a little weed.
It's not worth losing your job.
Yeah, no, you're right.
Pound the fluids.
Helps increase the output- a nice watery sample.
- So does that just work for pot or-
- Yeah.
Tox screens are a bitch.
Help yourself.
No, I'm good.
Do I got time for a smoke?
Most blood I ever saw.
He's a civil war collector.
He was cleaning his Confederate sword- what is that code for?
We're talking about nerds, not perverts.
A person can be both.
So he was cleaning his sword with Windex and a rag.
All four fingers- whoosh, down to the bone.
I feel bad for the patients who are, you know, stupid.
Um, it's a guy I'm dating.
Works in ICU, so...
- Raise the bar, Thor.
- 7:00 sharp!
Front row, chapel.
Be there.
Got an awesome birthday/wedding cake.
Right, Jackie?
Jackie's on cake duty.
- Best cake ever.
- Wow, you're in scrubs.
Is it for your birthday?
Happy Birthday, by the way.
Thank you, Zoey.
But don't everyone say it all at once.
I want today to be sprinkled with joy.
So if you could spread it out a little, catch me in the hall, the elevator- wherever.
And since everyone's dying to know what I'm doing in scrubs, it's in case a patient pukes on me.

In case of emergency, call my brother."
Okay, you handle the meds.
I'll make the call.

Write in his hand.
Write in his hand.
Um, he can't sign.
Write in his hand.
You're gonna be all right, man.
The guy with the pipe sticking out of his gut- that's his brother.
Here, I'm gonna write in his hand.
- Gloves?
- No, I'm good.
"U R OK."
Okay?
"Is he OK.?"
Uh...
Um, I'm gonna tell him yes.
"Y-e-s." Okay?
What, you have a better answer?
Yeah, he's okay.
God, Fi, what did you do?
We made a fire.
I got caught.
Answer your fuckin' phone.
Nope.
Hey, Jackie.
Too much?
It's either him or me.
You gotta pick.
Sorry, Coop.
You may have won the battle, but I'll win the war.
Watch me.
Best man, just sayin'.
- Oh, I know that look.
- Do you?
Because if you did, you'd know to keep that thought to yourself.
Guess I should have picked Coop.
Oh man, this day-
People gotta leave me alone.
Deaf, blind, tumor, pee test- man, I need a fuckin' break.
Yeah, you do.
It's Kevin.
- Don't pick that up.
- What?
What are you afraid of?
He's in Queens.
You think he's gonna crawl through the phone

- Eddie, leave it alone.
No, fuck it.
You be afraid if you want.
Me, I'm done running.
Hey, Kev.
What can I do for you?
Yeah, do me a favor.
Go find my wife and tell her to pick up her goddamn phone.
All right, well, I'll see if anyone knows where she's at.
- Is everything okay?
- Listen to me, Eddie.
Tell her she can blow me off all she wants after she calls me back, but she has to call me now.
Tell her.
- Everybody okay?
- Call him back.
You were right, you should've picked Coop.
I always knew this day would come.
Yeah, me too.
If you're avoiding the urine test,
I want you to tell me now.
No, actually I'm avoiding my husband, but thanks for thinking of me.

Just let me do my job, okay?
Um, you need a hand getting him dressed?

No, not at all.
Everybody's together, the chapel looks like a chapel again, and it's because of you.
You did it.
Look how happy Akalitus is.
That is not easy.
I feel like an asshole.
- You got me a horse and carriage.
- Not exactly.
No one's- no one's ever gonna wanna marry me.
That's not true.
Thank you for my statues, Dr. Cooper.
It might be kind of dumb, but...
Too soon, Zoey, but thanks.
No, it's for your birthday.
It's from all of us.

Happy Birthday to you ?

Okay, private moment.
I see that, but I have to pee really bad.
I'm sorry.
Stay calm.
Everything will be fine.
Oh, the tall one is her daughter.
She's 100.
I'm sorry, granddaughter- great-granddaughter.
- Better.
Thank you.
- Sorry for your loss.
All right, fine.
I'll take the girls and keep them busy with X-rays and sugar until I hear from you.
Jackie?
How does a person even get to be that old?
Well, for starters, a person doesn't fuck the pharmacist.
It's so much bigger than that.
Aw, what the fuck am I doing?
I just peed in a cup.
We all know how that's gonna turn out.
Kev's out there with his head full of accusations- most of them true, by the way.
- What?
- She's dead and I'm jealous.
How fucked up is that?
Oh God, please don't get dreary on me.
Come on.
Let's get it over with.
Hello.
I'm looking for a Grace and Fiona Peyton?
I can't see-
Wow, what a cool surprise, you guys.
So Dr. O'Hara's gonna show you around.
Daddy and I are gonna talk a little bit, okay?
I don't think you'll be so happy when you find out what I did.
- I bet I will.
- I bet you won't.
Are you guys gonna be long?
You got your books just in case, okay?
- Thank you.
- Fine.
Right, bring your books.
Absolutely no homework allowed.
Follow me.
We shall go and look at broken things.
You brought the girls?
Really?
I gotta get this off my chest, Jackie.
And I don't wanna do it at the house with the girls in the next fucking room.
Okay?
Tunie's at work.
What else am I supposed to do?
You're the dad.
You're supposed to hold it in.
Follow me.
- Extra wedding cake.
- We have tons.
No, thank you.
It's not like I wanna be doing this, okay?
This is the hardest thing I've ever done.
Will you look at me?
One's on meds, the other one's starting fires.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Whatever we're doing is messing them up.
Well, I disagree.
We were married in a church.
We had two little girls.
It's not just a piece of paper.
- Oh my God, just spit it out.
- I'm trying.
I've been trying for weeks.
All right, I'm here.
I'm all yours, okay?
Just say what you fuckin' gotta say.
You can't just step outside a marriage and fuck someone else because things got hard and expect the marriage to survive.
- Kevin-
- Just let me say it.
I had an affair.
Things got so bad, so hopeless and lonely, even in the same room- and I just-
I-I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
I fucked up.
It's over.
It will never happen again.
You gotta believe me, Jackie.
- Believe me.
- I...
What am I supposed to say?
I don't know.
"I love you"?
"I forgive you"?
Something like that.
Pack your bags.
?
Oh woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean ?
?
you're the meanest old woman that I ever seen ?
?
I guessed if you said so ?
?
I have to pack my things and go ?
- ?
that's right... ?
- Fuck 'em.
?
Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back ?
?
no more, no more, no more, no more ?
Jackie:
Previously on "Nurse Jackie"...
You see my wife every day.
What do you wanna say?
You gotta know what I'm talking about.
We have a problem.
- There is no we.
- Kevin knows.
- I'm here to see Jackie Peyton.
- And you are?
- Her husband.
- Jackie's not married.
You pull me in here and tell me I can't administer meds and you expect me not to push you?
I don't want H.R. launching a full-fledged investigation, because then I'll have no say in the matter.
It's been two weeks, Gloria.
I wanna get on with my life.
I will prescribe what I think is best for you in your situation to get you clean.
You're trying to buy your statues back?
I want them back for the chapel,
Coop wants them back for his wedding.
It's a win-win.
I took a couple of patches, might have been four.
I took six.
And I've never been to Haiti.
( Guffaws )
( Man vocalizing )
( Chatter )
You shouldn't be talking about this.
Why not?
It's true.
Anyways, if it's sunny out, all you need is a magnifying glass and you can make a fire, easy.
I don't need a magnifying glass.
Show me later.
What about tumors?
I get 'em all the time.
I got tumors like you can't believe.
All over.
Sometimes they hide.
Have a seat, Mr. Digby.
If you don't let me see a doctor in like...
Five minutes, I'm gonna call an ambulance and take my business to another hospital.
You wanna use my phone?
No?
Okay, have a seat.
- You're not going to like what I have to say.
- Try me.
H.R. has issued mandatory urine tests for the nurses in my department.
Failure to comply will be met with termination.
Today?
Tomorrow?
- When?
- Today.
And just so we understand each other, this is not coming from my office.
It's straight from H.R.
Either way, I don't pee on command.
- Hey.
- Hey, Slater.
- We get to pee in a cup today.
- So I heard.
- Want half a bagel?
- No, thank you.
I'm reducing.
Find me when you're ready, both of you.
If I'm not in my office, I'll be in the chapel.
I'm getting my statues back.
Nothing can stop me now.
- ( Pounding )
- Man:
Hey!
Are you their boss?
You tell her to let me in!
Is it your turn?
You see that?
I'm having a seizure.
Where's the camera?
I'm gonna have a seizure and die.
And my lawyer's gonna sue the hospital.
You're gonna get shut down.
And I won't care because I'm gonna be rich.
You'll be dead.
Urine samples.
Have a nice day.
- What if she wanted half a bagel?
- I'd be fucked.
I thought I'd get a jump on the pee test.
- Wanna see?
- Sure.
All right, vitamin b, zinc, ginger, aspirin.
I load up about eight hours before—
Jacks the numbers around.
I like to smoke a little weed.
It's not worth losing your job.
Yeah, no, you're right.
Pound the fluids.
Helps increase the output— a nice watery sample.
- So does that just work for pot or—
- Yeah.
Tox screens are a bitch.
Help yourself.
No, I'm good.
Do I got time for a smoke?
Most blood I ever saw.
He's a civil war collector.
He was cleaning his Confederate sword— what is that code for?
We're talking about nerds, not perverts.
A person can be both.
So he was cleaning his sword with Windex and a rag.
All four fingers— whoosh, down to the bone.
I feel bad for the patients who are, you know, stupid.
Um, it's a guy I'm dating.
Works in ICU, so...
- Raise the bar, Thor.
- Coop: 7:00 sharp!
Front row, chapel.
Be there.
Got an awesome birthday/wedding cake.
Right, Jackie?
Jackie's on cake duty.
- Best cake ever.
- Wow, you're in scrubs.
Is it for your birthday?
Happy Birthday, by the way.
Thank you, Zoey.
But don't everyone say it all at once.
I want today to be sprinkled with joy.
So if you could spread it out a little, catch me in the hall, the elevator— wherever.
And since everyone's dying to know what I'm doing in scrubs, it's in case a patient pukes on me.
Tuxedo, locked and loaded.
One tux, two ties.
Four shoes.
Where's Slater?
I need an opinion.
- He's in admitting.
- Yo, slates!
I need some help with the tie.
Birthday boy's getting hitched.
Did you guys get him anything?
I turned him into Cooper Duper.
That was my gift.
And I apparently bought him a cake, so he's fine.
Don't tell me you spent your money on Coop.
What?
I believe in birthdays.
You are officially on cake duty.
EMS., one minute away.
Boiler exploded.
30-year-old male with a foot of pipe stuck in his stomach.
All right, page O'Hara.
Call the O.R.
Witnessed explosion.
30-year-old male, found down.
Two lines wide open.
He's breathing on his own.
He needs to go straight to the O.R.
Do not pass go.
Do not collect $200.
Seriously, straight to surgery.
I need to stabilize him first.
Lenny, let's go.
Inside, now.
Look at me.
It's like a candle, okay?
- He's gonna go out like that.
- ( Snaps fingers )
You'll be stabilizing him for the morgue.
Come on, let me take him up.
Man:
Write in his hand.
It's— in his— write in his hands—
All right, Zoey, take him up now.
There's another one coming.
35-year-old male, crawling around at the scene, breathing on his own.
B.P.'S 180/100.
Valium in the field, five mil.
- I think he might be blind.
- Got it.
All right.
( Kids chattering )
Are you gonna chicken out?
- No.
Are you?
- Nope.
Told ya.
It's okay, I'm Jackie.
You're at All Saints.
Sir, sir, can you hear me?
Sir?
"My name is David Bonvino.
I am deaf and blind.
In case of emergency, call my brother."
Okay, you handle the meds.
I'll make the call.
( Buttons clicking )
- Urine test.
- Leave me alone.
( Cell phone chiming )
Oh shit.
What if it's a family member?
- I've never done this.
- You got it, Boo.
- Hello?
- Zoey?
- Jackie?
- Jackie Jackie?
- We'll take him from here.
- Wait.
Cool your jets.
He's trying to say something.
I got a guy here, deaf and blind, and a card that says in case of emergency call the brother.
- Do you have a brother?
- He can't sign.
Write in his hand.
Write in his hand.
Um, he can't sign.
Write in his hand.
You're gonna be all right, man.
The guy with the pipe sticking out of his gut— that's his brother.
Here, I'm gonna write in his hand.
- Kelly:
Gloves?
- Jackie:
No, I'm good.
"U R OK."
Okay?
"Is he OK.?"
Uh...
Um, I'm gonna tell him yes.
"Y-e-s." Okay?
What, you have a better answer?
Yeah, he's okay.
God, Fi, what did you do?
We made a fire.
I got caught.
( Ringing )
Answer your fuckin' phone.
- ( Vibrating )
- Nope.
Hey, Jackie.
Too much?
It's either him or me.
You gotta pick.
Sorry, Coop.
( Sighs ) You may have won the battle, but I'll win the war.
Watch me.
Best man, just sayin'.
- Oh, I know that look.
- Do you?
Because if you did, you'd know to keep that thought to yourself.
Guess I should have picked Coop.
Oh man, this day—
People gotta leave me alone.
Deaf, blind, tumor, pee test— man, I need a fuckin' break.
- Yeah, you do.
- ( Cell phone vibrating )
It's Kevin.
- Don't pick that up.
- What?
What are you afraid of?
He's in Queens.
You think he's gonna crawl through the phone
- and be magically standing here?
- Eddie, leave it alone.
No, fuck it.
You be afraid if you want.
Me, I'm done running.
Hey, Kev.
What can I do for you?
Yeah, do me a favor.
Go find my wife and tell her to pick up her goddamn phone.
All right, well, I'll see if anyone knows where she's at.
- Is everything okay?
- Listen to me, Eddie.
Tell her she can blow me off all she wants after she calls me back, but she has to call me now.
Tell her.
- Everybody okay?
- Call him back.
You were right, you should've picked Coop.
I always knew this day would come.
Yeah, me too.
If you're avoiding the urine test,
I want you to tell me now.
No, actually I'm avoiding my husband, but thanks for thinking of me.
No running in the halls!
Oh, come on!
Where are your shoes?
Anyone seen my crackhead?
You gotta be more specific.
Vegetarian?
Jackie's got her in five.
- Quit poking me!
- Stop.
Stay still or they're gonna restrain you, okay?
Let's get the IV Started, get some fluids in you, a little IV valium.
You're gonna feel much better, okay?
- You give her valium yet?
- No.
How about you do the valium?
I'll do the zofran.
- Man, I tried for an hour to get a line in.
- So I escaped.
Totally dehydrated.
She was up all night throwing up.
It was the bacon, not the crack.
- It was not the crack.
- No?
Monica here ate 2 pounds of bacon after not eating meat for six years.
- I see.
- I was tweaking and starving at the same time, which is practically impossible.
And then all of a sudden, I smelled bacon.
And I was like, "bacon!
Starving!
Seize the moment!"
I'm Mr. seize-the-moment.
Just ask Jackie.
Excuse me just a minute.
Hey, what's going on?
Everything checks out, so I've got a van waiting.
We're gonna take him home.
He'll be more comfortable there.
Oh, he looks pretty comfortable where he is.
But there's nothing wrong with him, and we need the bed.
Just let me do my job, okay?
Um, you need a hand getting him dressed?
- No, I got it.
- Okay.
Bonvino, pipe guy— is he dead or alive?
- ( Keyboard clicking )
- Alive.
Intensive care.
Oh good.
Oh, this is O'Hara's patient.
Shit.
You gotta keep him in his gown.
But I have a van waiting.
No, I totally fucked up.
You gotta help me out here.
I was supposed to have him up to ICU an hour ago.
I am gonna get killed.
See, they gotta keep him for serial CT's and observation.
- Sorry.
- I have to call upstairs.
Okay, you do that.
Thor!
- As fast as you can, okay?
- But I'm supposed to meet.
Coop's bride by the front entrance in case she needs help with her hair.
Tell your friend in the ICU To put him next to his brother.
I want them to be together.
Do whatever you gotta do.
- I will take care of the bride's hair.
- No—
- Just go.
- ( Cell phone vibrating )
- But—
- Go!
But you can't—
( grunts )
I went to, like, 10 places.
No one sells wedding cakes.
It's a world of birthdays out there.
I'm sure it'll be fine.
Don't worry about it.
Shh shh!
You think that's the bride?
She seems really nervous.
Whoo!
Here, you hold these.
I'm gonna run and get a cart.
Come on.
Go inside, go inside.
Come on, honey, go inside.
Go inside.
Yes!
What?
Oh God.
No no no.
Oh God.
Ugh.
( Organ music playing )
T minus one till my "Ave Maria."
- Ooh, nice cart.
- Urology.
Five more minutes and then back to work.
That's a lot of sugar, people.
- Hurry hurry hurry.
- Sorry I'm late.
Thor:
♪ Ave Maria ♪
♪ gratia plena ♪
♪ Maria gratia plena ♪
♪ Maria gratia plena... ♪
- I think the bride is a no-show.
- No!
( Gasps )
That's really rude.
♪ Gratia plena. ♪
- I look like an idiot.
- No.
No, not at all.
Everybody's together, the chapel looks like a chapel again, and it's because of you.
You did it.
Look how happy Akalitus is.
That is not easy.
I feel like an asshole.
- You got me a horse and carriage.
- Not exactly.
No one's— no one's ever gonna wanna marry me.
That's not true.
Thank you for my statues, Dr. Cooper.
It might be kind of dumb, but...
Too soon, Zoey, but thanks.
No, it's for your birthday.
It's from all of us.
All:
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy Birthday, dear Dr. Cooper... ♪
- My work here is done.
- Let's go.
♪ Happy Birthday to you. ♪
- Yay.
- Happy Birthday.
( Sighs ) Tough break, Coop.
It didn't turn out like I thought.
It never does.
( Sighs )
- Just... peddle.
- Yeah.
Coop!
Wait up.
Slide over.
( Man vocalizing )
( Phone ringing )
Somebody get that, please?
Not so fast.
It's time.
Anything you want to tell me?
Nope.
You saw his face.
You should feel more bad for him.
I do.
I feel horrible for him.
My heart goes out to the guy.
Well, it doesn't look like it.
Zoey, I took a urine test I know I'm gonna pass.
Let me enjoy it, okay?
Mr. Peyton, welcome!
- And what a pleasure.
- Zoey, right?
Correctamundo.
Sam, I'd like you to meet Jackie's husband,
- Mr. Peyton.
- Nice to meet you.
Willkommen.
Bienvenue.
Welcome to All Saints.
You must be the girls.
We're kind of in a hurry.
Is Jackie around?
Ah, yes.
I will go find Mrs. Peyton.
- Excuse us.
- Jacks!
Jackie:
Kinda busy.
- Kevin's in admitting...
- Oh, God damn it.
- ...with the girls.
- ( Toilet flushes )
- Hope you're happy.
- I'm not.
What do I do?
Tell me what to do.
( Shrieking )
Your daughters are so pretty!
Okay, private moment.
I see that, but I have to pee really bad.
I'm sorry.
O'Hara:
Stay calm.
Everything will be fine.
Oh, the tall one is her daughter.
She's 100.
I'm sorry, granddaughter— great-granddaughter.

I am deaf and blind.
In case of emergency, call my brother."
Okay, you handle the meds.
I'll make the call.
- Urine test.
- Leave me alone.
Oh shit.
What if it's a family member?
- I've never done this.
- You got it, Boo.
- Hello?
- Zoey?
- Jackie?
- Jackie Jackie?
- We'll take him from here.
- Wait.
Cool your jets.
He's trying to say something.
I got a guy here, deaf and blind, and a card that says in case of emergency call the brother.
- Do you have a brother?
- He can't sign.
Write in his hand.
Write in his hand.
Um, he can't sign.
Write in his hand.
You're gonna be all right, man.
The guy with the pipe sticking out of his gut- that's his brother.
Here, I'm gonna write in his hand.
- Gloves?
- No, I'm good.
"U R OK."
Okay?
"Is he OK.?"
Uh...
Um, I'm gonna tell him yes.
"Y-e-s." Okay?
What, you have a better answer?
Yeah, he's okay.
God, Fi, what did you do?
We made a fire.
I got caught.
Answer your fuckin' phone.
Nope.
Hey, Jackie.
Too much?
It's either him or me.
You gotta pick.
Sorry, Coop.
You may have won the battle, but I'll win the war.
Watch me.
Best man, just sayin'.
- Oh, I know that look.
- Do you?
Because if you did, you'd know to keep that thought to yourself.
Guess I should have picked Coop.
Oh man, this day-
People gotta leave me alone.
Deaf, blind, tumor, pee test- man, I need a fuckin' break.
Yeah, you do.
It's Kevin.
- Don't pick that up.
- What?
What are you afraid of?
He's in Queens.
You think he's gonna crawl through the phone
- and be magically standing here?
- Eddie, leave it alone.
No, fuck it.
You be afraid if you want.
Me, I'm done running.
Hey, Kev.
What can I do for you?
Yeah, do me a favor.
Go find my wife and tell her to pick up her goddamn phone.
All right, well, I'll see if anyone knows where she's at.
- Is everything okay?
- Listen to me, Eddie.
Tell her she can blow me off all she wants after she calls me back, but she has to call me now.
Tell her.
- Everybody okay?
- Call him back.
You were right, you should've picked Coop.
I always knew this day would come.
Yeah, me too.
If you're avoiding the urine test,
I want you to tell me now.
No, actually I'm avoiding my husband, but thanks for thinking of me.
No running in the halls!
Oh, come on!
Where are your shoes?
Anyone seen my crackhead?
You gotta be more specific.
Vegetarian?
Jackie's got her in five.
- Quit poking me!
- Stop.
Stay still or they're gonna restrain you, okay?
Let's get the IV Started, get some fluids in you, a little IV valium.
You're gonna feel much better, okay?
- You give her valium yet?
- No.
How about you do the valium?
I'll do the zofran.
Man, I tried for an hour to get a line in.
- So I escaped.
Totally dehydrated.
She was up all night throwing up.
It was the bacon, not the crack.
- It was not the crack.
- No?
Monica here ate 2 pounds of bacon after not eating meat for six years.
- I see.
- I was tweaking and starving at the same time, which is practically impossible.
And then all of a sudden, I smelled bacon.
And I was like, "bacon!
Starving!
Seize the moment!"
I'm Mr. seize-the-moment.
Just ask Jackie.
Excuse me just a minute.
Hey, what's going on?
Everything checks out, so I've got a van waiting.
We're gonna take him home.
He'll be more comfortable there.
Oh, he looks pretty comfortable where he is.
But there's nothing wrong with him, and we need the bed.
Just let me do my job, okay?
Um, you need a hand getting him dressed?
- No, I got it.
- Okay.
Bonvino, pipe guy- is he dead or alive?
Alive.
Intensive care.
Oh good.
Oh, this is O'Hara's patient.
Shit.
You gotta keep him in his gown.
But I have a van waiting.
No, I totally fucked up.
You gotta help me out here.
I was supposed to have him up to ICU an hour ago.
I am gonna get killed.
See, they gotta keep him for serial CT's and observation.
- Sorry.
- I have to call upstairs.
Okay, you do that.
Thor!
- As fast as you can, okay?
- But I'm supposed to meet.
Coop's bride by the front entrance in case she needs help with her hair.
Tell your friend in the ICU To put him next to his brother.
I want them to be together.
Do whatever you gotta do.
- I will take care of the bride's hair.
- No-
Just go.
- But-
- Go!
But you can't-
I went to, like, 10 places.
No one sells wedding cakes.
It's a world of birthdays out there.
I'm sure it'll be fine.
Don't worry about it.
Shh shh!
You think that's the bride?
She seems really nervous.
Whoo!
Here, you hold these.
I'm gonna run and get a cart.
Come on.
Go inside, go inside.
Come on, honey, go inside.
Go inside.
Yes!
What?
Oh God.
No no no.
Oh God.
Ugh.
T minus one till my "Ave Maria."
- Ooh, nice cart.
- Urology.
Five more minutes and then back to work.
That's a lot of sugar, people.
- Hurry hurry hurry.
- Sorry I'm late.

Well, it doesn't look like it.
Zoey, I took a urine test I know I'm gonna pass.
Let me enjoy it, okay?
Mr. Peyton, welcome!
- And what a pleasure.

Correctamundo.
Sam, I'd like you to meet Jackie's husband,

- Nice to meet you.
Willkommen.
Bienvenue.
Welcome to All Saints.
You must be the girls.
We're kind of in a hurry.
Is Jackie around?
Ah, yes.
I will go find Mrs. Peyton.
- Excuse us.

What do I do?
Tell me what to do.
Your daughters are so pretty!
Okay, private moment.
I see that, but I have to pee really bad.
I'm sorry.
Stay calm.
Everything will be fine.
Oh, the tall one is her daughter.
She's 100.
I'm sorry, granddaughter- great-granddaughter.
- Better.
Thank you.
- Sorry for your loss.
All right, fine.
I'll take the girls and keep them busy with X-rays and sugar until I hear from you.
Jackie?
How does a person even get to be that old?
Well, for starters, a person doesn't fuck the pharmacist.
It's so much bigger than that.
Aw, what the fuck am I doing?
I just peed in a cup.
We all know how that's gonna turn out.
Kev's out there with his head full of accusations- most of them true, by the way.
- What?
- She's dead and I'm jealous.
How fucked up is that?
Oh God, please don't get dreary on me.
Come on.

I'm looking for a Grace and Fiona Peyton?
I can't see-
Wow, what a cool surprise, you guys.
So Dr. O'Hara's gonna show you around.
Daddy and I are gonna talk a little bit, okay?
I don't think you'll be so happy when you find out what I did.
- I bet I will.

Are you guys gonna be long?
You got your books just in case, okay?
- Thank you.
- Fine.
Right, bring your books.
Absolutely no homework allowed.

I have no idea what you're talking about.
Whatever we're doing is messing them up.
Well, I disagree.
We were married in a church.
We had two little girls.

A mighty empire ruled by the descendants of gods.
A remote island where stone giants walked the Earth.
And a fertile garden where modern man was born.
Are the legends behind these ancient locations really based on fact?
If so, why did they exist?
And why have the answers been lost to history?
GEORGE NOORY:
How in the heck did they make these?
How did they move them?
Nobody has the answer.
DAVID CHILDRESS:
It may well be that the Garden of Eden today is underwater.
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:
These cultures were connected by flying machines operated by extraterrestrials.
NARRATOR:
Millions of people around the world believe we have been visited in the past by extraterrestrial beings.
What if it were true?
Did ancient aliens really help to shape our history?
And might we find proof by searching for our planet's mysterious lost worlds?
Central America
In a fertile valley between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, in what is now Honduras, lie the monumental ruins of Copan.
This archaeological site is believed to have been the cultural and political center of the once mighty Maya civilization that thrived between 2000 BC and 800 AD.
PAYSON SHEETS:
People have called Copan the paradise of Mesoamerica because it was such a place for the arts and humanities
The sculpture is beautiful.
Architecture is just magnificent.
NARRATOR:
It is believed that, at one time, Copan was inhabited by as many as 20,000 people and covered an area of ten square miles.
But in the ninth century, this incredible Mayan city was abandoned, and its people vanished.
When Spanish conquistadors arrived in the 16th century, they found only a few farming hamlets.
But why?
DAVID CHEETHAM:
They decimated their environment.
Warfare became endemic.
And it ended.
And people left.
They walked away.
PHILIP COPPENS:
To some extend, the idea that the Mayans became a lost culture is a yes and a no.
We know that they stopped building.
But at the very heart of the Mayan, it's a belief, it's a religion.
which continues to beaten to this very day.
saying, please pay attention to us because we have this vast body of knowledge
"want to share with the world."
At Copan, the Mayan had built a complex of monuments, temples and plazas, as well as sculptured stone pillars depicting ancient kings.
The Maya were also one of the earliest ancient civilizations to create a written language.
ADRIAN GILBERT:
In the last 20, 30 years, it's been a huge advance in the decoding of their hieroglyphs.
This is obvious happened in our generation is still ongoing.
NARRATOR:
Might a closer look at the Mayan stone carvings and their hieroglyphs provide proof of contact with extraterrestrials at Copan?
According to ancient astronaut theorists, the answer is yes.
TSOUKALOS:
Some of the large stautes at Copan are infantly fascinating to me the gear they are wearing is very reminiscent of something technological.
One of the figures has a box with tubes coming out and buttons and just very weird things.
These statues look like some type of a being wearing an astronaut suit.
And, in my opinion, that means that we were visited by some type of extraterrestrials who were very similar in appearance to us, because according to the ancient texts, we were created in their image.
NARRATOR:
Researchers working in Copan have also found stone sculptures called stelae, which have provoked controversy since the site was discovered in 1576.
And various interpretations of the carvings suggest the Maya may have had knowledge of a world far beyond their own continent.
CHILDRESS:
This is one of the curious dragon sculptures here at Copan, of which there are many.
In fact, this very oriental statues would look right at place in China or some other Oriental country.
Some archeologists believe that they are elephants on either side of this Copan ruler.
So why would there be, here at Copan, such Asian motifs as elephants and dragons in a place in Central America that is so far away from China and Southeast Asia?
Is there some kind of extraterrestrial connection between the Mayans and the Chinese, and an origin for both that comes from the stars?
How could the early Maya of Central America have had knowledge possessed by people living in Asia-- on the other side of the Pacific Ocean?
TSOUKALOS:
One of the basic premises of the ancient astronaut theory suggests that there was contact between ancient cultures way before we give them credit.
These ancient cultures were, in fact, connected by flying machines, and those flying machines were usually operated by extraterrestrials.
And especially in the Mayan carvings, we find many references of the gods descending from the sky in flying serpents.
Now, do flying serpents actually exist?
Of course not.
But it is a beautiful and very poetic description of something that is rooted in technology.
NARRATOR:
Due to the many strange carvings found at Copan really provide proof of contact between the Maya and otherworldly beings?
And if so, might that contact have produced offspring that could also be traced to an extraterrestrial source?
On the west side of the main temple at Copan stands a 63-step structure known as the Hieroglyphic Stairway.
It contains more than 1,200 stones carved with symbols that record the history of the kings of Copan.
CHILDRESS:
This Hieroglyphic Stairway is the longest Mayan inscription in the world.
It emphasizes the divine right of the 16 rulers of the Copan dynasty to rule their subjects-- a power given to them by the gods.
SHEETS:
The Hieroglyphic Stairway mentions the various rulers of Copan.
And talks about them in a semi divine sense.
So, they are human, they're mortal, but they are much more than that.
They are royal.
They have a spirit in their blood, and Maya called it Xuit Lel.
A Xuit Lel is in the blood and is the most powerful thing to get access to the supernatural.
So a king's Xuit Lel, when shed in a bloodletting ceremony and burned with copal incense, goes up into the heavens and takes a message to the deities, and they did things for the Maya.
NARRATOR:
Could the Maya rulers really have been the descendants of extraterrestrials, as ancient astronaut theorists believe?
Perhaps conclusive evidence can be found in what is widely believed to be the most advanced celestial calendar system of ancient times.
VON DANIKEN:
The Mayas had most the most precise calendar of all the people in antiquity, even the Babylonian, the Sumerian
They did not only observed our planetary system
They observed Orion, they observed Sirius and all the far away systems.
JON LOHSE:
One of the things that says about the Maya part it was the their ability to monitor the passage of astronomical events and to track the movement of constellations, to predict eclipses
They really developed some of this knowledge and skills to a pretty high degree.
It's remarkable.
No telescopes, no metal, yet the ability to predict time and advance in time in a way that it was really unprecedented in the world.
NARRATOR:
But why did the Maya create such precise maps of the Cosmos?
According to ancient astronauts theorists, the Maya's knowledge of the stars, in fact, came to them, from the stars, brought by extraterrestrial beings.
COPPENS:
When it comes to the ancient Maya that creation mythology evokes these legends, which say somewhere, just south of Orion's belt is this place where life originated from and they came to planet Earth on 1,200 BC when the ancient Mayans said the gods came to Earth.
VON DANIKEN:
Their teachers were the gods, and the gods were the extraterrestrials.
NARRATOR:
If beings from another star system really came to Earth in the ancient past, did they create the foundations of Mayan civilization and breed with its rulers?
Might they have also visited other areas of our planet?
Perhaps further evidence can be found at a desolate mountain kingdom visited by ancient priests from the East as the Magi.
Southeastern Turkey.
7,000 feet high, atop a barren mountain called Nemrud Dagi, lie the ruins of the lost Kingdom of Commagene.
Here, in 62 BC, a mysterious royal sanctuary was built by
King Antiochus I.
Colossal statues were created of lions and eagles, and Persian and Greek gods, as well as two massive sculptures of the king himself.
GILBERT:
Now, what Antiochus was trying to do was to produce a synthesis, a new version of the old religions.
And what he basically did was to take the Persian gods and put them into Greek dress.
So you've got a synthesis happening of the Persian gods with their Greek equivalents.
DONALD SANDERS:
The reason he build a colossal statue of himself among the gods was, I guess, a presumption on his part that he would indeed ascend to heaven and eventually be among them.
NARRATOR:
The conical peak was the highest point in the kingdom of King Antiochus.
Measuring 150 feet high and 500 feet wide, it is man-made with countless small limestone rocks,
and was said to be the location of the king's royal tomb.
Researchers believe the memorial was originally built as two large plazas.
The one on the east side was used to celebrate the birthday of King Antiochus.
The one on the west side was used to commemorate the day in 62 BC when Antiochus became the leader of a secret society.
GILBERT:
I think it's meant to symbolize Mount Olympus, the home of the gods.
Because you've got the God seated round it and then you've got a peak above them.
I think this is all very symbolic.
It's a stage for carrying out certain rituals and performances.
SANDERS:
And he also shows himself in the relief stelae shaking hands to all the gods, as if the gods recognize him as one of their own and are welcoming him into Heaven.
NARRATOR:
Mysteriously, both the site and the kingdom were abandoned in the first century AD.
And, so far, the king's legendary burial chamber has never been found.
But another question still remains: just why did King
Antiochus build this mysterious and massive monumental sanctuary?
According to researchers, evidence found at Nemrud Dagi suggests the king had a profound interest in, and understanding of star sciences.
GILBERT:
One example of the advanced knowledge of astronomy that they had is actually the lion horoscope, which gives us a very precise date.
We know that the position of the stars on the lion's body fits with the positions of stars of Leo given in a book of Eratosthenes, who was a Greek astronomer from Alexandria who wrote a book about the stars.
The arrangement of stars on the lion horoscope represented the constellation of Leo as seen in the sky in July 62 BC, a configuration that wouldn't be visible again for 25,000 years.
Further evidence of the exceptional knowledge of the stars was found in a nearby shaft that Antiochus built into the mountain.
GILBERT:
The shaft runs into the mountainside there, at an angle of 35 degrees to the horizontal, and it's about 150 meters long, and there's nothing at the bottom.
NARRATOR:
Computer analysis reveals that on two days of the year, the sun's rays would illuminate the bottom of the shaft-- once when in line with the constellation of Leo and once when in line with Orion.
GILBERT:
Now, that is a very interesting point in the sky, because it's the path where the sun crosses over the Milky Way, our galaxy.
And that, to the ancient world, was known as the Gate of Heaven.
And there were two of these-- one where they cross in the north and the other where they cross in the south.
There were two Gates to Heaven.
So we can understand that that gateway would be where the soul of the king is going back to heaven through Heaven's Gate.
NARRATOR:
Given the fact that neither Antiochus's tomb or remains have been found, is it possible that the king actually journeyed to the stars through a heavenly gate, as ancient astronaut theorists contend?
During his life, researchers believe Antiochus studied with a priestly sect of Eastern astrologers called the Magi, who were thought to be able to predict and even manipulate events based on their knowledge of the stars.
JASON MARTELL:
The Magi were renown priests from the far near east.
who had advanced astronomical knowledge and it's well known that most of the astronomers from the near east specifically ancient Irak, Sumer, recorded series of events happening in the heavens over hundreds of thousands of years.
This information was kept on stone tablets, held very sacredly and only passed down to the high priests.
NARRATOR:
According to the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament, it was three of these magi who followed celestial signs and stars to the birthplace of Jesus in Bethlehem.
A coincidence?
MARTELL:
What's interesting about this story is that the
Star of Bethlehem wasn't used as a navigation point.
It is clearly stated as it guided the wise men to the place of Christ.
A star cannot guide someone.
It can only be used as a navigation point.
So this brings up the idea that the star was possibly a UFO.
TSOUKALOS:
Today we think that the Magi were magicians and that is actually why we have the word magic today.
But when I hear about magical powers, that raises a flag because magic as such does not exist.
So were these Magi, in fact, in possession of some type of an extraterrestrial technology?
Because, according to the ancient texts, it was the initiates of each culture who were in touch with extraterrestrials.
And it was the initiates who later became priests or magi.
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that Antiochus was, in fact, a magi, one who learned celestial knowledge from extraterrestrial sources?
If so, might the monumental sanctuary at Nemrud Dagi have been built as a place to contact star travelers?
The answer may have been found among the ruins of Nemrud Dagi.
GILBERT:
The head of Antiochus is placed on the statue which is appropriate for Mercury, and that's because
Mercury is the planet of initiation for priests.
And he's one himself, so he models it on himself.
And people think this is him being boastful-- sitting among the gods.
It's not.
It's actually a code to say that he's one with the priests.
NARRATOR:
Eventually annexed by the Romans in the first century AD, King Antiochus and his court became scattered throughout the region.
Or were they?
According to ancient astronaut theorists, they may have instead used a heavenly gate to depart through--- to a distant realm.
An audacious idea?
Perhaps.
And there are those who believe further evidence can be found in one of the driest areas of the world-- in South America.
Peru, South America.
250 miles south of the capital of Lima lies one of the driest places on Earth-- a wasteland that once was home to an ancient civilization called Nazca.
Thriving between the 15th century BC and 500 AD, the Nazca were a deeply religious and spiritual people who built their ceremonial center in the temple city of Cahuachi.
GIUSEPPE OREFICI:
Cahuachi is the largest adobe ceremonial center in the world
Therefore, we find groups of temples and pyramids of immense size.
Spirituality was the most important thing in Cahuachi
The people of Nazca used the sacred spaces to elevate themselves in order to communicate with the deities.
BRIEN FOERSTER:
The Nazca were predominantly were farming people
So Cahuachi was built at the prime when they had all the food they needed and they had enough resources to be able to develop a highly evolved religious system.
NARRATOR:
But the Nazca people and their culture mysteriously vanished some 1,200 years ago, though not before etching a series of enormous geoglyphs-- or ground drawings-- into the nearby desert floor.
OREFICI:
The Nazca Lines were an important element of their religious worship and their ceremonies.
They would walk through these lines during their ceremonies, breaking ceramics and offering important elements to the deities from their own culture.
The great geoglyphs are composed of dozens of spirals, triangles and trapezoids, as well as miles of zigzagging lines.
FOERSTER:
This whole flat area, which covers several square miles, is covered in stones made of iron oxide, either red or black, and that's what gives it the darkish, brownish red appearance.
But right underneath the surface is clay, which is white, and all I have to do---
is that.
The contrast between the clay and the iron oxide gives a Nazca Line.
Acre size drawings depict a hummingbird, a spider, a killer whale and a human figure with owl-like eyes.
FOERSTER:
They would have had to have had observation from the sky in order to guide the workforce the ground as to how to draw complicated figures such as the spider and the hummingbird.
NARRATOR:
Preserved for centuries by the lack of wind and rain, the lines are best seen from the air, and were first spotted by aviators in the 1930s.
But why did the Nazca create patterns that could only be properly seen from a great height?
JORGE LUIS DELGADO MAMANI:
The obvious answer is because you can see only from the sky.
Many of our ancestors would talk about the star people.
All these sacred sites we consider it is for whom?
For the star people
CHILDRESS:
At Nazca and other areas in Peru there are legends of sky people and gods coming down from the sky.
NARRATOR:
But might the so-called star people referred to in the Nazca legends really have been extraterrestrial beings, as ancient astronaut theorists believe?
VON DANIKEN :
In the beginning there was just one line made by some robot or some extraterrestrial spaceship or space shuttle because they were looking for raw material for energy.
TSOUKALOS:
After a while the local population would see all those tracks on the ground.
And they would say, that these tracks were just left behind by these divine beings, by the gods.
And then they would wonder and "what can we do for those gods to return?"
According to ancient astronaut theory, the earliest of the Nazca Lines were made in imitation of the trails left by the first space visitors.
Later generations added more elaborate lines, and then shapes and figures, all in an attempt to signal the star gods to return.
But they never did.
OREFICI:
And this caused the population to doubt the deities, because it was mainly a psychological problem they had with their deities that brought about the abandonment and collapse of the Nazca culture.
NARRATOR:
But could there be other evidence of alien contact with the ancient people of Peru that is even more astounding than the Nazca Lines?
CHILDRESS:
Some of the skulls that we find today, because it's a very dry desert and they're well preserved, are some of the most astonishing, elongated skulls that you'll ever see.
And they look like extraterrestrials.
NARRATOR:
According to Nazca legends, the gods had elongated heads, much like the distended skulls of the controversial
Egyptian pharaoh King Tutankhamen and his sister Meretaten.
FOERSTER:
I honestly believe that the largest of the elongated skulls represent hybrid human beings dating back thousands of years, who lived here very peacefully and could very well be the ancestors of the Inca.
And that could be the reason why the Inca suddenly were these people of incredible sophistication who came from seemingly nowhere.
It's possible that they're descendants from star beings.
CHILDRESS:
Were they trying to imitate people they had already seen, gods from outer space?
NARRATOR:
Is it possible the ancient Nazca altered their bodies and their lands in order to communicate with or emulate something their ancestors may have witnessed, something out of this world?
Perhaps further clues to mankind's extraterrestrial connection can be found in the most remote place on planet Earth: in the South Pacific.
The South Pacific Ocean.
2,300 miles west of South America, in one of the most remote places on Earth, giant stone figures stand with their backs to the sea.
Called moai by the native inhabitants, they are the silent sentinels of Easter Island.
STEVENSON:
The moais are scattered throughout the island, and they're positioned on top of platforms, for the most part.
A moai is a stone sculpture of a deceased ancestor
They were once living individuals who ruled the society or led the society.
They were chiefs.
And then, upon their death, we believe that they've become represented in stone.
Nearly 900 moai were carved between the 12th and 18th centuries.
Hewn with stone tools from volcanic rock, the tallest stands a towering 33 feet high and weighs a staggering 75 tons.
They were even more unique-looking in the past.
They may have been painted.
And they also had large white coral eyes with obsidian pupils.
So it's a very effective way of kind of telling people, not verbally but symbolically, that someone's watching you and you should toe the line.
You should do what you're supposed to do.
NARRATOR:
The people who created the moai called themselves the Rapa Nui, and mainstream historians believe their Polynesian ancestors came to the island in canoes from across the vast
Pacific Ocean between 700 and 1100 AD.
But over several centuries, for reasons that are still unclear, what was once an island paradise withered into a treeless desert, stalked by famine, violence and some say cannibalism.
When the first europeans arrived in 1722, the Rapa Nui culture had already been nearly wiped out... and few could imagine how such primitive people could have created the moai.
NOORY:
How in the heck did they make these?
Where did they come from?
and how did they move them?
Nobody has the answer.
Modern scientists have tried, and so far have failed to duplicate the feats of the ancient Rapa Nui.
In 1987, anthropologist Charles Love used rollers to move a nine-ton moai replica at Western Wyoming Community College.
Ready?
On three.
One, two, three.
Come on, Rick.
- Come on.
- Get it
Good.
Thank you.
Whoa.
Only able to budge it about half an inch.
NARRATOR:
Other researchers have tried pulling moai with sleds.
But there is a unique problem with the idea of moving moai with sleds or rollers.
LOVE:
When you go to Easter Island, you don't get the impression they had enough wood to have rollers.
And in fact, in the 1700s, the first four expeditions to Easter
Island never really saw a tree.
And so that's the real mystery of Easter Island how can you move a multi-ton statue if you have no trees for rollers?
NARRATOR:
According to the oral history of the Rapa Nui, the moai were moved in a very unusual way.
LOVE:
They all reply basically the same thing.
The moai walked to the ahu, and that's the only explanation that they give.
NARRATOR:
But who or what had the power to make multi-ton moai appear to walk to their ahu, or stone platforms?
In 1919, British archaeologist Katherine Routledge, who lived on Easter Island for a year, recorded the legends and testimony of an old woman who said the moai were moved with a mystical energy called mana.
And according to the oral histories of the Rapa Nui, mana came from the gods.
TSOUKALOS:
Mana was a direct gift of the gods given to the Easter Islanders
Was this mana really a type of magical force?
Of course not.
It was some type of misunderstood technology, some type of a device, an extraterrestrial tool with which you could move those massive Easter Island heads rather easily.
NARRATOR:
Did early inhabitants of Easter Island really know how to unlock the secrets of gravity using mana?
And if so, where might such power over the physical world have come from?
Researchers believe there are clues hidden within mysterious written texts called rongorongo, inscribed on pieces of wood, discovered on the island in the 19th century.
LOVE:
This is a rongorongo board.
And it's a replica of ones of old.
About 25 of them are known.
We have had about six or eight different attempts at translating these things, with six or eight different results.
CHILDRESS:
You have to ask yourself, how could the Easter islanders have invented their own writing without some other cultural influence coming there.
Would it have been ancient seafarers coming to Easter Island or perhaps even space visitors?
NARRATOR:
Further evidence of early contact with otherworldly beings can be found in numerous strange stone carvings-- called petroglyphs.
LOVE:
What we see in the petroglyph art of the island are these figures of bird men, these tangata manus, carved in bas relief on the rocks on the very edge of the precipice.
NARRATOR:
In the myths of Easter Island's Rapa Nui, the bird man represents Makemake, the chief god and creator of humanity.
COPPENS:
Did at some point in the past a creature come, which was Bird man who flew in from somewhere?
Did he arrive on this island and did he indeed live very much like a pariah?
Did he die or did he take off again, and is this what the locals keep this legend of this creature who came to them alive through myth, legend and ritual.
Walking stone giants, petroglyphs of flying beings--- might the ancient inhabitants of Easter Island have been familiar with antigravity levitation and spaceflight?
If so, might these astounding abilities-- forever lost to time, have been made possible by extraterrestrial visitors?
Perhaps more evidence can be found in the most famous and alluring of all lost worlds-- the Garden of Eden.
The Middle East
For centuries, archaeologists, theologians and scholars have debated the location-- and even the existence of the ultimate of all lost worlds-- the biblical "Garden of Eden."
It was here, according to the Hebrew Book of Genesis, that a paradise once existed-- a paradise where the first human beings, Adam and Eve, were actually created by God.
But could such a paradise, now shrouded in myth and legend, have actually been a real place?
COPPENS:
When we're looking at the Garden of Eden we know there is actually a physical description as to where it was.
It is set at four very specific rivers, came from it, over near it
So we can actually go in search of this.
ROBERT MULLINS:
Two of these rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers, are well known and actually run through what is Irak today.
The other two rivers that are described are not very clear.
NARRATOR:
Researchers now believe the third river, known as the Karun River, runs through Iran and joins the Euphrates just north of the Persian Gulf.
Then, in 2010, satellite imagery revealed a fossil river, or dry riverbed, called the Wadi Baton, that once flowed through northern Arabia and also joined with the Euphrates.
Could these two rivers have been the location of the Pishon and Gihon rivers-- the lost rivers mentioned in the Bible-- that point to the actual location of the Garden of Eden?
JURIS ZARINS:
When you read the account in the Genesis it says that the four rivers form one river
So very careful reading indicates that the two rivers which are today in Irak, Tigris and Euphrates, and the one which is in Iran, the Karun and a false river, in Arabia, and then when you join them up
to form one river that is the approximate location of northern Persian Gulf.
NARRATOR:
And according to the Bible, that one river flowed through the Garden of Eden.
ZARINS:
And so, based upon Landsat images and a close reading of the Hebrew text, I think that the location of the
Garden of Eden is under the waters of the Persian Gulf and not on land.
NARRATOR:
Scientists believe that during the last ice age, the polar ice caps were two miles high and ocean levels were 170 feet lower than they are today.
Recent studies suggest the area of the Persian Gulf would have been a dry, fertile plain the size of Great Britain, providing an ideal refuge to some of the earliest humans outside Africa nearly 75,000 years ago.
But as the ice caps melted over the course of thousands of years, the waters of what is now the Indian Ocean flooded the land and formed the Persian Gulf.
GRAHAM HANCOCK:
During that long period, there were at least three episodes of very very major flooding.
When you would be looking at 30 or 40 ft rises in sea level virtually over night.
NARRATOR:
Might a great flood-- perhaps the one described in the biblical story of Noah's Ark, really be responsible for the disappearance of the so-called "Garden of Eden"?
Ancient astronaut theorists believe it is not only possible, but that the proof can be found by studying ancient Sumerian texts.
The earliest known civilization of Sumer dates to 5,000 BC, and their first settlement in southern Mesopotamia was called Eridu.
ZARINS:
The ancient Sumerians have a wonderful story.
They believe that they had lived in an area that was probably to the south of what is today Sumer.
And the reason we know that is because they said they came out of the sea.
NARRATOR:
Ancient cuneiform writings that have survived on clay tablets suggest the Sumerians had been brought to
Eridu by their god Enki.
The cuneiform texts also describe an alien race named the Anunnaki who came to Earth and created the first modern human beings.
ZARINS:
Adam in sumerian or a very early form of
Sumerian, means "a small rural settlement."
"Eve," however, isn't Sumerian.
"Eve" in Arabic and the Semitic languages means "one who gives birth."
The word "Eden" is a pre-Sumerian word and it means "plain."
NARRATOR:
But, according to ancient astronaut theory, the
Sumerian accounts may actually refer to a more ancient time, and to a distant fertile plain now lost under the waters of the Persian Gulf.
COPPENS:
Now the question is this, was the Garden of Eden really some kind of laboratory where certain things were created by the ancient scientists of their day?
Well, if mankind was created in a Garden of Eden, then clearly whoever was creating this wasn't a human being, it was somebody else.
TSOUKALOS:
So is it possible that the Garden of Eden was located here on planet Earth?
Yes, but was it a specific geographic location?
I'm not sure.
Personally, I'm leaning more towards the idea that the Garden of Eden was some type of a closed environment somewhere in nature, but it definitely was some type of a laboratory from where modern man originated.
NARRATOR:
Is it really possible that the first humans were created by extraterrestrial beings in what is referred to in the Bible as a "Garden of Eden"?
If so, has the evidence existed all along, on the cuneiform tablets of the ancient Sumerians?
Ancient astronaut theorists believe the answer is a definite yes.
And there are those who believe that such an incredible notion is not only possible, but that the proof lies in the further investigation of lost civilizations and ancient worlds-- an investigation that will not only uncover our past,
but reveal our future.
NARRATOR:
A mighty empire ruled by the descendants of gods.
A remote island where stone giants walked the Earth.
And a fertile garden where modern man was born.
Are the legends behind these ancient locations really based on fact?
If so, why did they exist?
And why have the answers been lost for centuries?
GEORGE NOORY:
How in the heck did they make these?
How did they move them?
Nobody has the answer.
DAVID CHILDRESS:
It may well be that the Garden of Eden today is underwater.
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:
These cultures were connected by flying machines operated by extraterrestrials.
NARRATOR:
Millions of people around the world believe we have been visited in the past by extraterrestrial beings.
What if it were true?
Did ancient aliens really help to shape our history?
And might we find proof by searching for our planet's mysterious lost worlds?
NARRATOR:
Central America.
In a fertile valley between the
Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean
Sea, in what is now Honduras, lie the monumental ruins of Copán.
This archaeological site is believed to have been the cultural and political center of the once mighty Maya civilization that thrived between 2000 BC and 800 AD.
PAYSON SHEETS:
People have called Copán the Paris of
Mesoamerica because it was such a place for the arts and humanities.
The sculpture is beautiful.
The architecture is just magnificent.
NARRATOR:
It is believed that, at one time, Copán was inhabited by as many as 20,000 people and covered an area of ten square miles.
But in the ninth century, this incredible Mayan city was abandoned, and its people vanished.
When Spanish conquistadors arrived in the 16th century, they found only a few farming hamlets.
But why?
DAVID CHEETHAM:
They decimated their environment.
Warfare became endemic.
And it ended.
And people left.
They walked away.
PHILIP COPPENS:
To some extent, the idea that the Mayans became a lost culture is a yes and a no.
We know that they stopped building, but at the very heart of the Mayan is a belief... it's a religion... which continues to beat until this very day, saying, "Please pay attention to us because we have
this vast body of knowledge we want to share with the world."
NARRATOR:
At Copán, the Maya had built a complex of monuments, temples and plazas, as well as sculptured stone pillars depicting ancient kings.
The Maya were also one of the earliest ancient civilizations to create a written language.
ADRIAN GILBERT:
In the last 20, 30 years, there's been a huge advance in the decoding of their hieroglyphs.
This is something that's happened in our generation, and it's still ongoing.
NARRATOR:
Might a closer look at the Mayan stone carvings and their hieroglyphs provide proof of contact with extraterrestrials at Copán?
According to ancient astronaut theorists, the answer is yes.
TSOUKALOS:
Some of the large statues at Copán are infinitely fascinating to me because the gear that they're wearing is very reminiscent of something technological.
One of the figures has a box with tubes coming out and buttons and just very weird things.
These statues look like some type of a being wearing an astronaut suit.
And, in my opinion, that means that we were visited by some type of extraterrestrials who were very similar in appearance to us, because according to the ancient texts, we were created in their image.
NARRATOR:
Researchers working in Copán have also found stone sculptures called stelae, which have provoked controversy since the site was discovered in 1576.
And various interpretations of the carvings suggest the
Maya may have had knowledge of a world far beyond their own continent.
CHILDRESS:
This is one of the curious dragon sculptures here at Copán, of which there are many.
In fact, these very Oriental statues would look right at place in China or some other
Oriental country.
Some archaeologists believe that there are elephants on either side of this Copán ruler.
So why would there be, here at
Copán, such Asian motifs as elephants and dragons in a place in Central America that is so far away from China and
Southeast Asia?
Is there some kind of extraterrestrial connection between the Mayans and the
Chinese, and an origin for both that comes from the stars?
NARRATOR:
How could the early
Maya of Central America have had knowledge possessed by people living in Asia... on the other side of the Pacific Ocean?
TSOUKALOS:
One of the basic premises of the ancient astronaut theory suggests that there was contact between ancient cultures way before we give them credit.
These ancient cultures were, in fact, connected by flying machines, and those flying machines were usually operated by extraterrestrials.
And especially in the Mayan carvings, we find many references of the gods descending from the sky in flying serpents.
Now, do flying serpents actually exist?
Of course not.
But it is a beautiful and very poetic description of something that is rooted in technology.
NARRATOR:
Do the many strange carvings found at Copán really provide proof of contact between the Maya and otherworldly beings?
And if so, might that contact have produced offspring that could also be traced to an extraterrestrial source?
On the west side of the main temple at Copán stands a 63-step structure known as the
Hieroglyphic Stairway.
It contains more than 1,200 stones carved with symbols that record the history of the kings of Copán.
CHILDRESS:
This Hieroglyphic
Stairway is the longest Mayan inscription in the world.
It emphasizes the divine right of the 16 rulers of the Copán dynasty to rule their subjects... a power given to them by the gods.
SHEETS:
The Hieroglyphic
Stairway mentions the various rulers of Copán and talks about them in a semidivine sense.
So they're human, they're mortal, but they are much more than that.
They are royal.
They have a spirit in their blood, and Maya called it Xuit
Lel.
A Xuit Lel is in the blood and is the most powerful thing to get access to the supernatural.
So a king's Xuit Lel, when shed in a bloodletting ceremony and burned with copal incense, goes up into the heavens and takes a message to the deities, and they did things for the Maya.
NARRATOR:
Could the Maya rulers really have been the descendants of extraterrestrials, as ancient astronaut theorists believe?
Perhaps conclusive evidence can be found in what is widely believed to be the most advanced celestial calendar system of ancient times.
VON DANIKEN:
The Mayas had the most precise calendar of all the people in antiquity, even the Babylonians, the Sumerians.
They did not only observe our planetary system, they observed
Orion, they observed Sirius and other far away systems.
LOHSE:
One of the things that sets the Maya apart was their ability to monitor the passage of astronomical events and to track the movements of constellations to predict eclipses.
They really developed some of this knowledge and skill to a pretty high degree.
CHEETHAM:
It's remarkable.
No telescopes, no metal, yet the ability to predict time and events in time, in a way that was really unprecedented in the world.
NARRATOR:
But why did the
Maya create such precise maps of the cosmos?
According to ancient astronaut theorists, the Mayans' knowledge of the stars, in fact, came to them from the stars, brought by extraterrestrial beings.
COPPENS:
When it comes to the ancient Maya, their creation mythology invokes these legends which say that somewhere just south of Orion's belt is this place where life originated from and came to planet Earth,
112 BC, when the ancient
Mayans said the gods came to Earth.
VON DANIKEN:
Their teachers were the gods, and the gods were the extraterrestrials.
NARRATOR:
If beings from another star system really came to Earth in the ancient past, did they create the foundations of Mayan civilization and breed with its rulers?
Might they have also visited other areas of our planet?
Perhaps further evidence can be found at a desolate mountain kingdom known to ancient priests from the East as the magi.
NARRATOR:
Southeastern
Turkey.
7,000 feet high, atop a barren mountain called Nemrud Dagi, lie the ruins of the lost Kingdom of
Commagene.
Here, in 62 BC, a mysterious royal sanctuary was built by
King Antiochus I.
Colossal statues were created of lions and eagles, and Persian and Greek gods, as well as two massive sculptures of the king himself.
GILBERT:
Now, what Antiochus was trying to do was to produce a synthesis, a new version of the old religions.
And what he basically did was to take the Persian gods and put them into Greek dress.
So you've got a synthesis happening of the Persian gods with their Greek equivalents.
SANDERS:
The reason he built a colossal statue of himself among the gods was,
I guess, a presumption on his part that he would indeed ascend to heaven and eventually be among them.
NARRATOR:
The conical peak was the highest point in the kingdom of King Antiochus.
Measuring 150 feet high and 500 feet wide, it is man-made with countless small limestone rocks, and was said to be the location of the king's royal tomb.
Researchers believe the memorial was originally built as two large plazas.
The one on the east side was used to celebrate the birthday of King Antiochus.
The one on the west side was used to commemorate the day in
62 BC when Antiochus became the leader of a secret society.
GILBERT:
I think it's meant to symbolize Mount Olympus, the home of the gods.
'Cause you've got the gods seated round it and then you've got a peak above them.
I think this is all very symbolic.
It's a stage for carrying out certain rituals and performances.
SANDERS:
And he also shows himself in the relief stelae shaking hands to all the gods, as if the gods recognize him as one of their own and are welcoming him into Heaven.
NARRATOR:
Mysteriously, both the site and the kingdom were abandoned in the first century AD.
And, so far, the king's legendary burial chamber has never been found.
But another question still remains: just why did King
Antiochus build this mysterious and massive monumental sanctuary?
According to researchers, evidence found at Nemrud Dagi suggests the king had a profound interest in, and understanding of, star sciences.
GILBERT:
One example of the advanced knowledge of astronomy that they had is actually the lion horoscope, which gives us a very precise date.
We know that the position of the stars on the lion's body fits with the positions of stars of
Leo given in a book of
Eratosthenes, who was a Greek astronomer from Alexandria who wrote a book about the stars.
NARRATOR:
The arrangement of stars on the lion horoscope represented the constellation of
Leo as seen in the sky in July 62 BC, a configuration that wouldn't be visible again for
25,000 years.
Further evidence of the exceptional knowledge of the stars was found in a nearby shaft that Antiochus built into the mountain.
GILBERT:
The shaft runs into the mountainside there, at an angle of 35 degrees to the horizontal, and it's about
150 meters long, and there's nothing at the bottom.
NARRATOR:
Computer analysis reveals that on two days of the year, the sun's rays would illuminate the bottom of the shaft... once when in line with the constellation of Leo and once when in line with Orion.
GILBERT:
Now, that is a very interesting point in the sky, because it's the path where the sun crosses over the Milky Way, our galaxy.
And that, to the ancient world, was known as the Gate of Heaven.
And there were two of these... one where they cross in the north and the other where they cross in the south.
There were two Gates to Heaven.
So we can understand that that gateway would be where the soul of the king is going back to heaven through Heaven's Gate.
NARRATOR:
Given the fact that neither Antiochus's tomb or remains have been found, is it possible that the king actually journeyed to the stars through a heavenly gate, as ancient astronaut theorists contend?
During his life, researchers believe Antiochus studied with a priestly sect of Eastern astrologers called the magi, who were thought to be able to predict and even manipulate events based on their knowledge of the stars.
JASON MARTELL:
The magi were renowned priests from the far
Near East who had advanced astronomical knowledge.
And it's well known that most of the astronomers from the Near
East, specifically ancient Iraq,
Sumer, recorded series of events happening in the heavens over hundreds of thousands of years.
This information was kept on stone tablets, held very sacredly and only passed down to the high priests.
NARRATOR:
According to the
Gospel of Matthew in the
New Testament, it was three of these magi who followed celestial signs and stars to the birthplace of Jesus in Bethlehem.
A coincidence?
MARTELL:
What's interesting about this story is that the
Star of Bethlehem wasn't used as a navigation point.
It is clearly stated as it guided the wise men to the place of Christ.
A star cannot guide someone.
It can only be used as a navigation point.
So this brings up the idea that the star was possibly a UFO.
TSOUKALOS:
Today, we think that the magi were magicians, and that is actually why we have the word "magic" today.
But when I hear about magical powers, that raises a flag, because magic, as such, does not exist.
So were these magi, in fact, in possession of some type of an extraterrestrial technology?
Because, according to the ancient texts, it was the initiates of each culture who were in touch with extraterrestrials.
And it was the initiates who later became priests or magi.
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that
Antiochus was, in fact, a magi, one who learned celestial knowledge from extraterrestrial sources?
If so, might the monumental sanctuary at Nemrud Dagi have been built as a place to contact star travelers?
The answer may have been found among the ruins of Nemrud Dagi.
GILBERT:
The head of
Antiochus is placed on the statue which is appropriate for
Mercury, and that's because
Mercury is the planet of initiation for priests.
And he's one himself, so he models it on himself.
And people think this is him being boastful... sitting among the gods.
It's not.
It's actually a code to say that he's one with the priests.
NARRATOR:
Eventually annexed by the Romans in the first century AD, King Antiochus and his court became scattered throughout the region.
Or were they?
According to ancient astronaut theorists, they may have instead used a heavenly gate to depart through... to a distant realm.
An audacious idea?
Perhaps.
And there are those who believe further evidence can be found in one of the driest areas of the world... in South America.
NARRATOR:
Peru,
South America.
250 miles south of the capitol of Lima lies one of the driest places on Earth... a wasteland that once was home to an ancient civilization called Nazca.
Thriving between the 15th century BC and 500 AD, the
Nazca were a deeply religious and spiritual people who built their ceremonial center in the temple city of Cahuachi.
OREFICI (translated):
Cahuachi is the largest adobe ceremonial center in the world.
Therefore, we find groups of temples and pyramids of immense size.
Spirituality was the most important thing in Cahuachi.
The people of Nazca used the sacred spaces to elevate themselves in order to communicate with the deities.
BRIEN FOERSTER:
The Nazca predominantly were a farming people, so Cahuachi was built at the prime, when they had all the food they needed and they had enough resources to be able to develop a highly evolved religious system.
NARRATOR:
But the Nazca people and their culture mysteriously vanished some
1,200 years ago, though not before etching a series of enormous geoglyphs... or ground drawings... into the nearby desert floor.
OREFICI (translated):
The
Nazca Lines were an important element of their religious worship and their ceremonies.
They would walk through these lines during their ceremonies, breaking ceramics and offering important elements to the deities from their own culture.
NARRATOR:
The great geoglyphs are composed of dozens of spirals, triangles and trapezoids, as well as miles of zigzagging lines.
FOERSTER:
This whole flat area, which covers several square miles, is covered in stones made of iron oxide, either red or black, and that's what gives it the darkish, brownish red appearance.
But right underneath the surface is clay, which is white, and all
I have to do is that.
The contrast between the clay and the iron oxide gives a
Nazca Line.
NARRATOR:
Acre-sized drawings depict a hummingbird, a spider, a killer whale and a human figure with owllike eyes.
FOERSTER:
They would have had to have had observation from the sky in order to guide the workforce on the ground as to how to draw complicated figures such as the spider and the hummingbird.
NARRATOR:
Preserved for centuries by the lack of wind and rain, the lines are best seen from the air, and were first spotted by aviators in the 1930s.
But why did the Nazca create patterns that could only be properly seen from a great height?
JORGE LUIS DELGADO MAMANI:
The obvious answer is because you can see only from the sky.
Many of our ancestors would talk about the star people.
All the sacred sites... we consider it is for whom?
For the star people.
CHILDRESS:
At Nazca and other areas in Peru, there are legends of sky people and gods coming down from the sky.
NARRATOR:
But might the so-called star people referred to in the Nazca legends really have been extraterrestrial beings, as ancient astronaut theorists believe?
VON DANIKEN:
In the beginning, there was just one line made by some robot or some extraterrestrial spaceship, some space shuttle, because they were looking for raw material for energy.
TSOUKALOS:
After a while, the local population would see all those tracks on the ground, and they would say that these tracks were just left behind by these divine beings, by the gods, and then they would wonder, "And
what can we do for those gods to return?"
NARRATOR:
According to ancient astronaut theory, the earliest of the Nazca Lines were made in imitation of the trails left by the first space visitors.
Later generations added more elaborate lines, and then shapes and figures, all in an attempt to signal the star gods to return.
But they never did.
OREFICI (translated):
And this caused the population to doubt the deities, because it was mainly a psychological problem they had with their deities that brought about the abandonment and collapse of the
Nazca culture.
NARRATOR:
But could there be other evidence of alien contact with the ancient people of Peru that is even more astounding than the Nazca Lines?
CHILDRESS:
Some of the skulls that we find today, because it's a very dry desert and they're well preserved, are some of the most astonishing, elongated skulls that you'll ever see.
And they look like extraterrestrials.
NARRATOR:
According to Nazca legends, the gods had elongated heads, much like the distended skulls of the controversial
Egyptian pharaoh King
Tutankhamen and his sister
Meretaten.
FORRESTER:
I honestly believe that the largest of the elongated skulls represent hybrid human beings dating back thousands of years, who lived here very peacefully and could very well be the ancestors of the Inca.
And that could be the reason why the Inca suddenly were these people of incredible sophistication who came from seemingly nowhere.
It's possible that they're descendants from star beings.
CHILDRESS:
Were they trying to imitate people they had already seen, gods from outer space?
NARRATOR:
Is it possible the ancient Nazca altered their bodies and their lands in order to communicate with or emulate something their ancestors may have witnessed, something out of this world?
Perhaps further clues to mankind's extraterrestrial connection can be found in the most remote place on planet
Earth: in the South Pacific.
NARRATOR:
The South
Pacific Ocean.
2,300 miles west of South
America, in one of the most remote places on Earth, giant stone figures stand with their backs to the sea.
Called moai by the native inhabitants, they are the silent sentinels of Easter island.
STEVENSON:
The moais are scattered throughout the island, and they're positioned on top of platforms, for the most part.
A moai is a stone sculpture of a deceased ancestor.
They were once living individuals who ruled the society or led the society.
They were chiefs.
And then, upon their death, we believe that they've become represented in stone.
NARRATOR:
Nearly 900 moai were carved between the 12th and 18th centuries.
Hewn with stone tools from volcanic rock, the tallest stands a towering 33 feet high and weighs a staggering 75 tons.
STEVENSON:
They were probably even more unique-looking in the past.
They may have been painted.
And they also had large white coral eyes with obsidian pupils.
So it's a very effective way of kind of telling people, not verbally but symbolically, that someone's watching you and you should toe the line.
You should do what you're supposed to do.
NARRATOR:
The people who created the moai called themselves the Rapa Nui, and mainstream historians believe their Polynesian ancestors came to the island in canoes from across the vast
Pacific Ocean between 700 and 1100 AD.
But over several centuries, for reasons that are still unclear, what was once an island paradise withered into a treeless desert, stalked by famine, violence and some say cannibalism.
When the first Europeans arrived in 1722, the Rapa Nui culture had already been nearly wiped out... and few could imagine how such primitive people could have created the moai.
NOORY:
How in the heck did they make these?
Where did they come from?
And how did they move them?
Nobody has the answer.
NARRATOR:
Modern scientists have tried, and so far have failed, to duplicate the feats of the ancient Rapa Nui.
In 1987, anthropologist Charles
Love used rollers to move a nine-ton moai replica at Western
Wyoming Community College.
Ready?
On three.
One, two, three.
Come on, Rick.
Come on.
Good.
Thank you.
Whoa.
Only able to budge it about half an inch.
NARRATOR:
Other researchers have tried pulling moai with sleds.
But there is a unique problem with the idea of moving moai with sleds or rollers.
LOVE:
When you go to Easter island, you don't get the impression they had enough wood to have rollers.
And in fact, in the 1700s, the first four expeditions to Easter island never really saw a tree.
And so that's the real mystery of Easter island.
How can you move a multi-ton statue if you have no trees for rollers?
NARRATOR:
According to the oral history of the Rapa Nui, the moai were moved in a very unusual way.
LOVE:
They all reply basically the same thing.
The moai walked to the ahu, and that's the only explanation that they give.
NARRATOR:
But who or what had the power to make multi-ton moai appear to walk to their ahu, or stone platforms?
In 1919, British archaeologist
Katherine Routledge, who lived on Easter island for a year, recorded the legends and testimony of an old woman who said the moai were moved with a mystical energy called mana.
And according to the oral histories of the Rapa Nui, mana came from the gods.
TSOUKALOS:
Mana was a direct gift of the gods given to the
Easter islanders.
Was this mana really a type of magical force?
Of course not.
It was some type of misunderstood technology, some type of a device, an extraterrestrial tool with which you could move those massive
Easter island heads rather easily.
NARRATOR:
Did early inhabitants of Easter island really know how to unlock the secrets of gravity using mana?
And if so, where might such power over the physical world have come from?
Researchers believe there are clues hidden within mysterious written texts called rongorongo, inscribed on pieces of wood, discovered on the island in the 19th century.
LOVE:
This is a rongorongo board.
And it's a replica of ones of old.
About 25 of them are known.
We have had about six or eight different attempts at translating these things, with six or eight different results.
CHILDRESS:
You have to ask yourself: how could the Easter islanders have invented their own writing without some other cultural influence coming there?
Would it have been ancient seafarers coming to Easter island or perhaps even space visitors?
NARRATOR:
Further evidence of early contact with otherworldly beings can be found in numerous strange stone carvings... called petroglyphs.
LOVE:
What we see in the petroglyph art of the island are these figures of bird men, these tangata manus, carved in bas relief on the rocks on the very edge of the precipice.
NARRATOR:
In the myths of
Easter island's Rapa Nui, the bird man represents Makemake, the chief god and creator of humanity.
COPPENS:
Did at some point in the past a creature come, which was bird man who flew in from somewhere.
Did he arrive on this island and did he indeed live very much like a pariah?
Did he die or did he take off again, and is this what the locals keep this legend of this creature who came to them alive through myth, legend and ritual.
NARRATOR:
Walking stone giants, petroglyphs of flying beings... might the ancient inhabitants of Easter island have been familiar with antigravity levitation and spaceflight?
If so, might these astounding abilities... forever lost to time, have been made possible by extraterrestrial visitors?
Perhaps more evidence can be found in the most famous and alluring of all lost worlds... the Garden of Eden.
NARRATOR:
The Middle East.
For centuries, archaeologists, theologians and scholars have debated the location... and even the existence of the ultimate of all lost worlds... the biblical "Garden of Eden."
it was here, according to the
Hebrew Book of Genesis, that a paradise once existed... a paradise where the first human beings, Adam and Eve, were actually created by God.
But could such a paradise, now shrouded in myth and legend, have actually been a real place?
COPPENS:
When we're looking at the Garden of Eden, we know that actually there is a physical description as to where it was.
It is said that four very specific rivers came from it or were near it.
So we can actually go in search of this.
MULLINS:
Two of these rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, are well known, and actually run through what is Iraq today.
The other two rivers that are described are not very clear.
NARRATOR:
Researchers now believe the third river, known as the Karun River, runs through
Iran and joins the Euphrates just north of the Persian Gulf.
Then, in 2010, satellite imagery revealed a fossil river, or dry riverbed, called the Wadi Baton, that once flowed through northern Arabia and also joined with the Euphrates.
Could these two rivers have been the location of the Pishon and Gihon rivers... the lost rivers mentioned in the Bible... that point to the actual location of the Garden of Eden?
JURIS ZARINS:
When you read the account in Genesis, it says that the four rivers formed one river.
So very careful reading indicates that the two rivers, which are today in Iraq... the
Tigris and Euphrates... and the one river, which is in Iran, the Karun, and the fossil river in Arabia, when you join them up, and form one river, it's at the approximate location
of northern Persian Gulf.
NARRATOR:
And according to the Bible, that one river flowed through the Garden of Eden.
ZARINS:
And so, based upon
Landsat images and a close reading of the Hebrew text, I think that the location of the
Garden of Eden is under the waters of the Persian Gulf and not on land.
NARRATOR:
Scientists believe that during the last ice age, the polar ice caps were two miles high and ocean levels were
170 feet lower than they are today.
Recent studies suggest the area of the Persian Gulf would have been a dry, fertile plain the size of Great Britain, providing an ideal refuge to some of the earliest humans outside Africa nearly 75,000 years ago.
But as the ice caps melted over the course of thousands of years, the waters of what is now the Indian Ocean flooded the land and formed the Persian
Gulf.
GRAHAM HANCOCK:
During that long period, there were at least three episodes of very, very major flooding, when you would be looking at 30 or 40 foot rises in sea level, virtually overnight.
NARRATOR:
Might a great flood... perhaps the one described in the biblical story of Noah's Ark, really be responsible for the disappearance of the so-called
"Garden of Eden"?
Ancient astronaut theorists believe it is not only possible, but that the proof can be found by studying ancient Sumerian texts.
The earliest known civilization of Sumer dates to 5,000 BC, and their first settlement in southern Mesopotamia was called
Eridu.
ZARINS:
The ancient Sumerians have a wonderful story.
They believe that they had lived in an area that was probably to the south of what is today
Sumer.
And the reason we know that is because they said they came out of the sea.
NARRATOR:
Ancient cuneiform writings that have survived on clay tablets suggest the
Sumerians had been brought to
Eridu by their god Enki.
The cuneiform texts also describe an alien race named the
Anunnaki who came to Earth and created the first modern human beings.
ZARINS: "Adam" in Sumerian, or a very early form of
Sumerian, means "a small rural settlement."
"Eve," however, isn't Sumerian.
"Eve" in Arabic and the Semitic languages means "one who gives birth."
The word "Eden" is a pre-Sumerian word and it means
"plain."
NARRATOR:
But, according to ancient astronaut theory, the
Sumerian accounts may actually refer to a more ancient time, and to a distant fertile plain now lost under the waters of the
Persian Gulf.
COPPENS:
Now the question is this, was the Garden of Eden really some kind of laboratory where certain things were created by the ancient scientists of their day?
Well, if mankind was created in a Garden of Eden, then clearly whoever was creating this wasn't a human being, it was somebody else.
TSOUKALOS:
So is it possible that the Garden of Eden was located here on planet Earth?
Yes, but was it a specific geographic location?
I'm not sure.
Personally, I'm leaning more towards the idea that the Garden of Eden was some type of a closed environment somewhere in nature, but it definitely was some type of a laboratory from where modern man originated.
NARRATOR:
Is it really possible that the first humans were created by extraterrestrial beings in what is referred to in the Bible as a "Garden of Eden"?
If so, has the evidence existed all along, on the cuneiform tablets of the ancient
Sumerians?
Ancient astronaut theorists believe the answer is a definite yes.
And there are those who believe that such an incredible notion is not only possible, but that the proof lies in the further investigation of lost civilizations and ancient worlds... an investigation that will not only uncover our past,
but reveal our future.

A mighty empire ruled by the descendants of gods.
A remote island where stone giants walked the Earth.
And a fertile garden where modern man was born.
Are the legends behind these ancient locations really based on fact?
If so, why did they exist?
And why have the answers been lost to history?
How in the heck did they make these?
How did they move them?
Nobody has the answer.
It may well be that the Garden of Eden today is underwater.
These cultures were connected by flying machines operated by extraterrestrials.
Millions of people around the world believe we have been visited in the past by extraterrestrial beings.
What if it were true?
Did ancient aliens really help to shape our history?
And might we find proof by searching for our planet's mysterious lost worlds?
Central America
In a fertile valley between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, in what is now Honduras, lie the monumental ruins of Copan.
This archaeological site is believed to have been the cultural and political center of the once mighty Maya civilization that thrived between 2000 BC and 800 AD.
People have called Copan the paradise of Mesoamerica because it was such a place for the arts and humanities
The sculpture is beautiful.
Architecture is just magnificent.
It is believed that, at one time, Copan was inhabited by as many as 20,000 people and covered an area of ten square miles.
But in the ninth century, this incredible Mayan city was abandoned, and its people vanished.
When Spanish conquistadors arrived in the 16th century, they found only a few farming hamlets.
But why?
They decimated their environment.
Warfare became endemic.
And it ended.
And people left.
They walked away.
To some extend, the idea that the Mayans became a lost culture is a yes and a no.
We know that they stopped building.
But at the very heart of the Mayan, it's a belief, it's a religion.
which continues to beaten to this very day.
saying, please pay attention to us because we have this vast body of knowledge
"want to share with the world."
At Copan, the Mayan had built a complex of monuments, temples and plazas, as well as sculptured stone pillars depicting ancient kings.
The Maya were also one of the earliest ancient civilizations to create a written language.
In the last 20, 30 years, it's been a huge advance in the decoding of their hieroglyphs.
This is obvious happened in our generation is still ongoing.
Might a closer look at the Mayan stone carvings and their hieroglyphs provide proof of contact with extraterrestrials at Copan?
According to ancient astronaut theorists, the answer is yes.
Some of the large stautes at Copan are infantly fascinating to me the gear they are wearing is very reminiscent of something technological.
One of the figures has a box with tubes coming out and buttons and just very weird things.
These statues look like some type of a being wearing an astronaut suit.
And, in my opinion, that means that we were visited by some type of extraterrestrials who were very similar in appearance to us, because according to the ancient texts, we were created in their image.
Researchers working in Copan have also found stone sculptures called stelae, which have provoked controversy since the site was discovered in 1576.
And various interpretations of the carvings suggest the Maya may have had knowledge of a world far beyond their own continent.
This is one of the curious dragon sculptures here at Copan, of which there are many.
In fact, this very oriental statues would look right at place in China or some other Oriental country.
Some archeologists believe that they are elephants on either side of this Copan ruler.
So why would there be, here at Copan, such Asian motifs as elephants and dragons in a place in Central America that is so far away from China and Southeast Asia?
Is there some kind of extraterrestrial connection between the Mayans and the Chinese, and an origin for both that comes from the stars?
How could the early Maya of Central America have had knowledge possessed by people living in Asia-- on the other side of the Pacific Ocean?
One of the basic premises of the ancient astronaut theory suggests that there was contact between ancient cultures way before we give them credit.
These ancient cultures were, in fact, connected by flying machines, and those flying machines were usually operated by extraterrestrials.
And especially in the Mayan carvings, we find many references of the gods descending from the sky in flying serpents.
Now, do flying serpents actually exist?
Of course not.
But it is a beautiful and very poetic description of something that is rooted in technology.
Due to the many strange carvings found at Copan really provide proof of contact between the Maya and otherworldly beings?
And if so, might that contact have produced offspring that could also be traced to an extraterrestrial source?
On the west side of the main temple at Copan stands a 63-step structure known as the Hieroglyphic Stairway.
It contains more than 1,200 stones carved with symbols that record the history of the kings of Copan.
This Hieroglyphic Stairway is the longest Mayan inscription in the world.
It emphasizes the divine right of the 16 rulers of the Copan dynasty to rule their subjects-- a power given to them by the gods.
The Hieroglyphic Stairway mentions the various rulers of Copan.
And talks about them in a semi divine sense.
So, they are human, they're mortal, but they are much more than that.
They are royal.
They have a spirit in their blood, and Maya called it Xuit Lel.
A Xuit Lel is in the blood and is the most powerful thing to get access to the supernatural.
So a king's Xuit Lel, when shed in a bloodletting ceremony and burned with copal incense, goes up into the heavens and takes a message to the deities, and they did things for the Maya.
Could the Maya rulers really have been the descendants of extraterrestrials, as ancient astronaut theorists believe?
Perhaps conclusive evidence can be found in what is widely believed to be the most advanced celestial calendar system of ancient times.
The Mayas had most the most precise calendar of all the people in antiquity, even the Babylonian, the Sumerian
They did not only observed our planetary system
They observed Orion, they observed Sirius and all the far away systems.
One of the things that says about the Maya part it was the their ability to monitor the passage of astronomical events and to track the movement of constellations, to predict eclipses
They really developed some of this knowledge and skills to a pretty high degree.
It's remarkable.
No telescopes, no metal, yet the ability to predict time and advance in time in a way that it was really unprecedented in the world.
But why did the Maya create such precise maps of the Cosmos?
According to ancient astronauts theorists, the Maya's knowledge of the stars, in fact, came to them, from the stars, brought by extraterrestrial beings.
When it comes to the ancient Maya that creation mythology evokes these legends, which say somewhere, just south of Orion's belt is this place where life originated from and they came to planet Earth on 1,200 BC when the ancient Mayans said the gods came to Earth.
Their teachers were the gods, and the gods were the extraterrestrials.
If beings from another star system really came to Earth in the ancient past, did they create the foundations of Mayan civilization and breed with its rulers?
Might they have also visited other areas of our planet?
Perhaps further evidence can be found at a desolate mountain kingdom visited by ancient priests from the East as the Magi.
Southeastern Turkey.
7,000 feet high, atop a barren mountain called Nemrud Dagi, lie the ruins of the lost Kingdom of Commagene.
Here, in 62 BC, a mysterious royal sanctuary was built by
King Antiochus I.
Colossal statues were created of lions and eagles, and Persian and Greek gods, as well as two massive sculptures of the king himself.
Now, what Antiochus was trying to do was to produce a synthesis, a new version of the old religions.
And what he basically did was to take the Persian gods and put them into Greek dress.
So you've got a synthesis happening of the Persian gods with their Greek equivalents.
The reason he build a colossal statue of himself among the gods was, I guess, a presumption on his part that he would indeed ascend to heaven and eventually be among them.
The conical peak was the highest point in the kingdom of King Antiochus.
Measuring 150 feet high and 500 feet wide, it is man-made with countless small limestone rocks,
and was said to be the location of the king's royal tomb.
Researchers believe the memorial was originally built as two large plazas.
The one on the east side was used to celebrate the birthday of King Antiochus.
The one on the west side was used to commemorate the day in 62 BC when Antiochus became the leader of a secret society.
I think it's meant to symbolize Mount Olympus, the home of the gods.
Because you've got the God seated round it and then you've got a peak above them.
I think this is all very symbolic.
It's a stage for carrying out certain rituals and performances.
And he also shows himself in the relief stelae shaking hands to all the gods, as if the gods recognize him as one of their own and are welcoming him into Heaven.
Mysteriously, both the site and the kingdom were abandoned in the first century AD.
And, so far, the king's legendary burial chamber has never been found.
But another question still just why did King
Antiochus build this mysterious and massive monumental sanctuary?
According to researchers, evidence found at Nemrud Dagi suggests the king had a profound interest in, and understanding of star sciences.
One example of the advanced knowledge of astronomy that they had is actually the lion horoscope, which gives us a very precise date.
We know that the position of the stars on the lion's body fits with the positions of stars of Leo given in a book of Eratosthenes, who was a Greek astronomer from Alexandria who wrote a book about the stars.
The arrangement of stars on the lion horoscope represented the constellation of Leo as seen in the sky in July 62 BC, a configuration that wouldn't be visible again for 25,000 years.
Further evidence of the exceptional knowledge of the stars was found in a nearby shaft that Antiochus built into the mountain.
The shaft runs into the mountainside there, at an angle of 35 degrees to the horizontal, and it's about 150 meters long, and there's nothing at the bottom.
Computer analysis reveals that on two days of the year, the sun's rays would illuminate the bottom of the shaft-- once when in line with the constellation of Leo and once when in line with Orion.
Now, that is a very interesting point in the sky, because it's the path where the sun crosses over the Milky Way, our galaxy.
And that, to the ancient world, was known as the Gate of Heaven.
And there were two of these-- one where they cross in the north and the other where they cross in the south.
There were two Gates to Heaven.
So we can understand that that gateway would be where the soul of the king is going back to heaven through Heaven's Gate.
Given the fact that neither Antiochus's tomb or remains have been found, is it possible that the king actually journeyed to the stars through a heavenly gate, as ancient astronaut theorists contend?
During his life, researchers believe Antiochus studied with a priestly sect of Eastern astrologers called the Magi, who were thought to be able to predict and even manipulate events based on their knowledge of the stars.
The Magi were renown priests from the far near east.
who had advanced astronomical knowledge and it's well known that most of the astronomers from the near east specifically ancient Irak, Sumer, recorded series of events happening in the heavens over hundreds of thousands of years.
This information was kept on stone tablets, held very sacredly and only passed down to the high priests.
According to the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament, it was three of these magi who followed celestial signs and stars to the birthplace of Jesus in Bethlehem.
A coincidence?
What's interesting about this story is that the
Star of Bethlehem wasn't used as a navigation point.
It is clearly stated as it guided the wise men to the place of Christ.
A star cannot guide someone.
It can only be used as a navigation point.
So this brings up the idea that the star was possibly a UFO.
Today we think that the Magi were magicians and that is actually why we have the word magic today.
But when I hear about magical powers, that raises a flag because magic as such does not exist.
So were these Magi, in fact, in possession of some type of an extraterrestrial technology?
Because, according to the ancient texts, it was the initiates of each culture who were in touch with extraterrestrials.
And it was the initiates who later became priests or magi.
Is it possible that Antiochus was, in fact, a magi, one who learned celestial knowledge from extraterrestrial sources?
If so, might the monumental sanctuary at Nemrud Dagi have been built as a place to contact star travelers?
The answer may have been found among the ruins of Nemrud Dagi.
The head of Antiochus is placed on the statue which is appropriate for Mercury, and that's because
Mercury is the planet of initiation for priests.
And he's one himself, so he models it on himself.
And people think this is him being boastful-- sitting among the gods.
It's not.
It's actually a code to say that he's one with the priests.
Eventually annexed by the Romans in the first century AD, King Antiochus and his court became scattered throughout the region.
Or were they?
According to ancient astronaut theorists, they may have instead used a heavenly gate to depart through--- to a distant realm.
An audacious idea?
Perhaps.
And there are those who believe further evidence can be found in one of the driest areas of the world-- in South America.
Peru, South America.
250 miles south of the capital of Lima lies one of the driest places on Earth-- a wasteland that once was home to an ancient civilization called Nazca.
Thriving between the 15th century BC and 500 AD, the Nazca were a deeply religious and spiritual people who built their ceremonial center in the temple city of Cahuachi.
Cahuachi is the largest adobe ceremonial center in the world
Therefore, we find groups of temples and pyramids of immense size.
Spirituality was the most important thing in Cahuachi
The people of Nazca used the sacred spaces to elevate themselves in order to communicate with the deities.
The Nazca were predominantly were farming people
So Cahuachi was built at the prime when they had all the food they needed and they had enough resources to be able to develop a highly evolved religious system.
But the Nazca people and their culture mysteriously vanished some 1,200 years ago, though not before etching a series of enormous geoglyphs-- or ground drawings-- into the nearby desert floor.
The Nazca Lines were an important element of their religious worship and their ceremonies.
They would walk through these lines during their ceremonies, breaking ceramics and offering important elements to the deities from their own culture.
The great geoglyphs are composed of dozens of spirals, triangles and trapezoids, as well as miles of zigzagging lines.
This whole flat area, which covers several square miles, is covered in stones made of iron oxide, either red or black, and that's what gives it the darkish, brownish red appearance.
But right underneath the surface is clay, which is white, and all I have to do---
is that.
The contrast between the clay and the iron oxide gives a Nazca Line.
Acre size drawings depict a hummingbird, a spider, a killer whale and a human figure with owl-like eyes.
They would have had to have had observation from the sky in order to guide the workforce the ground as to how to draw complicated figures such as the spider and the hummingbird.
Preserved for centuries by the lack of wind and rain, the lines are best seen from the air, and were first spotted by aviators in the 1930s.
But why did the Nazca create patterns that could only be properly seen from a great height?
The obvious answer is because you can see only from the sky.
Many of our ancestors would talk about the star people.
All these sacred sites we consider it is for whom?
For the star people
At Nazca and other areas in Peru there are legends of sky people and gods coming down from the sky.
But might the so-called star people referred to in the Nazca legends really have been extraterrestrial beings, as ancient astronaut theorists believe?
In the beginning there was just one line made by some robot or some extraterrestrial spaceship or space shuttle because they were looking for raw material for energy.
After a while the local population would see all those tracks on the ground.
And they would say, that these tracks were just left behind by these divine beings, by the gods.
And then they would wonder and "what can we do for those gods to return?"
According to ancient astronaut theory, the earliest of the Nazca Lines were made in imitation of the trails left by the first space visitors.
Later generations added more elaborate lines, and then shapes and figures, all in an attempt to signal the star gods to return.
But they never did.
And this caused the population to doubt the deities, because it was mainly a psychological problem they had with their deities that brought about the abandonment and collapse of the Nazca culture.
But could there be other evidence of alien contact with the ancient people of Peru that is even more astounding than the Nazca Lines?
Some of the skulls that we find today, because it's a very dry desert and they're well preserved, are some of the most astonishing, elongated skulls that you'll ever see.
And they look like extraterrestrials.
According to Nazca legends, the gods had elongated heads, much like the distended skulls of the controversial
Egyptian pharaoh King Tutankhamen and his sister Meretaten.
I honestly believe that the largest of the elongated skulls represent hybrid human beings dating back thousands of years, who lived here very peacefully and could very well be the ancestors of the Inca.
And that could be the reason why the Inca suddenly were these people of incredible sophistication who came from seemingly nowhere.
It's possible that they're descendants from star beings.
Were they trying to imitate people they had already seen, gods from outer space?
Is it possible the ancient Nazca altered their bodies and their lands in order to communicate with or emulate something their ancestors may have witnessed, something out of this world?
Perhaps further clues to mankind's extraterrestrial connection can be found in the most remote place on planet in the South Pacific.
The South Pacific Ocean.
2,300 miles west of South America, in one of the most remote places on Earth, giant stone figures stand with their backs to the sea.
Called moai by the native inhabitants, they are the silent sentinels of Easter Island.
The moais are scattered throughout the island, and they're positioned on top of platforms, for the most part.
A moai is a stone sculpture of a deceased ancestor
They were once living individuals who ruled the society or led the society.
They were chiefs.
And then, upon their death, we believe that they've become represented in stone.
Nearly 900 moai were carved between the 12th and 18th centuries.
Hewn with stone tools from volcanic rock, the tallest stands a towering 33 feet high and weighs a staggering 75 tons.
They were even more unique-looking in the past.
They may have been painted.
And they also had large white coral eyes with obsidian pupils.
So it's a very effective way of kind of telling people, not verbally but symbolically, that someone's watching you and you should toe the line.
You should do what you're supposed to do.
The people who created the moai called themselves the Rapa Nui, and mainstream historians believe their Polynesian ancestors came to the island in canoes from across the vast
Pacific Ocean between 700 and 1100 AD.
But over several centuries, for reasons that are still unclear, what was once an island paradise withered into a treeless desert, stalked by famine, violence and some say cannibalism.
When the first europeans arrived in 1722, the Rapa Nui culture had already been nearly wiped out... and few could imagine how such primitive people could have created the moai.
How in the heck did they make these?
Where did they come from?
And how did they move them?
Nobody has the answer.
Modern scientists have tried, and so far have failed to duplicate the feats of the ancient Rapa Nui.
In 1987, anthropologist Charles Love used rollers to move a nine-ton moai replica at Western Wyoming Community College.
Ready?
On three.
One, two, three.
Come on, Rick.
- Come on.
- Get it
Good.
Thank you.
Whoa.
Only able to budge it about half an inch.
Other researchers have tried pulling moai with sleds.
But there is a unique problem with the idea of moving moai with sleds or rollers.
When you go to Easter Island, you don't get the impression they had enough wood to have rollers.
And in fact, in the 1700s, the first four expeditions to Easter
Island never really saw a tree.
And so that's the real mystery of Easter Island how can you move a multi-ton statue if you have no trees for rollers?
According to the oral history of the Rapa Nui, the moai were moved in a very unusual way.
They all reply basically the same thing.
The moai walked to the ahu, and that's the only explanation that they give.
But who or what had the power to make multi-ton moai appear to walk to their ahu, or stone platforms?
In 1919, British archaeologist Katherine Routledge, who lived on Easter Island for a year, recorded the legends and testimony of an old woman who said the moai were moved with a mystical energy called mana.
And according to the oral histories of the Rapa Nui, mana came from the gods.
Mana was a direct gift of the gods given to the Easter islanders
Was this mana really a type of magical force?
Of course not.
It was some type of misunderstood technology, some type of a device, an extraterrestrial tool with which you could move those massive Easter Island heads rather easily.
Did early inhabitants of Easter Island really know how to unlock the secrets of gravity using mana?
And if so, where might such power over the physical world have come from?
Researchers believe there are clues hidden within mysterious written texts called rongorongo, inscribed on pieces of wood, discovered on the island in the 19th century.
This is a rongorongo board.
And it's a replica of ones of old.
About 25 of them are known.
We have had about six or eight different attempts at translating these things, with six or eight different results.
You have to ask yourself, how could the Easter islanders have invented their own writing without some other cultural influence coming there.
Would it have been ancient seafarers coming to Easter Island or perhaps even space visitors?
Further evidence of early contact with otherworldly beings can be found in numerous strange stone carvings-- called petroglyphs.
What we see in the petroglyph art of the island are these figures of bird men, these tangata manus, carved in bas relief on the rocks on the very edge of the precipice.
In the myths of Easter Island's Rapa Nui, the bird man represents Makemake, the chief god and creator of humanity.
Did at some point in the past a creature come, which was Bird man who flew in from somewhere?
Did he arrive on this island and did he indeed live very much like a pariah?
Did he die or did he take off again, and is this what the locals keep this legend of this creature who came to them alive through myth, legend and ritual.
Walking stone giants, petroglyphs of flying beings--- might the ancient inhabitants of Easter Island have been familiar with antigravity levitation and spaceflight?
If so, might these astounding abilities-- forever lost to time, have been made possible by extraterrestrial visitors?
Perhaps more evidence can be found in the most famous and alluring of all lost worlds-- the Garden of Eden.
The Middle East
For centuries, archaeologists, theologians and scholars have debated the location-- and even the existence of the ultimate of all lost worlds-- the biblical "Garden of Eden."
It was here, according to the Hebrew Book of Genesis, that a paradise once existed-- a paradise where the first human beings, Adam and Eve, were actually created by God.
But could such a paradise, now shrouded in myth and legend, have actually been a real place?
When we're looking at the Garden of Eden we know there is actually a physical description as to where it was.
It is set at four very specific rivers, came from it, over near it
So we can actually go in search of this.
Two of these rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers, are well known and actually run through what is Irak today.
The other two rivers that are described are not very clear.
Researchers now believe the third river, known as the Karun River, runs through Iran and joins the Euphrates just north of the Persian Gulf.
Then, in 2010, satellite imagery revealed a fossil river, or dry riverbed, called the Wadi Baton, that once flowed through northern Arabia and also joined with the Euphrates.
Could these two rivers have been the location of the Pishon and Gihon rivers-- the lost rivers mentioned in the Bible-- that point to the actual location of the Garden of Eden?
When you read the account in the Genesis it says that the four rivers form one river
So very careful reading indicates that the two rivers which are today in Irak, Tigris and Euphrates, and the one which is in Iran, the Karun and a false river, in Arabia, and then when you join them up
to form one river that is the approximate location of northern Persian Gulf.
And according to the Bible, that one river flowed through the Garden of Eden.
And so, based upon Landsat images and a close reading of the Hebrew text, I think that the location of the
Garden of Eden is under the waters of the Persian Gulf and not on land.
Scientists believe that during the last ice age, the polar ice caps were two miles high and ocean levels were
170 feet lower than they are today.
Recent studies suggest the area of the Persian Gulf would have been a dry, fertile plain the size of Great Britain, providing an ideal refuge to some of the earliest humans outside Africa nearly 75,000 years ago.
But as the ice caps melted over the course of thousands of years, the waters of what is now the Indian Ocean flooded the land and formed the Persian Gulf.
During that long period, there were at least three episodes of very very major flooding.
When you would be looking at 30 or 40 ft rises in sea level virtually over night.
Might a great flood-- perhaps the one described in the biblical story of Noah's Ark, really be responsible for the disappearance of the so-called "Garden of Eden"?
Ancient astronaut theorists believe it is not only possible, but that the proof can be found by studying ancient Sumerian texts.
The earliest known civilization of Sumer dates to 5,000 BC, and their first settlement in southern Mesopotamia was called Eridu.
The ancient Sumerians have a wonderful story.
They believe that they had lived in an area that was probably to the south of what is today Sumer.
And the reason we know that is because they said they came out of the sea.
Ancient cuneiform writings that have survived on clay tablets suggest the Sumerians had been brought to
Eridu by their god Enki.
The cuneiform texts also describe an alien race named the Anunnaki who came to Earth and created the first modern human beings.
Adam in sumerian or a very early form of
Sumerian, means "a small rural settlement."
"Eve," however, isn't Sumerian.
"Eve" in Arabic and the Semitic languages means "one who gives birth."
The word "Eden" is a pre-Sumerian word and it means "plain."
But, according to ancient astronaut theory, the
Sumerian accounts may actually refer to a more ancient time, and to a distant fertile plain now lost under the waters of the Persian Gulf.
Now the question is this, was the Garden of Eden really some kind of laboratory where certain things were created by the ancient scientists of their day?
Well, if mankind was created in a Garden of Eden, then clearly whoever was creating this wasn't a human being, it was somebody else.
So is it possible that the Garden of Eden was located here on planet Earth?
Yes, but was it a specific geographic location?
I'm not sure.
Personally, I'm leaning more towards the idea that the Garden of Eden was some type of a closed environment somewhere in nature, but it definitely was some type of a laboratory from where modern man originated.
Is it really possible that the first humans were created by extraterrestrial beings in what is referred to in the Bible as a "Garden of Eden"?
If so, has the evidence existed all along, on the cuneiform tablets of the ancient Sumerians?
Ancient astronaut theorists believe the answer is a definite yes.
And there are those who believe that such an incredible notion is not only possible, but that the proof lies in the further investigation of lost civilizations and ancient worlds-- an investigation that will not only uncover our past,
but reveal our future.

No, no, no, no.
This is wrong.
What are you taking pictures of my dad for?
Calm down, sir.
We mean no disrespect.
Army or Navy?
I'm a Lance Corporal, United States Marines.
Great. 'Cause if you interfere, we'll call the M.P.s at Camp Pendleton, and you'll become their problem.
So, should I proceed with the liver-temping exam?
Well, if you can do it before they start the wake, yes.
Man:
Is everything all right?
No visible head trauma.
But I see petechiae.
And ligature on the neck.
So, strangulation of some sort.
I'd call that unnatural.
91.
That puts time of death about two, three hours ago.
Um, Gabriel, come with me.
Um, you the wife?
Yes.
Yeah, well, I need to talk to you right now.
This is no way to treat people in mourning.
- Well, I don't know about that, lady.
- Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Mrs. Wycoff, you have the L.A.P.D.'s deepest sympathies in this very difficult time.
Perhaps there's someplace we could talk in private?
Yes.
Lieutenant, she may not realize she did something wrong.
She may also have just strangled her husband.
She's a preacher's wife.
You have to approach her a certain way.
And you would know how to do that better than I would because?
Because when I was a kid, I went to church four times a week.
Four times a week?
Twice on Sunday, prayer meetings on Wednesday, choir practice on Friday.
All right.
All right.
You win.
But hurry up.
I'm not waiting here till Jesus comes back.
[ Clears throat ]
Mrs. Wycoff...
I know you're taking care of many people right now, and we will be sensitive to your spiritual obligation, but I also need you to be sensitive to your legal situation.
And it would help us out greatly if you could just tell us what happened to your husband today.
[ Sighs ]
Clifford was, um, battling depression.
His faith was strong, but it...
Sometimes it's hard to know what God wants.
[ Voice breaking ] God didn't want this.
My husband hung himself in the garage at our house.
I am so very sorry.
I know how hard that must have been to say.
But, um...
Can you tell me why you didn't contact the authorities?
I should have, I know, but I didn't want anyone in the church to know.
Okay.
We can certify your husband's death.
But I need written consent to search your home and your garage.
- Okay?
- Thank you.
[ Sobs ]
Here.
Let yourselves in.
I'm taking the family to church if you need me.
Of course.
Thank you.
[ Engine turns over ]
Thank you.
I just came up with the pastor's most recent credit-card charge.
Uh, this guy didn't die at home, Lieutenant.
Starlight Motor Lodge.
He checked in at 10:00 a.m. this morning, and he still hasn't checked out.
Yeah, well, that depends on your point of view.
Also, someone made a call from the minister's room at the Starlight around 11:02 a.m., which would be just before the time of death.
Well, find out who that call went to, Mike.
Mm.
Yeah, Chief?
Um, we've got a situation.
Manager said the victim was a regular, Chief.
Held the room with a credit card and then paid with cash when he left.
Oh, the old cheater's trick.
So I hear.
Maybe he just needed a quiet place to reflect.
By the hour?
Man:
Get it all.
Make sure it gets all clean.
Hey, guys, hold up.
Hold up.
Shh.
Woman:
What did you say?
Make sure it gets all cleaned up.
[ Aerosol can spraying ] Stay back, Buzz.
I said make sure you empty the trash.
Sir, L.A.P.D.!
[ Glass shatters ]
Drop it.
Drop the weapon.
- Drop the weapon!
- Dear God!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Provenza:
What the hell?
!
Don't shoot!
We were just cleaning up.
Ma'am, put the spray cleaner down and step away from the sink.
- It's a hot-glue gun, Chief.
- A glue gun?
I just fixed that lamp, and now look at it.
Well, we have a pair of men's pants here, a, uh, shirt, belt.
Aha.
And what have we here?
Now, who does this belong to?
Y'all wouldn't happen to know a Pastor Cliff Wycoff, would you?
He was our son-in-law.
I'm going to let you in a little secret only my wife knows....
Your pastor's not perfect.
[ Laughter, applause ]
Jesus knows that I'm a sinner!
He loves me in spite of the fact that I'm human!
Pause it, Buzz.
What kind of a woman asks her parents to clean up the motel room where her husband was having sex?
[ Cellphone rings ] Tao.
Looks like the pastor's lady friend left in a hurry.
Anything from the motel security cameras?
Strictly decoration, Chief.
Somebody for sure called his wife's cellphone from the motel room.
Chief, Flynn and Gabriel picked up Mrs. Wycoff and her family at their church -- [ knock on door ] Chief Johnson?
They're on their way back here, but, uh, there's a bit of an issue.
Okay.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I want to know the moment that the rest of the Wycoff family arrives, please.
Thank you.
So, why were you talking to Peter Goldman this morning?
Uh, Goldman pretended to be a process server, and he threw subpoenas all around the murder room, and I ordered him out.
I wasn't talking to him.
Because I understand he was trying to offer you a deal.
How do you know that?
Ugh!
Commander Taylor!
When, when, when are you going to get him out of my murder room?
I can't bear it.
Look, Will, I don't -- I don't even remember what Goldman was talking about.
Well, allow me to refresh your memory.
He was asking who was with you in the car when you dropped off Turell Baylor at his house.
Now, why would he be asking that?
Was something said in that car that could get us in even more trouble?
No.
Goldman served everyone a subpoena, except for Gabriel, to turn us against each other and make us all paranoid.
Gabriel didn't get served?
You think he's already talked to Goldman?
Paranoia part seems to be working.
Look, Will, this is all about me.
Not all about you.
I got subpoenaed, too, and I'm in this now up to my neck.
As is the city, the department, your entire division.
You know what?
The next time Goldman comes into your murder room, will you just go into your office and lock the door and call the city attorney?
Which is what you should have done this morning.
Or, better yet, find yourself a personal attorney.
Maybe he can make you understand how serious this has become.
Because nobody else is getting through to you.
[ Knock on door ] Come in.
David Gabriel.
Chief.
Uh, Chief Johnson,
I have the rest of the Wycoff family waiting for you.
Thank you, David.
[ Door closes ]
Chief, I know everyone thinks it's weird that I didn't get served, but I just want you to know I would never --
David, let's stop worrying about gossip and start concentrating on this case.
What were the Wycoffs doing when you found them?
Uh, yeah, well, when we finally caught up with them at the church, they were driving their minivan around the parking lot, running over computers.
So, this is what's left of the church's entire I.T. division.
This is what's left of my desk.
There's probably a record in there of our victim's little love connection.
Well, this looks like an organized hit.
But who did the organizing?
I'm ready to throw them all in jail.
I wish it were that easy.
What -- how did you get back in this building?
Oh, I never left.
And I'm sorry to disturb your...investigation here.
Just, uh, wanted to drop back by, see if you'd had a chance to think over my little proposal.
I have.
I propose you stand still, let Lieutenant Tao take your picture, and tell security to arrest you if you ever come back in this building again.
Get -- all right.
Okay.
Just...call me if you change your mind on the deal.
Detective Gabriel...
Looking sharp.
I-I-I have never, ever met that man in my life before today!
Well, he sure as hell knows you.
Hey, hey!
That's enough.
Now, we all know David.
We've worked with him for years.
He's a good guy.
He's a great cop.
And he's as loyal as they come.
- Or else he's a snitch.
- Man, what --
At any rate, he's the only one of us who hasn't been subpoenaed, so he must have done something right.
Thank you, Lieutenant Provenza, for that morale booster.
Meanwhile, I'd like to talk to Mrs. Wycoff.
Detective Gabriel?
Let's start with how you knew where to find your husband's body.
He, um...
He called me from that horrible motel to say goodbye.
The number showed up on my cellphone he told you he was going to kill himself?
I begged him not to, but he wouldn't listen to me.
Uh, after he hung up the phone,
I-I rushed over to find him, but...
It was too late.
He was hanging by his belt [voice breaking] From the sprinkler pipe.
He felt he'd let me down, his church down.
He let God down.
Well, you certainly let me down, Mrs. Wycoff, 'cause I allowed you to spend some quiet time with your family, and you used that time to destroy all your husband's computers from the church.
I did that, yes.
It was only to protect the members of our congregation.
Protect them from what?
Our members trusted my husband with their secrets.
The law doesn't recognize the confidentiality of Protestant ministers.
God does.
We may not have legal rights, but we have spiritual ones.
Those rights do not include having your parents sterilize the motel room where your husband died.
Here are a few things that they couldn't sweep under the rug.
Any idea how these came to be there?
I assume he was with another woman.
Someone he knew?
Or a prostitute, maybe?
Please, I'm begging you -- do not sensationalize my husband's suicide.
I'm not sensationalizing anything, Mrs. Wycoff.
But I absolutely need to find this woman who was with your husband at that motel room.
She ran away without her shoes and her underwear, and that worries me.
I don't even know if she's still alive.
Or should I be checking with another funeral home somewhere?
I wouldn't know.
It's in God's hands...
Not mine.
Provenza:
Boy, oh, boy!
They're all singing from the same hymnal.
Anybody say anything about the girlfriend?
Nobody knows nothing about nothing but suicide.
[ Sighs ] Mrs. Wycoff's orchestrated this whole thing.
She's practically daring me to arrest her.
You know what?
I say let her go.
Why?
So she can destroy more evidence?
No.
She doesn't think we're questioning her.
She thinks we're questioning her faith and her beliefs.
That's only gonna make her stonewall.
But if we back off, who knows?
Maybe she'll try to contact the other woman on her own or lead us to her body.
It's either that, or we try those red shoes on all the fair ladies of the land.
[ Door opens ]
Excuse me, Chief.
Dr. Morales is ready for you.
Okay.
Thank you.
Uh, Lieutenant, I want 24-hour surveillance on every member of that family.
Can you arrange it, please?
Oh, love to.
Thank you.
Oh, and, uh, Detective Gabriel, I need you with me, please.
So, sir, did she say anything to you about what Goldman's proposal was?
No.
But whatever that asshole suggested, she's not letting Gabriel out of her sight.
In my opinion, the ligature wounds are consistent with the belt found at the scene.
So he did hang himself.
Only if he was somehow able to desperately scratch at his throat for air, severely bruise his knee, and, finally, sprain his ankle in the process.
That swelling had to happen before the guy died.
So you're saying there was a struggle.
I'm saying that, at some point, the victim found himself flailing on the floor.
So, what, the belt was being pulled one way...
And our victim was trying to pull it another, yes.
Doctor, what are these?
Oh, yes.
At first I thought those were broken blood vessels, but when I swabbed them, it appeared to be some kind of red dye.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.
Well, looks like we found Cinderella.
Yeah, but who turned him into a pumpkin?
Are you going to work?
Mm.
That was Detective Gabriel.
He's following the widow Wycoff to church this morning.
[ Yawning ] At 6:00 a.m.?
That's where she and her family go -- home and church, church and home.
That woman -- she honestly thinks she's somehow above the law, that the justice system just doesn't apply to her.
Speaking of which, did you ever contact that attorney Captain Raydor suggested to you?
No.
Kitty!
I mean Joel, Joel, Joel, Joel, off the table.
I really think you need an attorney.
Can't think about that right now.
I need to find someone who was with a minister who liked to wear women's underwear.
Oh.
Victoria isn't the only one with a secret.
How do you even know this minister was with anyone?
Someone killed him...
In a seedy motel room.
His wife -- his wife knows exactly who he was with, and she won't tell me.
She's more worried we'll find out her husband was a transvestite than she is about finding his killer.
People are weird.
She even had her parents scrub down the crime scene with bleach.
I mean, who does that?
!
Oh, my gosh!
They weren't just trying to wipe away fingerprints.
They were trying to wash away the sin.
That's it, isn't it?
They were shamed.
Just wait till I ask the widow Wycoff to help me find the person who was wearing that shoe.
Thought you already knew it was the pastor's.
Yeah, but she doesn't know I know that!
Watching me hunt for whose foot fits the ruby-red slipper might just make her realize she's not in Kansas anymore.
I love these heart-to-hearts we have in the morning.
Me too, honey.
Me too.
George:
When I stepped down from the pulpit of this church and passed it on to my son-in-law,
I never imagined the pain of a day like today.
God uses suffering to test us.
Even in a death from despair, God offers us choices, asking if our faith is stronger than one leader, questioning whether this church is about one man or one God.
So, when you all are reaching out to our congregation, resist the temptation to sow gossip...
You have no right interrupting a confidential meeting of our stewardship committee.
I've thought of another way to find out who was with your husband when he died.
- Does this look familiar?
- What are you doing?
Put that away.
This shoe probably belongs to the woman with whom he was sleeping.
Chances are, she either witnessed or caused his death.
My husband committed suicide.
Pastor Wycoff's death is undetermined, and while it remains that way, I intend to try this shoe on every female in your congregation, ages 18 to 65, starting with the people on your stewardship committee.
You wouldn't dare.
No!
Please, please.
Mom, what's she saying?
Please do not go into this church terrorizing everybody.
What makes you think
I could possibly know who this woman was?
You destroyed all the computers your husband used here at the church, which gives us the idea he either met a woman online or was maintaining some sort of relationship with a woman online.
All right.
Please put that away.
Yes.
My husband went on the Internet.
He went on a site where he found some woman named Sindy Showers, spelled S-I-N-D-Y.
Thank you.
We'll check that out and get back to you.
Oh, I'm sure you will.
Chief Johnson...
Do you even believe in God?
Tell you what I do believe, Mrs. Wycoff.
"Thou shalt not kill."
Ma'am, that shoe won't fit anybody at this church.
How do you know that?
When my mom found my dad, she called me, and...
When I got to the motel, he was wearing that.
And he was dressed in women's underwear and a bra, and I helped her change him into a suit.
How do you explain the ligature marks on his neck.
Come on, Chris.
We're only trying to do right by your dad.
You've heard of the...
autoerotic thing people do?
Yeah, choking yourself while you're...
Yeah.
Your father did that?
My dad was on the floor with his belt around his throat.
And my mom rolled him over, and his hand was, uh...
It was, uh...
[ Exhales sharply ]
Can you really blame her for not wanting to talk about it?
Chief, I just got off the phone with Dr. Morales.
He says the autoerotic asphyxiation thing is possible, but he wanted to know if we'd found a release mechanism at the motel.
Not sure exactly what that is.
We didn't find one.
Wait -- what didn't we find?
Typically, chief, the autoerotic guy rigs up the choking device with a quick release to prevent accidental hanging.
And Wycoff only had his belt.
Not sure how that explains the sprained ankle.
Well, it's an awful lot to be doing in heels.
Sindy Showers is in interview room number 1.
Vice tracked her down to a website called "Who's Your Mommy?"
She doesn't want a lawyer if we promise not to arrest her for solicitation and lewd conduct.
Thank you, Commander.
David, here's how to end this whole subpoena nightmare.
Just call Goldman and tell him you want to talk.
Wouldn't that make me look bad?
How could you look any worse?
Brenda:
Ms. Showers, I'm Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
I just got a few questions for you regarding your safety.
My safety?
Yes.
We're trying to find someone who might be targeting...
Workers like yourself.
Oh.
Then okay, I guess.
Do you recognize this man?
You're not serious.
If you're worried about my safety, you've got the wrong guy.
I've known him for years, see him once every month or so.
Yesterday, as a matter of fact.
Did you know he's a member of the clergy?
No.
But that explains a few things.
Like?
Like every time we finish, he tries to talk me out of ever meeting him again, and he always wants us to pray for forgiveness.
I'm used to getting on my knees, but not for that.
[ Chuckles ]
Any other, um, unusual requests?
You mean the lingerie?
Not that unusual.
I mean, you wouldn't believe what some men try to pull.
This one guy, he takes about 30 toasted almonds and lines them up --
Off topic.
Off topic.
Okay, look, Cliffy pays me $300 for the hour, plus another $100 for the underwear and another $100 for the shoes.
So Cliffy likes to wear women's clothes.
You know what?
So do I.
Big deal.
He's not dangerous.
I-I've always felt safe with him.
Even when he asks you to cut off his air supply?
When he what?
[ Clears throat ] Have you ever heard of autoerotic --
The choking thing?
Good God, no.
Not on my menu.
No blood, no bruises, no bondage.
I'm telling you, whatever this is, you got the wrong guy.
He likes to play dress-up.
It makes him happy.
Was he happy when you left him yesterday?
Why wouldn't he be?
Because, Sindy, we found Cliff in that motel room not long after you left, and he was dead.
What?
No.
Are you serious?
Now -- now you're scaring me.
That's...awful.
Dead how?
We're not sure exactly.
He may have committed suicide.
He didn't kill himself.
I can promise you that.
Cliff loved his family way too much to leave them behind.
You knew he was married?
Well, yeah.
Cliff told me that his wife wasn't into his whole dress-up thing at all.
So she let him handle it by hiring me.
So she knew all along?
Yeah.
Cliff said -- I-I think her name is Kate -- that Kate thought it was a little twisted, but as long as he didn't bring his bras and panties into the house, she could ignore it.
He -- he might have been a little different from my usual dates, but he didn't deserve to die in that motel room.
His wife hired a prostitute for her cross-dressing husband.
And not just once or twice.
Which means she also probably knew --
When it was his time of the month?
[ Clears throat ] Uh, look, Chief.
If she was aware of what was going on for a while, then why was yesterday the breaking point?
And why would he call her in despair?
Good question.
But it shows up on the motel phone records.
Pastor Wycoff called his wife.
Or did he?
- Chief?
- Yes.
Chief?
[ Clears throat ]
What are we gonna say in those depositions?
Just the truth, I guess.
The truth.
Yeah.
[ Chuckles ]
But first, shouldn't we all agree as to what that is?
I do phone trees all the time, but very seldom do we get to put together an all-out matrix.
And this is every phone call between every family member?
Land lines and cells.
Everybody's calling everybody except the oldest son.
Isn't it funny how, in every family, there's always an odd man out?
What is that supposed to mean?
It means everybody knows that you've already said your piece to Goldman, and that's why he was here.
Wait, wait.
Who's "everybody" --
Provenza, Tao, and Buzz -- or is "Everybody" just you?
Oh, yeah, it's just me.
I'm the only one that --
Gentlemen, please stop this bickering!
This ridiculous lawsuit has nothing to do with you.
It's all about me.
Detective Sanchez, Detective Gabriel,
Lieutenant Flynn, I want a pair of shiny handcuffs slapped on Mrs. Wycoff.
Make sure her family knows so that they'll follow her down here.
Lieutenant Provenza, Lieutenant Tao, let's get this murder board out of here.
- Where to, chief?
- Interview room 2.
I don't want the Wycoffs seeing it before we're ready.
Brenda:
How long have you known your husband was a cross-dresser?
Just...a few weeks.
Really?
Because Sindy with an "S" told us that he dressed up for her once a month and that it was all your idea.
This is an attempt to destroy my church.
Have a seat, sir.
You presume, because I'm a Christian, thatI somehowclaimtobe-- no, no, no.
I presume that you're not proud of helping your husband commit adultery.
Judge not lest ye be judged.
I won't be the one doing the judging, Mrs. Wycoff.
There is more to marriage than fidelity.
It's about raising children.
It's about...
Um...
I did my best.
I did my best.
I really did my best.
I'm sure you did, but we need to talk about Sindy.
She said your husband was happy when she left the motel room at 10:55, so why did he want to die at 11:02?
Cliff was disgusted with himself.
He would come home from these terrible sessions and cry for forgiveness.
He hung himself.
Why is that so hard for you to understand?
Because if he was so ashamed, why did he kill himself dressed like that for all whole world to see?
Mrs. Wycoff, the coroner says your husband's wounds are consistent with murder by strangulation.
And we know that Sindy --
I told you, he called me from the motel.
But he didn't.
You keep lying to me, and I'm going to have to tell the media that your husband died wearing pink panties, a bra, and a new pair of pumps.
So, who called you from the motel?
If I tell you what happened, can you keep the prostitution and cross-dressing to yourselves?
We can try.
And will you leave my family out of it?
Because, honestly, this is all about me.
All about you?
I called my own phone to establish an alibi.
I killed him.
I snapped.
God forgive me.
I killed him.
What are you doing?
What is this?
Your daughter just confessed, sir.
- But you don't believe her!
- I certainly do.
- Oh, it's impossible.
- Kate didn't kill him.
- Let me tell you what happened.
- Daddy, be quiet.
You can't arrest her.
Actually, I intend to arrest your entire family -- the whole lying lot of you -- as accessories to murder after the fact.
So, now would be a good time to stop covering up for each other.
Detective Sanchez, read them their rights, please, starting with George here.
What are you doing?
This is crazy.
You have the right to remain silent, sir.
What did we do?
Besides obstruct justice and destroy evidence?
Let me show you.
...Will be appointed for you by the state.
Have you heard and understood these rights as they have been read to you, sir?
This is a, uh, matrix -- or a map, if you will -- of all the phone calls made around the time of your father's death.
Um, here is your mother calling from the motel to her own cellphone to make it look like she wasn't there -- very clever.
About 45 minutes later, she called your grandparents, who, in turn, called your little sister and brother to pick up your father's clothes from home, I assume.
And here's the call informing you that your father had --
wait a minute.
Lieutenant Tao, this is Chris Wycoff over here, and yet looks like no one called him.
- Could that be right?
- Yes, chief.
And yet you were at the motel.
How'd you even know your father was dead?
Skywriting?
I was pulling duty on base when I got the call.
No, you weren't.
We checked with your commander.
You asked for yesterday off two weeks ago.
Which makes this look a lot like premeditation.
Wait.
I'll tell you why I didn't get the call.
Ma'am, can we talk privately?
Lieutenant.
A couple weeks ago, my dad asked me to look at his computer at church.
He was having trouble with the wi-fi.
And I found a hidden e-mail account where this woman -- this prostitute -- was writing to him about their next meeting.
I had trouble believing it, so I followed him.
I wanted to confront him.
So, you watched him check into the motel, and you saw the prostitute come and go?
Exactly, and after she left,
I opened the door, and my dad was lying dead on the floor from the autoerotic --
No, no, no, no, no.
There was no autoerotic anything.
Well, it sure as heck looked like it.
I don't know.
M-maybe the prostitute killed him.
I d-
- I don't know.
He was paying her $500 an hour.
Why would she kill him?
Look, your mother just confessed to this murder.
I could take her word for it, Corporal.
Is that what you want?
Let your brother and sister grow up without both parents?
Maybe they'd be better off.
Your father led a double life, but your mom's the one who made it possible.
Lying.
Covering up for him.
Maybe she deserves to go to prison.
Hmm?
Is that what you're thinking?
In our house, we were taught,
"Honor thy father and thy mother."
If you so much as breathed wrong, you got the belt.
Did you ever breathe wrong?
When I was 15, my -- my dad, the man who taught me right from wrong, the guy who liked to wear women's lingerie...
He found a note from this boy that I knew in choir --
Jeff.
The two of us were, uh...
Jeff and I were close.
We were close.
And I saved that note in my room at the very back of my desk drawer.
It was none of my dad's business...
That note.
But he found it.
And he went crazy.
Went crazy how?
First he beat me.
The he shipped me off to military school.
And when I came home for Christmas,
I-I found out that my dad had brought that note over to Jeff's house and showed it to his parents and that...
My friend...
He'd killed himself.
Oh, and guess who preached at Jeff's funeral.
So when my dad opened that door yesterday, looking like some kind of freak...
And he started saying that it was only this once and that -- that we should just pray about it, and at least he wasn't gay.
You saw his belt.
Is that it?
You grabbed his belt?
Yeah, I grabbed his belt.
And what did you do?
It's time to do the honorable thing, Corporal.
I put it around his neck, and I yanked him all over the room.
And then?
Ma'am, I spent five years in Afghanistan.
I know when someone's dead.
[ Sniffles ]
I killed him.
And then I called my mother.
And I left him in his little outfit, thinking, "Well...
Now she'll finally see the truth."
But she already knew.
And I realized, while she was fussing with him, you know, taking off his bra, asking me to help knot his tie, that she had never once in all of my life stood up for anyone but him.
And for a moment there -- for a really bad moment --
I thought about killing her, too.
[ Sniffles ]
Ma'am...
I'm sorry to have lied to you about everything.
It was not the honorable thing to do, and I wish to apologize for having caused everyone so much trouble.
Well...
I don't deal much in forgiveness, Corporal.
But I sure am sorry to have to arrest you for murder in the first degree.
Hey, everyone.
Good to see you again.
I have to congratulate you guys on being a pretty tight little unit.
Detective David Gabriel...
You have been served.
Happy now?
It's what you asked for.
Ecstatic.
Thank you.
Now you know what it's like to be singled out by your own gang.
But seriously, don't thank me.
Thank Chief Johnson.
She's the one who put you all in the spotlight.
You asked to be subpoenaed?
It's only fair, right?
So, come on.
Give it up.
Show me some love.
I'm subpoenaed, too.
Welcome to the club.
Provenza:
No rats.
No rats here.
No rats.
Oh, thank you, Lieutenant.
I could have told you that, though.
Here we go!
Here we go!
[ Door opens ]
Hey.
You're home early.
Rough day?
Sort of.
Baylors' attorney came back and subpoenaed Detective Gabriel, so that officially puts my entire division in hot water.
Ah.
Over a decision made by me and me alone.
What I'm wondering about now is, how much worse are things going to get?
I mean...
Really, how much worse?
A little worse, maybe.
What?
You too?
Why?
I volunteered to provide protective custody for his mom and sister. remember?
I'm -
- I'm so sorry.
Why?
Look, what did you do, really...
Except your job?
I-I-I drove Turell home, and I dropped him off.
And that's it.
That's it.
That's all.
I mean, there was no decision at all, really.
I don't know why we're being treated like this.
[ Gasps ]
Oh, shoot, now look what I've done.
It's okay.
I got it.
Just a spill, hon.
What have I done?
[ Crying ]
There's no permanent damage.
I'll wipe it up.
Okay.
It's okay.
What have I done?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Shh.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What have I done?
What have I done?
[ Crying ]
What have I done?
What have I done?
What have I done?
What have I done?

[PHONE RINGS]
Major Crimes.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
- Hey, chief.
- Yes?
Dr. Morales says there's a dead guy at a funeral home.
- Very funny.
SANCHEZ:
Seriously.
There's a body at Weaver Funeral Home without a death certificate.
Ask Dr. Morales to send a coroner's investigator.
He did, but the dead guy's family doesn't want him to examine the body.
- Who do you think should handle it?
MAN:
Detective Julio Sanchez?
- You have been served.
- What?
Again?
PROVE NZA:
Well, it's probably nothing.
Not counting my five divorces, I've been sued 17 times.
- Lieutenant Louie M. Provenza.
- Eighteen.
GOLDMAN:
Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
- You've been served.
- What's going on?
- Lieutenant Michael Tao.
- Getting wallpapered.
GOLDMAN:
Francis B. Watson.
- What?
Why me?
Why "Francis"?
That's the real question.
- Lieutenant Andrew Flynn.
- Yeah, yeah.
"A wrongful-death civil suit filed on behalf of Turell Baylor."
We didn't kill the guy.
He was beaten to death right after we dropped him off.
Turell murdered an old man and his 8-year-old grandson.
- Who cares what happened to him?
- Commander Russell Taylor.
You have been served.
Okay, that's it.
- Wait, whoa, whoa.
What about me?
- Sorry, that's all I got.
You talk to the Baylors' attorney already?
What did you say?
Are you kidding?
Are you serious?
Gabriel, it's Flynn.
He's paranoid for a living.
Of course I'm paranoid.
Raydor's been grilling us for weeks.
We're not allowed to discuss this case.
What I can tell you is that they're only really Interested In me.
Funny way to show it.
Hey.
Hey, buddy, what are you still doing here?
Oh, I'm serving subpoenas today... and I'm also the attorney representing the mother of Turell Baylor...
- What?
- ...
In her suit against the city, L.A.P.D... and almost everyone in this room.
My name is Peter Goldman, and It's a great pleasure meeting you all.
Now that I have your squad on record saying Turell Baylor deserved to die...
I was wondering if I could ask your detectives follow-up questions...
No.
They're on their way to a crime scene of a very serious murder... at Weaver Funeral Home.
- Lieutenant.
- Right.
Right.
Let's go.
Hurry up.
Get out of here.
Clear out.
- If you could spare me just a moment...
- Goodbye.
I can't help you.
Goodbye.
I am an officer of the court, sworn to uphold the law...
I and just like you, I am only trying to get to the truth.
And a $20 million settlement.
When suspects die without due process, people lose confidence In the justice...
Goodbye, Mr. Goldman.
There were two other cops in the car when you drove Turell Baylor home.
Give me their names and I won't depose your whole squad.
I've already heard some of your people were unhappy... with the way you treated Turell.
Nice try, Mr. Goldman.
But there's nothing you could say that would make me suspect my officers.
Just a friendly heads-up.
"Goodbye" didn't work.
Let's try "get out."
- Now.
- Come on.
Come on.
Let me walk you back to the elevator.
GOLDMAN:
It's all right.
I know my way around.
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Walk.
- All right, I'm walking.
- Walk.
I'm walking.
Excuse me.
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm Terry Weaver.
Are you gentlemen all from the police?
Lieutenant Provenza, Major Crimes.
Major Crimes?
Oh, my gosh.
Listen, I'm the funeral director here, an d...
Six of you?
Six?
Oh, my gosh.
What...?
There's been a miscommunication.
Did someone carry a body in here without a death certificate?
Okay, listen.
Cliff Wycoff, he's a minister.
Pastor Wycoff died of natural causes In his home... .and his family brought him to the funeral home.
- Have you examined the body?
- Oh, no.
I would never do that before the death was certified.
That's why I called the coroner.
But we don't need the police.
- Mr. Weaver, what are you doing?
- Is the body In there?
Front of the chapel, yes.
[MUMBLES]
PROVENZA:
All right, L.A.P.D. Everybody back.
Step back.
Why does he have a camera7 No, no, no.
This is wrong.
- Why are you taking pictures of my dad?
- We mean no disrespect.
- Army or Navy?
- Lance corporal, United States Marines.
Great, because if you interfere... we'll call the MPs at Camp Pendleton, and you'II become their problem.
So should I proceed with the liver temp and exam?
Well, if you can do it before they start the wake, yes.
TERRY:
Is everything all right?
No visible head trauma.
Let's see.
But I see petechiae.
- Ligature on the neck.
- Strangulation of some sort.
I'd call that unnatural.
Ninety-one.
That puts time of death about two or three hours ago.
Urn, Gabriel, come with me.
- Urn...
You the wife?
- Yes.
I need to talk to you.
This is no way to treat people In mourning.
- I don't know about that-
- Excuse me, lieutenant.
You have the I.A. P. D.'s deepest sympathies in this very difficult time.
Perhaps there's someplace we could talk?
Yes.
Lieutenant, she may not realize she did something wrong.
She may also have just strangled her husband.
She's a preacher's wife.
You approach her a certain way.
You would know how to do that .better than I would because?
When I was a kid, I went to church four times a week.
Four times a week?
Twice on Sunday, prayer meetings I on Wednesday, choir on Friday.
All right, you win, but hurry up.
I'm not waiting here till Jesus comes back.
[MUMBLES]
Mrs. Wycoff, I know you're taking care of many people right now... and we will be sensitive to your spiritual obligations.
But I also need you to be sensitive to your legal situation.
It would help us out greatly... if you could just tell us what happened to your husband today.
Clifford was battling depression.
His faith was strong, but it...
Sometimes it's hard to know what God wants.
God didn't want this.
My husband hung himself In the garage of our house.
I am so very sorry.
I know how hard that must have been to say.
But can you tell me why you didn't contact the authorities?
I should have, I know, but I didn't want anyone In the church to know.
GABRIEL:
I
We can certify your husband's death... .but I need written consent to search your home and your garage, okay?
Thank you.
Here, let yourselves in.
I'm taking the family to church If you need me.
Of course.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Don't let anybody in.
I just came up with the pastor's most recent credit-card charge.
- This guy didn't die at home, lieutenant.
- Starlight Motor Lodge.
He checked in at 10 a.m. this morning, and he still hasn't checked out.
Yeah, that depends on your point of view.
Someone made a call from the minister's room... at the Starlight around 11:02 am., just before the time of death.
Well, find out who that call went to, Mike.
Yeah, chief?
Urn...
We've got a situation.
Manager said the victim was a regular.
Held the room with a credit card, then paid with cash when he left.
Oh, the old cheater's trick.
So I hear.
Maybe he just needed a quiet place to reflect.
- By the hour?
MAN:
Get It all.
Make sure it gets cleaned up.
- Hey, guys, hold up, hold up.
Shh.
WOMAN:
What did you say?
1AN:
Make sure it gets all cleaned up.
- Stay back, Buzz.
MAN:
I said, make sure you empty the trash.
- Sir, L.A.P.D. Drop it.
- Drop the weapon.
- Drop the weapon!
- Dear God, don't shoot!
- What the hell?
- Don't shoot!
Oh, we were just cleaning up.
Ma'am, put the spray cleaner down and step away from the sink.
- It's a hot glue gun, chief.
- A glue gun?
I just fixed that lamp, and now look at it.
Well, we have a pair of men's pants here, a shirt, a belt.
Aha.
And what have we here?
Now, who does this belong to?
Y'all wouldn't happen to know a Pastor Cliff Wycoff, would you?
He was our son-in-law.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret only my wife knows.
Your pastor's not perfect.
[CROWD LAUGHS OVER TV]
Jesus knows that I'm a sinner.
He loves me in spite of the fact that I'm human.
CROWD:
Yeah!
- Pause It, Buzz.
What kind of a woman asks her parents to clean up the room... where her husband was having sex?
TAO:
Tao.
Looks like the pastor's lady friend left In a hurry.
Anything from the motel security cameras?
Strictly decoration, chief.
Somebody called his wife's phone from the motel room.
Flynn and Gabriel picked up Mrs. Wycoff and her family at their church...
Chief Johnson.
They're on their way back here, .but there's a bit of an issue.
Okay.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I wanna know the moment that the rest of the Wycoff family arrives, please.
Thank you.
So why were you talking to Peter Goldman this morning?
Goldman pretended to be a process server... and he threw subpoenas all around the Murder Room, and I ordered him out.
- He was trying to offer you a deal.
- How do you know that?
Oh, Commander Taylor.
When, when, when are you going to get him out of my Murder Room?
I can't bear it.
Will, I don't even remember what Goldman was talking about.
Well, allow me to refresh your memory.
He was asking who was with you when you dropped off Turell Baylor.
Now, why would he be asking that?
Was something said in that car that could get us In trouble?
No.
Goldman served everyone a subpoena except for Gabriel... .to turn us against each other, make us paranoid.
Gabriel didn't get served?
You think he's already talked to Goldman?
The paranoia part seems to be working.
Look, Will, this is all about me.
Not all about you.
I got subpoenaed too, and I'm in this now up to my neck.
As is the city, the department, your entire division.
The next time Goldman comes Into your Murder Room... .will you go into your office and lock the door?
And call the city attorney, which is what you should've done.
Or better yet, find yourself a personal attorney.
Maybe he can make you understand how serious this is.
Because nobody else is getting through to you.
Come In.
- David Gabriel.
- Chief.
Uh, I have the rest of the Wycoff family waiting for you.
Thank you, David.
Everyone thinks it's weird that I didn't get served.
I
David, stop worrying about gossip and start concentrating on this case.
What were the Wycoffs doing when you found them?
When we finally caught up with them at the church... they were driving their minivan around the parking lot, running over computers.
So this is what's left of the church's entire IT Division.
This is what's left of my desk.
There's probably a record in there of our victim's love connection.
Looks like an organized hit.
.Who did the organizing?
- I'm ready to throw them all in jail.
GOLDMAN:
I wish It were that easy.
- How did you get back in this building?
- Oh, I never left.
And I'm sorry to disturb your investigation here.
Just wanted to drop by, see if you'd had a chance to think over my proposal.
I have.
I propose you stand still, let Lieutenant Tao take your picture... and tell Security to arrest you If you come back again.
- Okay, I'm going, I'm going.
- Get.
All right, okay.
Just call me if you change your mind on the deal.
Detective Gabriel, looking sharp.
Look, I have never, ever met that man in my life before today.
- Well, he sure as hell knows you.
- Hey, that's enough.
We know David.
We've worked with him for years.
He's a good guy, he's a great cop, and he's as loyal as they come.
- Thanks.
- Or else he's a snitch.
At any rate, he's the only one of us who hasn't been subpoenaed... so he must have done something right.
Thank you, Lieutenant Provenza, for that morale booster.
Meanwhile, I'd like to talk to Mrs. Wycoff.
Detective Gabriel?
Let's start with how you knew where to find your husband's body.
He, urn...
He called me from that horrible motel to say goodbye.
The number showed up on my cell phone as the Starlight Motor Lodge.
He told you he was going to kill himself?
I begged him not to, but he wouldn't listen to me.
After he hung up the phone, I rushed over to find him... but it was too late.
He was hanging by his belt .from the sprinkler pipe.
He felt he'd let me down, his church down.
He let God down.
Well, you certainly let me down, Mrs. Wycoff.
I allowed you to spend some time with your family... and you used that time to destroy all your husband's computers.
I did that, yes.
It was only to protect the members of our congregation.
Protect them from what?
Our members trusted my husband with their secrets.
The law doesn't recognize the confidentiality of Protestant ministers.
God does.
We may not have legal rights, but we have spiritual ones.
Those rights do not include having your parents sterilize the room... where your husband died.
Here are a few things that they couldn't sweep under the rug.
Any idea how these came to be there?
- I assume he was with another woman.
- Someone he knew or a prostitute?
Please, I'm begging you... do not sensationalize my husband's suicide.
I'm not sensationalizing anything, Mrs. Wycoff.
But I absolutely need to find this woman... .who was with your husband at that motel.
She ran away without her shoes and her underwear.
That worries me.
I don't even know if she's still alive.
Or should I be checking with another funeral home somewhere?
I wouldn't know.
It's in God's hands, not mine.
Boy, oh, boy.
They're all singing from the same hymnal.
Anybody say anything about the girlfriend?
PROVENZA:
Nobody knows nothing about nothing but suicide.
Mrs. Wycoff's orchestrated this.
She's practically daring me to arrest her.
You know what?
I say let her go.
- So she can destroy more evidence?
- She doesn't think we're questioning her.
She thinks we're questioning her faith.
That's gonna make her stonewall.
If we back off, who knows?
Maybe she'll try to contact the other woman or lead us to her body.
It's either that or we try those red shoes on all the fair ladies in the land.
Excuse me, chief.
Dr. Morales Is ready for you.
Okay.
Thank you.
I want 24-hour surveillance on every member of that family.
- Can you arrange it, please?
- Oh, love to.
Thank you.
Oh, and, Detective Gabriel, I need you with me, please.
So, sir, did she say anything to you about what Goldman's proposal was?
No, but whatever that asshole suggested... she's not letting Gabriel out of her sight.
The ligature wounds are consistent with the belt found at the scene.
So he did hang himself?
Only if he was somehow able to desperately scratch at his throat for air... severely bruise his knee, and finally, sprain his ankle In the process.
That swelling had to happen before the guy died.
So there was a struggle?
At some point, the victim found himself flailing on the floor.
So, what, the belt was being pulled one way...?
And our victim was trying to pull It another, yes.
Doctor, what are these?
MORALES:
Oh, yes.
At first, I thought those were broken blood vessels... but when I swabbed them, it appeared to be some kind of red dye.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.
Well, looks like we found Cinderella.
Yeah, but who turned him Into a pumpkin?
- Are you going to work?
BRENDA:
Mm.
That was Detective Gabriel.
He's following the widow Wycoff to church.
- At 6 a.m.?
- That's where she and her family go.
Home and church.
Church and home.
That woman.
She honestly thinks she's somehow above the law... that the justice system doesn't apply to her.
Speaking of which, did you ever contact... .that attorney Captain Raydor suggested to you?
No.
Kitty.
I mean, Joel.
Joel, Joel, Joel, off the table.
- I really think you need an attorney.
- I can't think about that right now
I need to find someone who was with a minister who wore women's underwear.
Oh.
Victoria isn't the only one with a secret.
How do you even know this minister was with anyone?
Someone killed him In a seedy motel room.
His wife knows exactly who he was with, and she won't tell me.
She's more worried we'll find out her husband was a transvestite...
I
- ...than she is about finding his killer.
- People are weird.
She had her parents scrub down the crime scene with bleach.
I mean, who does that?
Oh, my gosh.
They weren't just trying .to wipe away prints.
They were trying to wash away the sin.
That's It, isn't it?
They were ashamed.
Just wait till I ask the widow Wycoff... to help me find the person who was wearing that shoe.
- I thought you knew it was the pastor.
- Yeah, but she doesn't know I know that.
Watching me hunt for whose foot fits the ruby-red slipper... might just make her realize she's not In Kansas anymore.
- I love these heart-to-hearts we have.
- Me too, honey.
Me too.
GEORGE:
When I stepped down from the pulpit of this church...
I and passed it on to my son-in-law...
I never imagined the pain of a day like today.
God uses suffering to test us.
Even in a death from despair, God offers us choices... .asking if our faith is stronger than one leader... .questioning whether this church Is about one man or one God.
So when you all are reaching out to our congregation... resist the temptation to sow gossip.
You have no right interrupting a meeting of our stewardship committee.
I've thought of a way to find out who was with your husband when he died.
- Does this look familiar?
- Put that away.
This belongs to the woman with whom he was sleeping.
Chances are, she witnessed or caused his death.
- My husband committed suicide.
- Pastor Wycoff's death Is undetermined.
While it remains that way, I intend to try this shoe on every female... in your congregation ages 18 to 65, starting with your committee.
You wouldn't dare.
- No, please, please.
- Mom, what's she saying?
Please, do not go into this church terrorizing everybody.
What makes you think I could know who this woman was?
You destroyed the computers your husband used... which gives us the idea he either met a woman online... or was maintaining some sort of relationship with a woman online.
All right.
Please put that away.
Yes.
My husband went on the Internet.
He went on a site where he found some woman named Sindy Showers.
Spelled S-l-N-D-Y.
Thank you.
I'll check that out and get back to you.
Oh, I'm sure you will.
Chief Johnson.
Do you even believe in God?
I'll tell you what I do believe, Mrs. Wycoff.
Thou shalt not kill.
Ma'am, that shoe won't fit anybody at this church.
How do you know that?
When my mom found my dad, she called me... .and when I got to the motel, he was wearing that.
And he was dressed In women's underwear and a bra.
And I helped her change him into his suit.
How do you explain the ligature marks on his neck?
Come on, Chris.
We're only trying to do right by your dad.
You've heard of the autoerotic thing people do?
- Yeah.
Choking yourself while you're-
- Yeah.
Your father did that?
My dad was on the floor with his belt around his throat.
And my mom rolled him over, and his hand was, uh...
It was, uh...
[SIGHS]
Can you really blame her for not wanting to talk about It?
I just got off the phone with Dr. Morales.
He says the autoerotic-asphyxiation thing Is possible... but he wanted to know if we found a release mechanism at the motel.
- I'm not sure exactly what that is.
- We didn't find one.
Wait, what didn't we find?
Typically, chief, the autoerotic guy rigs up the choking device... with a quick release to prevent accidental hanging.
But Wycoff only had his belt.
Not sure how that explains his sprained ankle.
Well, it's an awful lot to be doing In heels.
Sindy Showers is in Interview Room Number 1.
Vice tracked her down to a site .called
Who's Your Mommy?
She doesn't want a lawyer if we promise not to arrest her... for solicitation and lewd conduct.
Thank you, commander.
[COMPUTER KEYS CLACKING]
David, here's how to end this whole subpoena nightmare.
Just call Goldman and tell him you wanna talk.
- Wouldn't that make me look bad?
- How could you look any worse?
BRENDA:
Miss Showers, I'm Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
I've got a few questions regarding your safety.
- My safety?
- Yes.
We're trying to find someone who might be targeting, uh, workers like yourself.
- Oh, then okay, I guess.
- Do you recognize this man?
[PROVENZA CLEARS THROAT]
You're not serious.
If you're worried about my safety, you've got the wrong guy.
I've known him for years.
See him once every month or so.
Yesterday, as a matter of fact.
- You know he's a member of the clergy?
- No, but that explains a few things.
- Like?
- Like every time we finish... he tries to talk me out of ever meeting him again... and he always wants us to pray for forgiveness.
I'm used to getting on my knees, but not for that.
[SINDY CHUCKLES]
Any other unusual requests?
SINDY:
You mean the lingerie?
Not that unusual.
I mean, you wouldn't believe what some men try to pull.
This one guy, he takes about 30 toasted almonds... and lines them up...
Off topic.
Off topic.
Okay.
Look, Cliff y pays me $300 for the hour... another hundred for the underwear, another hundred for the shoes.
So ditty likes to wear women's clothes.
You know what?
So do I. Big deal.
He's not dangerous.
I've always felt safe with him.
Even when he asks you to cut off his air supply?
- When he what?
- Ahem.
Have you ever heard of autoerotic...?
The choking thing?
Good God, no.
Not on my menu.
No blood, no bruises, no bondage.
I'm telling you, whatever this is, you got the wrong guy.
He likes to play dress-up.
It makes him happy.
Was he happy when you left him yesterday?
Why wouldn't he be?
Because, Sindy, we found Cliff in that motel room... .not long after you left, and he was dead.
What?
No.
Are you serious?
Now you're scaring me.
That's awful.
- Dead how?
- Were not sure exactly.
He may have committed suicide.
He didn't kill himself, I can promise you that.
Cliff loved his family way too much to leave them behind.
- You knew he was married?
- Well, yeah.
Cliff told me that his wife wasn't Into his whole dress-up thing at all... so she let him handle it by hiring me.
- So she knew all along?
- Yeah.
Cliff said...
I think her name is Kate.
... that Kate thought It was a little twisted... but as long as he didn't bring his bras and panties Into the house... she could ignore it.
He might have been a little different from my usual dates... but he didn't deserve to die in that motel room.
His wife hired a prostitute for her cross-dressing husband.
- And not just once or twice.
- Which means she also probably knew...
When it was his time of the month?
Ahem.
Uh, look, chief, if she was aware of what was going on for a while... .then why was yesterday the breaking point?
- And why would he call her in despair?
- Good question.
It shows up on the motel phone records.
Pastor Wycoff called his wife.
Or did he?
- Chief'?
Ahem.
Chief, what are we gonna say in those depositions?
- Just the truth, I guess.
- The truth, yeah.
But first, shouldn't we all agree as to what that is?
I do phone trees all the time... but very seldom do we get to put together an all-out matrix.
And this is every phone call between every family member?
Landlines and cells.
FLYNN:
Almost everybody's calling everybody.
Isn't it funny how in every family, there's always an odd man out?
What is that supposed to mean?
It means everybody knows that you've already said your piece to Goldman.
Who's everybody?
Provenza, Tao and Buzz, or just you?
- Oh, yeah, just me.
I'm the only one-
- Gentlemen, stop this bickering.
This ridiculous lawsuit has nothing .to do with you.
It's all about me
Sanchez, Gabriel, Lieutenant Flynn...
I want handcuffs slapped on Mrs. Wycoff.
Make sure her family knows so that they'll follow her down here.
Provenza, Tao, let's get this murder board out of here.
- Where to, chief?
BRENDA:
Interview Room 2.
I don't want the Wycoffs seeing it before we're ready.
BRENDA [OVER MONITOR]:
How long have you known... your husband was a cross-dresser?
Just a few weeks.
Really?
Because Sindy, with an S told us that he dressed up for her once a month, and It was all your idea.
I won't stand for this.
This is an attempt to destroy my church.
Have a seat, sir.
KATE:
You presume because I'm a Christian, 1 claim to be perfect.
BRENDA:
No, I presume that you're not proud..
F helping your husband commit adultery.
Judge not lest ye be judged.
I won't be the one doing the judging, Mrs. Wycoff.
There is more to marriage than fidelity.
It's about raising children.
It's about...
Oh, about...
I did my best.
I did my best.
I really did my best.
BRENDA:
I'm sure you did, but we need to talk about Sindy.
She said your husband was happy when she left the motel room at 10:55... so why did he wanna die at 11:02?
Cliff was disgusted with himself.
He would come home from these terrible sessions and cry for forgiveness.
He hung himself.
Why is that so hard for you to understand?
Because if he was so ashamed, why did he kill himself dressed like that... for all the world to see?
Mrs. Wycoff, the coroner says your husband's wounds are consistent... .with murder by strangulation.
We know Sindy...
- He called me from the motel.
BRENDA:
But he didn't.
You keep lying, I'm going to tell the media... that your husband died wearing pink panties, a bra and a pair of pumps.
So who called you from the motel?
If I tell you what happened can you keep the prostitution and cross-dressing to yourselves?
I
We can try.
And will you leave my family out of it?
Because honestly, this is all about me.
All about you?
I called my own phone to establish an alibi.
I killed him.
I snapped.
God forgive me.
I killed him.
What are you doing?
What is this?
- Your daughter just confessed.
- You don't believe her.
- I certainly do.
DIANA:
It's Impossible.
Kate didn't kill him.
Let me tell you what...
- Quiet.
- You can't arrest her.
I intend to arrest your entire family, the lying lot of you... .as accessories to murder after the fact.
So stop covering up for each other.
Read them their rights, please, starting with George here.
- This is crazy.
- You have the right to remain silent.
What did we do?
Besides obstruct justice and destroy evidence?
Let me show you.
SANCHEZ:
Have you heard and understood these rights as they have been read to you?
This is a matrix, or a map, if you will... of all the phone calls made around the time of your father's death.
Here is your mother calling from the motel to her own cell phone... to make it look like she wasn't there.
Very clever.
About 45 minutes later, she called your grandparents... who in turn called your little sister and brother... to pick up your father's clothes from home, I assume.
And here's the call informing you that your father had...
Wait a minute.
Lieutenant Tao, this is Chris Wycoff over here... and yet it looks like no one called him.
- Could that be right?
- Yes, chief.
And yet you were at the motel.
How'd you even know your father was dead?
- Skywriting?
- I was on base when I got the call.
No.
We checked with your commander.
You asked for yesterday off two weeks ago.
Makes this look like premeditation.
Wait.
I'll tell you why I didn't get the call.
Ma'am, can we talk privately?
Lieutenant?
A couple weeks ago, my dad asked me to look at his computer.
He was having trouble with the Wi-Fi.
And I found a hidden e-mail account where this woman... this prostitute, was writing to him about their next meeting.
I had trouble believing it, so I followed him.
I wanted to confront him.
You watched him check into the motel You saw the prostitute come and go?
And after she left, I opened the door... .and my dad was dead on the floor from autoerotic...
No, no, no.
There was no autoerotic anything.
Well, it sure as heck looked like it.
I don't know.
Maybe the prostitute killed him.
He was paying her $500 an hour.
Why would she kill him?
Your mother confessed to this murder.
I could take her word for it.
Is that what you want?
Let your brother and sister grow up without both parents?
Maybe they'd be better off.
Your father led a double life, but your mom's the one who made It possible.
I
Lying, covering up for him.
Maybe she deserves to go to prison.
Hmm?
Is that what you're thinking?
In our house, we were taught "honor thy father and thy mother."
- If you breathed wrong, you got the belt.
- Did you ever breathe wrong?
When I was 15, my dad... .the man who taught me right from wrong... the guy who liked to wear women's lingerie... he found a note from this boy that I knew In choir, Jeff.
The two of us were, uh-Jeff and I were close.
We were close.
And I saved that note in my room, at the very back of my desk drawer.
And it was none of my dad's business... that note.
But he found it.
- And he went crazy.
- Went crazy how?
First he beat me.
Then he shipped me off to military school.
When I came home for Christmas...
I found out Dad had brought that note to Jeff's house... and showed it to his parents... and that my friend... he'd killed himself.
Oh, and guess who preached at Jeff's funeral.
So when my dad opened that door yesterday... looking like some kind of freak... and he started saying It was only this once..
And we should just pray about it and at least he wasn't gay...
You saw his belt?
Is that it?
You grabbed his belt?
- Yeah, I grabbed his belt
- And what did you c:
It's time to do the honorable thing, corporal.
I put it around his neck and yanked him all over the room.
And then?
Ma'am, I spent five years in Afghanistan.
I know when someone's dead.
[SNIFFS]
I killed him.
And then I called my mother and I left him in his little outfit... thinking, "Well, now she'll finally see the truth."
But she already knew.
And I realized while she was fussing with him... you know, taking off his bra, asking me to help knot his tie... that she had never once in all of my life stood up for anyone but him.
And for a moment there for a really bad moment...
I thought about killing her too.
[SIGHS]
[SNIFFS]
Ma'am, I'm sorry to have lied to you.
It was not the honorable thing to do.
I wish to apologize for having caused everyone so much trouble.
Well, I don't deal much in forgiveness, corporal... but I sure am sorry to have to arrest you for murder In the first degree.
Hey, everyone, good to see you again.
I have to congratulate you guys on being a pretty tight little unit.
Detective David Gabriel... you have been served.
- Happy now?
It's what you asked for.
- Ecstatic.
Thank you.
Now you know what it's like to be singled out by your own gang.
But seriously, don't thank me.
Thank Chief Johnson.
She's the one who put you all In the spotlight.
You asked to be subpoenaed?
It's only fair, right?
So come on, give It up.
Show me some love.
I'm subpoenaed too.
- Welcome to the club.
PROVENZA:
No rats.
No rats here.
GABRIEL:
Oh, thank you, lieutenant.
I could've told you that, though.
[MEN CHATTERING]
[LAUGHING]
PROVENZA:
Here we go.
Here we go.
All right.
[DOOR OPENS]
- Hey.
- Hey.
You're home early.
Rough day?
Sort of.
The Baylors' attorney came back and subpoenaed Gabriel... so that officially puts my entire division In hot water.
Over a decision made by me and me alone.
What I'm wondering about... .now is, how much worse are things gonna get?
I mean, really.
How much worse?
A little worse, maybe.
What?
You too?
Why?
Remember when Turell first presented himself... .l volunteered to provide protective custody for his mom and sister?
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm...
- I'm so sorry.
- Why?
Look, what did you do, really, except your job?
I drove Turell hornet and I dropped him off.
And that's it.
That's it.
That's all.
I mean, there was no decision at all, really.
I don't know why we're being treated like this.
[BRENDA GASPS]
- Oh, shoot, now look what I've done.
- It's okay, I got it.
It's just a spill, hon.
- What have I done?
- It's okay, no permanent damage.
I'll wipe it up.
It's okay.
It's okay.
- What have done.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Shh.
Hey, hey, hey.
- What have I done?
- Shh.
What have I done?
[SOBBING]
What have I done?
What have I done?
- It's okay.
- What have I done?
What have I done?
Synced Corrected by Shadowmoon
Major Crimes.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
- Hey, chief.
- Yes?
Dr. Morales says there's a dead guy at a funeral home.
- Very funny.
Seriously.
There's a body at Weaver Funeral Home without a death certificate.
Ask Dr. Morales to send a coroner's investigator.
He did, but the dead guy's family doesn't want him to examine the body.
- Who do you think should handle it?
Detective Julio Sanchez?
- You have been served.
- What?
Again?
PROVE Well, it's probably nothing.
Not counting my five divorces, I've been sued 17 times.
- Lieutenant Louie M. Provenza.
- Eighteen.
Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
- You've been served.
- What's going on?
- Lieutenant Michael Tao.
- Getting wallpapered.
Francis B. Watson.
- What?
Why me?
Why "Francis"?
That's the real question.
- Lieutenant Andrew Flynn.
- Yeah, yeah.
A wrongful-death civil suit filed on behalf of Turell Baylor."
We didn't kill the guy.
He was beaten to death right after we dropped him off.
Turell murdered an old man and his 8-year-old grandson.
- Who cares what happened to him?
- Commander Russell Taylor.
You have been served.
Okay, that's it.
- Wait, whoa, whoa.
What about me?
- Sorry, that's all I got.
You talk to the Baylors' attorney already?
What did you say?
Are you kidding?
Are you serious?
Gabriel, it's Flynn.
He's paranoid for a living.
Of course I'm paranoid.
Raydor's been grilling us for weeks.
We're not allowed to discuss this case.
What I can tell you is that they're only really Interested In me.
Funny way to show it.
Hey.
Hey, buddy, what are you still doing here?
Oh, I'm serving subpoenas today... and I'm also the attorney representing the mother of Turell Baylor...
- What?
- ...
In her suit against the city, L.A.P.D... and almost everyone in this room.
My name is Peter Goldman, and It's a great pleasure meeting you all.
Now that I have your squad on record saying Turell Baylor deserved to die...
I was wondering if I could ask your detectives follow-up questions...
No.
They're on their way to a crime scene of a very serious murder... at Weaver Funeral Home.
- Lieutenant.
- Right.
Right.
Let's go.
Hurry up.
Get out of here.
Clear out.
- If you could spare me just a moment...
- Goodbye.
I can't help you.
Goodbye.
I am an officer of the court, sworn to uphold the law...
I and just like you, I am only trying to get to the truth.
And a $20 million settlement.
When suspects die without due process, people lose confidence In the justice...
Goodbye, Mr. Goldman.
There were two other cops in the car when you drove Turell Baylor home.
Give me their names and I won't depose your whole squad.
I've already heard some of your people were unhappy... with the way you treated Turell.
Nice try, Mr. Goldman.
But there's nothing you could say that would make me suspect my officers.
Just a friendly heads-up.
"Goodbye" didn't work.
Let's try "get out."
- Now.
- Come on.
Come on.
Let me walk you back to the elevator.
It's all right.
I know my way around.
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Walk.
- All right, I'm walking.
- Walk.
I'm walking.
Excuse me.
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm Terry Weaver.
Are you gentlemen all from the police?
Lieutenant Provenza, Major Crimes.
Major Crimes?
Oh, my gosh.
Listen, I'm the funeral director here, an d...
Six of you?
Six?
Oh, my gosh.
What...?
There's been a miscommunication.
Did someone carry a body in here without a death certificate?
Okay, listen.
Cliff Wycoff, he's a minister.
Pastor Wycoff died of natural causes In his home... .and his family brought him to the funeral home.
- Have you examined the body?
- Oh, no.
I would never do that before the death was certified.
That's why I called the coroner.
But we don't need the police.
- Mr. Weaver, what are you doing?
- Is the body In there?
Front of the chapel, yes.
All right, L.A.P.D. Everybody back.
Step back.
Why does he have a camera7 No, no, no.
This is wrong.
- Why are you taking pictures of my dad?
- We mean no disrespect.
- Army or Navy?
- Lance corporal, United States Marines.
Great, because if you interfere... we'll call the MPs at Camp Pendleton, and you'II become their problem.
So should I proceed with the liver temp and exam?
Well, if you can do it before they start the wake, yes.
Is everything all right?
No visible head trauma.
Let's see.
But I see petechiae.
- Ligature on the neck.
- Strangulation of some sort.
I'd call that unnatural.
Ninety-one.
That puts time of death about two or three hours ago.
Urn, Gabriel, come with me.
- Urn...
You the wife?
- Yes.
I need to talk to you.
This is no way to treat people In mourning.
- I don't know about that-
- Excuse me, lieutenant.
You have the I.A. P. D.'s deepest sympathies in this very difficult time.
Perhaps there's someplace we could talk?
Yes.
Lieutenant, she may not realize she did something wrong.
She may also have just strangled her husband.
She's a preacher's wife.
You approach her a certain way.
You would know how to do that .better than I would because?
When I was a kid, I went to church four times a week.
Four times a week?
Twice on Sunday, prayer meetings I on Wednesday, choir on Friday.
All right, you win, but hurry up.
I'm not waiting here till Jesus comes back.
Mrs. Wycoff, I know you're taking care of many people right now... and we will be sensitive to your spiritual obligations.
But I also need you to be sensitive to your legal situation.
It would help us out greatly... if you could just tell us what happened to your husband today.
Clifford was battling depression.
His faith was strong, but it...
Sometimes it's hard to know what God wants.
God didn't want this.
My husband hung himself In the garage of our house.
I am so very sorry.
I know how hard that must have been to say.
But can you tell me why you didn't contact the authorities?
I should have, I know, but I didn't want anyone In the church to know.
I
We can certify your husband's death... .but I need written consent to search your home and your garage, okay?
Thank you.
Here, let yourselves in.
I'm taking the family to church If you need me.
Of course.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Don't let anybody in.
I just came up with the pastor's most recent credit-card charge.
- This guy didn't die at home, lieutenant.
- Starlight Motor Lodge.
He checked in at 10 a.m. this morning, and he still hasn't checked out.
Yeah, that depends on your point of view.
Someone made a call from the minister's room... at the Starlight around 11:02 am., just before the time of death.
Well, find out who that call went to, Mike.
Yeah, chief?
Urn...
We've got a situation.
Manager said the victim was a regular.
Held the room with a credit card, then paid with cash when he left.
Oh, the old cheater's trick.
So I hear.
Maybe he just needed a quiet place to reflect.
- By the hour?
Get It all.
Make sure it gets cleaned up.
- Hey, guys, hold up, hold up.
Shh.
What did you say?
- Stay back, Buzz.
I said, make sure you empty the trash.
- Sir, L.A.P.D. Drop it.
- Drop the weapon.
- Drop the weapon!
- Dear God, don't shoot!
- What the hell?
- Don't shoot!
Oh, we were just cleaning up.
Ma'am, put the spray cleaner down and step away from the sink.
- It's a hot glue gun, chief.
- A glue gun?
I just fixed that lamp, and now look at it.
Well, we have a pair of men's pants here, a shirt, a belt.
Aha.
And what have we here?
Now, who does this belong to?
Y'all wouldn't happen to know a Pastor Cliff Wycoff, would you?
He was our son-in-law.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret only my wife knows.
Your pastor's not perfect.
Jesus knows that I'm a sinner.
He loves me in spite of the fact that I'm human.
Yeah!
- Pause It, Buzz.
What kind of a woman asks her parents to clean up the room... where her husband was having sex?
Tao.
Looks like the pastor's lady friend left In a hurry.
Anything from the motel security cameras?
Strictly decoration, chief.
Somebody called his wife's phone from the motel room.
Flynn and Gabriel picked up Mrs. Wycoff and her family at their church...
Chief Johnson.
They're on their way back here, .but there's a bit of an issue.
Okay.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I wanna know the moment that the rest of the Wycoff family arrives, please.
Thank you.
So why were you talking to Peter Goldman this morning?
Goldman pretended to be a process server... and he threw subpoenas all around the Murder Room, and I ordered him out.
- He was trying to offer you a deal.
- How do you know that?
Oh, Commander Taylor.
When, when, when are you going to get him out of my Murder Room?
I can't bear it.
Will, I don't even remember what Goldman was talking about.
Well, allow me to refresh your memory.
He was asking who was with you when you dropped off Turell Baylor.
Now, why would he be asking that?
Was something said in that car that could get us In trouble?
No.
Goldman served everyone a subpoena except for Gabriel... .to turn us against each other, make us paranoid.
Gabriel didn't get served?
You think he's already talked to Goldman?
The paranoia part seems to be working.
Look, Will, this is all about me.
Not all about you.
I got subpoenaed too, and I'm in this now up to my neck.
As is the city, the department, your entire division.
The next time Goldman comes Into your Murder Room... .will you go into your office and lock the door?
And call the city attorney, which is what you should've done.
Or better yet, find yourself a personal attorney.
Maybe he can make you understand how serious this is.
Because nobody else is getting through to you.
Come In.
- David Gabriel.
- Chief.
Uh, I have the rest of the Wycoff family waiting for you.
Thank you, David.
Everyone thinks it's weird that I didn't get served.
I
David, stop worrying about gossip and start concentrating on this case.
What were the Wycoffs doing when you found them?
When we finally caught up with them at the church... they were driving their minivan around the parking lot, running over computers.
So this is what's left of the church's entire IT Division.
This is what's left of my desk.
There's probably a record in there of our victim's love connection.
Looks like an organized hit.
.Who did the organizing?
- I'm ready to throw them all in jail.
I wish It were that easy.
- How did you get back in this building?
- Oh, I never left.
And I'm sorry to disturb your investigation here.
Just wanted to drop by, see if you'd had a chance to think over my proposal.
I have.
I propose you stand still, let Lieutenant Tao take your picture... and tell Security to arrest you If you come back again.
- Okay, I'm going, I'm going.
- Get.
All right, okay.
Just call me if you change your mind on the deal.
Detective Gabriel, looking sharp.
Look, I have never, ever met that man in my life before today.
- Well, he sure as hell knows you.
- Hey, that's enough.
We know David.
We've worked with him for years.
He's a good guy, he's a great cop, and he's as loyal as they come.
- Thanks.
- Or else he's a snitch.
At any rate, he's the only one of us who hasn't been subpoenaed... so he must have done something right.
Thank you, Lieutenant Provenza, for that morale booster.
Meanwhile, I'd like to talk to Mrs. Wycoff.
Detective Gabriel?
Let's start with how you knew where to find your husband's body.
He, urn...
He called me from that horrible motel to say goodbye.
The number showed up on my cell phone as the Starlight Motor Lodge.
He told you he was going to kill himself?
I begged him not to, but he wouldn't listen to me.
After he hung up the phone, I rushed over to find him... but it was too late.
He was hanging by his belt .from the sprinkler pipe.
He felt he'd let me down, his church down.
He let God down.
Well, you certainly let me down, Mrs. Wycoff.
I allowed you to spend some time with your family... and you used that time to destroy all your husband's computers.
I did that, yes.
It was only to protect the members of our congregation.
Protect them from what?
Our members trusted my husband with their secrets.
The law doesn't recognize the confidentiality of Protestant ministers.
God does.
We may not have legal rights, but we have spiritual ones.
Those rights do not include having your parents sterilize the room... where your husband died.
Here are a few things that they couldn't sweep under the rug.
Any idea how these came to be there?
- I assume he was with another woman.
- Someone he knew or a prostitute?
Please, I'm begging you... do not sensationalize my husband's suicide.
I'm not sensationalizing anything, Mrs. Wycoff.
But I absolutely need to find this woman... .who was with your husband at that motel.
She ran away without her shoes and her underwear.
That worries me.
I don't even know if she's still alive.
Or should I be checking with another funeral home somewhere?
I wouldn't know.
It's in God's hands, not mine.
Boy, oh, boy.
They're all singing from the same hymnal.
Anybody say anything about the girlfriend?
Nobody knows nothing about nothing but suicide.
Mrs. Wycoff's orchestrated this.
She's practically daring me to arrest her.
You know what?
I say let her go.
- So she can destroy more evidence?
- She doesn't think we're questioning her.
She thinks we're questioning her faith.
That's gonna make her stonewall.
If we back off, who knows?
Maybe she'll try to contact the other woman or lead us to her body.
It's either that or we try those red shoes on all the fair ladies in the land.
Excuse me, chief.
Dr. Morales Is ready for you.
Okay.
Thank you.
I want 24-hour surveillance on every member of that family.
- Can you arrange it, please?
- Oh, love to.
Thank you.
Oh, and, Detective Gabriel, I need you with me, please.
So, sir, did she say anything to you about what Goldman's proposal was?
No, but whatever that asshole suggested... she's not letting Gabriel out of her sight.
The ligature wounds are consistent with the belt found at the scene.
So he did hang himself?
Only if he was somehow able to desperately scratch at his throat for air... severely bruise his knee, and finally, sprain his ankle In the process.
That swelling had to happen before the guy died.
So there was a struggle?
At some point, the victim found himself flailing on the floor.
So, what, the belt was being pulled one way...?
And our victim was trying to pull It another, yes.
Doctor, what are these?
Oh, yes.
At first, I thought those were broken blood vessels... but when I swabbed them, it appeared to be some kind of red dye.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.
Well, looks like we found Cinderella.
Yeah, but who turned him Into a pumpkin?
- Are you going to work?
Mm.
That was Detective Gabriel.
He's following the widow Wycoff to church.
- At 6 a.m.?
- That's where she and her family go.
Home and church.
Church and home.
That woman.
She honestly thinks she's somehow above the law... that the justice system doesn't apply to her.
Speaking of which, did you ever contact... .that attorney Captain Raydor suggested to you?
No.
Kitty.
I mean, Joel.
Joel, Joel, Joel, off the table.
- I really think you need an attorney.
- I can't think about that right now
I need to find someone who was with a minister who wore women's underwear.
Oh.
Victoria isn't the only one with a secret.
How do you even know this minister was with anyone?
Someone killed him In a seedy motel room.
His wife knows exactly who he was with, and she won't tell me.
She's more worried we'll find out her husband was a transvestite...
I
- ...than she is about finding his killer.
- People are weird.
She had her parents scrub down the crime scene with bleach.
I mean, who does that?
Oh, my gosh.
They weren't just trying .to wipe away prints.
They were trying to wash away the sin.
That's It, isn't it?
They were ashamed.
Just wait till I ask the widow Wycoff... to help me find the person who was wearing that shoe.
- I thought you knew it was the pastor.
- Yeah, but she doesn't know I know that.
Watching me hunt for whose foot fits the ruby-red slipper... might just make her realize she's not In Kansas anymore.
- I love these heart-to-hearts we have.
- Me too, honey.
Me too.
When I stepped down from the pulpit of this church...
I and passed it on to my son-in-law...
I never imagined the pain of a day like today.
God uses suffering to test us.
Even in a death from despair, God offers us choices... .asking if our faith is stronger than one leader... .questioning whether this church Is about one man or one God.
So when you all are reaching out to our congregation... resist the temptation to sow gossip.
You have no right interrupting a meeting of our stewardship committee.
I've thought of a way to find out who was with your husband when he died.
- Does this look familiar?
- Put that away.
This belongs to the woman with whom he was sleeping.
Chances are, she witnessed or caused his death.
- My husband committed suicide.
- Pastor Wycoff's death Is undetermined.
While it remains that way, I intend to try this shoe on every female... in your congregation ages 18 to 65, starting with your committee.
You wouldn't dare.
- No, please, please.
- Mom, what's she saying?
Please, do not go into this church terrorizing everybody.
What makes you think I could know who this woman was?
You destroyed the computers your husband used... which gives us the idea he either met a woman online... or was maintaining some sort of relationship with a woman online.
All right.
Please put that away.
Yes.
My husband went on the Internet.
He went on a site where he found some woman named Sindy Showers.
Spelled S-l-N-D-Y.
Thank you.
I'll check that out and get back to you.
Oh, I'm sure you will.
Chief Johnson.
Do you even believe in God?
I'll tell you what I do believe, Mrs. Wycoff.
Thou shalt not kill.
Ma'am, that shoe won't fit anybody at this church.
How do you know that?
When my mom found my dad, she called me... .and when I got to the motel, he was wearing that.
And he was dressed In women's underwear and a bra.
And I helped her change him into his suit.
How do you explain the ligature marks on his neck?
Come on, Chris.
We're only trying to do right by your dad.
You've heard of the autoerotic thing people do?
- Yeah.
Choking yourself while you're-
- Yeah.
Your father did that?
My dad was on the floor with his belt around his throat.
And my mom rolled him over, and his hand was, uh...
It was, uh...
Can you really blame her for not wanting to talk about It?
I just got off the phone with Dr. Morales.
He says the autoerotic-asphyxiation thing Is possible... but he wanted to know if we found a release mechanism at the motel.
- I'm not sure exactly what that is.
- We didn't find one.
Wait, what didn't we find?
Typically, chief, the autoerotic guy rigs up the choking device... with a quick release to prevent accidental hanging.
But Wycoff only had his belt.
Not sure how that explains his sprained ankle.
Well, it's an awful lot to be doing In heels.
Sindy Showers is in Interview Room Number 1.
Vice tracked her down to a site .called
Who's Your Mommy?
She doesn't want a lawyer if we promise not to arrest her... for solicitation and lewd conduct.
Thank you, commander.
David, here's how to end this whole subpoena nightmare.
Just call Goldman and tell him you wanna talk.
- Wouldn't that make me look bad?
- How could you look any worse?
Miss Showers, I'm Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
I've got a few questions regarding your safety.
- My safety?
- Yes.
We're trying to find someone who might be targeting, uh, workers like yourself.
- Oh, then okay, I guess.
- Do you recognize this man?
You're not serious.
If you're worried about my safety, you've got the wrong guy.
I've known him for years.
See him once every month or so.
Yesterday, as a matter of fact.
- You know he's a member of the clergy?
- No, but that explains a few things.
- Like?
- Like every time we finish... he tries to talk me out of ever meeting him again... and he always wants us to pray for forgiveness.
I'm used to getting on my knees, but not for that.
Any other unusual requests?
You mean the lingerie?
Not that unusual.
I mean, you wouldn't believe what some men try to pull.
This one guy, he takes about 30 toasted almonds... and lines them up...
Off topic.
Off topic.
Okay.
Look, Cliff y pays me $300 for the hour... another hundred for the underwear, another hundred for the shoes.
So ditty likes to wear women's clothes.
You know what?
So do I. Big deal.
He's not dangerous.
I've always felt safe with him.
Even when he asks you to cut off his air supply?
- When he what?
- Ahem.
Have you ever heard of autoerotic...?
The choking thing?
Good God, no.
Not on my menu.
No blood, no bruises, no bondage.
I'm telling you, whatever this is, you got the wrong guy.
He likes to play dress-up.
It makes him happy.
Was he happy when you left him yesterday?
Why wouldn't he be?
Because, Sindy, we found Cliff in that motel room... .not long after you left, and he was dead.
What?
No.
Are you serious?
Now you're scaring me.
That's awful.
- Dead how?
- Were not sure exactly.
He may have committed suicide.
He didn't kill himself, I can promise you that.
Cliff loved his family way too much to leave them behind.
- You knew he was married?
- Well, yeah.
Cliff told me that his wife wasn't Into his whole dress-up thing at all... so she let him handle it by hiring me.
- So she knew all along?
- Yeah.
Cliff said...
I think her name is Kate.
... that Kate thought It was a little twisted... but as long as he didn't bring his bras and panties Into the house... she could ignore it.
He might have been a little different from my usual dates... but he didn't deserve to die in that motel room.
His wife hired a prostitute for her cross-dressing husband.
- And not just once or twice.
- Which means she also probably knew...
When it was his time of the month?
Ahem.
Uh, look, chief, if she was aware of what was going on for a while... .then why was yesterday the breaking point?
- And why would he call her in despair?
- Good question.
It shows up on the motel phone records.
Pastor Wycoff called his wife.
Or did he?
- Chief'?
Ahem.
Chief, what are we gonna say in those depositions?
- Just the truth, I guess.
- The truth, yeah.
But first, shouldn't we all agree as to what that is?
I do phone trees all the time... but very seldom do we get to put together an all-out matrix.
And this is every phone call between every family member?
Landlines and cells.
Almost everybody's calling everybody.
Isn't it funny how in every family, there's always an odd man out?
What is that supposed to mean?
It means everybody knows that you've already said your piece to Goldman.
Who's everybody?
Provenza, Tao and Buzz, or just you?
- Oh, yeah, just me.
I'm the only one-
- Gentlemen, stop this bickering.
This ridiculous lawsuit has nothing .to do with you.
It's all about me
Sanchez, Gabriel, Lieutenant Flynn...
I want handcuffs slapped on Mrs. Wycoff.
Make sure her family knows so that they'll follow her down here.
Provenza, Tao, let's get this murder board out of here.
- Where to, chief?
Interview Room 2.
I don't want the Wycoffs seeing it before we're ready.
How long have you known... your husband was a cross-dresser?
Just a few weeks.
Really?
Because Sindy, with an S told us that he dressed up for her once a month, and It was all your idea.
I won't stand for this.
This is an attempt to destroy my church.
Have a seat, sir.
You presume because I'm a Christian, 1 claim to be perfect.
No, I presume that you're not proud..
F helping your husband commit adultery.
Judge not lest ye be judged.
I won't be the one doing the judging, Mrs. Wycoff.
There is more to marriage than fidelity.
It's about raising children.
It's about...
Oh, about...
I did my best.
I did my best.
I really did my best.
I'm sure you did, but we need to talk about Sindy.
She said your husband was happy when she left the motel room at 10:55... so why did he wanna die at 11:02?
Cliff was disgusted with himself.
He would come home from these terrible sessions and cry for forgiveness.
He hung himself.
Why is that so hard for you to understand?
Because if he was so ashamed, why did he kill himself dressed like that... for all the world to see?
Mrs. Wycoff, the coroner says your husband's wounds are consistent... .with murder by strangulation.
We know Sindy...
- He called me from the motel.
But he didn't.
You keep lying, I'm going to tell the media... that your husband died wearing pink panties, a bra and a pair of pumps.
So who called you from the motel?
If I tell you what happened can you keep the prostitution and cross-dressing to yourselves?
I
We can try.
And will you leave my family out of it?
Because honestly, this is all about me.
All about you?
I called my own phone to establish an alibi.
I killed him.
I snapped.
God forgive me.
I killed him.
What are you doing?
What is this?
- Your daughter just confessed.
- You don't believe her.
- I certainly do.
It's Impossible.
Kate didn't kill him.
Let me tell you what...
- Quiet.
- You can't arrest her.
I intend to arrest your entire family, the lying lot of you... .as accessories to murder after the fact.
So stop covering up for each other.
Read them their rights, please, starting with George here.
- This is crazy.
- You have the right to remain silent.
What did we do?
Besides obstruct justice and destroy evidence?
Let me show you.
Have you heard and understood these rights as they have been read to you?
This is a matrix, or a map, if you will... of all the phone calls made around the time of your father's death.
Here is your mother calling from the motel to her own cell phone... to make it look like she wasn't there.
Very clever.
About 45 minutes later, she called your grandparents... who in turn called your little sister and brother... to pick up your father's clothes from home, I assume.
And here's the call informing you that your father had...
Wait a minute.
Lieutenant Tao, this is Chris Wycoff over here... and yet it looks like no one called him.
- Could that be right?
- Yes, chief.
And yet you were at the motel.
How'd you even know your father was dead?
- Skywriting?
- I was on base when I got the call.
No.
We checked with your commander.
You asked for yesterday off two weeks ago.
Makes this look like premeditation.
Wait.
I'll tell you why I didn't get the call.
Ma'am, can we talk privately?
Lieutenant?
A couple weeks ago, my dad asked me to look at his computer.
He was having trouble with the Wi-Fi.
And I found a hidden e-mail account where this woman... this prostitute, was writing to him about their next meeting.
I had trouble believing it, so I followed him.
I wanted to confront him.
You watched him check into the motel You saw the prostitute come and go?
And after she left, I opened the door... .and my dad was dead on the floor from autoerotic...
No, no, no.
There was no autoerotic anything.
Well, it sure as heck looked like it.
I don't know.
Maybe the prostitute killed him.
He was paying her $500 an hour.
Why would she kill him?
Your mother confessed to this murder.
I could take her word for it.
Is that what you want?
Let your brother and sister grow up without both parents?
Maybe they'd be better off.
Your father led a double life, but your mom's the one who made It possible.
I
Lying, covering up for him.
Maybe she deserves to go to prison.
Hmm?
Is that what you're thinking?
In our house, we were taught "honor thy father and thy mother."
- If you breathed wrong, you got the belt.
- Did you ever breathe wrong?
When I was 15, my dad... .the man who taught me right from wrong... the guy who liked to wear women's lingerie... he found a note from this boy that I knew In choir, Jeff.
The two of us were, uh-Jeff and I were close.
We were close.
And I saved that note in my room, at the very back of my desk drawer.
And it was none of my dad's business... that note.
But he found it.
- And he went crazy.
- Went crazy how?
First he beat me.
Then he shipped me off to military school.
When I came home for Christmas...
I found out Dad had brought that note to Jeff's house... and showed it to his parents... and that my friend... he'd killed himself.
Oh, and guess who preached at Jeff's funeral.
So when my dad opened that door yesterday... looking like some kind of freak... and he started saying It was only this once..
And we should just pray about it and at least he wasn't gay...
You saw his belt?
Is that it?
You grabbed his belt?
- Yeah, I grabbed his belt
- And what did you c:
It's time to do the honorable thing, corporal.
I put it around his neck and yanked him all over the room.
And then?
Ma'am, I spent five years in Afghanistan.
I know when someone's dead.
I killed him.
And then I called my mother and I left him in his little outfit... thinking, "Well, now she'll finally see the truth."
But she already knew.
And I realized while she was fussing with him... you know, taking off his bra, asking me to help knot his tie... that she had never once in all of my life stood up for anyone but him.
And for a moment there for a really bad moment...
I thought about killing her too.
Ma'am, I'm sorry to have lied to you.
It was not the honorable thing to do.
I wish to apologize for having caused everyone so much trouble.
Well, I don't deal much in forgiveness, corporal... but I sure am sorry to have to arrest you for murder In the first degree.
Hey, everyone, good to see you again.
I have to congratulate you guys on being a pretty tight little unit.
Detective David Gabriel... you have been served.
- Happy now?
It's what you asked for.
- Ecstatic.
Thank you.
Now you know what it's like to be singled out by your own gang.
But seriously, don't thank me.
Thank Chief Johnson.
She's the one who put you all In the spotlight.
You asked to be subpoenaed?
It's only fair, right?
So come on, give It up.
Show me some love.
I'm subpoenaed too.
- Welcome to the club.
No rats.
No rats here.
Oh, thank you, lieutenant.
I could've told you that, though.
Here we go.
Here we go.
All right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You're home early.
Rough day?
Sort of.
The Baylors' attorney came back and subpoenaed Gabriel... so that officially puts my entire division In hot water.
Over a decision made by me and me alone.
What I'm wondering about... .now is, how much worse are things gonna get?
I mean, really.
How much worse?
A little worse, maybe.
What?
You too?
Why?
Remember when Turell first presented himself... .l volunteered to provide protective custody for his mom and sister?
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm...
- I'm so sorry.
- Why?
Look, what did you do, really, except your job?
I drove Turell hornet and I dropped him off.
And that's it.
That's it.
That's all.
I mean, there was no decision at all, really.
I don't know why we're being treated like this.
- Oh, shoot, now look what I've done.
- It's okay, I got it.
It's just a spill, hon.
- What have I done?
- It's okay, no permanent damage.
I'll wipe it up.
It's okay.
It's okay.
- What have done.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Shh.
Hey, hey, hey.
- What have I done?
- Shh.
What have I done?
What have I done?
What have I done?
- It's okay.
- What have I done?
What have I done?

Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
- Hey, Chief?
- Yes?
Dr. Morales says there's a dead guy at a funeral home.
Very funny.
Seriously, there's a body at Weaver Funeral Home without a death certificate.
Well, ask Dr. Morales to send in a coroner's investigator.
He did, but the dead guy's family doesn't want him to examine the body.
Who do you think should handle it, Chief?
Uh, Detective Julio Sanchez?
You have been served.
What, again?
Well, it's probably nothing.
Not counting my five divorces, I've been sued 17 times.
Lieutenant Louie M. Provenza?
18.
Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson?
You've been served.
- What's going on?
- Lieutenant Michael Tao?
Getting wallpapered, Commander.
- Francis B. Watson?
- What?
Why me?
Why "Francis"?
That's the real question.
- Lieutenant Andrew Flynn?
- Yeah, yeah.
A wrongful-death civil suit filed on behalf of Turell Baylor?
We didn't kill the guy.
Yeah, but he was beaten to death right after we dropped him off at his house.
Turell murdered an old man and his 8-year-old grandson.
Who cares what happened to him?
Commander Russell Taylor?
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
You have been served.
Okay, that's it.
Wait.
Whoa.
Whoa.
What about me?
Sorry.
That's all I got.
You talked to the Baylors' attorney already?
What'd you say?
Are you kidding?
Are you serious right now?
Gabriel, it's Flynn!
He's paranoid for a living.
Of course I'm paranoid.
Raydor's been down here grilling us for weeks.
Look, gentlemen, we're not allowed to discuss the case, but what I can tell you is that they're only really interested in me.
Funny way to show it.
Hey.
Hey, buddy.
What are you still doing here?
Oh, I'm serving subpoenas today, and I'm also the attorney representing the mother of Turell Baylor...
You're the what?
!
...In her suit against the city, the L.A.P.D., and almost everyone in this room.
My name is Peter Goldman.
And it's a great pleasure meeting you all.
Uh, now that I have your squad on record saying Turell Baylor deserved to die,
I was wondering if I could ask your detectives a few simple follow-up questions.
No!
They're on their way to a crime scene of a very serious murder at...
Weaver Funeral Home.
Lieutenant.
Right!
Right!
Let's go!
Hurry up.
Get out of here.
Clear out.
If you could spare me just a moment --
Goodbye, Mr. Goldman.
I can't help you.
Goodbye.
I am an officer of the court, sworn to uphold the law, and, just like you, I am only trying to get to the truth.
And a $20 million settlement.
When suspects die without due process, people lose confidence in the justice system.
Goodbye, Mr. Goldman.
There were two other cops in the car when you drove Turell Baylor home.
Give me their names, and I won't depose your whole squad.
I've already heard some of your people were unhappy with the way you treated Turell.
Nice try, Mr. Goldman.
But there's nothing you could say that would make me suspect my fellow officers.
Just a friendly heads-up.
"Goodbye" didn't work.
Let's try "Get out!"
- Now.
- Come on.
Come on.
Let me walk you back to the elevator.
Let's go.
It's all right.
I know my way around.
Pleasure meeting you.
Walk.
What?
I'm walking!
I'm walking.
Excuse me.
Wait.
Wait, wait.
I'm Terry Weaver.
A-are you gentlemen all from the police?
Lieutenant Provenza, Major Crimes.
Major Crimes?
Oh, my gosh.
Listen, I'm the funeral director here and -- six of you?
Six -- oh, my gosh.
There's been a terrible miscommunication.
Did someone carry a body in here without a death certificate?
Okay, listen.
Cliff Wycoff -- he's a minister.
Pastor Wycoff died of natural causes in his home.
And his family brought him to the funeral home.
Have you examined the body?
Oh, no, no.
I would never do that before the death was certified.
That's why I called the coroner.
But we don't need the police.
Mr. Weaver, what are you doing?
Is the body in there?
Front of the chapel, yes.
In here.
All right, L.A.P.D. everybody back.
Step back.
Step back.
Why does he have -- no, no.
Why does he have a camera?
No, no, no, no.
This is wrong.
What are you taking pictures of my dad for?
Calm down, sir.
We mean no disrespect.
Army or Navy?
I'm a Lance Corporal, United States Marines.
Great. 'Cause if you interfere, we'll call the M.P.s at Camp Pendleton, and you'll become their problem.
So, should I proceed with the liver-temping exam?
Well, if you can do it before they start the wake, yes.
Is everything all right?
No visible head trauma.
But I see petechiae.
And ligature on the neck.
So, strangulation of some sort.
I'd call that unnatural.
91.
That puts time of death about two, three hours ago.
Um, Gabriel, come with me.
Um, you the wife?
Yes.
Yeah, well, I need to talk to you right now.
This is no way to treat people in mourning.
- Well, I don't know about that, lady.
- Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Mrs. Wycoff, you have the L.A.P.D.'s deepest sympathies in this very difficult time.
Perhaps there's someplace we could talk in private?
Yes.
Lieutenant, she may not realize she did something wrong.
She may also have just strangled her husband.
She's a preacher's wife.
You have to approach her a certain way.
And you would know how to do that better than I would because?
Because when I was a kid, I went to church four times a week.
Four times a week?
Twice on Sunday, prayer meetings on Wednesday, choir practice on Friday.
All right.
All right.
You win.
But hurry up.
I'm not waiting here till Jesus comes back.
Mrs. Wycoff...
I know you're taking care of many people right now, and we will be sensitive to your spiritual obligation, but I also need you to be sensitive to your legal situation.
And it would help us out greatly if you could just tell us what happened to your husband today.
Clifford was, um, battling depression.
His faith was strong, but it...
Sometimes it's hard to know what God wants.
God didn't want this.
My husband hung himself in the garage at our house.
I am so very sorry.
I know how hard that must have been to say.
But, um...
Can you tell me why you didn't contact the authorities?
I should have, I know, but I didn't want anyone in the church to know.
Okay.
We can certify your husband's death.
But I need written consent to search your home and your garage.
- Okay?
- Thank you.
Here.
Let yourselves in.
I'm taking the family to church if you need me.
Of course.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I just came up with the pastor's most recent credit-card charge.
Uh, this guy didn't die at home, Lieutenant.
Starlight Motor Lodge.
He checked in at 10:00 a.m. this morning, and he still hasn't checked out.
Yeah, well, that depends on your point of view.
Also, someone made a call from the minister's room at the Starlight around 11:02 a.m., which would be just before the time of death.
Well, find out who that call went to, Mike.
Mm.
Yeah, Chief?
Um, we've got a situation.
Manager said the victim was a regular, Chief.
Held the room with a credit card and then paid with cash when he left.
Oh, the old cheater's trick.
So I hear.
Maybe he just needed a quiet place to reflect.
By the hour?
Get it all.
Make sure it gets all clean.
Hey, guys, hold up.
Hold up.
Shh.
What did you say?
Make sure it gets all cleaned up.
Stay back, Buzz.
I said make sure you empty the trash.
Sir, L.A.P.D.!
Drop it.
Drop the weapon.
- Drop the weapon!
- Dear God!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
What the hell?
!
Don't shoot!
We were just cleaning up.
Ma'am, put the spray cleaner down and step away from the sink.
- It's a hot-glue gun, Chief.
- A glue gun?
I just fixed that lamp, and now look at it.
Well, we have a pair of men's pants here, a, uh, shirt, belt.
Aha.
And what have we here?
Now, who does this belong to?
Y'all wouldn't happen to know a Pastor Cliff Wycoff, would you?
He was our son-in-law.
I'm going to let you in a little secret only my wife knows....
Your pastor's not perfect.
Jesus knows that I'm a sinner!
He loves me in spite of the fact that I'm human!
Pause it, Buzz.
What kind of a woman asks her parents to clean up the motel room where her husband was having sex?
Tao.
Looks like the pastor's lady friend left in a hurry.
Anything from the motel security cameras?
Strictly decoration, Chief.
Somebody for sure called his wife's cellphone from the motel room.
Chief, Flynn and Gabriel picked up Mrs. Wycoff and her family at their church --
Chief Johnson?
They're on their way back here, but, uh, there's a bit of an issue.
Okay.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I want to know the moment that the rest of the Wycoff family arrives, please.
Thank you.
So, why were you talking to Peter Goldman this morning?
Uh, Goldman pretended to be a process server, and he threw subpoenas all around the murder room, and I ordered him out.
I wasn't talking to him.
Because I understand he was trying to offer you a deal.
How do you know that?
Ugh!
Commander Taylor!
When, when, when are you going to get him out of my murder room?
I can't bear it.
Look, Will, I don't -- I don't even remember what Goldman was talking about.
Well, allow me to refresh your memory.
He was asking who was with you in the car when you dropped off Turell Baylor at his house.
Now, why would he be asking that?
Was something said in that car that could get us in even more trouble?
No.
Goldman served everyone a subpoena, except for Gabriel, to turn us against each other and make us all paranoid.
Gabriel didn't get served?
You think he's already talked to Goldman?
Paranoia part seems to be working.
Look, Will, this is all about me.
Not all about you.
I got subpoenaed, too, and I'm in this now up to my neck.
As is the city, the department, your entire division.
You know what?
The next time Goldman comes into your murder room, will you just go into your office and lock the door and call the city attorney?
Which is what you should have done this morning.
Or, better yet, find yourself a personal attorney.
Maybe he can make you understand how serious this has become.
Because nobody else is getting through to you.
Come in.
David Gabriel.
Chief.
Uh, Chief Johnson,
I have the rest of the Wycoff family waiting for you.
Thank you, David.
Chief, I know everyone thinks it's weird that I didn't get served, but I just want you to know I would never --
David, let's stop worrying about gossip and start concentrating on this case.
What were the Wycoffs doing when you found them?
Uh, yeah, well, when we finally caught up with them at the church, they were driving their minivan around the parking lot, running over computers.
So, this is what's left of the church's entire I.T. division.
This is what's left of my desk.
There's probably a record in there of our victim's little love connection.
Well, this looks like an organized hit.
But who did the organizing?
I'm ready to throw them all in jail.
I wish it were that easy.
What -- how did you get back in this building?
Oh, I never left.
And I'm sorry to disturb your...investigation here.
Just, uh, wanted to drop back by, see if you'd had a chance to think over my little proposal.
I have.
I propose you stand still, let Lieutenant Tao take your picture, and tell security to arrest you if you ever come back in this building again.
Get -- all right.
Okay.
Just...call me if you change your mind on the deal.
Detective Gabriel...
Looking sharp.
I-I-I have never, ever met that man in my life before today!
Well, he sure as hell knows you.
Hey, hey!
That's enough.
Now, we all know David.
We've worked with him for years.
He's a good guy.
He's a great cop.
And he's as loyal as they come.
- Or else he's a snitch.
- Man, what --
At any rate, he's the only one of us who hasn't been subpoenaed, so he must have done something right.
Thank you, Lieutenant Provenza, for that morale booster.
Meanwhile, I'd like to talk to Mrs. Wycoff.
Detective Gabriel?
Let's start with how you knew where to find your husband's body.
He, um...
He called me from that horrible motel to say goodbye.
The number showed up on my cellphone he told you he was going to kill himself?
I begged him not to, but he wouldn't listen to me.
Uh, after he hung up the phone,
I-I rushed over to find him, but...
It was too late.
He was hanging by his belt
From the sprinkler pipe.
He felt he'd let me down, his church down.
He let God down.
Well, you certainly let me down, Mrs. Wycoff, 'cause I allowed you to spend some quiet time with your family, and you used that time to destroy all your husband's computers from the church.
I did that, yes.
It was only to protect the members of our congregation.
Protect them from what?
Our members trusted my husband with their secrets.
The law doesn't recognize the confidentiality of Protestant ministers.
God does.
We may not have legal rights, but we have spiritual ones.
Those rights do not include having your parents sterilize the motel room where your husband died.
Here are a few things that they couldn't sweep under the rug.
Any idea how these came to be there?
I assume he was with another woman.
Someone he knew?
Or a prostitute, maybe?
Please, I'm begging you -- do not sensationalize my husband's suicide.
I'm not sensationalizing anything, Mrs. Wycoff.
But I absolutely need to find this woman who was with your husband at that motel room.
She ran away without her shoes and her underwear, and that worries me.
I don't even know if she's still alive.
Or should I be checking with another funeral home somewhere?
I wouldn't know.
It's in God's hands...
Not mine.
Boy, oh, boy!
They're all singing from the same hymnal.
Anybody say anything about the girlfriend?
Nobody knows nothing about nothing but suicide.
Mrs. Wycoff's orchestrated this whole thing.
She's practically daring me to arrest her.
You know what?
I say let her go.
Why?
So she can destroy more evidence?
No.
She doesn't think we're questioning her.
She thinks we're questioning her faith and her beliefs.
That's only gonna make her stonewall.
But if we back off, who knows?
Maybe she'll try to contact the other woman on her own or lead us to her body.
It's either that, or we try those red shoes on all the fair ladies of the land.
Excuse me, Chief.
Dr. Morales is ready for you.
Okay.
Thank you.
Uh, Lieutenant, I want 24-hour surveillance on every member of that family.
Can you arrange it, please?
Oh, love to.
Thank you.
Oh, and, uh, Detective Gabriel, I need you with me, please.
So, sir, did she say anything to you about what Goldman's proposal was?
No.
But whatever that asshole suggested, she's not letting Gabriel out of her sight.
In my opinion, the ligature wounds are consistent with the belt found at the scene.
So he did hang himself.
Only if he was somehow able to desperately scratch at his throat for air, severely bruise his knee, and, finally, sprain his ankle in the process.
That swelling had to happen before the guy died.
So you're saying there was a struggle.
I'm saying that, at some point, the victim found himself flailing on the floor.
So, what, the belt was being pulled one way...
And our victim was trying to pull it another, yes.
Doctor, what are these?
Oh, yes.
At first I thought those were broken blood vessels, but when I swabbed them, it appeared to be some kind of red dye.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.
Well, looks like we found Cinderella.
Yeah, but who turned him into a pumpkin?
Are you going to work?
Mm.
That was Detective Gabriel.
He's following the widow Wycoff to church this morning.
At 6:00 a.m.?
That's where she and her family go -- home and church, church and home.
That woman -- she honestly thinks she's somehow above the law, that the justice system just doesn't apply to her.
Speaking of which, did you ever contact that attorney Captain Raydor suggested to you?
No.
Kitty!
I mean Joel, Joel, Joel, Joel, off the table.
I really think you need an attorney.
Can't think about that right now.
I need to find someone who was with a minister who liked to wear women's underwear.
Oh.
Victoria isn't the only one with a secret.
How do you even know this minister was with anyone?
Someone killed him...
In a seedy motel room.
His wife -- his wife knows exactly who he was with, and she won't tell me.
She's more worried we'll find out her husband was a transvestite than she is about finding his killer.
People are weird.
She even had her parents scrub down the crime scene with bleach.
I mean, who does that?
!
Oh, my gosh!
They weren't just trying to wipe away fingerprints.
They were trying to wash away the sin.
That's it, isn't it?
They were shamed.
Just wait till I ask the widow Wycoff to help me find the person who was wearing that shoe.
Thought you already knew it was the pastor's.
Yeah, but she doesn't know I know that!
Watching me hunt for whose foot fits the ruby-red slipper might just make her realize she's not in Kansas anymore.
I love these heart-to-hearts we have in the morning.
Me too, honey.
Me too.
When I stepped down from the pulpit of this church and passed it on to my son-in-law,
I never imagined the pain of a day like today.
God uses suffering to test us.
Even in a death from despair, God offers us choices, asking if our faith is stronger than one leader, questioning whether this church is about one man or one God.
So, when you all are reaching out to our congregation, resist the temptation to sow gossip...
You have no right interrupting a confidential meeting of our stewardship committee.
I've thought of another way to find out who was with your husband when he died.
- Does this look familiar?
- What are you doing?
Put that away.
This shoe probably belongs to the woman with whom he was sleeping.
Chances are, she either witnessed or caused his death.
My husband committed suicide.
Pastor Wycoff's death is undetermined, and while it remains that way, I intend to try this shoe on every female in your congregation, ages 18 to 65, starting with the people on your stewardship committee.
You wouldn't dare.
No!
Please, please.
Mom, what's she saying?
Please do not go into this church terrorizing everybody.
What makes you think
I could possibly know who this woman was?
You destroyed all the computers your husband used here at the church, which gives us the idea he either met a woman online or was maintaining some sort of relationship with a woman online.
All right.
Please put that away.
Yes.
My husband went on the Internet.
He went on a site where he found some woman named Sindy Showers, spelled S-I-N-D-Y.
Thank you.
We'll check that out and get back to you.
Oh, I'm sure you will.
Chief Johnson...
Do you even believe in God?
Tell you what I do believe, Mrs. Wycoff.
"Thou shalt not kill."
Ma'am, that shoe won't fit anybody at this church.
How do you know that?
When my mom found my dad, she called me, and...
When I got to the motel, he was wearing that.
And he was dressed in women's underwear and a bra, and I helped her change him into a suit.
How do you explain the ligature marks on his neck.
Come on, Chris.
We're only trying to do right by your dad.
You've heard of the...
autoerotic thing people do?
Yeah, choking yourself while you're...
Yeah.
Your father did that?
My dad was on the floor with his belt around his throat.
And my mom rolled him over, and his hand was, uh...
It was, uh...
Can you really blame her for not wanting to talk about it?
Chief, I just got off the phone with Dr. Morales.
He says the autoerotic asphyxiation thing is possible, but he wanted to know if we'd found a release mechanism at the motel.
Not sure exactly what that is.
We didn't find one.
Wait -- what didn't we find?
Typically, chief, the autoerotic guy rigs up the choking device with a quick release to prevent accidental hanging.
And Wycoff only had his belt.
Not sure how that explains the sprained ankle.
Well, it's an awful lot to be doing in heels.
Sindy Showers is in interview room number 1.
Vice tracked her down to a website called "Who's Your Mommy?"
She doesn't want a lawyer if we promise not to arrest her for solicitation and lewd conduct.
Thank you, Commander.
David, here's how to end this whole subpoena nightmare.
Just call Goldman and tell him you want to talk.
Wouldn't that make me look bad?
How could you look any worse?
Ms. Showers, I'm Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
I just got a few questions for you regarding your safety.
My safety?
Yes.
We're trying to find someone who might be targeting...
Workers like yourself.
Oh.
Then okay, I guess.
Do you recognize this man?
You're not serious.
If you're worried about my safety, you've got the wrong guy.
I've known him for years, see him once every month or so.
Yesterday, as a matter of fact.
Did you know he's a member of the clergy?
No.
But that explains a few things.
Like?
Like every time we finish, he tries to talk me out of ever meeting him again, and he always wants us to pray for forgiveness.
I'm used to getting on my knees, but not for that.
Any other, um, unusual requests?
You mean the lingerie?
Not that unusual.
I mean, you wouldn't believe what some men try to pull.
This one guy, he takes about 30 toasted almonds and lines them up --
Off topic.
Off topic.
Okay, look, Cliffy pays me $300 for the hour, plus another $100 for the underwear and another $100 for the shoes.
So Cliffy likes to wear women's clothes.
You know what?
So do I.
Big deal.
He's not dangerous.
I-I've always felt safe with him.
Even when he asks you to cut off his air supply?
When he what?
Have you ever heard of autoerotic --
The choking thing?
Good God, no.
Not on my menu.
No blood, no bruises, no bondage.
I'm telling you, whatever this is, you got the wrong guy.
He likes to play dress-up.
It makes him happy.
Was he happy when you left him yesterday?
Why wouldn't he be?
Because, Sindy, we found Cliff in that motel room not long after you left, and he was dead.
What?
No.
Are you serious?
Now -- now you're scaring me.
That's...awful.
Dead how?
We're not sure exactly.
He may have committed suicide.
He didn't kill himself.
I can promise you that.
Cliff loved his family way too much to leave them behind.
You knew he was married?
Well, yeah.
Cliff told me that his wife wasn't into his whole dress-up thing at all.
So she let him handle it by hiring me.
So she knew all along?
Yeah.
Cliff said -- I-I think her name is Kate -- that Kate thought it was a little twisted, but as long as he didn't bring his bras and panties into the house, she could ignore it.
He -- he might have been a little different from my usual dates, but he didn't deserve to die in that motel room.
His wife hired a prostitute for her cross-dressing husband.
And not just once or twice.
Which means she also probably knew --
When it was his time of the month?
Uh, look, Chief.
If she was aware of what was going on for a while, then why was yesterday the breaking point?
And why would he call her in despair?
Good question.
But it shows up on the motel phone records.
Pastor Wycoff called his wife.
Or did he?
- Chief?
- Yes.
Chief?
What are we gonna say in those depositions?
Just the truth, I guess.
The truth.
Yeah.
But first, shouldn't we all agree as to what that is?
I do phone trees all the time, but very seldom do we get to put together an all-out matrix.
And this is every phone call between every family member?
Land lines and cells.
Everybody's calling everybody except the oldest son.
Isn't it funny how, in every family, there's always an odd man out?
What is that supposed to mean?
It means everybody knows that you've already said your piece to Goldman, and that's why he was here.
Wait, wait.
Who's "everybody" --
Provenza, Tao, and Buzz -- or is "Everybody" just you?
Oh, yeah, it's just me.
I'm the only one that --
Gentlemen, please stop this bickering!
This ridiculous lawsuit has nothing to do with you.
It's all about me.
Detective Sanchez, Detective Gabriel,
Lieutenant Flynn, I want a pair of shiny handcuffs slapped on Mrs. Wycoff.
Make sure her family knows so that they'll follow her down here.
Lieutenant Provenza, Lieutenant Tao, let's get this murder board out of here.
- Where to, chief?
- Interview room 2.
I don't want the Wycoffs seeing it before we're ready.
How long have you known your husband was a cross-dresser?
Just...a few weeks.
Really?
Because Sindy with an "S" told us that he dressed up for her once a month and that it was all your idea.
This is an attempt to destroy my church.
Have a seat, sir.
You presume, because I'm a Christian, thatI somehowclaimtobe-- no, no, no.
I presume that you're not proud of helping your husband commit adultery.
Judge not lest ye be judged.
I won't be the one doing the judging, Mrs. Wycoff.
There is more to marriage than fidelity.
It's about raising children.
It's about...
Um...
I did my best.
I did my best.
I really did my best.
I'm sure you did, but we need to talk about Sindy.
She said your husband was happy when she left the motel room at 10:55, so why did he want to die at 11:02?
Cliff was disgusted with himself.
He would come home from these terrible sessions and cry for forgiveness.
He hung himself.
Why is that so hard for you to understand?
Because if he was so ashamed, why did he kill himself dressed like that for all whole world to see?
Mrs. Wycoff, the coroner says your husband's wounds are consistent with murder by strangulation.
And we know that Sindy --
I told you, he called me from the motel.
But he didn't.
You keep lying to me, and I'm going to have to tell the media that your husband died wearing pink panties, a bra, and a new pair of pumps.
So, who called you from the motel?
If I tell you what happened, can you keep the prostitution and cross-dressing to yourselves?
We can try.
And will you leave my family out of it?
Because, honestly, this is all about me.
All about you?
I called my own phone to establish an alibi.
I killed him.
I snapped.
God forgive me.
I killed him.
What are you doing?
What is this?
Your daughter just confessed, sir.
- But you don't believe her!
- I certainly do.
- Oh, it's impossible.
- Kate didn't kill him.
- Let me tell you what happened.
- Daddy, be quiet.
You can't arrest her.
Actually, I intend to arrest your entire family -- the whole lying lot of you -- as accessories to murder after the fact.
So, now would be a good time to stop covering up for each other.
Detective Sanchez, read them their rights, please, starting with George here.
What are you doing?
This is crazy.
You have the right to remain silent, sir.
What did we do?
Besides obstruct justice and destroy evidence?
Let me show you.
...Will be appointed for you by the state.
Have you heard and understood these rights as they have been read to you, sir?
This is a, uh, matrix -- or a map, if you will -- of all the phone calls made around the time of your father's death.
Um, here is your mother calling from the motel to her own cellphone to make it look like she wasn't there -- very clever.
About 45 minutes later, she called your grandparents, who, in turn, called your little sister and brother to pick up your father's clothes from home, I assume.
And here's the call informing you that your father had --
wait a minute.
Lieutenant Tao, this is Chris Wycoff over here, and yet looks like no one called him.
- Could that be right?
- Yes, chief.
And yet you were at the motel.
How'd you even know your father was dead?
Skywriting?
I was pulling duty on base when I got the call.
No, you weren't.
We checked with your commander.
You asked for yesterday off two weeks ago.
Which makes this look a lot like premeditation.
Wait.
I'll tell you why I didn't get the call.
Ma'am, can we talk privately?
Lieutenant.
A couple weeks ago, my dad asked me to look at his computer at church.
He was having trouble with the wi-fi.
And I found a hidden e-mail account where this woman -- this prostitute -- was writing to him about their next meeting.
I had trouble believing it, so I followed him.
I wanted to confront him.
So, you watched him check into the motel, and you saw the prostitute come and go?
Exactly, and after she left,
I opened the door, and my dad was lying dead on the floor from the autoerotic --
No, no, no, no, no.
There was no autoerotic anything.
Well, it sure as heck looked like it.
I don't know.
M-maybe the prostitute killed him.
I d-
- I don't know.
He was paying her $500 an hour.
Why would she kill him?
Look, your mother just confessed to this murder.
I could take her word for it, Corporal.
Is that what you want?
Let your brother and sister grow up without both parents?
Maybe they'd be better off.
Your father led a double life, but your mom's the one who made it possible.
Lying.
Covering up for him.
Maybe she deserves to go to prison.
Hmm?
Is that what you're thinking?
In our house, we were taught,
"Honor thy father and thy mother."
If you so much as breathed wrong, you got the belt.
Did you ever breathe wrong?
When I was 15, my -- my dad, the man who taught me right from wrong, the guy who liked to wear women's lingerie...
He found a note from this boy that I knew in choir --
Jeff.
The two of us were, uh...
Jeff and I were close.
We were close.
And I saved that note in my room at the very back of my desk drawer.
It was none of my dad's business...
That note.
But he found it.
And he went crazy.
Went crazy how?
First he beat me.
The he shipped me off to military school.
And when I came home for Christmas,
I-I found out that my dad had brought that note over to Jeff's house and showed it to his parents and that...
My friend...
He'd killed himself.
Oh, and guess who preached at Jeff's funeral.
So when my dad opened that door yesterday, looking like some kind of freak...
And he started saying that it was only this once and that -- that we should just pray about it, and at least he wasn't gay.
You saw his belt.
Is that it?
You grabbed his belt?
Yeah, I grabbed his belt.
And what did you do?
It's time to do the honorable thing, Corporal.
I put it around his neck, and I yanked him all over the room.
And then?
Ma'am, I spent five years in Afghanistan.
I know when someone's dead.
I killed him.
And then I called my mother.
And I left him in his little outfit, thinking, "Well...
Now she'll finally see the truth."
But she already knew.
And I realized, while she was fussing with him, you know, taking off his bra, asking me to help knot his tie, that she had never once in all of my life stood up for anyone but him.
And for a moment there -- for a really bad moment --
I thought about killing her, too.
Ma'am...
I'm sorry to have lied to you about everything.
It was not the honorable thing to do, and I wish to apologize for having caused everyone so much trouble.
Well...
I don't deal much in forgiveness, Corporal.
But I sure am sorry to have to arrest you for murder in the first degree.
Hey, everyone.
Good to see you again.
I have to congratulate you guys on being a pretty tight little unit.
Detective David Gabriel...
You have been served.
Happy now?
It's what you asked for.
Ecstatic.
Thank you.
Now you know what it's like to be singled out by your own gang.
But seriously, don't thank me.
Thank Chief Johnson.
She's the one who put you all in the spotlight.
You asked to be subpoenaed?
It's only fair, right?
So, come on.
Give it up.
Show me some love.
I'm subpoenaed, too.
Welcome to the club.
No rats.
No rats here.
No rats.
Oh, thank you, Lieutenant.
I could have told you that, though.
Here we go!
Here we go!
Hey.
You're home early.
Rough day?
Sort of.
Baylors' attorney came back and subpoenaed Detective Gabriel, so that officially puts my entire division in hot water.
Ah.
Over a decision made by me and me alone.
What I'm wondering about now is, how much worse are things going to get?
I mean...
Really, how much worse?
A little worse, maybe.
What?
You too?
Why?
I volunteered to provide protective custody for his mom and sister. remember?
I'm -
- I'm so sorry.
Why?
Look, what did you do, really...
Except your job?
I-I-I drove Turell home, and I dropped him off.
And that's it.
That's it.
That's all.
I mean, there was no decision at all, really.
I don't know why we're being treated like this.
Oh, shoot, now look what I've done.
It's okay.
I got it.
Just a spill, hon.
What have I done?
There's no permanent damage.
I'll wipe it up.
Okay.
It's okay.
What have I done?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Shh.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What have I done?
What have I done?
What have I done?
What have I done?
What have I done?
What have I done?

People are naturally powerless.

Sorry to bother you.
Hey!
I wasn't finished.
You're at the top of his downsizing list.
I'm not worried about that!
Covering up the truth is what worries me.
You saw it too, right?
I saw it...
Did it look like a car-crash?
ESCAPE LEADS TO LETHAL ROAD ACCIDENT
In a year time eight criminal cases resulted in car-crash related deaths.
Exactly one year ago the International Airport Control Tower hostage taking.
15 days later the bus hijacking on the Meihan Expressway.

Here's conclusive evidence.
Oh yeah.
Show me baby.
Cut it out.
Don't film me.
Come on baby.

SUPREME PUBLIC PROSECUTORS ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
Once again, your boys went too far.
Just carrying out their mission.
The underworld is calling them the Wild 7.
The name serves as a deterrent to crime.
"Using criminals to eliminate criminals."
That's what you said, when I allowed your outside-the-law police unit to be formed.
Now, I'm regretting it.
The seven you chose are merely out of control ex-cons.
They could easily run off.
Some prosecutors consider their existence dangerous.
And yours as well, Kusanami.
If their lawless behavior escalates any further...
Then even as the Attorney General I could no longer cover for you.
If necessary...
I'll bury the seven.
After him!
Him again!
?
That's the second time, he's taken out our target.
They had one thing in common.
Both were members of the M-108 syndicate.
You follow?
Not a word.
Regardless of the refusal to pay their blackmail or not they killed them on a whim.
The real scum of the Earth.
Four M-108 members have been gunned down in the last six months.
Why is he killing them?
If you hadn't failed to catch him you could have asked him.
Who cares.
He's doing our dirty work for us.
Saving us the trouble.
He's killing bad guys.
He's just like us.
No, he ain't.

MINISTRY OF JUSTICE PUBLIC SECURITY UNIT
He's expecting you.
This way, sir.
PSU received a report that a super-hybrid virus was stolen from the Athena pharmaceutical lab facility.
This virus was developed in secret at our Ministry of Health.
The Defense Ministry and the U.S. military were active in the research.
National crisis situations that require absolute secrecy are fielded by the PSU.
In short crisis situations like this.
If an intruder enters, the system activates and goes into attack mode.
We've been expecting you.
This is Kiryu Keigo.
Please follow me.
Kiryu comes highly credited for his work at the PSU.
For the past 12 years, since the PSU was started he has been in charge of intel.
And this is former Metro Inspector...
Kusanami Masaru.
The future Super-intendent of Metro.
Your theory that criminals outside the law should be executed was the grounds for your supralegal hit-team, the Wild 7.
The perps demanded 200 million dollars in cash.
If not met with their demands they'll disperse the virus over the city.
A viral bomb has been set up on an airship.
The timer has been activated.
The timer reads 3 PM.
A mere 4.5 hours remaining.
The perps will only relinquish the code to deactivate the bomb once payment to a Cayman Island account is made and confirmed.
Could it be an idle threat?
To show the lethal potency of the virus this morning, they released it on a cargo vessel off the Manazuru peninsula.
The entire 15-head crew are dead.
Their location has been listed as unknown.
Under the pretext of a military exercise, the entire area has been sealed off.
It appears the virus was stolen from the Athena lab yesterday at 5 PM.
But the report came in this morning, correct?
While they decided what to do, the report may have been delayed.
Our vaccine stockpile is close to zero.
The vaccine is enroute from the U.S. but it won't reach us in time.
If we attempt to seize the airship the deal is off and the bomb will be detonated according to the terrorists.
Based on their MO, we view the crime as the doing of M-108 rogues.
The police can't be mobilized.
The government will balk at terrorism and accept their demands.
Even if they give in I don't foresee the bomb threat being fended off.
I agree.
The remote-control has a 5km range.
The transmission source has to be mobile.
Find a suspicious vehicle in the area.
The perps are M-108 rogues.
What if the airship gets blown up?
The deadly virus on board was developed by the U.S. military in secret with our government.
It's a level 4 virus.
It has a 90% infection and death rate.
What's that?
Mommy.
What is it?
An air balloon.
Wow.
Amazing.
Suspicious vehicle at Central Station!
Stolen vehicle.
Get to Central Station!
Hebopie, left flank!
They used the vaccine.
They're gonna release the virus.
They dumped their van!
Like a needle in a haystack.
The boss is a real slave driver.
In a crisis situation, I alone have clearance to use this specialized system.
All monitoring cameras across the nation can be controlled from here.
I have the authority to access all personal info.
We're cross-checking the data of everyone at the station.
The public is not aware of this.
They must never know that we have classified secrets like this.
With this system, PSU monitors and spies on all citizens.
What are you investigating?
I can't confirm the claim of the Self-Defense Forces training in the peninsula.
So?
The missing cargo vessel was last seen near the Manazuru peninsula.
Something's about to go down.
This is a no smoking zone.
Your phone.
It's the news desk.
Just hang up on them!
Hello...
No, he's not with me right now.
Get out of Tokyo.
Huh?
Get her out of town.
Huh?
What... who are you?
Listen up.
Do it now.
One more thing...
Yes?
Carry your own ash tray from now on.
Toudou?
Where did you go?
What are you doing?
The database found a match.
Michael Shibata from M-108.
Current location, the airport train concourse.
The airport train concourse.
Hebopie.
Down, down!
Incoming call from the Attorney General!
Kiryu here.
The government approved their demands.
The money's been wired.
Transfer confirmed.
Deactivate the bomb?
No need.
Let hell break loose.
The timer hasn't been deactivated!
Are they gonna escape?
Apprehend them.
Force them to deactivate the bomb.
Take them alive.
Force them to deactivate the bomb.
Cease fire!
Don't kill them!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot.
Nobody fire.
Move!
The only one who can disarm the bomb is me.
What's with the chick?
Three minutes left!
You're all gonna die.
So are you man.
Who the fuck is this chick!
?
We won't die.
We used the vaccine.
We'll take you with us.
Say Hiba...
Who are you pointing your gun at?
Disarm the bomb!
Move.
Hold your fire!
If you don't, millions will die!
I don't give a damn!
Disarm the bomb!
I'll kill you too!
What's going on?
Who do I shoot?
Hiba!
Shoot Hiba?
I'll kill all of you!
Shut the hell up!
He killed my family.
He stole my life.
I'll kill anyone who stands in my way!
One minute left.
What's this chick done?
Let's all die together.
He's alive!
Now that's being prepared.
The code now!
That vest won't save you now.
Start recovering the virus and bomb.
Ten years ago, at the Universal Square Bombing they robbed me of everything.
It was like a scene from hell.
I was the sole survivor.
To find the men responsible for the explosion and kill them myself.
I've lived to honor that pledge.
Then six months ago I found one of them.
From his cell phone I was able to identify four of the seven men and killed them.
I knew who you were...
So...
I got close to you.
That night...
While you were asleep, I rigged a tracking device to your cell.
I figured that following you would lead me to the remaining targets.
And I found the fifth man as planned.
But I couldn't do it myself.
Two targets remain.
My revenge has not yet been fulfilled.
Let... ..it go.
If you want to stop me...
You'll have to kill me.
If you want to shoot, go right ahead.
A fighting fish much like me, can only live in solitude.
And chances are she's not "living" either.
The bomb and virus have been recovered.
Fighting poison with poison.
Thanks to your Wild 7, any serious harm was prevented.
Yesterday, if the theft had been reported when it happened wouldn't the men on that ship have been saved?
I couldn't say.
What I do know is that an evil capable of snuffing out 15 lives with ease is part of the world we live in.
SYNDICATE MEMBERS DIE IN SHOOT-OUT
It's just like you said something serious did happen!
Toudou?
You think the Wild 7 were behind this?
Give it a rest already!
What's wrong?
Is your father...
I don't have a father.
Don't remember one anyway.
Oh, that's right.
My bad.
That came out of nowhere.
These are the stock trends of the U.S. drug company that created the vaccine.
As the crisis situation went public their stock went through the roof.
So what?
After the virus was stolen and the NY stock exchange opened someone purchased massive shares in their stock.
Once the stock sky-rocketed, he sold and made 2 billion yen.
What's that mean?
Beats me.
So somebody made a killing on the stock market, eh?
So they blackmailed the nation and made money on the market?
But, how do dead people sell their stock?
They don't.
It was someone with first-hand knowledge of the virus being stolen.
Kiryu from PSU knew.
Kiryu has made billions by using PSU intel on the market.
And this wasn't the first time neither.
There's been a time lag between the PSU reports and the moment the police is informed.
Huge stock deals took place in these cases as well.
Making big money by delaying PSU reports?
I envy the guy.
Tragedy might've been prevented.
A lot of people died 'cause of him!
What do you want us to do?
UNIVERSAL SQUARE BOMBING
UNIVERSAL SQUARE BOMBING Fire him already!
Fire him already!
Use your head and figure something out your damn self.
It's not our job.
He's just like the others.
Just another roach that needs to be exterminated.
So...
You're here too, eh?
I know what you've discovered and why you're here.
While you were day trading how much blood washed off on your hands?
I saved a 10,000 times more lives.
And merely claimed a suitable fee for all my work.
You truly believe that?
Protest all you want.
Neither the nation nor the media would listen to you.
Even playing them this conversation would be a waste of time.
I hold all the trump cards.
As you know, I control a secret weapon, the public can never know about.
But that's not all.
I control our nation's darkest secrets.
Political scandals, corporate leaks, trade secrets, intel on the underworld.
Secrets that would change the world, if ever they became public.
With this power who would dare touch me?
I don't live in fear.
I'm shielded by both the government and the crime organizations.
You still wish to defy me?
Is there any point to your work?
The Wild 7 are meaningless.
Evil never dies.
You can't kill it.
History has proven that much.
Therefor...
You must coexist with evil.
Like I do.
It's your call, Kusanami.
Let him walk.
Let him go, Hiba.
Hiba Dairoku, am I right?
Your background fascinates me.
You were in love with a woman.
A woman under the harrow of the mob.
You simply wanted to save her from the mob so you barged into their office, started a fight and ended up taking three lives.
Such lovely, innocent intentions makes me shed a tear.
But the part that really gets me...
Not long after, she took her own life.
You caused the death of the one you wanted to protect.
So you cut off all emotional ties.
And chose to live the life of a killing machine.
Trusting no one.
Loving no one.
But ironically...
Your heart has been rocked by another woman.
A waitress.
A hunter bent on revenge!
Leave her out of it.
On the contrary.
She's a loose cannon like all of you.
A criminal.
If arrested, she'll await the death penalty.
Or perhaps I should have you exterminate her for me?
Let go of me!
You can't protect her.
Portraying a true father figure.
Isn't that right, Sekai?
Smart boy.
If you keep up this nonsense your honest living reporter daughter might get hurt.
Damn you!
That's the spirit my son.
As vicious criminals, there is a use for you.
Like Pyro, who can create military grade bombs.
And Sox, a genius con artist and master of manipulation.
Or Oyabun, who was once the boss of 300 gangsters.
I know your darkest secrets.
All seven of you.
Never forget that.
You must never open Kiryu's Pandora's box.
For the sake of the nation.
I can't cover for you anymore.
Strike team to command.
Unable to confirm target!
All seven are on the run.
A crime unit called the Wild 7 are wanted by the police.
Their leader former-Metro Inspector Kusanami Masaru is already in custody.
ALL SEVEN MEN STILL AT LARGE Their leader former-Metro Inspector Kusanami Masaru is already in custody.
Got it, thanks.
Call you back.
What the hell's going on?
Calling the Wild 7 a crime ring?
Didn't the government create them?
All wanted criminals are men.
They escaped from prison.
Police.
Open up!
Honma Yuki!
Open up!
She's not here.
No sign of Honma Yuki.
Jump on.
They're violent felons after all.
They escaped as we feared all along.
This is a massive scandal.
The Wild 7 are still on the loose.
I can understand why the police are after me, but why you?
Did you screw up?
I don't care.
What are you gonna do?
What do you think?
Kill the two remaining men.
Now that they're after me, I can't waste anymore time.
Let it go.
Let it go.
Why did I survive?
So I could get revenge.
That's the only reason.
Your revenge won't be fulfilled once you've killed them.
What do you mean?
Kiryu from PSU?
Where is he?
He's not yours to kill.
Live your life.
A shoot-to-kill order for the Wild 7 is bound to happen.
According to my research the Wild 7 are an outside-the-law police unit created by our government.
But the nation's calling them criminals, right?
As the head of PSU, surely you would know why.
I don't see the need for me to comment.
You may leave now.
Let's get back to work.
Give up now?
Something's fishy.
We've located the Wild 7.
Damn fools...
I knew you were insane.
This proves it.
Look who's talking, old man.
You're crazy too.
Old man?
!
I may look...
Screw you!
You should both get your heads examined.
Our destination is set.
The semi won't stop.
All patrol cars join the pursuit.
Metro Police is ready to escort him.
Bring my car around.
It appears they're heading North East on Route 5.
What are they up to?
Completing their mission.
Their destination...
PSU.
They're insane, you know that.
The only one who can stop them is you.
Put a stop to them.
So we die as criminals?
Back to who we truly are.
It's me.
Commence with your mission.
The target is PSU Intel Chief...
Kiryu Keigo.
He's your only target.
Do not kill anyone else.
Copy that.
Let's blaze!
Their semi is heading for PSU.
All units join the pursuit.
The semi- truck is excellerating.
Full alert!
Mobilize SAT!
EMERGENCY!
EMERGENCY!
It might raise suspicion if we don't get going.
It regrets me to say...
I have a subordinate who can knock me out.
Forgive me, boss.
Third floor standing by!
Go!
Go!
Fall out!
Hurry!
The semi busted through the gate.
Ready!
Aim!
Raise shields!
Fall back!
Retreat!
Eat this!
Fire!
Engage!
After them!
Fall back!
Area G2 penetrated!
Just beyond the Intel Room.
Area G4 penetrated!
Everyone evacuate.
I said, get out!
Wild 7, can you hear me?
Tohto Newspaper reporter lwashita Kozue is held in the 3rd floor TC room.
She's in custody for being an ally of the Wild 7.
Your daughter?
Unless you surrender, she'll die.
Toudou!
Go after Kiryu.
I'll catch up.
It's a trap, Sekai!
You'll get killed.
It's my battle to fight.
- Move!
- It's madness!
It's suicide.
We can protect.
So it's a trap.
Heads we forget about the hostage and go after Kiryu.
Tails.
Anyone up for a detour?
Let's move out.
You cheating bastard.
Blow it up.
You got it.
You good for nothing machines!
The Wild 7 members and two accomplices besieged in flames in the TC room.
250 millimeters thick.
Four meters to your daughter.
Gotcha.
Bomb set.
Take cover!
Brace yourselves!
The Wild 7?
Kozue!
Terrorists and accomplices located.
Snipers!
How can we not kill 'em?
!
Just injure them.
From the frying pan into the fire.
Listen up...
When SAT enters, don't move.
Don't resist.
Let them take you in.
Are you her...
Look after Kozue for me.
Of course.
I'm counting on you.
Leave them to me!
Retreat!
Fall back!
Go get Kiryu!
Get in gear!
The terrorists have yet to make any demands.
Yukawa, can you hear me?
We appear to have received an update.
This breaking news just in.
Among the seven terrorists assaulting PSU one of them is said to have been killed by SAT.
Details on the identity of the man killed have yet to be released.
The objective of the terrorist's assaulting PSU remains unknown, correct?
- Switch!
- Gotcha.
BBQ!
Move in!
Move in!
You okay?
I got this!
Grenade!
Go on!
Hurry!
Take him into custody!
The fire shutter has closed.
Never expected you to get this far.
Don't move.
You'll be the dead before you can pull the trigger.
You can shoot me or tear me limb from limb...
I'll still pull this trigger.
Can you shoot with your body severed?
Let's test that theory.
Try me.
Why stop me?
Kiryu...
You were right all along.
It seems I'll have to obey you.
Kusanami, I knew you'd see the light.
And you know what would happen to the nation if you kill me.
So we're gonna let him walk?
I want you to erase all the data that was made public about me.
Trying to protect only yourself I see.
Don't do this.
I have no use for a broken machine!
I can always create another to replace you.
You're a malfunctioning machine.
It must be that woman's fault.
Pretending to be human was where you went wrong, you damn machine!
Keep living life never trusting or loving anyone.
That's more your style.
You were happy, right?
Yeah.
It was easier that way I guess.
But...
I can't let it go!
I wanna protect her!
Stop your babbling!
You criminal, you murderer!
That works for me, Kusanami.
From my point of view, you're a relevant person.
With a single keystroke, all data of you as leader of the Wild 7 will be erased.
Now we're partners.
I welcome you as a brother.
What's the big idea?
From my point of view you're the least relevant person.
What have you done?
I leaked your intel.
Vital intel hidden by the underworld about their power relationships.
You what?
Since only you can leak this intel, the underworld won't forgive you.
They'll hunt you down in a frenzy.
Without your trump cards nobody nationwide will protect you.
In fact they'll all wish you were dead.
You said that the existence of the Wild 7 was meaningless, didn't you?
I doubt the world will change by burying a little bad guy like yourself.
Still, we can't let evil live.
We can't coexist with evil.
You'll never get it, but that's what being human is all about.
And the men of the Wild 7 are more human than you'll ever be.
Get out of my face.
See how far you can run.
Today, charred remains were discovered, in an burned-out car by Tokyo Bay.
Police identified the body as...
PSU's Kiryu Keigo.
Police stated his body was badly beaten.
He was constrained and blown up.
From the cruelty and motive, it appears a crime group with a grudge...
I'm so confused.
What's going on?
It's over.
Kiryu fabricated the whole thing.
The Wild 7, everything.
Then who saved us?
SAT troops.
That's what they said.
But I saw those seven men.
The Wild 7 protected us.
They're phantoms.
The Wild 7 don't exist.
I don't care what you say.
I'm going to find the Wild 7.
I'll prove these outside-the-law crime avengers exist.
Knock yourself out.
Honma Yuki turned herself in.
She'll receive a death sentence.
We can't excuse murder no matter what.
Only the Wild 7 who exterminate evil can be pardoned.
You got nowhere else to go.
You seven that is.
A militia group has seized a satellite launch site.
SAT troops were completely devastated.
In 30 minutes, they'll launch a rocket at the Tokyo metropolitan area.
Authority in this case has been delegated to us.
Commence your mission.
[ Corrected by NagaLITE ]
People are basically powerless.
Like sand slipping through your fingers... anything precious vanishes.
I decided to live alone, never needing anyone.
Like a fighting fish who can only live alone.
But I don'!
know if I am living or not.

Wild 7!
As the press, we must expose their existence.
Sorry to bother you.
Hey!
I wasn't finished.
You're on the top of his downsizing list.
I ain't afraid!
Hiding the truth is what scares me.
You saw it too, right?
I saw it...
Did it look like a car crash?

No!
It's a government cover-up.
Oh...here
Pay attention!
You're constantly...
SUPREME PUBLIC PROSECUTORS, ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
Once again, your boys went too far.
Just carrying out their mission.
The underworld is calling them Wild 7.
The name serves as a deterrent to crime.
"Wipe out crooks with crooks."
ls what you said, when I allowed your above-the-law police unit to be formed.
Now, I'm regretting it.
The seven you chose are merely out of control ex-cons.
They could easily run off.
Some prosecutors consider their existence dangerous.
And your existence dangerous as well, Kusanami.
If their bad behavior escalates any further... even as Attorney General, I cannot cover for you.
If necessary...
I'll bury all seven.
After him!
Him again!
?
He's taken out our target twice now.
They had one thing in common.
Both are M-108 crime syndicate members.
You follow?
Not a word.
All who refused to pay... their blackmail or paid were killed on a whim.
Real "scum of the Earth".
Four M-108 men have been gunned down in six months.
Is he killing them?
It you hadn't tailed to catch him, I could have asked him myself.
Who cares.
He's doing our dirty work for us.
Saving us the trouble, right?
He's killing bad guys;
he's the same as us.
No, he ain't.
SEKAI:
Cop Killer, Jailbreak He's a murderer.

I'm the one who saved your miserable lite after... your emotions made you take three lives.
I don'!
remember asking for your help.
It I had my way, I'd send you back to death row but... streamlining you "execution machines" has cost time and money.

"Not one single person I wanna protect."
"Anything precious can't be protected."
What happened to you?
I killed four people.
What's your name?
Mine's Yuki.
Honma Yuki.
Hiba Dairoku.
Still here?
I ain't killing because of orders like I got no choice.
We're making this world a bit better place, right?
This world?
Everybody's got something precious...
they want to protect, right?
You ever really protected... something precious to you?
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE PUBLIC SECURITY UNIT
He's expecting you.
This way, sir.
PSU got a report that a super-hybrid virus was stolen from... the Athena pharmaceutical lab facility.
This virus was developed in secret at our Ministry of Health.
The Defense Ministry and the U.S. military were active in the research.
National crises that require total secrecy are fielded by the PSU.
In a word...
crisis situations like this.
It an intruder enters, the system activates and goes into attack mode.
We've been expecting you.
This is Kiryu Keigo.
This way.
Kiryu was highly credited for his work at the PSU.
For 12 years, since the PSU was started, he's been in charge of intel.
- And this is---
- Ex-Metro Inspector Kusanami Masaru.
The future Superintendent of Metro.
Your theory that "criminals above-the-law should be executed"... lead to you forming your supralegal hit team, Wild 7.
The perps demanded 200 million dollars in cash.
Otherwise, they'll disperse the virus over the city.
A virus bomb have been set on an airship.
The timer has been activated.
The timer reads 3 pm.
Only 4.5 hours remaining.
The perps will only relinquish the release code if payment to... a Cayman Island account is made and confirmed.
Maybe an empty threat?
To show what this lethal virus can do... this morning, they released it on this cargo vessel all the Manazuru peninsula.
All 15 crew are dead.
Their location has been listed as unknown.
Under the pretext of a military exercise, the area's been sealed off.
Seems the virus was stolen from the Athena lab yesterday at 5 pm.
But the report came in this morning, correct?
While they decided what to do, the report was probably delayed.
Our vaccine stockpile is almost zero.
The vaccine enroute from the U.S. but won't reach us in time.
If we attempt to seize the airship... the deal is oft and the bomb will be detonated according to the terrorists.
Based on their MO, we view the crime as the doing of M-108 rogues.
The police can'!
be mobilized.
The government will balk at terrorism and accept their demands.
Even it we give in, I don't foresee the bomb threat being fended off.
I agree.
The remote-control has a 5km range.
T he transmission source is mobile too.
Find a suspicious vehicle in the area.
The perps are M-108 rogues.
What if the airship gets blown up?
The deadly virus on board... was developed by the U.S. military in secret with our government.
It's a Ie vel 4 lethal virus.
It has a 90% disease and death rate.
What's that?
Mommy.
What is it?
An air balloon.
Wow.
Amazing.
Suspicious car at Central Station!
Stolen vehicle.
Central Station!
Hebopie, that way!
They used the vaccine.
They're gonna release the virus.
They dumped their van!
Like a needle in a haystack.
Our boss is a slave driver.
In a crisis, only I have clearance to use this specialized system.
All monitoring cameras in the nation... can be controlled here at PSU.
I have the authority to access all private info.
We're crosschecking the data of everyone in the station.
The public doesn't know.
They must never know that... we have classified secrets like this.
PSU monitors and spies on all citizens with this system.
What are you investigating?
I can'!
confirm the Self-Defense Forces claim to training by the peninsula.
$0?
The missing cargo vessel was last seen near the Manazuru peninsula.
Something serious is about to happen.
This is a no smoking zone.
Your phone.
It's the news desk.
Just hang "P!
Hello...
No, he's not with me right now.
Get out of Tokyo.
Huh?
Get her out of town.
Huh?
What...who are you?
Listen up.
Do it now.
One more thing...
Yes?
Carry your own ash tray.
Toudou?
Where are you?
What are you doing?
The database found a match.
Michael Shibata from M-108.
On the airport train concourse.
The airport train concourse.
Hebopie, down, down.
Incoming call from the Attorney General!
Kiryu here.
The government approved their demands The money's been wired.
Money confirmed.
Deactivate the bomb?
No need.
Let hell break loose.
The timer hasn't been deactivated!
Are they gonna escape?
Arrest them.
Make them deactivate the bomb.
Take them alive.
Deactivate the bomb.
Don'!
shoot.
Don't kill them.
Don'!
shoot.
Don'!
shoot.
Nobody fire.
Move it!
The only one who can disarm the bomb is me.
What's with the chick?
Three minutes to go!
You're all gonna die.
YOU 100 man.
Who is this girl!
?
We won't die.
We used the vaccine.
We'll take you with us.
Hiba, who are you pointing your gun at?
Deactivate the bomb!
Move.
Don't lire.
ll you do, millions will die.
I don't give a damn!
Stop the bomb!
I'll kill you I00!
What's going on?
Who do I shoot?
Hiba!
Shoot Hiba?
I'll kill you all!
Shut up!
He killed my family.
He stole my lite.
I'll kill anyone who tries to stop me!
One minute left
What's this chick done?
Let's all die together.
He's alive.
Now that's being prepared.
The code now!
That vest won'!
save you now.
Start recovering the virus and bomb
Ten years ago, at the Universal Square Bombing... they robbed me of everything.
It was like a scene from hell.
Only I survived.
Find the men who caused the explosion and kill them myself.
I've lived to honor that pledge.
Then six months ago...
I found one of them.
From the man's cell phone...
I found four of the seven men and killed them.
I knew who you were so...
I go!
closed to you.
That night... when you were sleeping, I rigged a tracking device to your cell.
If I followed you...
I thought I'd get even close to the remaining targets.
And I finally found the fifth man as planned.
But I couldn't do it myself.
Two targets remain.
My revenge isn't over.
Let... it go.
You'll have to...kill me to stop me.
If you wanna shoot, go ahead.
A fighting fish...
The same as me who can only live alone.
And she's probably not..
"living" either.
The bomb and virus has been recovered.
Fighting poison with poison.
Thanks to your creation, Wild 7, all harm was prevented.
Yesterday, it the theft had been reported when it happened... wouldn't the men on that ship have been saved?
I don't know.
What I do know is that evil... evil that can easily snuff out 15 lives... exists in this world.
CRIME GROUP MEMBERS SHOOT EACH OTHER TO DEATH
Just like you said, something serious did happen!
Toudou?
You think Wild 7 was behind this too?
Give it a rest.
What?
Is your father...
I don'!
have a dad.
Don't remember one.
Oh, that's right.
My bad.
That came out of nowhere.
Stock trends of the U.S. drug company that provided the vaccine.
Naturally, as the crisis went public, their stock went through the roof.
So what?
After the virus was stolen and the NY stock exchange opened... someone bought massive shares of their stock.
After the stock skyrocketed, he sold and made 2 billion yen.
What's that mean?
Beats me.
So somebody made a killing on the stock market, eh?
So they blackmailed the nation and made money on the market?
But, how do... dead people sell their stock?
Not them.
Someone who first knew the virus had been stolen.
Kiryu from PSU knew.
Kiryu has made billions by using PSU intel in the market.
And this wasn't the first time.
There's been a time lag between PSU reports... and when they are sent to the police.
Huge stock deals took place in these cases as well.
Making big money by delaying PSU reports?
I envy the guy.
Tragedy might've been prevented.
Too many victims died 'cause of him!
What do you want us to do?
UNIVERSAL SQUARE BOMBING 12/24/20012:44 PM
UNIVERSAL SQUARE BOMBING 12/24/20012:44 PM Fire him already!
Fire him already!
Use your head and figure something out your damn self.
It's not our job.
He's like the others.
Another roach that needs extermination.
So...you're here too, eh?
I know what you found... and why you're here.
While you were "day trading"... how much blood is on your hands?
But I saved a 10,000 times more lives.
And I've claimed a suitable fee for my work.
You believe that logic?
Protest all you want.
The nation and media won'!
talk to you.
Even playing them this conversation is a waste.
I hold... the trump cards.
As you witnessed, I control a secret weapon.
The public must never know.
But that's not all.
I control our nation's dark secrets.
Political scandals, corporate leaks, trade secrets, intel on the underworld.
Secrets that would change our world it they got out.
With this intel, who can touch me?
I don'!
live in fear.
I'm shielded by the government and all crime organizations.
Yet still you defy me?
Is there any point to your work?
Wild 7 is meaningless.
Evil never dies.
You can'!
kill it.
History has proven that much.
So... you coexist with evil.
Like I have done.
Kusanami, it's your call.
Let him walk.
Hiba, let it go.
Hiba Dairoku, right?
Your background fascinates me.
You were in love with a certain woman.
A woman under the harrow of the mob.
You simply wanted to save that woman from the mob so... you barged into their office, started a fight... and you took three lives.
Such lovely, innocence makes me cry.
But this is the part that gets me.
Right after that, she took her own life.
You caused the death of who you wanted to protect most.
So you've cut off all emotional ties.
And lived your life as a killing machine.
Trusting no one.
Loving no one.
But, strangely enough... your heart has been rocked by another woman.
A waitress
A hunter bent on revenge.
Leave her out of it.
Quite the opposite.
She's a loose cannon like you all.
A criminal.
If arrested, she'll get the death penalty.
Or shall I have you exterminate her for me?
Let me go.
You can'!
protect her.
Just like a true father.
Right, Sekai?
Smart boy.
Keep up this nonsense and... your honest living reporter daughter might get hurt.
You!
That's the spirit son.
As vicious criminals, there is a use for you.
Like Pyro, who can create bombs like the military.
Or Sox, a genius con artist who can manipulate people.
Or Oyabun, who was the boss of 300 gangsters.
I know your darkest secrets.
You seven.
Never forget that.
You must never open Kiryu's Pandora's box.
For the nation.
I can'!
cover for you any more.
Strike team to command, unable to confirm target!
All seven on the run.
A crime unit called Wild 7 are wanted by the police.
Their ringleader ex-Metro Inspector Kusanami Masaru is in custody.
ALL SEVEN MEN STILL AT LARGE Their ringleader ex-Metro Inspector Kusanami Masaru is in custody.
ALL SEVEN MEN STILL AT LARGE
I got it.
Thanks.
Call you back.
What is going on?
Calling Wild 7 a crime ring?
The government didn't create them?
All wanted criminals are men.
They escaped from prison.
Police.
Open up.
Honma Yuki!
Open up.
Not here.
No sign of Honma Yuki.
Get on.
They're violent felons after all.
They escaped as we feared all along.
This is a massive scandal.
Wild 7 are still an the loose.
I can see why the police are after me, but why you?
Did you screw up?
I don'!
care.
What are you gonna do?
What else.
Kill the two remaining men.
Now that they're after me, I can't waste time.
Let it go.
Let it go.
Why did I have to survive?
So I could get revenge.
That's the only reason.
Your revenge won'!
end even if you kill them.
What do you mean?
Kiryu from PSU?
Where is this man?
He's not yours to kill.
Live your life.
A shoal-to-kill order for Wild 7 is bound to happen.
According to my research, Wild 7 is... an above-the-law police unit in our government.
But the nation's calling them criminals, right?
As the head of PSU, surely you know why.
I don't see the need for me to comment.
You may leave now.
Let's get back to work.
Give up now?
Something's fishy.
We located Wild 7.
Damn fools...
I knew you were insane.
This proves it.
Look who's talking, old man.
You're crazy too.
Old man?
I may look---
Screw you!
Get your heads examined.
Our destination is set.
The semi-truck won'!
stop.
All patrol cars join the pursuit.
Metro Police is ready to take him.
Bring my car around.
Seems they're heading North East on Route 5.
They're up to something, right?
Completing their mission.
Their destination...
PSU.
They're not sane, you know.
The only one who can stop them is you.
Stop them.
So we die as criminals?
Just back to who we are.
It's me.
Start your mission.
The target is PSU Intel Chief...
Kiryu Keigo.
He is your only target.
Do not kill anyone else.
Copy that.
Let's rampage.
Their semi-truck is heading for PSU.
All units join the pursuit.
The semi-truck is gaining speed.
Full alert!
Mobilize SAT!
EMERGENCY!
EMERGENCY!
It might look suspicious if we don'!
get going.
I sure regret...having a subordinate who can punch me out.
Sorry boss.
Third floor standing by.
Go!
Go!
Fall out!
Hurry!
The semi-truck busted through the gate.
Ready!
Airn!
Shields up!
Fall back!
Retreat!
Eat this!
Fire!
Engage!
After them!
Fall back!
Area G2 penetrated!
Just past the Intel Room.
Area G4 penetrated!
Everyone evacuate.
I said "out!"
Wild 7, can you hear me?
Tohto Newspaper reporter Iwashila Kazue is held in the 3rd floor T C room.
In custody as a Wild 7 ally.
Your daughter?
It you don'!
surrender, she'll die.
Toudou!
Go after Kiryu.
I'll catch up.
It's a trap, Sekai!
You'll get killed.
It's my battle to fight.
- Move it.
- It's madness.
It's suicide.
We can protect.
So it's a trap.
Heads we forget about the hostage and... go for Kiryu.
Tails.
Detour anyone?
Move out.
You cheating bastard.
Blow it up.
You got it.
You good-for-nothing machines!
Wild 7 members and two accomplices... besieged in flames in the TC room.
250 millimeters thick.
Four meters to your daughter.
Gotcha.
Bomb set.
Get back.
Brace yourself.
Wild...7?
Kozue!
Terrorists and accomplices located.
Snipers!
How can we not kill 'em?
Just wound them.
From bad to worse.
Listen.
If SAT enters, don'!
move.
Don't resist.
Let them take you.
Are you her...
Take care of Kozue for me.
Sure.
I'm counting on you.
Leave them to me!
Retreat!
Fall back!
Go gel Kiryu!
Get in gear!
T he terrorists have made no demands yet.
Yukawa, can you hear me?
We seem to have an update.
This breaking news just in.
Among the seven terrorists attacking PSU... one of them has been killed by SA T.
Details on the man killed have yet to be announced.
The terrorist's objective in attacking PSU is still unkna wn, right?
- Switch.
- Gotcha.
BBQ.
Go!
Go!
You Okay?
I got this!
Grenade!
NOW go!
Hurry!
Take him into custody!
The fire shutter has closed.
Never thought you'd get this far.
Don'!
move.
Before you pull the trigger, I'll shoot you down dead.
Shoot me down or tear me limb from limb...
I will pull this trigger.
Can you shoot with your body in pieces?
Wanna test me?
Try me.
Whv slop me?
Kiryu... what you said is correct after all.
Seems I have to obey you.
Kusanami, I knew you'd see the light.
And you know what could happen to our nation if you kill me.
So we let him walk?
I want you to alter all data that has been... made public about me.
Trying to protect only yourself I see.
Don't.
I go!
no use for a broken machine.
I can always create more to replace you.
You're a malfunctioning machine.
It must be that woman's fault.
Trying to feel human was where you went wrong, you machine.
Keep living life never trusting anyone, never loving anyone.
That's more your style.
Happy, right?
Yeah.
It was easier that way I guess.
But...
I can't let it go.
I want to protect her!
Stop your babbling!
You criminal, murderer!
That works for me, Kusanami.
From my point of view, you're a necessary person.
With one key stroke all data of you as ringleader of Wild 7 will be deleted.
Now...we're partners.
I welcome you as a brother.
What's the big idea?
From my point of view... you're the least necessary person.
What have you done?
I leaked your intel.
Vital intel hidden by the underworld about their power relationships.
You what?
Since only you can leak this intel, the underworld won't forgive you.
They'll hunt you down in a frenzy.
Without your trump cards... nobody in the nation will protect you.
In fact, they'll wish you were dead.
You said...
that the existence of Wild 7... was meaningless, didn't you?
I doubt the world will change by burying a little bad guy like yourself.
Still, we can'!
let evil lie.
We can't coexist with evil.
You'll never get it, but that's what being human is.
And the men of Wild 7... are more human than you'll ever be.
Get out of my face.
See how long you can run.
Today, charred remains were found in an exploded car by Tokyo Bay.
Police identified the body as...
PSU's Kiryu K eigo.
Police say his body was badly beaten.
He was incarcerated and blown up.
From the cruelty and motive, it seems a crime group with a grudge...
I'm completely mixed up.
No idea what is going on.
It's over.
Kiryu fabricated it all.
The Wild 7, everything.
Then who saved us?
SAT troops.
That's what they said.
But I saw those seven men.
Wild 7 protected us.
They're phantoms.
Wild 7 doesn't exist.
I don't care what you say.
I'm going to find Wild 7.
I'll prove these above-the-law crime avengers exists.
Knock yourself out.
Honma Yuki turned herself in.
She'll get a death sentence.
We can't pardon murder no matter what.
Only those who exterminate evil can be pardoned.
Only Wild 7.
You got no other place to live.
You seven...that is.
A militia group has seized a satellite launch site.
SA T troops were completely devastated.
In 30 minutes, they'll launch a rocket at the Tokyo metropolitan area.
Authority has been delegated to us in this case.
Start your mission now.
People are basically powerless.
Like sand slipping through your fingers... anything precious vanishes.
I decided to live alone, never needing anyone.
Like a fighting fish who can only live alone.
But I don't know if I am living or not.
HQ to all units.
From the current crisis, we confirm:
6 Tango and 36 Hotel...

Banking hours are over.

Exterminated?

Like I said..."exterminated".
What's going on?
It's them.
Their work.

Wild...7.
SUPRALEGAL POLICE UNIT EXECUTES BAD GUYS
ALL SEVEN ARE EX-CONS
ALIAS wild 7
IS METRO POLICE ORDERING THEIR MISSIONS?
GOVERNMENT COVER-UP?
DEATHS RULED AN ACCIDENT
ABOVE-THE-LAW POLICE UNIT
It was no "accident".
I saw it.
I admire your wild imagination.
What happened to my story?
We can't print it.
They exist!
Wild 7!
As the press, we must expose their existence.
Sorry to bother you.
Hey!
I wasn't finished.
You're on the top of his downsizing list.
I ain't afraid!
Hiding the truth is what scares me.
You saw it too, right?
I saw it...
Did it look like a car crash?
ESCAPE LEADS TO AUTO ACCIDENT DEATHS
ESCAPE LEADS TO AUTO ACCIDENT DEATHS In one year, eight cases of criminals suddenly dying in car accidents!
In one year, eight cases of criminals suddenly dying in car accidents!
Exactly one year ago, the International Airport Control Tower Take Over!
15 days later, the Meihan Expressway Bus Hijacking!
You've shown me many times.
Here's conclusive evidence!
Oh yeah.
Show me baby.
Hey, don't.
Don't film me.
Come on baby.
What the...
What's that?
No way.
They're dead.
What now?
It's the same seven.
It's out of focus.
Can't see at thing.
wild 7 exist?
It's out of focus.
Can't see at thing.
This is Wild 7.
When anything gets uploaded, it gets deleted.
A hoax, right?
No!
It's a government cover-up.
Oh...here.
Pay attention!
You're constantly...
SUPREME PUBLIC PROSECUTORS, ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
Once again, your boys went too far.
Just carrying out their mission.
The underworld is calling them Wild 7.
The name serves as a deterrent to crime.
"Wipe out crooks with crooks."
Is what you said, when I allowed your above-the-law police unit to be formed.
Now, I'm regretting it.
The seven you chose are merely out of control ex-cons.
They could easily run off.
Some prosecutors consider their existence dangerous.
And your existence dangerous as well, Kusanami.
If their bad behavior escalates any further... even as Attorney General, I cannot cover for you.
If necessary...
I'll bury all seven.
After him!
Him again!
?
He's taken out our target twice now.
They had one thing in common.
Both are M-108 crime syndicate members.
You follow?
Not a word.
All who refused to pay... their blackmail or paid were killed on a whim.
Real "scum of the Earth".
Four M-108 men have been gunned down in six months.
Is he killing them?
If you hadn't failed to catch him, I could have asked him myself.
Who cares.
He's doing our dirty work for us.
Saving us the trouble, right?
He's killing bad guys;
he's the same as us.
No, he ain't.
SEKAI:
Cop Killer, Jailbreak He's a murderer.
SEKAI:
Cop Killer, Jailbreak
SEKAI:
Cop Killer, Jailbreak The same thing.
Nope, he's better off than us.
We're ex-cons following orders to kill.
But you're enjoying the exterminating, Hiba.
PYRO:
Serial Bomber Running wild, playing police, is great shit man.
Don't call me a cop!
Even us yakuza bosses..
have a code of honor.
OYABUN:
Former Yakuza Family Boss I'm doing what the worthless police can't.
Cops or criminals?
SOX:
Genius Confidence Man
SOX:

We're cleaning out the gutter with no end in sight.
We ain't no use to nobody;
plenty would take our place.
Replaceable at best.
I don't give a damn what you think or how you live.
Simply execute your mission to the letter.
Can't admit to being the head of a garbage crew?
I'm the one who saved your miserable life after... your emotions made you take three lives.
I don't remember asking for your help.
If I had my way, I'd send you back to death row but... streamlining you "execution machines" has cost time and money.
Far from being worth my while.
Machines should live like machines.
Don't ponder your function in life like ordinary people.
We ain't.
HIBA:
Murderer
What's with the act?
You know me, don't you?
Huh?
We've met once.
On the expressway.
Is that a new pickup line?
Get real.
Got the wrong person.
Sorry.
Hold on.
Now, I'm late for work.
You on the motorcycle!
Pull over!
Busted!
Drive faster!
Pull over now!
Just in time!
Later.
Help me with my tips.
I...
Did we...
I washed your shirt for you.
Don't get any ideas about us.
Wash up and go home.
You got a family?
Not since I was born.
"No friends, no lovers," right?
You said so when you were drunk.
"Not one single person I wanna protect."
"Anything precious can't be protected."
What happened to you?
I killed four people.
What's your name?
Mine's Yuki.
Honma Yuki.
Hiba Dairoku.
Still here?
I ain't killing because of orders like I got no choice.
We're making this world a bit better place, right?
This world?
Everybody's got something precious...
they want to protect, right?
You ever really protected... something precious to you?
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE PUBLIC SECURITY UNIT
He's expecting you.
This way, sir.
PSU got a report that a super-hybrid virus was stolen from... the Athena pharmaceutical lab facility.
This virus was developed in secret at our Ministry of Health.
The Defense Ministry and the U.S. military were active in the research.
National crises that require total secrecy are fielded by the PSU.
In a word...
crisis situations like this.
If an intruder enters, the system activates and goes into attack mode.
We've been expecting you.
This is Kiryu Keigo.
This way.
Kiryu was highly credited for his work at the PSU.
For 12 years, since the PSU was started, he's been in charge of intel.
- And this is,
- Ex-Metro Inspector Kusanami Masaru.
The future Superintendent of Metro.
Your theory that "criminals above-the-law should be executed"... lead to you forming your supralegal hit team, Wild 7.
The perps demanded 200 million dollars in cash.
Other wise, they'll disperse the virus over the city.
A virus bomb have been set on an airship.
The timer has been activated.
The timer reads 3 pm.
Only 4.5 hours remaining.
The perps will only relinquish the release code if payment to... a Cayman Island account is made and confirmed.
Maybe an empty threat?
To show what this lethal virus can do... this morning, they released it on this cargo vessel off the Manazuru peninsula.
All 15 crew are dead.
Their location has been listed as unknown.
Under the pretext of a military exercise, the area's been sealed off.
Seems the virus was stolen from the Athena lab yesterday at 5pm.
But the report came in this morning, correct?
While they decided what to do, the report was probably delayed.
Our vaccine stockpile is almost zero.
The vaccine enroute from the U.S. but won't reach us in time.
If we attempt to seize the airship... the deal is off and the bomb will be detonated according to the terrorists.
Based on their MO, we view the crime as the doing of M-108 rogues.
The police can't be mobilized.
The government will balk at terrorism and accept their demands.
Even if we give in, I don't foresee the bomb threat being fended off.
I agree.
The remote-control has a 5km range.
The transmission source is mobile too.
Find a suspicious vehicle in the area.
The perps are M-108 rogues.
What if the airship gets blown up?
The deadly virus on board... was developed by the U.S. military in secret with our government.
It's a level 4 lethal virus.
It has a 90% disease and death rate.
What's that?
Mommy.
What is it?
An air balloon.
Wow.
Amazing.
Suspicious car at Central Station!
Stolen vehicle.
Central Station!
Hebopie, that way!
They used the vaccine.
They're gonna release the virus.
They dumped their van!
Like a needle in a haystack.
Our boss is a slave driver.
In a crisis, only I have clearance to use this specialized system.
All monitoring cameras in the nation... can be controlled here at PSU.
I have the authority to access all private info.
We're crosschecking the data of everyone in the station.
The public doesn't know.
They must never know that... we have classified secrets like this.
PSU monitors and spies on all citizens with this system.
What are you investigating?
I can't confirm the Self-Defense Forces claim to training by the peninsula.
So?
The missing cargo vessel was last seen near the Manazuru peninsula.
Something serious is about to happen.
This is a no smoking zone.
Your phone.
It's the news desk.
Just hang up!
Hello...
No, he's not with me right now.
Get out of Tokyo.
Huh?
Get her out of town.
Huh?
What...who are you?
Listen up.
Do it now.
One more thing...
Yes?
Carry your own ash tray.
Toudou?
Where are you?
What are you doing?
The database found a match.
Michael Shibata from M-108.
On the airport train concourse.
The airport train concourse.
Hebopie, down, down.
Incoming call from the Attorney General!
Kiryu here.
The government approved their demands.
The money's been wired.
Money confirmed.
Deactivate the bomb?
No need.
Let hell break loose.
The timer hasn't been deactivated!
Are they gonna escape?
Arrest them.
Make them deactivate the bomb.
Take them alive.
Deactivate the bomb.
Don't shoot.
Don't kill them.
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
Nobody fire.
Move it!
The only one who can disarm the bomb is me.
What's with the chick?
Three minutes to go!
You're all gonna die.
You too man.
Who is this girl!
?
We won't die.
We used the vaccine.
We'll take you with us.
Hiba, who are you pointing your gun at?
Deactivate the bomb!
Move.
Don't fire.
If you do, millions will die.
I don't give a damn!
Stop the bomb!
I'll kill you too!
What's going on?
Who do I shoot?
Hiba!
Shoot Hiba?
I'll kill you all!
Shut up!
He killed my family.
He stole my life.
I'll kill anyone who tries to stop me!
One minute left.
What's this chick done?
Let's all die together.
He's alive.
Now that's being prepared.
The code now!
That vest won't save you now.
Start recovering the virus and bomb.
Ten years ago, at the Universal Square Bombing.... they robbed me of everything.
It was like a scene from hell.
Only I survived.
Find the men who caused the explosion and kill them myself.
I've lived to honor that pledge.
Then six months ago...
I found one of them.
From the man's cell phone...
I found four of the seven men and killed them.
I knew who you were so...
I got closed to you.
That night... when you were sleeping, I rigged a tracking device to your cell.
If I followed you...
I thought I'd get even close to the remaining targets.
And I finally found the fifth man as planned.
But I couldn't do it myself.
Two targets remain.
My revenge isn't over.
Let... it go.
You'll have to...kill me to stop me.
If you wanna shoot, go ahead.
A fighting fish...
The same as me who can only live alone.
And she's probably not...
"living" either.
The bomb and virus has been recovered.
Fighting poison with poison.
Thanks to your creation, Wild 7, all harm was prevented.
Yesterday, if the theft had been reported when it happened... wouldn't the men on that ship have been saved?
I don't know.
What I do know is that evil... evil that can easily snuff out 15 lives... exists in this world.
crime GROUP MEMBERS SHOOT EACH OTHER TO DEATH
Just like you said, something serious did happen!
Toudou?
You think Wild 7 was behind this too?
Give it a rest.
What?
Is your father...
I don't have a dad.
Don't remember one.
Oh, that's right.
My bad.
That came out of nowhere.
Stock trends of the U.S. drug company that provided the vaccine.
Naturally, as the crisis went public, their stock went through the roof.
So what?
After the virus was stolen and the NY stock exchange opened... someone bought massive shares of their stock.
After the stock skyrocketed, he sold and made 2 billion yen.
What's that mean?
Beats me.
So somebody made a killing on the stock market, eh?
So they blackmailed the nation and made money on the market?
But, how do... dead people sell their stock?
Not them.
Someone who first knew the virus had been stolen.
Kiryu from PSU knew.
Kiryu has made billions by using PSU intel in the market.
And this wasn't the first time.
There's been a time lag between PSU reports... and when they are sent to the police.
Huge stock deals took place in these cases as well.
Making big money by delaying PSU reports?
I envy the guy.
Tragedy might've been prevented.
Too many victims died because of him!
What do you want us to do?
UNIVERSAL SQUARE BOMBING 12/24/2001 2:44PM
universal SQUARE BOMBING 12/24/2001 2:44PM Fire him already!
Fire him already!
Use your head and figure something out your damn self.
It's not our job.
He's like the others.
Another roach that needs extermination.
So...you're here too, eh?
I know what you found... and why you're here.
While you were "day trading"... how much blood is on your hands?
But I saved a 10,000 times more lives.
And I've claimed a suitable fee for my work.
You believe that logic?
Protest all you want.
The nation and media won't talk to you.
Even playing them this conversation is a waste.
I hold... the trump cards.
As you witnessed, I control a secret weapon.
The public must never know.
But that's not all.
I control our nation's dark secrets.
Political scandals, corporate leaks, trade secrets, intel on the underworld.
Secrets that would change our world if they got out.
With this intel, who can touch me?
I don't live in fear.
I'm shielded by the government and all crime organizations.
Yet still you defy me?
Is there any point to your work?
Wild 7 is meaningless.
Evil never dies.
You can't kill it.
History has proven that much.
So... you coexist with evil.
Like I have done.
Kusanami, it's your call.
Let him walk.
Hiba, let it go.
Hiba Dairoku, right?
Your background fascinates me.
You were in love with a certain woman.
A woman under the harrow of the mob.
You simply wanted to save that woman from the mob so... you barged into their office, started a fight... and you took three lives.
Such lovely, innocence makes me cry.
But this is the part that gets me.
Right after that, she took her own life.
You caused the death of who you wanted to protect most.
So you've cut off all emotional ties.
And lived your life as a killing machine.
Trusting no one.
Loving no one.
But, strangely enough... your heart has been rocked by another woman.
A waitress.
A hunter bent on revenge.
Leave her out of it.
Quite the opposite.
She's a loose cannon like you all.
A criminal.
If arrested, she'll get the death penalty.
Or shall I have you exterminate her for me?
Let me go.
You can't protect her.
Just like a true father.
Right, Sekai?
Smart boy.
Keep up this nonsense and... your honest living reporter daughter might get hurt.
You!
That's the spirit son.
As vicious criminals, there is a use for you.
Like Pyro, who can create bombs like the military.
Or Sox, a genius con artist who can manipulate people.
Or Oyabun, who was the boss of 300 gangsters.
I know your darkest secrets.
You seven.
Never forget that.
You must never open Kiryu's Pandora's box.
For the nation.
I can't cover for you anymore.
Strike team to command, unable to confirm target!
All seven on the run.
A crime unit called Wild 7 are wanted by the police.
Their ringleader ex-Metro Inspector Kusanami Masaru is in custody.
ALL SEVEN MEN STILL AT LARGE Their ringleader ex-Metro Inspector Kusanami Masaru is in custody.
ALL SEVEN MEN STILL AT LARGE
I got it.
Thanks.
Call you back.
What is going on?
Calling Wild 7 a crime ring?
The government didn't create them?
All wanted criminals are men.
They escaped from prison.
Police.
Open up.
Honma Yuki!
Open up.
Not here.
No sign of Honma Yuki.
Get on.
They're violent felons after all.
They escaped as we feared all along.
This is a massive scandal.
Wild 7 are still on the loose.
I can see why the police are after me, but why you?
Did you screw up?
I don't care.
What are you gonna do?
What else.
Kill the two remaining men.
Now that they're after me, I can't waste time.
Let it go.
Let it go.
Why did I have to survive?
So I could get revenge.
That's the only reason.
Your revenge won't end even if you kill them.
What do you mean?
Kiryu from PSU?
Where is this man?
He's not yours to kill.
Live your life.
A shoot-to-kill order for Wild 7 is bound to happen.
According to my research, Wild 7 is... an above-the-law police unit in our government.
But the nation's calling them criminals, right?
As the head of PSU, surely you know why.
I don't see the need for me to comment.
You may leave now.
Let's get back to work.
Give up now?
Something's fishy.
We located Wild 7.
Damn fools...
I knew you were insane.
This proves it.
Look who's talking, old man.
You're crazy too.
Old man?
I may look,
Screw you!
Get your heads examined.
Our destination is set.
The semi-truck won't stop.
All patrol cars join the pursuit.
Metro Police is ready to take him.
Bring my car around.
Seems they're heading North East on Route 5.
They're up to something, right?
Completing their mission.
Their destination...
PSU.
They're not sane, you know.
The only one who can stop them is you.
Stop them.
So we die as criminals?
Just back to who we are.
It's me.
Start your mission.
The target is PSU Intel Chief...
Kiryu Keigo.
He is your only target.
Do not kill anyone else.
Copy that.
Let's rampage.
Their semi-truck is heading for PSU.
All units join the pursuit.
The semi-truck is gaining speed.
Full alert!

Wild 7, can you hear me?
Tohto Newspaper reporter Iwashita Kozue is held in the 3rd floor TC room.
In custody as a Wild 7 ally.
Your daughter?
If you don't surrender, she'll die.
Toudou!
Go after Kiryu.
I'll catch up.
It's a trap, Sekai!
You'll get killed.
It's my battle to fight.
- Move it.
- It's madness.
It's suicide.
We can protect.
So it's a trap.
Heads we forget about the hostage and... go for Kiryu.
Tails.
Detour anyone?
Move out.
You cheating bastard.
Blow it up.
You got it.
You good-for-nothing machines!
Wild 7 members and two accomplices... besieged in flames in the TC room.
250 millimeters thick.
Four meters to your daughter.
Gotcha.

Kozue!
Terrorists and accomplices located.
Snipers!
How can we not kill 'em?
Just wound them.
From bad to worse.
Listen.
If SAT enters, don't move.
Don't resist.
Let them take you.
Are you her...
Take care of Kozue for me.
Sure.
I'm counting on you.
Leave them to me!
Retreat!
Fall back!
Go get Kiryu!
Get in gear!
The terrorists have made no demands yet.
Yukawa, can you hear me?
We seem to have an update.
This breaking news just in.
Among the seven terrorists attacking PSU... one of them has been killed by SAT.
Details on the man killed have yet to be announced.
The terrorist's objective in attacking PSU is still unknown, right?
- Switch.
- Gotcha.
BBQ.
Go!
Go!
You okay?
I got this!
Grenade!
Now go!
Hurry!
Take him into custody!
The fire shutter has closed.
Never thought you'd get this far.
Don't move.
Before you pull the trigger, I'll shoot you down dead.
Shoot me down or tear me limb from limb...
I will pull this trigger.
Can you shoot with your body in pieces?
Wanna test me?
Try me.
Why stop me?
Kiryu... what you said is correct after all.
Seems I have to obey you.
Kusanami, I knew you'd see the light.
And you know what could happen to our nation if you kill me.
So we let him walk?
I want you to alter all data that has been... made public about me.
Trying to protect only yourself I see.
Don't.
I got no use for a broken machine.
I can always create more to replace you.
You're a malfunctioning machine.
It must be that woman's fault.
Trying to feel human was where you went wrong, you machine.
Keep living life never trusting anyone, never loving anyone.
That's more your style.
Happy, right?
Yeah.
It was easier that way I guess.
But...
I can't let it go.
I want to protect her!
Stop your babbling!
You criminal, murderer!
That works for me, Kusanami.
From my point of view, you're a necessary person.
With one key strok e all data of you as ringleader of Wild 7 will be deleted.
Now...we're partners.
I welcome you as a brother.
What's the big idea?
From my point of view... you're the least necessary person.
What have you done?
I leaked your intel.
Vital intel hidden by the underworld about their power relationships.
You what?
Since only you can leak this intel, the underworld won't forgive you.
They'll hunt you down in a frenzy.
Without your trump cards... nobody in the nation will protect you.
In fact, they'll wish you were dead.
You said...
that the existence of Wild 7... was meaningless, didn't you?
I doubt the world will change by burying a little bad guy like yourself.
Still, we can't let evil lie.
We can't coexist with evil.
You'll never get it, but that's what being human is.
And the men of Wild 7... are more human than you'll ever be.
Get out of my face.
See how long you can run.
Today, charred remains were found in an exploded car by Tokyo Bay.
Police identified the body as...
PSU's Kiryu Keigo.
Police say his body was badly beaten.
He was incarcerated and blown up.
From the cruelty and motive, it seems a crime group with a grudge...
I'm completely mixed up.
No idea what is going on.
It's over.
Kiryu fabricated it all.
The Wild 7, everything.
Then who saved us?
SAT troops.
That's what they said.
But I saw those seven men.
Wild 7 protected us.
They're phantoms.
Wild 7 doesn't exist.
I don't care what you say.
I'm going to find Wild 7.
I'll prove these above-the-law crime avengers e xists.
Knock yourself out.
Honma Yuki turned herself in.
She'll get a death sentence.
We can't pardon murder no matter what.
Only those who exterminate evil can be pardoned.
Only Wild 7.
You got no other place to live.
You seven...that is.
A militia group has seized a satellite launch site.
SAT troops were completely devastated.
In 30 minutes, they'll launch a rocket at the Tokyo metropolitan area.

But Dad said...
Your father should have asked me.
These arrived for you in the post this morning.
Your projected grades.
There's an application form for Nando's stapled to them.
No, there isn't.
Oh, this is just victimisation!
We've decided you're leaving college.
Today.
What?
We tried to be reasonable with you, Alo, but last night was the final straw.
We tried to give you a choice, but you have let yourself down again, haven't you?
From now on, you're gonna work here with your father so we can keep an eye on you.
You're joking?
I'm not leaving college, Mum.
We're meeting Mr Blood at ten.
Put your suit on.
Mum, I'm not leaving college.
Check out the shit heap.
Nice car!
Mum!
Stay in the car with the dog, Dewi.
Not today, thank you, Richard.
So, here on the form, where it says "reason for leaving",
I'll just put "simpleton", OK?
He's just a bit...
Useless?
Well, it's very refreshing to see parents taking an honest appraisal of their child's limitations.
We just don't know what else to do with him.
Of course you don't.
And why should you?
Now, I am required to suggest that Alo picks up some kind of vocational outlet.
The world needs ditch diggers too, and all that.
Well, he'll be working with his father, on the farm.
How, er... agricultural.

He's Matty's mate or something.
Oh, I see.
We wouldn't want Matty getting jealous, would we?
What the fuck are you on about?
I...
I've seen the way you look at each other.
I say go for it.
Liv'd do it to you in a heartbeat.
You know what, Mini?
I'm trying really fucking hard to show people that you're not a complete bitch.

Hey, buddy, what's your problem?
You all right?
What was that... in there?
Just some prick.
Franky... what's the deal?
What do you mean?
I mean, like... like, do you like boys or...?
Cos no-one cares.
Fuck, I could tell you some stories about Mini that'd surprise you.

I didn't leave the farm.
What is this?
What have you done?
Oh, here we fucking go.
Come on, then, Dad, let's have it, shall we?
Why don't you tell me exactly what Mum thinks?
Right, my boy...
Owen, don't!
Oh, sorry, Mum.
Does he need your permission first?
Look at you.
You're ball-less and miserable and fucking... old.
What are you gonna do, eh?
(SHOUTS) What are you gonna do?

What was that?
(HE SOBS)
You OK, Farm Boy?
I think I fucked up.
It's only a bit of flour and eggs.
I can't say the place was a palace to begin with.
No, like... really, really fucked up.
(SNIFFLES)
It's just when did it all get so fucking hard?
Well... that's what happens.
But you adapt, don't you?
You look at what's changed and you find a way to own it.
I think I'll just go and see Rich.
You're actually all right.
Aren't you?
Yeah.
I am all right.
I thought you were fucking off.
(PLINK!

(SHOUTS) Rich!
(SHOUTS) Rich!
Mate, I'm sorry, I know it's late and your dad'll go mental, but... remember when we were kids and we used to talk about just... just fucking it, running away and becoming roadies?
Well...
Has Hannah Montana died or something?
Guess what I just did?
With Grace?
Yes, of course with Grace.
Fuck!
(HE CHUCKLES)
Nice one.
I keep thinking, you know, me and you.
We're growing up and it's fucking awesome.
This is it, mate.

You all right?
Yeah.
Just chuffed for you.
So what did you want to see me about?

How is he, Dewi?
Home.
They only kept him in here for a few hours.
High blood pressure.
Mind you, it was off the fucking chart.
So he's fine?
Oh, I wouldn't say that, he's got a bad couple of years coming.
But he knew that anyway.
He didn't want to worry you about it.
Hey, I knew you'd come by.
That's why I waited.
You want a lift home?
I dunno.
Hey, you're a Creevey man, boy.
And you always will be.
Huh?
Come on.
Hey!
Hey.
Where is he?
Like you care.
Of course I care, Mum.
If you cared, Alo, you wouldn't have done this to us.
You knew he wasn't well.
No, I didn't.
You don't tell me anything.
Can you blame us?
I'm sorry, Mum.
I just don't know what to do with you any more, Alo.
I'm gonna try, OK?
I'm really gonna try to be better.
You need to try too.
Sometimes you make me feel so fucking useless.
But I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna grow up.
If you want me, I'll be on top field.

Ooh, I wonder what I've got in my bag.

That's a long shape.
But my favourite one of all is the banana.
Ooh, he's very ripe.
Get that banana right in my big bloody tits.
Oh, yeah.
Yesl Give me a good banana milkshake, you bananary bastardl
Oohl Oh, yes, bananal
Ohl Ohl
Well, that was a proper job.
Get in my gob, you big yellow bastardl (sighs) (LAUGHS)
Oh, banana.
What is it?
It's your birthday present, Alo.
It's a spade.
Oh.
- l've been talking to your father.
You're not going to town tonight.
- What?
Da's milking on a rolling shift.
He needs you.
I can't.
Me and Rich are doing stuff.
I don't give a monkey's, Alo.
Your father needs help.
Every single day he's out there on his own.
Anything could happen to him.
He's got Dewi.
Ma', it's my birthday.
There are bigger problems in this world than you and your poxy little friends, my lad.
But Ma.
- You need to try harder, Alo.
You are not being fair.
Cheers for me spade, Mum.
Oh.
Happy birthday, son.
Oh.
Wow.
Thanks, Dad.
She's a good runner.
You've a lot to catch up on, so you can't go out for too long.
Actually, Da', there's...
- Up you pop, mush.
(engine STARTS)
So, Dad, me and Rich were thinking of sort of... lt's my birthday and everything, so we were thinking of...
Concentrate.
Nice and easy, just like I taught you.
Right.
Yeah.
Nice one.
Nice and gently, couple of fingers worth.
Not too much choke.
He's a good lad, Dew.
(LOUD music) (PHONE rings) (ringing TONE)
Finallyl I swear, if you've been ultra-wanking...
Problem.
- Oh, here we fucking go.
I think I'm gonna be late to the pub.
Rich, how hot should tractors get?
I'm not at the pub, Alo.
I'm...at your surprise party.
- What?
Yeah.
Happy birthday...
you ungrateful cunt.
liv:
Happy birthday, Alol
Oh, shit.
Mate, I can't get away.
Mumgabe's doing her nut.
Tell him he's scheduled to entertain the young debutante.
Liv's got you a practice girl.
What?
Like, a real one?
Does she look good?
Um...
No. I think it's retinal.
What?
- Look, listen, mate, if there was ever a rock-solid, iron-clad, balls-in chance of you getting laid, then this is definitely it.
All right?
liv:
Tell him you've done the vol-au-vents.
RlCHY:
Yeah, and I've done fucking vol-au-vents.
So finish up and get your shit together.
(engine CUTS OUT)
Oh, come on.
What happened here?
Get out.
I dunno, it just sort of...
it just sort of went.
Dad, there's this, er...
there's this party...
He overheated it.
So I should probably, er...
I should probably be heading off, then.
Alo, we need to sort this.
- Dad, it's my birthday.
Rich is...
Fine.
Just go, then, bey.
But you need to...
- Nice one, Da'.
I think he's fucked it.
(HOWLlNG) (DOGS BARK) (laughing) (CLUCKlNG)
Shit my balls.
Has a war started?
- Where did you go last night, Alo?
Nowhere.
All right, town.
But I had to, Rich did vol-au-vents.
I don't care what drugs your friends were taking.
But Dad said...
- Your father should have asked me.
These arrived for you in the post this morning.
Your projected grades.
There's an application form for Nando's stapled to them.
No, there isn't.
Oh, this is just victimisation.
- We've decided you're leaving college.
Today.
What?
- We tried to be reasonable with you, Alo, but last night was the final straw.
We tried to give you a choice, but you have let yourself down again, haven't you?
From now on, you're gonna work here with your father so we can keep an eye on you.
You're joking?
I'm not leaving college, Mum.
We're meeting Mr Blood at ten.
Put your suit on.
- Mum, I'm not leaving college.
Check out the shit heap.
- Nice car(. )
Mum.
Stay in the car with the dog, Dewi.
Not today, thank you, Richard.
So, here on the form, where it says 'reason for leaving', I'll just put 'simpleton', OK?
He's just a bit...
Useless?
Well, it's very refreshing to see parents taking an honest appraisal of their child's limitations.
We just don't know what else to do with him.
Of course you don't.
And why should you?
Now, I am required to suggest that Alo picks up some kind of vocational outlet.
The world needs ditch diggers too, and all that.
Well, he'll be working with his father, on the farm.
How, er...agricultural.
Just in case, an old college chum of mine runs a medical testing facility.
They're giving away free Xboxes to new admissions.
Old Xbox or Xbox 360?
(sliding)
Blatantly on a piece of string.
All right, fun police.
- What the fuck's going on?
My mum's in there, ruining my life.
We know.
That's why we're doing a kidnap on you.
Oh.
Nice one.
Where are we going?
Rich?
Um...
We've only planned this far.
So...
Pub?
ALL:
Pub.
(BURLESQUE music)
Nice one.
So, you're just going to roll over?
- Well, what else can I do?
Go Viking on that shit.
Burn the fucker down.
Oh...
Couldn't do it the Old Boy.
So where do you draw the line?
You're a person, Alo, not a cow.
It's your life, so you get to choose.
That's the deal.
I know they're being shitty, but I can't just wreck the farm.
It's all they've got, and I...
You know...
No, what?
I love them and stuff.
Ha-ha.
You're gay for your parents.
(MEN cheering)
Grace.
Come on.
And what exactly are we doing in this shit hole?
They've done a kidnap on me.
- Alo fancies his parents, even though they're making him drop out for free slave labour on the farm.
MATTY:
You've got to do something, mate.
Cos it won't stop.
They'll just keep grinding you down till you're miserable and soulless and old, just like them.
- You've got to stick it to the man, bruv.
Bollocks.
Aloysius Schmeichel Creevey.
Fucking sell-out, Rags.
It's no good you sulking, Alo.
You've officially left college now.
Yes, Mum.
I've planned out your day for you.
You should have this lot finished by bath time.
Yes, Mum.
I'm only thinking of you, Alo.
You may not like it, but you've had your chances.
- Yes, Mum.
And time and time again you've let us both down.
Hasn't he, Owen?
Hasn't he, Owen?
Oh.
Yes, dear.
- Oh.... ...(engine STARTS)...
Now, I want you to take all this lumber, all this...bits of tat and that, and sort out a great big old bonny.
You know?
Like, er, like for a witch.
Huh.
Yeah.
And then...take...
Well, take it round the back, but be careful of the mice.
And then just set fire to the bloody lot.
Proper job, eh?
See?
See.
- See. (CHUCKLES) (COUGHS) (COWS MOO) (GRUNTS)
Whoo...
Fuck.
What are you playing at?
This should have been done an hour ago.
It's been hectic in here, Dad.
I think I need a brew.
No, Alo.
- But I'm gasping.
Just do as you're told for once.
It's me who gets in the neck, you know.
And put your bloody shoe back on.
(COUGHS) Yeah, old bey'll do the ploughing.
We've got to move all the rocks, like.
(MUMBLES) You don't, you fuck up the blade.
Then we'd be up shit creek. (GROANS)
Simple as that.
Yeah.
(MUMBLES)
You got to keep your wits about you.
I remember once, there's a rock n-n-no bigger than your fist...
You know what, Dewi?
Half the time, no-one can understand a fucking word you're saying.
OWEN:
We'll have to pick up the pace.
You need to learn this stuff, Alo.
You need to know what you're doing.
I do know what I'm doing.
Well, not that one.
- l can do it, Da'.
I said leave it, bey.
Dad, I said I can do it.
That one don't move, bey.
It's always been there.
So just do as you're told, see?
(GROANS)
Fuckin'...
Told you.
Fine where it was.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's fine isn't it, Da'?
Yeah, we all just like it the way it is, don't we?
Where you going, bey?
- Just doing as I'm told, Da'.
Sticking to Ma's list.
Alo?
(COW MOOS)
What are you doing in 'ere?
Nothing.
What's that smell?
That's cow shit, Mum.
Don't get smart with me, my lad.
Why isn't that barn cleared?
Just sticking to your schedule, Mum.
If you were sticking to my schedule, you'd be bathing Rags by now.
Rags doesn't like baths.
He's farm property, Alo.
He likes what the farm tells him to like.
Lot of that going around, isn't there?
- Will you speak to your son?
What?
- He's taking the piss, Owen, and it's you letting him do it.
All right, love.
- Mum, lay off him.
If I wanted your opinion,
Aloysius, I'd ask for it.
- Sorry, Mum.
Come on, hen, I'll make a brew.
It's all right.
It's not all right.
Everything that boy touches turns to shit.
You're a disgrace, Aloysius Creevey.
You're a disgrace to me and you're a disgrace to this family.
- Mum.
Oh, don't start, Alo.
Dad?
She's right, bey.
You need to sort yourself out.
Owen.
Am I going to have to make that cup of tea myself?
Coming, hen.
(COUGHS AND SPLUTTERS) (BELLOWlNG MOOlNG)
Bessie?
Bey, you all right?
What...
Alo?
Please don't tell Mum.
Mum, it was an accident.
I didn't mean to.
Mum.
Mum.
You can't just take all my stuff.
Don't.
Mum.
(CLATTERlNG)...
MUM:
Pack this lot up now.
- ALO:
No.
Where's Rags gonna sleep?
No fucking way.
She's taking Rags, Dad.
Dad, she's taking my fucking dog.
Look, I don't care about the van, all right?
The computer, the telly, whatever.
Just not Rags, all right?
Yeah?
(SHOUTS) All right, Dad?
Please?
(DOOR SLAMS)
OWEN:
We'll be back later tonight.
MUM:
You're not to set one foot off this farm, my lad, you understand?
I want that list done by the time we're home.
Any problems, just give your Aunty Pippa a ring.
Ma says her fella'll give us a good price for this lot.
And we'll sort the damage out when...
Right, well (engine TURNS) (engine TURNS) (TECHNO music PLAYS)

Yeah, we're sticking it to the man.

Mm, yeah?
So, tonight, then?
In those clouds.
Look, there's Kanye West and there's the pig.
Oh.
Poor pig.
So you're fine with Nick coming over, then?
ALO:
So long as he doesn't make us run drills, the more the merrier.
You know, I think you should call more people.
In fact, call everyone you know...
MATTY:
Alo...
- And we're gonna need supplies, lots of supplies.

I have thought about it, Rich.

There's a different view of the world from the one you have at the moment.
If you want to see it, there's a certain group of people in Chicago I'd like you to meet.
A year from now the mayor runs for reelection.
Drop out of the governor's race and you'll have the organizational support you need to take him on.
If we're gonna move on this, we have to do it soon.
What do you say?
The document that shows then sanitation director Thomas Kane authorized the dump of trichloroethylene was made public by a blogger, Chumpbait.
We make it so it's not about us.
We make it so it's about how a small town deals with the end of the world.
12 years ago I was approached by a member of Mayor Kane's staff and told that any reference to trichloroethylene was to be redacted from the report.
Alongside Mayor Kane, I did wrong.
♪ Satan, your kingdom must come down
♪ Satan, your kingdom must come down
♪ I heard the voice of Jesus Christ
♪ Satan, your kingdom must come down.
Surfacing last night a bombshell.
Dr. Gabriela Reyes, head of research at Children's Memorial at the time, claiming the Kane administration coerced her into redacting damning materials from her official report.
I could've stood strong, but I did not.
Alongside Mayor Kane, I did wrong.
Give me an old Chicago on tap.
I'd like a ride on the Riverview coaster, but they both went under in '67 just after the blizzard.
- 26".
- 27.
- We made a killing.
- Six sidewalks, four driveways and two shovels.
Where are those industrious little bastards?
I thought I'd be seeing you.
- Can we go for a walk?
- I'll check with the owner, tell him the mayor wants a word.
This can't be an easy time for you.
It goes with the territory.
What's so important, alderman, that you needed to see me on a Saturday?
I'd like to offer my assistance.
Help the mayor make a graceful exit.
You know, recent revelations aside, he's done many positive things for the city for which he should be remembered.
That's very kind of you.
I'll relay the message.
She looks good on tv,
Dr. Reyes.
Respectable.
Unimpeachable.
Troubled by a past transgression and then pointing her elegant finger at your guy for poisoning children and then covering it up.
That ball doesn't bounce.
Look, I have no interest in shaming him out of office.
I'd like to offer him a way to leave with a little dignity during this difficult time.
If...?
If he promises not to run again.
To free it up for whom?
You?
No.
I don't need to try that suit on.
I know a bad fit by looking at it.
Mm-hmm.
And if he doesn't?
Then we'll be forced to start impeachment hearings.
We?
The wheels are already in motion, but say the word and we'll put the brakes on.
You know where to reach me.
Sorry to interrupt, but Mrs. Kane is on the line.
- I'm in a meeting.
- She's looking for the mayor.
- She's left several messages.
- The mayor's not taking any calls right now.
He'll get back to her at his earliest convenience.
Yes sir.
They have a pretty airtight case.
I assume you're aware of all the details.
Appendix two, you'll find them listed alphabetically under "Bensenville plaintiffs."
These are all everyday folks--
Their numbers sizeable and growing--
Whose health and well-being were pretty badly compromised by the mayor's negligence and the cover-up he engineered to avoid personal responsibility.
We're aware of the details, Mr. McGantry.
Elliot, please.
Look, we don't have to play the game too hard here.
We know what we have.
You know it too.
- What are you offering?
- A 12-hour window for the mayor to agree to a settlement.
The mayor has no intention of admitting guilt
- because he's--
- Not guilty.
Of course.
- The terms?
- Steep, though not as steep should he decide to go to trial instead.
The choice is his, sort of.
I mean does man really have free choice?
"Brothers Karamazov," "the Grand Inquisitor"?
It changed my life.
I'll pass these on and get back to you.
- 12 hours.
- Heard you the first time.
I assume you've seen some photos of the plaintiffs involved, but just in case you haven't.
This is tragic.
Hey, it's me.
Any word from the mayor?
- No ma'am.
Nothing yet.
- Leave another message.
- Okay.
- Shit.
Those people are fishing down there.
Yeah.
In the mornings they come to watch for birds.
From a chemical dump to a fucking garden of eden.
It was a quarry before that.
Someday somebody'll come along and convince the city to build condos next to the fishing pond and turn it into something else.
Another layer for the archeologists to dig up.
- Remember Harold Baines?
- Do I remember?
You were a pathetic cubbie when we first met.
Cooperstown turned him down again.
- Could be his last shot.
- Fuck them.
How many hall-of-famers have over 3,000 hits?
His mistake was not quitting when he was on top, ending his career when he was batting .161.
You can't quit when the team still needs you.
Yeah.
I worked for the city since before I could vote.
I'm not sure I know what anything else would even feel like.
- You'd hate it.
- How do you know?
'Cause you need to be on the field.
The game is what keeps you going.
You'd shrivel up and die without it.
- Recognize it?
- Why?
I haven't been back there since--
You were running errands for Jack Manning
- at the housing authority.
- The greasiest palm in the city.
Man taught me all I ever needed to know about how things work.
They were all in bed with Sorell--
All of 'em.
Paid off by that greedy fucking slumlord to look the other way while my family dodged rats and drug dealers.
You came and took one look, saw what this place had become.
"Screw Jack Manning," you said,
"and screw the housing authority."
I was showing off for your sister.
Yeah.
As far as I'm concerned, that's the night you became Tom Kane.
No response yet from the mayor's office as the controversy shows no signs of abating.
Try again.
I don't care.
Try every five minutes until you reach him.
Reference to trichloro--
Birth defects, lung abnormalities, severe asthma.
- Yeah?
- It's me.
What are you wearing?
A suit of armor.
It's the middle of a work day.
- It's Saturday.
- Have you been watching the news?
- I need to see you.
- Ben, primaries are four days away.
- Are you focusing?
- I am, on you.
- I need to see you.
- I am in the middle of a shitstorm.
I am not gonna drop everything and trek out to Decatur.
You don't have to.
Come with me, one hour.
You came back to Chicago for a quick fuck?
What's going on?
What's going on?
Get the fuck out of here, okay?
- You're wasting my time.
- What if I drop out of the race?
That's why I'm here.
I had a meeting with some people and they think I should quit.
Who's they?
Cullen, Ross, others.
They came to me, proposed I drop out of the primary and...
- And?
- ...
Run next year.
- Next year?
- For mayor.
Against?
Are you out of your fucking mind?
They think I can win, that they can make it happen.
- Well, they're using you.
- For what?
You just asked me yourself-- have you been watching the news?
Forget a year, he may not be in office next Monday.
Don't underestimate.
You have no idea.
Even if he does bounce back, if I don't make this move,
I'm in his pocket the rest of my political life.
What about Ross's pocket or Cullen's pocket?
It's different.
They're different.
I know how to handle them.
- How are they different?
- This whole fucking thing is sinking.
We don't have to go down with it.
We have choices, options.
Why are you telling me all this?
I'm telling you this because I trust my instincts and I trust yours.
I mean think about this.
How much have you had to compromise?
Huh?
Sacrifice?
And for what?
If he goes down, what are you left with?
Is he worth it?
Who else knows about all this?
- Who?
- Anyone who does is neck-deep in on it, and then there's you.
He's not gonna go down without a fight.
He will take this entire city down with him.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Come here.
Things have changed.
Sorell rebuilt, of course.
Like roaches, the Sorells of the world...
- Mm-hmm.
- ...
Adapting to anything.
They could survive a nuclear attack, inherit the Earth.
Everybody came out on top, except maybe Sorell's insurance company.
So if you're ever worried whether you did the right thing--
You were an officer of the law, and I burnt down his fucking house.
When you choose between the lesser of two evils, your choice is still evil.
A necessary evil.
You do something bad to do something good.
I remember pouring turpentine along the base,
watch the flames lick at the bottom of the house before swallowing it whole.
The smoke was so blinding, you could hear the fire better than you could see it.
Electrical circuits popping, glass shattering, the hiss of appliances decompressing and then exploding.
And then steady, calm--
Wood burning.
Snap, crackle, pop--
Just like a bowl of Rice Krispies.
And then it was done.
And all I could think was
I had no regrets.
It took me less than a year in Manning's office to see how things are done.
Fair play had about as much currency as the tooth fairy.
See, the thing is one necessary evil leads to another, till one day you can't differentiate between what's necessary and what's merely expedient.
And when that happens, you're done.
You're a monster.
Nice guys don't turn dumps into city parks or force landlords to clean up slums.
Not here.
It's nice here.
I should've visited before.
Yeah, try touring your city sometime, see what the monster has built.
I need a favor.
When we spend money on private estate coffee, you don't ruin it by serving it in a cardboard cup, you know?
Sugar?
Alderman Mata, are you fucking us?
No.
- Ross.
- What about him?
If there's a movement to impeach,
I assume if you knew anything, we'd hear about it, correct?
- Yes.
- What factions, what kind of names, numbers, money.
Of course.
Hmm.
I understand it's tempting to consider alternative world views when the climate turns like this.
- No.
- But climates turn and turn again.
It would be terrible were you to land on the wrong side once things settle.
You've worked too hard to be suckered by wannabes who think this is their moment, yeah?
Don't worry about the coffee.
- Everything all right?
- Fine.
No, actually, I'm not.
I'm out of my mind, trying to reach the mayor.
- Where is he?
- He'll be back when he's ready.
- How's our boy doing?
- Numbers are up, right on target.
- Where are they now?
- Uh, Decatur, I think, unless they've moved on to Urbana.
Nope.
Decatur until tomorrow morning.
- When are you joining them?
- I don't know.
If the mayor ever reappears and we get this mess cleaned up, maybe I'll try to head out there in the next couple of days.
You should go anyway.
We can't afford to take chances, not now.
If Kane's pick loses, his chances of bouncing back are next to nil.
I wouldn't want to be responsible for that, would you?
Uh, Mrs. Kane--
I'm not available, the mayor's not available and no, I don't know where he is or when he's coming back.
Um, she's in your office, sir,
Mrs. Kane.
- Ezra.
- Mrs. Kane.
Where is Tom?
I don't know.
Is there something I can help you with?
Do you mind if we talk candidly?
- No.
- How bad is it?
It's bad.
And Tom?
How's he reacting?
As he usually does.
It's hard to imagine, isn't it?
The city without him, him without it.
But then, not impossible.
I've tried to picture it, the end--
Farewell dinners, dedications, interviews, maybe a statue.
But this?
- Well...
- He's been through worse.
We all have.
I wouldn't doubt his resilience.
- Still?
- Yes.
My father always said that Tom was the kind of leader other men would follow into battle, that he had the vision to take this city into the next millennium.
So he'd found his successor, someone to perpetuate his legacy.
I was just a bridge between the two.
Tom would inherit the kingdom, my father would never have to step down, be a sort of mayor emeritus.
He thought the world of your father.
We all did.
Yes, but his tenure did end, didn't it?
How about you?
Have you thought about it, the end?
What it would look like?
When you talk to him, tell him to meet me at the house at 4:00 this afternoon and not to be late.
Of course.
Can I tell him what it's regarding?
Dr. Reyes, it's Sam Miller again.
I'd really appreciate your calling me back when you have a chance.
I have a few follow-up questions regarding the mayor's involvement in the redacted medical reports.
Again, my number is 555-0158.
Thank you.
Why am I here?
What do you expect to get from this, detective?
Retired.
I left the force not long after I arrested your brother here.
He looks good.
Good job, the right meds--
He's pulled his life together.
I've made my peace with what happened.
It was a long time ago.
I carried it with me in silence and now it's time to speak.
Gemma Lewis.
Remember her name?
When we found her, her neck was ripped open.
He did it with his teeth.
Left marks all over her, like an animal.
Do you remember?
I do.
What do you want?
What do you think would happen to him, to Mani, if all the details of the case were to finally be revealed?
And not only that, but that you agreed to alter medical evidence in your report to make those details go away to save him?
There's a statute of limitations.
Class X felony--
Aggravated criminal sexual assault.
It means he's accountable for up to 20 years after the victim turns 18.
Plenty of time for another trial.
And with the dental records and the DNA--
Just tell me what you want.
Remove Tom Kane from the toxic-waste equation, make a simple statement you acted on your own.
He had nothing to do with it.
Some deals are worth doubling down on.
No?
The first secret that she has...
In a way, I admire her.
"Man hath no greater love than to lay down his life for his brother."
Except she laid down the lives of innocent children to save her werewolf brother.
And what does that make me?
- I should've called.
- I told you I'd bring them by when I got them.
I just wanted some fresh air, clear my head.
- I thought--
- Can I get you anything?
- Some water or--
- Yeah, some water'd be nice.
You look tired.
Yeah, maybe a little.
I'm not as resilient as I used to be.
That young man I saw leave--
- Darius?
- Thanks.
He helps out.
You two seem close.
Dad.
I know.
It's a little late for me to be asking you questions about your-- Your boyfriends.
Only by about 15 years.
It's not too late.
Well, what does he do to help out?
He transports supplies, that sort of thing.
- Supplies?
- Dad.
Look, I don't want this to be difficult.
I want to tell you the truth and be honest about things.
- Me too.
- I can't afford to be compromised.
I know that.
I'm on top of it.
I know what I'm doing.
Trust me, okay?
It's not too late for you to start doing that.
I promise you, he's as stunned as the rest of the city by her accusations.
That's the problem.
His word against Mother Teresa's.
And now with this brewing class action suit ahead of him--
We've been here before, countless times.
These accusations are politically motivated.
We know it.
We can see it.
Tom's always fighting off challenges like this, and he's always survived.
Yes, but this time he's got Elliot biting at his heels.
Your Elliot?
Since he joined Bollingworth, Sanford Wexler.
Watch out.
Young Mr. McGantry is looking for a game-changer to make his name on.
I'm sure he is, win or lose.
Look, I'm not gonna bullshit you, Meredith.
I don't give a damn who sits in city hall as long as there's consistency about the way we do things.
I know you know what I mean.
And I've always had a soft spot for you and your father, so I'm gonna give you a heads up.
There are some people making some serious moves against Tom.
- How serious?
- Usually these threats peter out.
It's almost impossible to unseat an incumbent unless a star candidate presents himself.
Who?
Drop the naivete.
It doesn't suit you.
It's a town of two when it comes to politics, you know that.
This kid is gathering a serious head of steam, could do anything with it.
Tom needs to watch his back.
It doesn't matter what we recommend.
Our hands are tied until we get a directive from the mayor.
I'm getting fried out there.
- Should I go--
- No, stay where you are.
Schedule a press conference today at 2:00.
Yes sir, and the talking points?
Dr. Reyes will be retracting her former statement, absolving the mayor's office of any involvement
- in a cover-up.
- Can I leak in advance on the reason?
No, she has agreed to make the statement.
That, for the moment, will be enough.
Will she be taking questions?
Sir, maybe we should prepare against pushback, questioning the viability of recanting such an explosive accusation without explaining it.
There's no need.
- But in the public's view--
- This has nothing to do with the public's confidence in the mayor.
It's a message aimed at a different constituency.
- Thank you.
- Sir, one more thing.
It's urgent.
Bensenville class action suit-- I spoke with them this morning.
- They have us over a barrel.
- Stop.
Do you know who I am?
Yes sir, I believe so.
Spectators stand on the sidelines shaking their heads, lacking the balls.
Do you know what I mean?
- No sir.
- When Truman nuked Japan, when Lincoln sent boys out to kill their cousins, you think they gave a shit about their approval rating?
- No sir.
- Fuck the spectators.
If there's another city in this country that takes better care of its citizens, you tell me now which one you think it is.
Anyone?
Good.
If in the course of doing what I believe is best for this city there is collateral damage,
who here wants to explain to me the position of those on the sidelines shaking their heads?
Good.
Now you were saying about this lawsuit?
Nothing, sir.
Just get me a deal.
I will settle this one.
They should've proposed one already anyway.
That's what I'm hearing.
It's already underway unless you announce you're not gonna seek reelection.
- Who else is involved?
- I don't know.
Ross-
- Find out, dig.
I need to know where he's vulnerable.
I'm fucking done with him-- Impeachment hearings.
Did you find her yet, the nurse?
- Not yet.
We will though.
- Soon.
I can't afford to wait, not now.
I would first like to say how grateful...
I am to Dr. Reyes for her willingness to come here and set the record straight.
It takes character and courage to admit a mistake.
This is an example of the kind of integrity that has defined her career.
Dr. Gabriela Reyes.
I wish to amend the statement
I made yesterday regarding the redacted medical reports.
Jesus Christ!
- Mayor Kane had nothing at all to do with it.
- What?
I acted entirely alone.
I regret any aspersions
I might have cast on the Kane administration
- or on the mayor himself...
- No.
No no no no.
- ...
Whose commitment to the health and welfare...
- No.
- ...
Of the citizens of Chicago is and has always been...
- Motherfucking--
Above reproach.
What did you get on her?
It's not gonna work.
Reversing a huge public statement this quickly is only gonna raise public suspicion.
But this isn't about the public.
This is aimed at us, at me, at every alderman and ward boss.
You know what he's saying?
He's saying, "come after me, motherfucker, because I'm staying where I am and your potential star witness is no more."
Impeachment?
Gone.
Period.
Thank you.
I know how difficult this was for you.
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.
Change anything?
Not if we jump on it before he's had time to recover.
He's upped the game, so we hit him back harder--
His own man running against him.
Speaks volumes.
Look, we have to be decisive and move fast.
I need your answer by tonight.
What are you doing home?
I just needed a break.
I wanted to see you and see the kids.
Ben, four days to the primary-- What do you mean a break?
The kids can wait.
I can wait.
We'll see enough of each other in Springfield.
Let's just get there.
I missed you.
Come on, cut it out.
Be serious.
Should I be worried?
No, everything's fine.
You should go.
If the kids see you, it'll only make things worse.
It's better they believe you weren't here at all.
Ben.
I know it's hard, but everything will be okay.
As soon as this is over, everything is gonna be so much easier.
- Whatcha got?
Whatcha got?
- Come on, gimme the ball.
Hey!
Oh boy!
Come on, man.
You're lucky, boy.
Oh man.
- Come on, man.
- Hey, heads up.
Shoulda called.
You just don't drop by around here.
I did.
You didn't answer.
- What's the matter?
- Your father.
I didn't like seeing him at the clinic
- and I didn't like him seeing me.
- It's fine.
I told him you work there.
- And?
- And what?
Did he believe it?
Well, you do, sort of.
It's not a joke-- What I do, who he is.
I know that.
I told you he's fine.
I have it under control.
- Hey.
- D!
- Shit!
Fuck.
- What's the matter?
- Oh, I don't like this.
- No, it's just in case.
- It's okay.
- Oh shit.
- Move it.
Come on, man, go!
- What's going on?
- Run!
- Come on!
Let's go!
- What's going on?
- Run!
Run!
Go through here.
I'll meet up with you later.
- Go go.
- Fuck.
- Oh fucking a.
- Ah!
Yeah.
Hey, now come on, man.
Okay.
You just wait here, okay?
- Don't--
- Shh, shh!
Hit him!
Come on.
Anybody home?
Over here.
Here here.
- Will he be okay?
- I don't know.
I'm gonna call the police.
What the fuck are you thinking?
We should call the police?
We should call the police?
- Where do you think we are, huh?
- I just thought--
Thought what?
Who do you think I am?
What do you think all this is, some fucking project?
Some fucking Robin Hood shit?
Fucking fairy tale?
- That's not fair.
- This is real and it's fucking dangerous.
And there is no fucking help.
Do you get that?
So go back to your shelter where you can feel good about yourself for helping some poor colored people.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh baby.
Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
The situation has changed since her confession.
Confession?
Hardly.
Coercion more like it.
Still, it changes everything.
He could come back.
Impeachment was always just a short-term opportunity.
We have to stay the course on this-
- Just keep our heads, keep cool, play the long game.
- Yeah, the long game.
- Look, we hit him with the kid first and roll from there on.
We can't afford to break ranks.
- No.
- What he put on for us today in that press room was a pretty puppet show.
Don't flinch.
- We need you.
- See, you've got nothing to lose.
If he even finds out that I know about our play dates, let alone that I'm involved, it is over.
I am fucked.
Don't you ever get tired of being that man's bitch?
It's been a long time.
My neighborhood has benefited greatly from Mayor Kane's generosity.
- What are you saying?
- I don't know.
Just that maybe it's not the right time.
Maybe we wait.
- We wait?
- Yeah.
I can't force you into anything.
Just know this:
You are more than what he allows you to be.
More than just some affirmative action spic who brown-nosed his way into the council chamber.
You are right at the head of the fastest-growing immigrant population in the state, not to mention the country.
Now that's something he should acknowledge with more respect.
I would.
Oh what?
Who?
Oh look.
Grr.
How y'all doing?
Yes.
Ezra Stone.
I just don't know what's wrong with him.
It's been going on for months.
- I didn't sign up for that.
- Hm-Mmm.
Hm-Mmm.
His skin, his coloring--
It's eating him from the inside.
Mmm, well, he's only gonna get worse.
- I know.
- So what do you want me to do?
Get rid of him, because he's gonna bring you down too.
Do it before he gets any worse.
- Oh.
- He's an embarrassment.
I think he wets his bed.
You're stronger than him.
- Oh.
- Yes, you always have been.
- Daddy.
- Do what you need to do.
Things must go on.
I'm here.
I'm right here.
Tom.
Peter, good to see you.
Oh, it's nice to be invited.
I haven't been here in quite some time.
It's still a beautiful place.
My compliments.
- Thank you.
- Would you like a drink?
Oh, no thanks.
I didn't want to divulge to Peter the reason you arranged for this little tete-a-tete in too much detail without you being here.
You have your own inimitable way of expressing your concerns.
I thought it best to wait.
The price one pays for a long marriage--
Predictability, I'm afraid.
But Peter here is aware of Mr. Miller's dogged nature.
- Are you?
- Well, I read his column.
- He's bright, impulsive.
- Let's cut the shit, Peter.
He's burying me and Bentley doesn't have the balls to stop him.
Well, why should he?
Every outlet's running with the story.
What difference does one reporter make?
He broke the story.
His column leads the charge.
He goes dark, it takes considerable wind out of sails.
Well, I don't know, Tom.
It's selling papers.
- Quid pro quo.
- Are you gonna be around long enough for quid pro quo?
The art of political survival--
One day at a time.
You make it through one, then the next.
String enough days together, people forget.
They move on to newer matters.
I need a breather--
Just a little-
- Through the gubernatorial primary.
Well, there's a tower-- My tower.
I've been operating a radio station from it.
It has recently and quite suddenly been designated a Chicago landmark.
- You know it, I believe.
- Yes.
So now I can't make any alterations to accommodate a new broadcast tower, which is something I'm very anxious to do.
There are nine people on the landmark commission, all nine appointed by you.
I'll see what I can do.
It was a pleasure.
Next time it'll be the four of us and I'll do the cooking.
He doesn't keep me around just for my looks.
Thanks a lot.
- Good night.
- Bye-bye.
Farewell.
Ah.
Don't ever blind-side me again.
It was the right play to make.
Don't get ahead of yourself.
I would strongly advise against it.
Ezra, we're glad, believe us.
He put impeachment out of play.
But the real problem is how the people see him out there in the street.
They're not buying it.
The press conference just made it look like he bullied that woman into recanting.
And the kid's charismatic, but without Kane, why would we want him?
He's unconnected, inexperienced.
- What are you saying?
- Look, I gotta tell ya--
Cullen looks solid right now.
He's a known quantity, been doing the job for years.
That's good for contracts, relationships.
Everything that stands today remains stable with him.
- We want stability.
- Kane is your stability.
If he's in city hall.
But if he isn't,
Zajac's nothing but a smile.
Frank, what's the temperature in the 37th?
My precinct captains are waiting, ready to mobilize and get out the vote whichever way Tom wants to go.
But I agree with everyone else--
As things stand, one choice is easier to pull for than the other.
No matter who wins the primary,
Tom Kane is staying in city hall, of that I am sure.
And I'm also sure that he will look back on this time and remember those who were able to overcome difficulties and deliver a majority for treasurer Zajac in their wards.
Then he will ask me for the names of those who did not.
That must've been some car accident.
How come the rest of you didn't get damaged?
All depends on how you go through the windshield, I guess.
- The angle.
- Yeah.
Why am I here, Mr. Ross?
How close are you to Lalo Mata?
- He's my alderman.
- That's it?
I've known him since I was little, from the neighborhood.
He's like my uncle.
And he's thrown some business your way in the past.
We're very grateful for that.
- Suppose it were to stop.
- Excuse me?
What if there were no more contracts?
That would not be good.
Mr. Ruiz, can I speak with you frankly?
Yes yes, by all means.
There's a shift going on within the city administration.
Things are going to be different and soon.
I'm sorry to say that alderman Mata has found himself on the wrong side of that shift.
- Uh-huh.
- This shift means that contracts that were Mr. Mata's to dispense would now be mine to award as I saw fit...
Yes.
Which is why I asked to speak to you today.
I wanted to let you know that I'd like to continue working with you and your company.
You are an integral part of how the city contracts are effectively and economically carried out.
Thank you, sir.
That-
- That's it?
Yes, that's it.
- Thank you, Mr. Ross.
- Mr. Ruiz.
Uh, Mata-- Alderman Mata-- so he's not involved anymore?
Soon he won't be.
Not even as an alderman?
I doubt it.
Thank you, Mr. Ross.
- Yes sir?
- Get me alderman Mata on the phone, please.
Sir, it's ringing.
You gonna get that?
Dental records.
You understand.
See, 20 years from now when the city council decides to turn this new terminal into a shopping mall and some nutball like me finds your skeleton, nobody'll know who the fuck it is.
Not indian burial sites, cement foundations or, uh, aldermen.
I should cut off your fingertips, avoid prints, but then soft tissue starts rotting almost immediately.
Did you know that if you bury a pig under the sidewalk, the cement starts to smell like pigshit?
Like coffee.
And then there's bloat.
Just imagine if your body began pushing up the dirt.
Hmm?
So this is gonna be a little tricky, but your body's gotta be ventilated.
The foundation that we're laying tomorrow, you know what it's for?
The executive terminal.
Huh?
Perfect, right?
You can spend eternity kissing the feet of los jefes while they walk on your face, just like you did when you were alive.
Don't think of this as the end, Lalo.
Think of it as...
As a transition.
Like everything in life, no one can live forever.
Hey.
Burns like hell, I know.
But lye's the best thing to speed the decomposition.
We'll do it publicly--
A press conference where you'll announce that you're dropping out of the gubernatorial race in order to focus on your upcoming candidacy for mayor.
- Sounds good.
- And I want you to hold it in front of city hall.
Mr. Zajac, nice to see you again.
Have a nice night.
Tom.
Thomas Kane?
Hand it to me.
You've been served.
The Bensenville suit.
What happened to the goddamn deal?
- I'll look into it.
- What the fuck is going on around here?
What about the old man's nurse?
- We've got a lead.
- Find her, Stoney, for God's sake.
Mrs. Kane.
Thank you for meeting me.
I don't have long.
I have only one question.
Are you prepared for the wrath of my husband?
Because it'll be unlike any you've ever felt before.
That's a long drive for one question.
Running against him won't be easy.
I can help you win.
I guess that's not a question after all.
Lewy Body causes progressive decline.
I have it.
There's no cure.
I'm sorry.
- Is there something else I should know?
- No.
My guy said it's some pretty powerful shit.
- Who's it for?
- A friend.
A friend I need to know about?
No, relax.
There's nothing to worry about.
I want you to run for governor against Mac Cullen.
There's a different view of the world from the one you have at the moment.
If you want to see it, there's a certain group of people in Chicago I'd like you to meet.
A year from now the mayor runs for reelection.
Drop out of the governor's race and you'll have the organizational support you need to take him on.
If we're gonna move on this, we have to do it soon.
What do you say?
The document that shows then sanitation director Thomas Kane authorized the dump of trichloroethylene was made public by a blogger, Chumpbait.
We make it so it's not about us.
We make it so it's about how a small town deals with the end of the world.
12 years ago I was approached by a member of mayor Kane's staff and told that any reference to trichloroethylene was to be redacted from the report.
Alongside mayor Kane, I did wrong.
♪ Satan, your kingdom must come down
♪ Satan, your kingdom must come down
♪ I heard the voice of Jesus Christ
♪ Satan, your kingdom must come down.
Servicing last night a bombshell.
Dr. Gabriela Reyes, head of research at children's memorial at the time, claiming the Kane administration coerced her into redacting damning materials from her official report.
I could've stood strong, but I did not.
Alongside mayor Kane, I did wrong.
Give me an old Chicago on tap.
I'd like a ride on the Riverview coaster, but they both went under in '67 just after the blizzard.
- 26".
- 27.
- We made a killing.
- Six sidewalks, four driveways and two shovels.
Where are those industrious little bastards?
I thought I'd be seeing you.
- Can we go for a walk?
- I'll check with the owner, tell him the mayor wants a word.
This can't be an easy time for you.
It goes with the territory.
What's so important, alderman, that you needed to see me on a Saturday?
I'd like to offer my assistance.
Help the mayor make a graceful exit.
You know, recent revelations aside, he's done many positive things for the city for which he should be remembered.
That's very kind of you.
I'll relay the message.
She looks good on tv,
Dr. Reyes.
Respectable.
Unimpeachable.
Troubled by a past transgression and then pointing her elegant finger at your guy for poisoning children and then covering it up.
That ball doesn't bounce.
Look, I have no interest in shaming him out of office.
I'd like to offer him a way to leave with a little dignity during this difficult time.
If...?
If he promises not to run again.
To free it up for whom?
You?
No.
I don't need to try that suit on.
I know a bad fit by looking at it.
Mm-hmm.
And if he doesn't?
Then we'll be forced to start impeachment hearings.
We?
The wheels are already in motion, but say the word and we'll put the brakes on.
You know where to reach me.
Sorry to interrupt, but Mrs. Kane is on the line.
- I'm in a meeting.
- She's looking for the mayor.
- She's left several messages.
- The mayor's not taking any calls right now.
He'll get back to her at his earliest convenience.
Yes sir.
They have a pretty airtight case.
I assume you're aware of all the details.
Appendix two, you'll find them listed alphabetically under "Bensenville plaintiffs."
These are all everyday folks--
Their numbers sizeable and growing--
Whose health and well-being were pretty badly compromised by the mayor's negligence and the cover-up he engineered to avoid personal responsibility.
We're aware of the details, Mr. McGantry
Elliot, please.
Look, we don't have to play the game too hard here.
We know what we have.
You know it too.
- What are you offering?
- A 12-hour window for the mayor to agree to a settlement.
The mayor has no intention of admitting guilt
- because he's--
- Not guilty.
Of course.
- The terms?
- Steep, though not as steep should he decide to go to trial instead.
The choice is his, sort of.
I mean does man really have free choice?
"Brothers Karamazov," "the Grand Inquisitor"?
It changed my life.
I'll pass these on and get back to you.
- 12 hours.
- Heard you the first time.
I assume you've seen some photos of the plaintiffs involved, but just in case you haven't.
This is tragic.
Hey, it's me.
Any word from the mayor?
Leave another message.
Shit.
Those people are fishing down there.
Yeah.
In the mornings they come to watch for birds.
From a chemical dump to a fucking garden of eden.
It was a quarry before that.
Someday somebody'll come along and convince the city to build condos next to the fishing pond and turn it into something else.
Another layer for the archeologists to dig up.
- Remember Harold Baines?
- Do I remember?
You were a pathetic cubbie when we first met.
Cooperstown turned him down again.
- Could be his last shot.
- Fuck them.
How many hall-of-famers have over 3,000 hits?
His mistake was not quitting when he was on top, ending his career when he was batting .161.
You can't quit when the team still needs you.
Yeah.
I worked for the city since before I could vote.
I'm not sure I know what anything else would even feel like.
- You'd hate it.
- How do you know?
'Cause you need to be on the field.
The game is what keeps you going.
You'd shrivel up and die without it.
- Recognize it?
- Why?
I haven't been back there since--
You were running errands for Jack Manning
- at the housing authority.
- The greasiest palm in the city.
Man taught me all I ever needed to know about how things work.
They were all in bed with Sorell--
All of 'em.
Paid off by that greedy fucking slumlord to look the other way while my family dodged rats and drug dealers.
You came and took one look, saw what this place had become.
"Screw Jack Manning," you said,
"and screw the housing authority."
I was showing off for your sister.
Yeah.
As far as I'm concerned, that's the night you became Tom Kane.
No response yet from the mayor's office as the controversy shows no signs of abating.
Try again.
I don't care.
Try every five minutes until you reach him.
Reference to trichloro--
Birth defects, lung abnormalities, severe asthma.
- Yeah?
- It's me.
What are you wearing?
A suit of armor.
It's the middle of a work day.
- It's Saturday.
- Have you been watching the news?
- I need to see you.
- Ben, primaries are four days away.
- Are you focusing?
- I am, on you.
- I need to see you.
- I am in the middle of a shitstorm.
I am not gonna drop everything and trek out to decatur.
You don't have to.
Come with me, one hour.
You came back to Chicago for a quick fuck?
What's going on?
What's going on?
Get the fuck out of here, okay?
- You're wasting my time.
- What if I drop out of the race?
That's why I'm here.
I had a meeting with some people and they think I should quit.
Who's they?
Cullen, Ross, others.
They came to me, proposed I drop out of the primary and...
- And?
- ...
Run next year.
- Next year?
- For mayor.
Against?
Are you out of your fucking mind?
They think I can win, that they can make it happen.
- Well, they're using you.
- For what?
You just asked me yourself-- have you been watching the news?
Forget a year, he may not be in office next Monday.
Don't underestimate.
You have no idea.
Even if he does bounce back, if I don't make this move,
I'm in his pocket the rest of my political life.
What about Ross's pocket or Cullen's pocket?
It's different.
They're different.
Iknowhowtohandlethem.
- How are they different?
- This whole fucking thing is sinking.
We don't have to go down with it.
We have choices, options.
Why are you telling me all this?
I'm telling you this because I trust my instincts and I trust yours.
I mean think about this.
How much have you had to compromise?
Huh?
Sacrifice?
And for what?
If he goes down, what are you left with?
Is he worth it?
Who else knows about all this?
- Who?
- Anyone who does is neck-deep in on it, and then there's you.
He's not gonna go down without a fight.
He will take this entire city down with him.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Come here.
Things have changed.
Sorell rebuilt, of course.
Like roaches, the Sorells of the world...
- Mm-hmm.
- ...
Adapting to anything.
They could survive a nuclear attack, inherit the Earth.
Everybody came out on top, except maybe Sorell's insurance company.
So if you're ever worried whether you did the right thing--
You were an officer of the law, and I burnt down his fucking house.
When you choose between the lesser of two evils, your choice is still evil.
A necessary evil.
You do something bad to do something good.
I remember pouring turpentine along the base,
watch the flames lick at the bottom of the house before swallowing it whole.
The smoke was so blinding, you could hear the fire better than you could see it.
Electrical circuits popping, glass shattering, the hiss of appliances decompressing and then exploding.
And then steady, calm--
Wood burning.
Snap, crackle, pop--
Just like a bowl of rice Krispies.
And then it was done.
And all I could think was
I had no regret.
It took me less than a year in Manning's office to see how things are done.
Fair play had about as much currency as the tooth fairy.
See, the thing is one necessary evil leads to another, till one day you can't differentiate between what's necessary and what's merely expedient.
And when that happens, you're done.
You're a monster.
Nice guys don't turn dumps into city parks or force landlords to clean up slums.
Not here.
It's nice here.
I should've visited before.
Yeah, try touring your city sometime, see what the monster has built.
I need a favor.
When we spend money on private estate coffee, you don't ruin it by serving it in a cardboard cup, you know?
Sugar?
Alderman Mata, are you fucking us?
No.
- Ross.
- What about him?
If there's a movement to impeach,
I assume if you knew anything, we'd hear about it, correct?
- Yes.
- What factions, what kind of names, numbers, money.
Of course.
Hmm.
I understand it's tempting to consider alternative world views when the climate turns like this.
- No.
- But climates turn and turn again.
It would be terrible were you to land on the wrong side once things settle.
You've worked too hard to be severed by wannabes who think this is their moment, yeah?
Don't worry about the coffee.
- Everything all right?
- Fine.
No, actually, I'm not.
I'm out of my mind, trying to reach the mayor.
- Where is he?
- He'll be back when he's ready.
- How's our boy doing?
- Numbers are up, right on target.
- Where are they now?
- Uh, Decatur, I think, unless they've moved on to Urbana.
Nope.
Decatur until tomorrow morning.
- When are you joining them?
- I don't know.
If the mayor ever reappears and we get this mess cleaned up, maybe I'll try to head out there in the next couple of days.
You should go anyway.
We can't afford to take chances, not now.
If Kane's pick loses, his chances of bouncing back are next to Nil.
I wouldn't want to be responsible for that, would you?
Uh, Mrs. Kane--
I'm not available, the mayor's not available and no, I don't know where he is or when he's coming back.
Um, she's in your office, sir,
Mrs. Kane.
- Ezra.
- Mrs. Kane.
Where is Tom?
I don't know.
Is there something I can help you with?
Do you mind if we talk candidly?
- No.
- How bad is it?
It's bad.
And Tom?
How's he reacting?
As he usually does.
It's hard to imagine, isn't it?
The city without him, him without it.
But then, not impossible.
I've tried to picture it, the end--
Farewell dinners, dedications, interviews, maybe a statue.
But this?
- Well...
- He's been through worse.
We all have.
I wouldn't doubt his resilience.
- Still?
- Yes.
My father always said that Tom was the kind of leader other men would follow into battle, that he had the vision to take this city into the next millennium.
So he'd found his successor, someone to perpetuate his legacy.
I was just a bridge between the two.
Tom would inherit the kingdom, my father would never have to step down, be a sort of mayor emeritus.
He thought the world of your father.
We all did.
Yes, but his tenure did end, didn't it?
How about you?
Have you thought about it, the end?
What it would look like?
When you talk to him, tell him to meet me at the house at 4:00 this afternoon and not to be late.
Of course.
Can I tell him what it's regarding?
Dr. Reyes, it's Sam Miller again.
I'd really appreciate your calling me back when you have a chance.
I have a few follow-up questions regarding the mayor's involvement in the redacted medical reports.
Again, my number is 555-0158.
Thank you.
Why am I here?
What do you expect to get from this, detective?
Retired.
I left the force not long after I arrested your brother here.
He looks good.
Good job, the right meds--
He's pulled his life together.
I've made my peace with what happened.
It was a long time ago.
I carried it with me in silence and now it's time to speak.
Gemma Lewis.
Remember her name?
When we found her, her neck was ripped open.
He did it with his teeth.
Left marks all over her, like an animal.
Do you remember?
I do.
What do you want?
What do you think would happen to him, to mani, if all the details of the case were to finally be revealed?
And not only that, but that you agreed to alter medical evidence in your report to make those details go away to save him?
There's a statute of limitations.
Class X felony--
Aggravated criminal sexual assault.
It means he's accountable for up to 20 years after the victim turns 18.
Plenty of time for another trial.
And with the dental records and the DNA--
Just tell me what you want.
Remove Tom Kane from the toxic-waste equation, make a simple statement you acted on your own.
He had nothing to do with it.
Some deals are worth doubling down on.
No?
The first secret that she has...
In a way, I admire her.
"Man hath no greater love than to lay down his life for his brother."
Except she laid down the lives of innocent children to save her werewolf brother.
And what does that make me?
- I should've called.
- I told you I'd bring them by when I got them.
I just wanted some fresh air, clear my head.
- I thought--
- Can I get you anything?
- Some water or--
- Yeah, some water'd be nice.
You look tired.
Yeah, maybe a little.
I'm not as resilient as I used to be.
That young man I saw leave--
- Darius?
- Thanks.
He helps out.
You two seem close.
Dad.
I know.
It's a little late for me to be asking you questions about your-- Your boyfriends.
Only by about 15 years.
It's not too late.
Well, what does he do to help out?
He transports supplies, that sort of thing.
- Supplies?
- Dad.
Look, I don't want this to be difficult.
I want to tell you the truth and be honest about things.
- Me too.
- I can't afford to be compromised.
I know that.
I'm on top of it.
I know what I'm doing.
Trust me, okay?
It's not too late for you to start doing that.
I promise you, he's as stunned as the rest of the city by her accusations.
That's the problem.
His word against mother Teresa's.
And now with this brewing class action suit ahead of him--
We've been here before, countless times.
These accusations are politically motivated.
We know it.
We can see it.
Tom's always fighting off challenges like this, and he's always survived.
Yes, but this time he's got Elliot biting at his heels.
Your Elliot?
Since he joined Bollingworth, Sanford Wexler.
Watch out.
Young Mr. McGantry is looking for a game-changer to make his name on.
I'm sure he is, win or lose.
Look, I'm not gonna bullshit you, Meredith.
I don't give a damn who sits in city hall as long as there's consistency about the way we do things.
I know you know what I mean.
And I've always had a soft spot for you and your father, so I'm gonna give you a heads up.
There are some people making some serious moves against Tom.
- How serious?
- Usually these threats Peter out.
It's almost impossible to unseat an incumbent unless a star candidate presents himself.
Who?
Drop the naivety.
It doesn't suit you.
It's a town of two when it comes to politics, you know that.
This kid is gathering a serious head of steam, could do anything with it.
Tom needs to watch his back.
It doesn't matter what we recommend.
Our hands are tied until we get a directive from the mayor.
I'm getting fried out there.
- Should I go--
- No, stay where you are.
Schedule a press conference today at 2:00.
Yes sir, and the talking points?
Dr. Reyes will be retracting her former statement, absolving the mayor's office of any involvement
- in a cover-up.
- Can I leak in advance on the reason?
No, she has agreed to make the statement.
That, for the moment, will be enough.
Will she be taking questions?
Sir, maybe we should prepare against pushback, questioning the viability of recanting such an explosive accusation without explaining it.
There's no need.
- But in the public's view--
- This has nothing to do with the public's confidence in the mayor.
It's a message aimed at a different constituency.
- Thank you.
- Sir, one more thing.
It's urgent.
Bensenville class action suit-- I spoke with them this morning.
- They have us over a barrel.
- Stop.
Do you know who I am?
Yes sir, I believe so.
Spectators stand on the sidelines shaking their heads, lacking the balls.
Do you know what I mean?
- No sir.
- When Truman nuked Japan, when Lincoln sent boys out to kill their cousins, you think they gave a shit about their approval rating?
- No sir.
- Fuck the spectators.
If there's another city in this country that takes better care of its citizens, you tell me now which one you think it is.
Anyone?
Good.
If in the course of doing what I believe is best for this city there is collateral damage,
who here wants to explain to me the position of those on the sidelines shaking their heads?
Good.
Now you were saying about this lawsuit?
Nothing, sir.
Just get me a deal.
I will settle this one.
They should've proposed one already anyway.
That's what I'm hearing.
It'salreadyunderway unless you announce you're not gonna seek reelection.
- Who else is involved?
- I don't know.
Ross-
- Find out, dig.
I need to know where he's vulnerable.
I'm fucking done with him-- Impeachment hearings.
Did you find her yet, the nurse?
- Not yet.
We will though.
- Soon.
I can't afford to wait, not now.
I would first like to say how grateful...
I am to Dr. Reyes for her willingness to come here and set the record straight.
It takes character and courage to admit a mistake.
This is an example of the kind of integrity that has defined her career.
Dr. Gabriela Reyes.
I wish to amend the statement
I made yesterday regarding the redacted medical reports.
Jesus Christ!
- Mayor Kane had nothing at all to do with it.
- What?
I acted entirely alone.
I regret any aspersions
I might have cast on the Kane administration
- or on the mayor himself...
- No.
No no no no.
- ...
Whose commitment to the health and welfare...
- No.
- ...
Of the citizens of Chicago is and has always been...
- Motherfucking--
Above reproach.
What did you get on her?
It's not gonna work.
Reversing a huge public statement this quickly is only gonna raise public suspicion.
But this isn't about the public.
This is aimed at us, at me, at every alderman and ward boss.
You know what he's saying?
He's saying, "come after me, motherfucker, because I'm staying where I am
"and your potential star witness is no more."
Impeachment?
Gone.
Period.
Thank you.
I know how difficult this was for you.
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.
Change anything?
Not if we jump on it before he's had time to recover.
He's upped the game, so we hit him back harder--
His own man running against him.
Speaks volumes.
Look, we have to be decisive and move fast.
I need your answer by tonight.
What are you doing home?
I just needed a break.
I wanted to see you and see the kids.
Ben, four days to the primary-- What do you mean a break?
The kids can wait.
I can wait.
We'll see enough of each other in Springfield.
Let's just get there.
I missed you.
Come on, cut it out.
Be serious.
Should I be worried?
No, everything's fine.
You should go.
If the kids see you, it'll only make things worse.
It's better they believe you weren't here at all.
Ben.
I know it's hard, but everything will be okay.
As soon as this is over, everything is gonna be so much easier.
- Whatcha got?
Whatcha got?
- Come on, gimme the ball.
Hey!
Oh boy!
Come on, man.
You're lucky, boy.
Oh man.
- Come on, man.
- Hey, heads up.
Shoulda called.
You just don't drop by around here.
I did.
You didn't answer.
- What's the matter?
- Your father.
I didn't like seeing him at the clinic
- and I didn't like him seeing me.
- It's fine.
I told him you work there.
- And?
- And what?
Did he believe it?
Well, you do, sort of.
It's not a joke-- What I do, who he is.
I know that.
I told you he's fine.
I have it under control.
- Hey.
- D!
- Shit!
Fuck.
- What's the matter?
- Oh, I don't like this.
- No, it's just in case.
- It's okay.
- Oh shit.
- Move it.
Come on, man, go!
- What's going on?
- Run!
- Come on!
Let's go!
- What's going on?
- Run!
Run!
Go through here.
I'll meet up with you later.
- Go go.
- Fuck.
- Oh fucking a.
- Ah!
Yeah.
Hey, now come on, man.
Okay.
You just wait here, okay?
- Don't--
- Shh, shh!
Hit him!
Come on.
Anybody home?
Over here.
Here here.
- Will he be okay?
- I don't know.
I'm gonna call the police.
What the fuck are you thinking?
We should call the police?
We should call the police?
- Where do you think we are, huh?
- I just thought--
Thought what?
Who do you think I am?
What do you think all this is, some fucking project?
Some fucking Robin Hood shit?
Fucking fairy tale?
- That's not fair.
- This is real and it's fucking dangerous.
And there is no fucking help.
Do you get that?
So go back to your shelter where you can feel good about yourself for helping some poor colored people.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh baby.
Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
The situation has changed since her confession.
Confession?
Hardly.
Coercion more like it.
Still, it changes everything.
He could come back.
Impeachment was always just a short-term opportunity.
We have to stay the course on this-
- Just keep our heads, keep cool, play the long game.
- Yeah, the long game.
- Look, we hit him with the kid first and roll from there on.
We can't afford to break ranks.
- No.
- What he put on for us today in that press room was a pretty puppet show.
Don't flinch.
- We need you.
- See, you've got nothing to lose.
If he even finds out that I know about our play dates, let alone that I'm involved, it is over.
I am fucked.
Don't you ever get tired of being that man's bitch?
It's been a long time.
My neighborhood has benefited greatly from mayor Kane's generosity.
- What are you saying?
- I don't know.
Just that maybe it's not the right time.
Maybe we wait.
- We wait?
- Yeah.
I can't force you into anything.
Just know this:
You are more than what he allows you to be.
More than just some affirmative action spic who brown-nosed his way into the council chamber.
You are right at the head of the fastest-growing immigrant population in the state, not to mention the country.
Now that's something he should acknowledge with more respect.
I would.
Oh what?
Who?
Oh look.
Grr.
How y'all doing?
Yes.
Ezra Stone.
I just don't know what's wrong with him.
It's been going on for months.
- I didn't sign up for that.
- Hm-Mmm.
Hm-Mmm.
His skin, his coloring--
It's eating him from the inside.
Mmm, well, he's only gonna get worse.
- I know.
- So what do you want me to do?
Get rid of him, because he's gonna bring you down too.
Do it before he gets any worse.
- Oh.
- He's an embarrassment.
I think he wets his bed.
You're stronger than him.
- Oh.
- Yes, you always have been.
- Daddy.
- Do what you need to do.
Things must go on.
I'm here.
I'm right here.
Tom.
Peter, good to see you.
Oh, it's nice to be invited.
I haven't been here in quite some time.
It's still a beautiful place.
My compliments.
- Thank you.
- Would you like a drink?
Oh, no thanks.
I didn't want to divulge to Peter the reason you arranged for this little tete-a-tete in too much detail without you being here.
You have your own inimitable way of expressing your concerns.
I thought it best to wait.
The price one pays for a long marriage--
Predictability, I'm afraid.
But Peter here is aware of Mr. Miller's dogged nature.
- Are you?
- Well, I read his column.
- He's bright, impulsive.
- Let's cut the shit, Peter.
He's burying me and Bentley doesn't have the balls to stop him.
Well, why should he?
Every outlet's running with the story.
What difference does one reporter make?
He broke the story.
His column leads the charge.
He goes dark, it takes considerable wind out of sails.
Well, I don't know, Tom.
It's selling papers.
- Quid pro quo.
- Are you gonna be around long enough for quid pro quo?
The art of political survival--
One day at a time.
You make it through one, then the next.
String enough days together, people forget.
They move on to newer matters.
I need a breather--
Just a little-
- Through the gubernatorial primary.
Well, there's a tower-- My tower.
I've been operating a radio station from it.
It has recently and quite suddenly been designated a Chicago landmark.
- You know it, I believe.
- Yes.
So now I can't make any alterations to accommodate a new broadcast tower, which is something I'm very anxious to do.
There are nine people on the landmark commission, all nine appointed by you.
I'll see what I can do.
It was a pleasure.
Next time it'll be the four of us and I'll do the cooking.
He doesn't keep me around just for my looks.
Thanks a lot.
- Good night.
- Bye-bye.
Farewell.
Ah.
Don't ever blind-side me again.
It was the right play to make.
Don't get ahead of yourself.
I would strongly advise against it.
Ezra, we're glad, believe us.
He put impeachment out of play.
But the real problem is how the people see him out there in the street.
They're not buying it.
The press conference just made it look like he bullied that woman into recanting.
And the kid's charismatic, but without Kane, why would we want him?
He's unconnected, inexperienced.
- What are you saying?
- Look, I gotta tell ya--
Cullen looks solid right now.
He's a known quantity, been doing the job for years.
That's good for contracts, relationships.
Everything that stands today remains stable with him.
- We want stability.
- Kane is your stability.
If he's in city hall.
But if he isn't,
Zajac's nothing but a smile.
Frank, what's the temperature in the 37th?
My precinct captains are waiting, ready to mobilize and get out the vote whichever way Tom wants to go.
But I agree with everyone else--
As things stand, one choice is easier to pull for than the other.
No matter who wins the primary,
Tom Kane is staying in city hall, of that I am sure.
And I'm also sure that he will look back on this time and remember those who were able to overcome difficulties and deliver a majority for treasurer Zajac in their wards.
Then he will ask me for the names of those who did not.
That must've been some car accident.
How come the rest of you didn't get damaged?
All depends on how you go through the windshield, I guess.
- The angle.
- Yeah.
Why am I here, Mr. Ross?
How close are you to Lalo Mata?
- He's my alderman.
- That's it?
I've known him since I was little, from the neighborhood.
He's like my uncle.
And he's thrown some business your way in the past.
We're very grateful for that.
- Suppose it were to stop.
- Excuse me?
What if there were no more contracts?
That would not be good.
Mr. Ruiz, can I speak with you frankly?
Yes yes, by all means.
There's a shift going on within the city administration.
Things are going to be different and soon.
I'm sorry to say that alderman Mata has found himself on the wrong side of that shift.
- Uh-huh.
- This shift means that contracts that were Mr. Mata's to dispense would now be mine to award as I saw fit...
Yes.
Which is why I asked to speak to you today.
I wanted to let you know that I'd like to continue working with you and your company.
You are an integral part of how the city contracts are effectively and economically carried out.
Thank you, sir.
That-
- That's it?
Yes, that's it.
- Thank you, Mr. Ross.
- Mr. Ruiz.
Uh, Mata-- Alderman Mata-- so he's not involved anymore?
Soon he won't be.
Not even as an alderman?
I doubt it.
Thank you, Mr. Ross.
- Yes sir?
- Get me alderman Mata on the phone, please.
Sir, it's ringing.
You gonna get that?
Dental records.
You understand.
See, 20 years from now when the city council decides to turn this new terminal into a shopping mall and some nutball like me finds your skeleton, nobody'll know who the fuck it is.
Not indian burial sites, cement foundations or, uh, aldermen.
I should cut off your fingertips, avoid prints, but then soft tissue starts rotting almost immediately.
Did you know that if you bury a pig under the sidewalk, the cement starts to smell like pigshit?
Like coffee.
And then there's bloat.
Just imagine if your body began pushing up the dirt.
Hmm?
So this is gonna be a little tricky, but your body's gotta be ventilated.
The foundation that we're laying tomorrow, you know what it's for?
The executive terminal.
Huh?
Perfect, right?
You can spend eternity kissing the feet of los jefes while they walk on your face, just like you did when you were alive.
Don't think of this as the end, Lalo.
Think of it as...
As a transition.
Like everything in life, no one can live forever.
Hey.
Burns like hell, I know.
But lye's the best thing to speed the decomposition.
We'll do it publicly--
A press conference where you'll announce that you're dropping out of the gubernatorial race in order to focus on your upcoming candidacy for mayor.
- Sounds good.
- And I want you to hold it in front of city hall.
Mr. Zajac, nice to see you again.
Have a nice night.
Tom.
Thomas Kane?
Hand it to me.
You've been served.
The Bensenville suit.
What happened to the goddamn deal?
- I'll look into it.
- What the fuck is going on around here?
What about the old man's nurse?
- We've got a lead.
- Find her, Stoney, for God's sake.
Mrs. Kane.
Thank you for meeting me.
I don't have long.
I have only one question.
Are you prepared for the wrath of my husband?
Because it'll be unlike any you've ever felt before.
That's a long drive for one question.
Running against him won't be easy.
I can help you win.
I guess that's not a question after all.
I know it's freaky.
but what you need to get your head around, Axl, is that your family are all gods.
Gods.
Norse gods.
Very funny.
Ha-ha.
Am I a god now?
I feel like a god.
Of course you feel like a bloody god.
Which god?
Odin.
Odin.
If he is Odin, you know that changes everything, right?
Yeah, I know.
You haven't even told your wife.
She's a mortal who knows nothing.
When he returns, he shall have two hearts.
Are you a powerful god?
You bet.
The tip of the arrow wedged between his ribs.
It's like he's got two hearts now.
You did precisely what you were told not to and managed only to complete the prophecy.
Well, well done.
You are the living incarnation of Odin.
You need to find a woman.
I can handle that.
Not just any woman, Frigg.
If Odin and Frigg are reunited, we will rule as gods once again.
If you die before this quest is complete, we all die too.
No pressure then.
So, I can go now?
You may go, Dawn.
Your work today has been exemplary.
I live to wait upon you.
Another thing I love about you.
It's, uh, good to see you're over your injury.
My doctor says I need to take it easy.
You and Anders must see the same doctor.
But, uh, you're good to get your own beers now?
We will struggle on without you.
See you, Dawn.
Bye, Dawn.
It's good you're better.
Taking it easy.
Not that you can do that for the rest of your life, which is also the rest of my life as it turns out.
Mike should be here if we're going to talk about that kind of stuff.
Mike's a pussy.
Mike said we should wait for a sign from Olaf.
He reckons Olaf's way more onto it when he comes back after a surf.
And while we're waiting for mike and Olaf to get their shit together,
you might drop dead and take us all with you, not to mention the many innocent people that will perish in whatever cataclysmic event your death provoked.
I don't need this kind of pressure, man, not so soon after some woman put an arrow in me.
You lived.
Forget her, she was a freak.
Who tried to kill me.
Listen, you need to start putting it about.
Putting what about?
You, you egg.
I'm Odin!
Don't call me an egg.
Yes, but like an egg, you need to get laid.
- How come?
- To find Frigg, dip-shit.
It's not a very nice name, is it, Frigg.
It's kind of cold.
I bet all those other goddesses have much nicer names.
Can you focus, please?
We have to get started on this, Axl.
- How?
- How?
By letting you loose on the womenfolk, of course.
* My god, I'm beaten *
* When I fall down, I fall down, on my knees, I fall. *
I'm very sorry.
We did everything by the book.
Exactly what you said, again.
I don't get what we did wrong.
I understand, Valerie, how you feel right at this moment, but bear in mind the pregnancy rate for...
I know what the fucking pregnancy rates are for woman my age.
It's because I'm a god, isn't it?
It is a real possibility, Mike, that your god sperm and
Valerie's mortal eggs can never fertilize, even though to human eyes, they seem entirely compatible.
I'm why we can't have a child.
But who knows?
Now that Odin has returned, I mean, maybe everything has changed.
Maybe you'll be able to impregnate women just like this.
But the good news is if a couple such as yourselves who decide to go for the third cycle, there's a rebate.
We'll think about it.
What was that all about?
What?
"We'll think about it."
We'll find the money, Mike.
It's not that.
Then what?
I don't want you to have to go through that again.
I'll go through it as many times as it takes to have our baby.
Hello?
Yes, speaking.
Sorry, he did what?
Well, Rob has always been something of a medical miracle, as you know.
His physical state is remarkable given everything.
But you said something had changed.
Yes.
He is crying.
That's not unusual in vegetative patients.
It's another development I'm talking about.
What development?
That one.
Oh, my god.
He's been quite chatty, really.
The doctors have been in and there's been no change to his baseline status, just... this.
What the hell is he saying?
Who knows?
It's okay, Rob.
We're here.
Let him go, Val!
You can ruin him when he gets back.
Don't you get too pissed.
And drive carefully.
Olaf, the reason I gave you a phone is so that you could answer it when I need to talk to you.
Now, I don't care where you are or how good the surf is,
I need to talk to you.
So answer your bloody phone.
Logically, he's on the right track.
You are going to have to eliminate many to find the one.
By sleeping with them?
As is Anders' take on it.
Anders thinks with his dick.
Yes, he does.
Do you have a problem with bedding many women?
No.
No way, I'm not like that.
I'm totally into women.
I wasn't implying you were gay, Axl.
I'm suggesting that you, unlike Anders, have morals.
Is that a problem?
Let's say you bed a woman and she's not Frigg.
You then have to move on, forget her, even if you're totally into her.
But I have to do it or you die when I die.
Well, lucky for us you're totally into women then, because logically you have a lot of women to sleep with.
The gods fled Norway in the early 1870s.
They ended up in Central Hawke's Bay, where they farmed, fought, fucked and caused the occasional natural disaster.
But they also drifted apart because gods and goddesses can't stand to be around each other.
So, bottom line, as far as you're concerned, is you seek one goddess.
And she could be anywhere.
There are two million women in New Zealand.
But I won't have to sleep with all of them, right?
I mean, she won't be, like, Korean, eh?
Probably not.
So, starting with those of Scandinavian descent would be the logical way to go.
Hot blonde chicks.
Or not.
Just 'cause you're 21 years old doesn't mean she's 21.
Logically, she could be 70.
or 45 and happily married with two kids.
Or a lesbian.
Or really, really ugly.
Or on her O.E. Or she hasn't even been reincarnated yet and we have to wait until she is.
And one day you're 90 and we're all dead already and your whole life has been wasted on a fruitless search.
You can be really depressing sometimes.
So I'm told.
I like the idea that you just look at her and something goes ping.
Me too.
I've been summoned to Mike's for dinner.
Something is afoot.
You want to come?
Shit no.
Okay, cool.
And could you not tell Mike about this conversation?
Not tell Mike that Anders is trying to pimp you out to the world.
I can live without that lecture.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You're home.
Um, this is Jamie.
We grew up in Waiheke together.
This is Axl, my flatmate.
Yeah, we bumped into each other today.
I kind of ended up inviting myself for dinner.
Is that okay?
Sure, yeah.
That's cool.
You can try again
We haven't decided if we will.
Well, if you need money for...
It's not about money.
You hear stories all the time about couples that get pregnant when they stop trying.
You do hear those stories.
A lot.
That wasn't helping, was it?
Not much.
But we forgive you.
Hi.
Hi, Ty.
Oh, I love you, man.
Val.
Mike.
Olaf.
No surf, Olaf?
Anywhere?
Dead.
Bummer.
Suppose you'll want some dinner.
Only if there's some going.
Thanks for returning my call.
What call was this?
On the phone I gave you.
Small technical problem, it's at the bottom of a long drop
Coma Rob?
Don't call him that.
It's a persistent vegetative state, it's not a coma.
Well, Coma Rob sounds better than Rob the Persistent Vegetable.
Does this mean he's waking up?
It means he was talking the same Norse gobbledygook that you were spouting.
How long has he been in the coma now?
It's not a coma.
Been a vegetable then.
15 years, give or take.
Why, is that important?
Well, I don't know.
Do you think it's important?
I'm asking you.
You asked how long, like it was important.
Rob is inextricably linked to you.
So, if it's important to you, it's probably important to him.
He's in a coma ... or whatever it's called.
Breathing is important to him.
How does whatever's happening to me affect him?
We are connected.
You, Coma
Rob, Axl, us, all connected.
So, is he waking up?
That's something only Rob knows.
Another one for your collection.
God, the models in this town are a mangy lot.
Yet you still attempt to sleep with many of them.
Would you turn gay for her?
Who am I charging this to, by the way?
Call it a special secret project.
I don't have that budget code.
Uh, then charge it to the vodka people.
They've got the money.
Uh, the dragon lady called from the Northern Dragons again.
You deal with her.
She likes you.
Because she hates you.
It's about Carla Svenson.
What's she done this time?
There are photos at an Elemeno P gig dancing with no top on.
Oh, doing her bit to publicize the great sport of net ball, no doubt.
It was an all-ages gig, the average age being about 12.
Giving the girls something to aspire to and the boys something to dream about.
When you've sorted out your sex life, please deal with it, Anders.
Oh, get me the photo of carla with her knocks out.
That'll help.
He's getting look books from modelling agencies;
anyone who can pass as Scandinavian.
Bragi never was the brightest god.
She's a goddess, ipso facto she must look like a goddess.
What if she does?
If she is?
In the remote possibility they find her first, we shall deal with it then.
But for now, we will go about this our way.
Through the science of genealogy, I will find her.
Don't you worry about that.
It's sad we can't just kill him.
We've been through this before, Stacey.
You can't kill Odin without instigating a huge catastrophe.
Thousands will die with him.
What if the earthquake last time was actually a coincidence?
We live in a city of many volcanoes.
Do you really want to put that to the test?
We could kill him from far away.
Well, when you've developed your intercontinental missiles,
Stacey, why don't you get back to me?
I found her.
Found who?
Who do you think, dickhead?
When I actually am Odin,
I'm so going to waste you if you don't stop calling me names.
And how did you find the Frigg?
Okay, I don't actually know that she's the Frigg.
But she is a great start, hmm?
She looks scary.
No, no, no, she looks like a goddess.
No, I'm not getting any vibe.
You don't get a vibe off a picture.
You meet her, nail her, see if god stuff happens
She's about a hundred leagues out of my league.
Don't sell yourself short, okay?
You're Odin, and with me as your wingman, it's a level playing field.
Plus, she'll go for just about anything with a dick after she's had a few.
Godness and whore, great
What's your problem?
Many, many guys would give their left nut for a crack at Carla.
Actually, I've met someone.
- Someone?
- Yes.
Is this someone the Frigg?
Probably not.
Does she have a name?
Jamie.
Okay, so you've got the hoon for someone called Jamie.
It is not a hoon, I know what a hoon looks like
Now, watch as she falls to the power of the Zeb.
Oh, you made a spiritual Connection.
Fuck you.
But yes, we have.
She's really smart and really funny and great to talk to.
And we clicked, you know?
We clicked.
That's so beautiful.
I think I just threw up a little bit in my mouth.
Did you nail her?
You know, for the god of poetry, you are a crude prick.
Did thou embed thy staff of love in the sweet cave of her womanly folds?
No, I didn't.
But...
It was a great dinner.
Thank you.
No probs.
It was nice to see you again.
Great to meet you, Axl.
Yeah, you too.
Big ups for eating Gaia's weird food.
Shut up.
It was delicious, seriously.
But if you ever fancy something less Waiheke, give me a call.
- I can murder a good steak.
- You're on.
That's so beautiful.
But what does it have to do with Carla?
I'm not like you, Anders.
I don't chase skirt all over town.
You don't have to chase Carla.
All you have to do is the fun bit.
I have a date with Jamie.
Can we just leave it at that for now?
You made a date already?
I texted her last night.
You texted her straight after she left here?
Do you know how desperate that makes you look?
Fuck off, Anders.
Hey, Axl, listen, you may not like it, but your life is now my life and Ty's life and Mike's life.
So get used to me being on your case.
Call me when you finish playing with yourself and your girlfriend.
Talk some sense into him.
Make him realize his obligation is to his family.
Like bagging himself a net baller?
Anything that isn't waiting for Mike to get his shit together.
Mike has his own problems to be dealing with right now.
Mike lives for problems.
Not these ones.
Why?
What's up?
He'll tell you if he wants.
I can't see that happening.
Can you?
True.
But you have to promise not to be an asshole about this.
Cross my heart, hope to die... hopefully not because Axl dies.
Mike and Val have been trying IVF and it's not working.
I'm genuinely sorry to hear that.
They deserve kids.
Yeah, whatever.
But I think Mike is seeing this in the context of recent events.
The Odin thing?
What's that got to do with the fact that Val can't get knocked up?
Uh, it's kind of merged with the fact that Rob has started talking.
Coma Rob?
Yeah, we're not meant to call him that.
I'm not seeing the link.
He's speaking the same Nordic gibberish
Olaf lapsed into when Axl became Odin.
Wow, intriguing.
Does this mean Rob's waking up?
No one knows.
'Cause if Rob does wake up,
I know one god with a lot of explaining to do.
So, have you tried getting her pregnant the usual way?
Of course I have.
We've been trying to get pregnant for years.
Maybe you're not doing it right.
Olaf, there's nothing wrong with the way we've been doing it.
I have no problem getting chicks pregnant.
Yeah, well aware of your history in that department.
I'm only saying, god sperm and human eggs work fine when it comes to me.
So, how does Coma Rob fit in?
That is among the many, many things i would like you to tell me.
Strangely, I don't feel qualified to answer this.
It's me.
I'm the connection.
Or you're overplaying your importance in the cosmic order.
You're the one that was banging on about how everything is connected.
All of us, not just you and Rob.
But I'm the reason he's in a coma.
You said it wasn't a coma.
Whatever the fuck it is,
I'm still the prick who put him in it.
Hello?
All hail Odin.
What do you want, Anders?
To apologize.
Seriously.
I came on way too strong this morning.
You're still getting used to the whole deal.
It was wrong of me to put pressure on you.
And I hope you have a good time on your date tonight.
Why?
Because I'm proud of you for getting back on the horse.
What horse?
How about the last chick you went after put an arrow in your chest.
If that was me, that would definitely be playing on my mind.
This is way different from that.
I know, that's what I'm saying.
Go out, have a good time, and when you're ready to talk about the other thing, over to you.
So, how long are you staying for this time, Olaf?
As long as I'm needed.
Hey, I'm sorry to hear the IVF thing isn't working out for you.
But it's good you're thinking about trying again.
Science is amazing these days.
Yes, it is.
You'll make awesome parents.
That was the plan.
I'll sort out dessert.
What the hell was that?
I was giving you an opening.
To do what?
To talk to her.
You need to talk.
Thanks for that, Olaf.
Hello?
Oh, hey.
It's Anders here, Axl's brother.
Um, I need to get hold of him.
I believe he's on a date and he's turned his cell phone off.
I was wondering if you knew where he is.
Yeah, I do.
So, you never knew your dad.
- No, I was a baby when he left.
- God.
And how did your mom cope with raising... oh, excuse me.
Any chance we could get proper steak knives?
how did your mom cope with raising four boys on her own?
Not well.
She, um, she kind of shot through when I was six.
My big brother Mike took over being dad... and mum.
How did you end up being so normal?
Who says I'm normal?
Thanks.
If you're going to stab something, you need the proper implement.
Depends on who you're stabbing.
I was thinking the steak.
That's a relief.
I'm a bit sensitive around sharp objects.
The last woman I, um... she kind of... shot me with an arrow.
Get the hell out.
Why?
There was alcohol involved.
Far out.
Told you I'm not normal.
Well, you're safe with me.
You alright?
Yeah.
All good.
Sorry about Olaf.
You don't need to apologize for your family.
Yeah, I do, actually.
So, have you thought about it?
What if we're never meant to have a baby?
But the doctors say there's no reason why we can't.
I know what the doctors say.
What if... it's never meant to be, if it's fate?
I don't believe in fate.
I believe in you and me.
- Hi.
- Hi.
How was your date?
It was...pretty good actually.
That's good.
- Jamie's really nice, eh?
- Yeah, she is.
Hey, did your brother get a hold of you?
Which one?
Anders.
He rang.
He was... wanted to know where you were.
Yeah.
Yeah, he did.
Prick.
He's here now.
Hello.
Is your girlfriend here?
Her name is Jamie, and no.
Do you think I'm a fuck-wit?
Uh, yeah, sometimes.
You sent that vodka girl to the pub.
Ah, fair cop.
Well spotted.
It was a reminder.
You have a quest.
What happened to "No pressure, Axl"?
I was backing off to give you time to come to your senses and then I realized that was a stupid idea.
So, this Jamie chick, is she the Frig?
She's a nice girl who likes me for who I am.
But you're a god.
Not that me!
The real me.
Ah.
Did you plough her?
Thank you for dinner.
Thank you for not stabbing me with your steak knife.
You should probably know now.
I have this rule about not sleeping with a guy on a first date.
No, no, I wasn't thinking about that at all.
But if you want a second date.
No, I didn't.
Not that it's any of your business.
Everything you do is my business, Axl, as one who will die if you die without ever having tasted the Frig.
Look, if your girl isn't the Frig and you want to keep seeing her, that's cool.
See her all you want, but, you have a duty, Axl, and this is where duty starts.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
It's called cheating.
Men have been doing is since time began.
Yes, morally it's a little bit dodgy but there's a greater good here, Axl.
Look at her, mate.
She's a walking wet dream.
How can you resist that?
She scares the crap out of me is how.
And I'd quite like my first time to be with someone who doesn't terrify me.
First time on the quest?
First time ever?
You're 21 and you're a virgin?
How is that possible?
Look, it's not for want of trying, okay?
It was just tricky living at Mike and Val's place.
Oh, oh, sorry.
Uh, just looking for reading glasses here, so
Don't mind me.
Oh, sorry.
Hi, Stella.
How's your mom?
It was the main reason I moved.
But still no luck, eh?
It's like I'm cursed.
I mean, I'm not exactly a pig, right?
But have I ever gotten any?
Meanwhile the most useless pricks I know are doing the business.
Well, maybe you are cursed, but in a good way.
Maybe it was your fate to wait until you became Odin.
If you tell anyone about this the first thing I'll do when I get my powers is smite your ass.
Okay, you have my word as a god.
How about you look at it this way.
You have to pop your cherry sometime, right?
So what better way than to do it with...
All you got to do is hang on and go for the ride, bro.
I'd rather handle this my way.
You have no way except the way of the virgin.
If you hook up with Karla and she's not the Frigg the worst that can happen is you get a roll in the hay with a very desirable woman.
And then you go back to Jamie and get it on, except now you're over your first night moves so it's going to be so much better for the both of you.
Especially her.
Yeah, okay.
How?
Shit, I know you're a virgin but...
You know what I mean.
Pick you up about five?
What, tonight?
Yeah, tonight.
I got a date with Jamie.
Give her the flick.
I can't give her the flick.
No, tell her you've scored a job tonight, which is true actually.
Okay, you might think of it as a job but I don't, so...
It is an actual job, numb nuts.
You get paid and everything.
They have six of them?
No, not that bit.
The paying gig first, the fun time after.
It's win-win for a poor student god like yourself.
You're hiding.
No, I'm not.
I'll hide with you.
if you go and stay, how about making rent noises again?
You know what this room needs to be a really good man-hiding space?
Pool table.
Sometimes the connection is there is no connection.
You can't have a child because you can't.
What happened to Rob happened because it happened.
I'm really sorry.
We know!
You keep saying.
But I am.
Any money is good.
Never a truer word spoken.
We can go out tomorrow.
When he's flush with cash.
What is this job exactly?
Ah, it's kind of a performance, crowd motivational thing at the Northern Dragons home game tonight.
Which means what?
You're the mascot.
The team bus ran over the usual mascot's foot at the last game.
It'll be fun.
You'll love it.
I am not dressing up in that.
What?
You love dressing up.
Remember that time you dressed up as a little smurf?
For a pub crawl.
I was pissed.
You owe me.
How is dressing like a dork meant to land me a net baller girl?
The other mascot guy nailed half the team before he got run over by the bus.
You're making that up.
Seriously.
Wing attack and wing defence on the same night on an away trip during the carnival.
Net ballers digs mascots sex
All you have to do is be here,
I'll do the rest.
Hey.
Are you the other team's mascot?
The team's motivational assistant.
So how was it for you dressing as a girl bunny every week?
I have no problem with that?
Really?
It would do my head in after a while.
I'm comfortable in my masculinity.
Do your friends know that you dress as a girl bunny every week?
Look, mate, this is how it works.
You and me, we're enemies, right?
I'll shake your hand after the game, but until then, bring it on 'cause you're the one who'll be going down.
Dick.
Hey, how's it going?
I'm not the usual mascot.
Just filling in.
The other guy got his foot run over.
I know, I was there.
I heard him scream.
Well, of course.
You need to lead us on now.
What?
The mascot leads us out.
Oh.
It's impossible not to watch your every move.
You draw the eye.
But you know that, don't you?
- You're the P.R. Guy, right?
- I am.
You hear about the photo.
I only did it for a day.
I don't care about the photo,
If that wanker bunny slaps me one more time
I'll punch his lights out!
Relax, you did great.
Hey, hey, hey.
Okay, that does it.
I said come here.
Axl.
Axl!
Get of me!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Figh Fight!
Let me at him.
Let me at him.
I'll bloody kill him!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you.
What's up?
Are you watching the net ball on TV?
No.
Are you?
Nothing wrong with a man watching net ball.
If you say so.
Well, you should.
Tonight of all nights you really should.
Your brother tells me you were defending my honour.
When?
The fight.
Oh yeah.
Yeah!
My hero.
They don't have, like, drug testing in net ball?
Hello, Mike.
What are you up to, Anders?
Moving things along.
Doing what we were put on this planet to do, you know, being gods among men.
Don't you do this.
You don't know what you're messing with!
But I know of no other way to find out.
You're phone's going to start ringing.
It will be Mike.
It's up to you what you do.
What say we take this party elsewhere, huh?
Oh, idiot, idiot!
No way is my first time involve you in there with me.
But you're up.
Take the lady a drink.
Thank you, Axl.
So, Anders says you're a virgin.
No, now way!
Not me.
Pity.
I always wanted to be a beautiful boy's first.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, I am.
Come with me.
Oh, look.
The cavalry.
Where's Axl?
I sent him on his way.
Drink?
Okay.
Sure.
On his way to do what?
To do what comes naturally of course.
You can't just unleash him on the world until we know what we are dealing with.
When is that going to occur, Mike?
When finally rejoins us on planet earth?
Face it, the only way we're going to know what's going to happen is by getting out there and actually doing it, not hiding from reality like you do.
Don't you dare use Axl to get what you want.
I want to become a god, Michael.
A proper god.
Not theses piss-weak versions we've become.
What's wrong with that?
Let Ty be the god he is, not the god of "Did someone leave the door open."
Even you.
You got a reason for Axl to succeed.
As gods we've got the power to bring your mate back from the land of the living dead.
Arise, Rob.
Rejoin the human race.
Unless it suits you for "Coma Rob" To remain in his coma.
I am here for Axl.
Everything else is in your fucked up head.
Oh god, oh god!
Karla?
Shit.
Axl's fine, Mike.
Axl's having the time of his life.
In fact, in his own way, he's learning what it's like to be a god.
And good oh him, I say.
She's dead!
I think I killed...her.
She' breathing, sort of.
But she will be alright, right?
Put your hands on her.
Oh, get off!
No, no, cold hands, dick.
Like the girl in the spa top her.
Nice work, ice man.
Fuck sake!
No, no, no, it's not like that.
You think you're not the frig.
You are Odin You should know.
Then no.
One down, two million to go.
Wait at the shop.
I'll look after her now.
Can you tell her sorry, and, um, and thanks.
Yeah, no.
All over it.
Bye-bye.
You're not really a driving talking kind of brother, are you?
Not like Anders.
Look, I know this is a big game to you and him
You've got a licence to screw around.
I know what that feeling is like.
"Look at me, I'm a god!"
Actually, the only reason I went through with it is
I thought I was doing the right thing for us.
Axl nothing gods do turns out well for people around them.
If you don't believe me, ask Rob.
What does coma Rob have to do with it?
Everything.
Not farting around, huh?
Where did that come from?
Call it a gift.
I was 21.
I was a god.
I was all god of games and...
I owned that pool table.
What's the matter?
No one else want to get their ass kicked.
Come on!
Oh, fuck!
Your break.
This is now wise.
Fuck 'em.
They don't own this place.
Let's just lose and leave, man.
Oh, I believe it's down-trouser tradition when all our balls are sunk and yours are still on the table.
Yeah.
Shit!
Shit!
Rob!
Rob!
Rob!
You just had your first lesson, Axl.
Just piss off!
And don't do anything ever without talking to me first.
Hey.
Weren't expecting to see you tonight.
It's fast work, eh.
Tough night.
It had its moments.
What?
We went to the game, man.
These guys forced me to pay money to watch net ball.
Oh, so you saw the fight?
We waited around for you afterwards to see if you were okay.
But you looked kind of busy.
Here he is.
Hey, that's really hot net ball chick.
Shut up!
We just went to the place for a drink, that's all.
Dude, I hope it wasn't your brother that gave you that hickey.
It was nothing.
Honest.
See, I told you it was only a root.
He likes you heaps, man.
Let's go.
Really?
You do what you like, but
I don't really go for guys who are players.
Oh, I'm not a player.
I swear!
Sure.
It's only a root, right?
I can give you a lift home.
Ta.
I still love her, you know.
I know when she brings me flowers.
I hear her when she talks to me.
She still loves me, Mike.
But you already know that.
Right?
You're in a coma.
Shut up.
It's not a coma.
What?
We'll do it.
Do what?
Go again.
To hell with the expense, to hell with everything.
To hell with me.
Let's make this bloody baby.
It's the hottest day in seven years.
A cloudless sky, and yet it will rain.
- Mom, we have to go.
- What time is it?
- Take your toothbrush out first.
- What time is it?
- Nine-thirty, Mom.
- What time does the bus leave?
Ten to ten.
In twenty minutes.
Red.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
You promised me, Mom.
I don't want you to get cancer.
- How do you know what cancer is?
- Internet.
Oh, Luca.
Green.
- Where did I leave the key?
- In the car, Mom.
- Shit.
- Mom.
- What is it?
-Don't use bad words.
I'm sorry.
Wait.
Luca, what am I going to do without you?
You'll be fine, Mom.
It's only for two weeks.
- Promise?
- Of course.
- Here you go, young man.
A cap.
- Thank you.
You're welcome...
Luca.
- Where are you going, Luca?
- To my Dad.
He'll pick me up in Paris and take me to the Coated Sewer.
- You're going to the Cote d'Azur.
- To the Cote d'Azur.
- Right.
Know what that means?
- No.
- The azure-blue coast.
- Wow.
- That's right.
Let's go.
- Azure blue is a very deep blue.
- Isn't that right, Mom?
- Absolutely.
Luca, don't forget to catch that butterfly for me.
- I promise.
- I love you.
I love you too.
- Say hello to Dad.
- I will.
- Don't smoke or it will start raining.
- I promise.
So Julius Pass paints portraits of people without seeing them?
Correct.
He uses his sense of touch, exploring their features with his hands.
- Amazing.
- And today his exhibition opens...
Cappuccino for the gentleman, fresh orange juice for the lady.
Very well.
Have a good day.
- Toni, are you crazy?
- I'm sorry, Felix, but I'm late.
- Can you park it for me?
- Having your period?
- Please, the key's inside.
- It's the last time.
They'll...
Please.
Hotel Mira Mare Berlin, Ostrowski.
How can I help you?
Of course, Mr Rubinstein.
- Wild boar, service please.
- Caramelized mango for table 26.
- Has anyone seen Antonia yet?
- No
In-Room Dining, Zylinski.
How can I help you?
English breakfast for 406.
- Suse, have you seen Antonia yet?
- No.
35 minutes late.
Where is she?
Have you seen Antonia today?
Must be Groundhog Day.
That's why a well-managed hotel should only hire homosexuals.
Because I can't get children and use them as an excuse to mess things up.
- Marcel, I...
- No, Antonia, it's enough.
After hearing me rave about my unfulfillable wish for a child... you ought to know I can't accept this drivel.
I just can't.
Okay, you're a single mother and you work at this hotel.
So?
Does that keep you from getting up, bringing your son to the bus... and showing up for work on time?
No.
Heavens, Toni.
If I had what you had, I'd work even longer and get up earlier.
I know, Marcel.
That's why it makes me...
Yes, I know.
That's why it makes you feel even worse.
I know, I know.
Now for the last time I'll do my duty as caring gay maitre d'hotel and say:
Let's forget it.
- You're the best.
- You'll be fired if it happens again.
- This is the very last time.
- Thank you.
And yet you still look like seven days of rain.
I wouldn't mind a downpour to wash the dust off the streets.
Of course.
Now slip out of your pitifully drab everyday clothes... and slip on your fairy tale costume, Cinderella.
- Thank you.
- Go on.
Hey, Antonia.
- My feet really hurt.
- Hello, Julia.
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing, I'm fine.
- I'm just sweating, that's all.
- You're sweating?
What are you talking about?
What's the matter?
What is it?
Antonia, come here.
What's wrong?
What happened?
I sweat, and I don't think that's sweat coming out of your eyes.
As surely as you menstruate every month, that's not sweat.
- You're crazy.
- And you're smiling.
- Sweetheart, what happened?
- I hate myself for it.
- It's so ridiculous.
It...
- I knew it was about a man.
- The moment I came in...
- No.
It's not about a man.
The only man...
He's not a man, he's my son.
- Luca?
- Yes, Luca.
He's in France with his Dad.
- I can't believe you gave in to her.
- I'm sorry.
Hello, Director.
Ostrowski, from the reception.
- Really?
- Yes.
I'd have been worried to death.
I mean, he's only seven.
- An independent young man.
- He really is very independent.
You know, for the first time in ages I can just feel that I...
I have...
What?
Since Luca's father...
Since Luca's father?
- Don't laugh at me.
- I'm not laughing at you.
Go on.
It's been seven years since I...
- ...
last made love.
- I can't believe it
- Seven years?
Really?
- Yes.
Toni, why didn't you tell me?
That can be arranged.
- Sweet of you.
What can be arranged?
- Dates.
- I don't have time for such things.
- For such things?
Listen to you.
You also have to think of yourself.
- As of now, you'll start doing so.
- Doing what?
Lightness.
Just take things lightly, and take some risks.
Let him bring you to bed.
Maybe he'll sing to you.
Who?
Who is going to sing to me?
Well, other men.
They really exist.
I've seen them.
But men aren't interested in me.
A woman with a child makes men blind to her.
Antonia, beauty can't be blemished.
And if Luca looks anything like you... he must be a gorgeous boy and not a blemish.
- I've never looked at it...
- Lightness, Antonia, lightness.
And now I'm going to shower.
My body is all sticky.
Bye, Antonia.
Such a beautiful name.
Much cooler than 'Toni'.
Thank you.
Is that her?
Ms Marin, do you understand what it's about?
Mr Zylinski told us he ordered you to restock the multipurpose wipes.
- Is that true?
- Yes, Director.
But when you went to the storeroom, there were none left.
- Correct.
- So I asked her to call.
Mr Zylinski, let Ms Marin continue.
And stop those conspiring glances.
- Director, it's obvious...
- Give Ms Marin a chance to speak.
I called our supplier, as we need the multipurpose wipes for housekeeping.
- And...
- And no one answered the phone.
Ms Marin, your effort is laudable, but the execution is unacceptable.
- It's a ground for dismissal.
- I know.
I'm really very sorry.
- How long have you been in service?
- Since the opening.
Five years.
In order for those five years to become many more... we expect top performances from everybody.
Why is that?
Because our guests expect top service from us.
The next time you race across the city... to find...what was it again?
-Multi-purpose wipes.
To find multi-purpose wipes, take the time... to drive to the service entrance and don't park in front.
And don't keep Mr...
-Jedinger.
And don't keep Mr Jedinger from welcoming our guests.
- Yes, Director.
- We'll leave it at a verbal warning.
If it wasn't for Mr Zylinksi, you might have to work at those awful hostels... those hostels popping up all over the city.
Eight-bed rooms, imagine.
Who are those people?
Eight beds.
- Terrible.
- Yes.
Good, that's been settled.
Mr Zylinski, have a good day.
- I'm glad we resolved this.
- So am I, Director.
- Ms Marin.
- Director.
- Mr Richter.
- Ostrowski.
Forgive me.
Mr Jedinger.
- Go back to your desk, you weasel.
- This will have consequences.
For your ass for sure, if we happen to meet at the shower one fine day.
- I'm sorry, Toni.
- I'm sorry, Felix, it's all my fault.
You see, sweetheart, everything's fine again.
- Cigarette?
- I quit smoking.
That's good news.
- I'd better get started.
- The list is on the board.
Don't smoke or it will start raining.
Let Ms Marin continue.
And stop those conspiring glances.
Lightness, Antonia, lightness.
Yes, Marcel?
Room service.
No, listen, I won't discuss it any further.
I selected 15 English-speaking nude models from your database.
I don't care.
Be glad Kilian Kerner isn't here to witness this screw-up.
I want you to suggest a way to solve the problem right now.
If I don't hear from you in five minutes, I won't use your services again.
Housekeeping.
Shit.
Man, Dennewitz.
No, hold on.
No, I'm already at the elevator.
I just pressed the elevator button.
Yes, of course I'm dressed up.
Yes, perfect.
Of course I'm excited.
Yes, this will be my day, absolutely.
How do you manage to get all those intellectuals from TV in your gallery?
Electric blankets.
I'm taking a taxi.
I'm in the elevator now.
I have a very bad...
Hello?
light gray
pink
Definitely not.
dark grey
Excuse me, please.
Let me tell you that you're all full of shit.
'Julius, you can't say that.'
No?
'No, no.' You're right, Dennewitz.
It's an honour and a great joy... to waste my time on you today.
'Julius.'
I mean spend, spend.
It's so hot, I could use a refreshment.
How about you?
'Yes, yes.'
Here, champagne for everyone.
'Yes, champagne.
Wow, wonderful.'
'How do you like it?
' 'Oh, I'm glad to hear that.'
'Those works have such power, and that even though he's blind.'
'No, because he's blind.' 'Amazing, incredible.' Cunts.
Don't stop.
Do you see my cigarettes anywhere?
Yes, over here.
Smoking isn't allowed here.
- Sorry, would you like one as well?
- I quit smoking.

- As of now, you'll start doing so.
- Doing what?
Lightness.
Just take things lightly, and take some risks.
Let him bring you to bed.
Maybe he'll sing to you.
Who?
Who is going to sing to me?
Well, other men.
They really exist.
I've seen them.
But men aren't interested in me.
A woman with a child makes men blind to her.
Antonia, beauty can't be blemished.
And if Luca looks anything like you... he must be a gorgeous boy and not a blemish.
- I've never looked at it...
- Lightness, Antonia, lightness.
And now I'm going to shower.
My body is all sticky.
Bye, Antonia.
Such a beautiful name.
Much cooler than 'Toni'.
Thank you.
Is that her?
Ms Marin, do you understand what it's about?
Mr Zylinski told us he ordered you to restock the multipurpose wipes.
- Is that true?
- Yes, Director.
But when you went to the storeroom, there were none left.
- Correct.
- So I asked her to call.
Mr Zylinski, let Ms Marin continue.
And stop those conspiring glances.
- Director, it's obvious...
- Give Ms Marin a chance to speak.
I called our supplier, as we need the multipurpose wipes for housekeeping.
- And...
- And no one answered the phone.
Ms Marin, your effort is laudable, but the execution is unacceptable.
- It's a ground for dismissal.
- I know.
I'm really very sorry.
- How long have you been in service?
- Since the opening.
Five years.
In order for those five years to become many more... we expect top performances from everybody.
Why is that?
Because our guests expect top service from us.
The next time you race across the city... to find...what was it again?
-Multi-purpose wipes.
To find multi-purpose wipes, take the time... to drive to the service entrance and don't park in front.
And don't keep Mr...
-Jedinger.
And don't keep Mr Jedinger from welcoming our guests.
- Yes, Director.
- We'll leave it at a verbal warning.
If it wasn't for Mr Zylinksi, you might have to work at those awful hostels... those hostels popping up all over the city.
Eight-bed rooms, imagine.
Who are those people?
Eight beds.
- Terrible.
- Yes.
Good, that's been settled.
Mr Zylinski, have a good day.
- I'm glad we resolved this.
- So am I, Director.
- Ms Marin.
- Director.
- Mr Richter.
- Ostrowski.
Forgive me.
Mr Jedinger.
- Go back to your desk, you weasel.

For your ass for sure, if we happen to meet at the shower one fine day.

You see, sweetheart, everything's fine again.

It's hermetically sealed.
And this is your paint color.

Jamaica!
And there you are.

And there's your dad, who's playing with his new toy instead of helping me paint.
Sorry.
I can help.
- Yeah?
Come on.
- If I wasn't...
If I wasn't filming I would help.
Go and get the other ladder.
Yeah, you should have a real ladder.
That's...
You know.
All right, that's a...
- Who's that?
- It's my sister.
She's here to check out the nursery.

This is so gorgeous.
I love it.

I'm glad y'all went with that.
It's much better than the green.

You know, I think I'm okay.

Come on.
In preparation for the big move, I have a couple of boxes in my car that I would love to throw in your basement.
Please?

Probably.
Oh, God!
So, a little bit nervous?
No, I'm excited.
I spend all my time over at Micah's anyway.
VHS?
That is old school.
Do we have a VCR?
I didn't even know you had this much stuff.
Somehow I ended up with it after Grandma Lois died.
I haven't even gone through it.
- How come you got it?
- I don't know.
You can have it.
Nobody ever gives me anything.
So who's gonna get the top bunk?
We're not 12.
We can get a VCR for free.
You know, I don't remember these at all.
You guys didn't go Beta, huh?
That's fine, okay?
I'm just gonna tape over an old one.
Can you get Abby out of here, please?
She's gonna get cut on the glass!
We just got back and the whole place is pretty much destroyed.
Nothing seems to be actually missing.
It's just, everything's really...
That's what she's telling me.
Just make sure we document everything.
Don't touch anything.
This is our basement.
I don't see anything really broken.
I don't see that box of tapes that Katie brought over.
Looks like that's the only thing that's missing.
All right and there she is.
The mother of the birthday girl, my girlfriend...
Chocolate, chocolate, rainbow stuff.
- That is a good-looking cake.
- Which is exactly what she wanted.
Beautiful.
Just beautiful.
And you're beautiful.
I don't know how you do it.
Are you okay?
Watch your backs!
Watch your hair.
Good job.
All right, and here's the birthday girl.
I found some.
She looks pretty unhappy.
Something's going on.
We got the young one.
Under the trampoline.
- Twenty bites and that's about all.
- Twenty bites?
That's what my mother used to make me do.
That's a lot of cake on that plate.
Hey, Julie.
Go get Kristi.
Say hi, Kristi!
Hi.
Kristi's a little shy.
That's cute.
They love each other.
It's Grandma.
Happy, happy, happy birthday.
Never forget the day you were born.
I held you in my arms and you made me laugh and cry at the same time.
You were so cute.
Serious piece of equipment, so be careful.
How do you shoot those weddings with this thing?
- It must hurt your back.
- It's something...
You have to work certain parts of your...
I've only been here for a few months...
But thank you for welcoming me into your family.
I...
- I just...
I love you, and I love...
- Dennis, my shoulder.
...you so much.
Happy birthday.
- Okay, take this thing now.
- All right.
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God!
Katie, take it easy.
Take it easy.
It's dead.
You're a little monster.
- All right, all right, I got my camera.
- Here, let me help you, 'cause I don't...
- I want to see the tooth full throttle.
- Okay, all right.
This thing's coming out today.
- Is it okay if I push it a little?
- No, no, don't push it.
- Lower lip.
- Want some juice, babe?
- Down.
- Here.
Now...
- You want some of this?
- Yeah, orange juice.
That is...
That is a good one!
- All right.
- Let's see this.
Open up.
Don't push it with your tongue.
Let's see.
It's ready.
- I think it might be...
- It's ready.
You're gonna get a newjob as a dentist.
Thank you.
You think I'm good?
Wrap it in a tissue, put it in your pocket, and bring it home for...
- The Tooth Fairy.
- The Tooth Fairy, that's right.
And we'll put it under your pillow, tonight.
Wow.
You like the Tooth Fairy, right?
We love the Tooth Fairy.
Why does he need a bowl?
Because he wants to eat.
He's hungry?
Kristi, Toby isn't real.
- Hey.
It doesn't matter.
- Yes, he is.
My assistant Randy is currently 43 minutes late.
And this isn't the first time, he's always late.
So, today we're gonna play a little prank and see if we can teach him a lesson.
- Come on around the front door.
- Come on, just open the garage.
Randy, I need your help, man.
Come around the front door.
Okay, okay.
- Hey.
- Hey, man.
- Where were you?
What happened?
- Sorry I'm late.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.
- I got blocked in.
- I'm really sorry.
- That's all right, man.
I had a leak in the house.
I was hoping you'd get here sooner.
I had a leak in the ceiling here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Here, push this up here.
It didn't rain last night.
Hold this for a second.
I need your help.
It's been going like crazy.
And I don't know what to do,
- so I got that pole there.
- Why is it white?
- What?
- Why is it white?
I don't know.
I think it's maybe something with the paint on this.
Anyway, I gotta get some spackle.
I'll be back.
- Wait, you just want me to...
- Hang on.
- You want me to wait here and hold it?
- Thanks, Randy.
Wait, Dennis.
I'm just supposed to wait here?
Dennis.
Dennis!
- Hey.
- Okay, girls, that's far enough.
Hey.
No.
Why don't you come on in and hand me that ladder?
No.
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.
You know you don't have to listen to him.
He's not even your real dad.
Who wants to go jump on the trampoline?
- I do!
- Oh, come on.
- I have a new trick to show you.
- Okay.
Guys, come on.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.
- Ready for a surprise?
It better be a ladder.
We were playing outside.
What did we find, guys?
- A spider.
- Dennis.
- We've got a cute little spider.
- Dennis!
- Come on, man.
- Okay.
Yeah?
- Do it, do it, do it, do it!
- All right.
Run!
- It wasn't even a spider.
- That really hurt.
That really hurt.
- Hi.
- Big day today, right?
- Yep.
- What's today?
- Picture day.
- Picture day!
- Dennis, you're still in.
- Sorry.
- I was finishing my hair!
- This picture's for Grandma.
Smile.
All right!
- Okay...
- Kristi, come on!
Here it goes.
All right.
Cheese.
- Thanks, sweetheart.
- No, no, no.
Seriously, like...
- Randy?
- Yeah.
Where did you find this girl?
I don't know.
I didn't see her at all throughout any of the wedding...
- That's because I'm so happy...
- "So happy for you."
I love my job, man.
- I should've got her number.
- Probably could've.
Randy, this is great stuff.
I can't use any of this, but it's great.
Jule?
Julie?
There it goes again.
Hello?
Julie?
I like this song!
Not bad.
That's pretty good.
Teddy?
Did you fall down?
What was that?
- Hey.
- Hey.
What you doing?
Nothing.
I was just looking around.
What...
What...
You guys just get home?
Yeah.
- It was girls' day.
- I know.
How was it?
- Was it fun?
- Great.
You just really snuck up on me there.
All right.
It's time.
- Don't film this.
- Why not?
It's illegal.
Don't laugh.
We haven't even started smoking it, and you're already paranoid.
It's illegal.
What if my kids find me?
I'm a mother.
- Now relax.
- Seriously, Dennis.
Seriously, Julie.
Let's get really serious.
Seriously.
- Shut up.
- Let's be serious.
- All right.
- Real, real, real big, big...
That was big.
Julie, do the voice.
Dennis.
What voice?
This voice?
Dennis, I can't believe you're filming me smoke marijuana.
God, you're so beautiful.
Shut up.
I want to film us having sex.
Is that perverted?
- Is that weird?
- I don't know.
Was that a yes?
Okay.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Hey, there, pretty lady.
Stop.
I don't know.
You sure...
You sure you're up for this?
No.
You know what?
Don't answer that.
Hurry up, before I change my mind.
Okay, sorry.
All right.
What are you doing?
What was that?
It's porno music.
Great.
Classy.
Good start.
Good, right?
- All right.
- I don't know.
Relax.
Just relax.
Don't worry about it.
Hey.
- Yeah.
I'm okay.
- Relax.
- Yeah, what is that?
- I don't know.
It's an earthquake.
- Holy shit!
- Dennis, it's an earthquake!
The girls.
The girls!
Come on!
Dennis!
Dennis.
Oh, my God, I look so fat.
You don't look fat.
- Look at the size of me on top of you.
- You look beautiful.
You look like you can't breathe 'cause I'm sitting on top of you.
I want another shot at doing one of these.
- Watch this.
- Dennis, you have to erase this.
Julie, watch, watch, watch.
- See that?
- What?
Did you see that in the corner?
Yeah, I see, like, dust.
- Dirt falling.
- No, Julie.
There's something there.
- You are crazy.
- There was something there.
Wait, you can see something there.
It's very cute, but you're going a little crazy.
You're like one of those people that see things, like in their food.
Like when people think they see the Virgin Mary in their toast.
- That's you right now.
- That's hilarious.
This has to be erased and this has to be erased.
I'm sorry.
Or we're never having sex again.
I'm late.
I got to go.
Thanks for erasing both of them.
You know, you're going to regret saying that.
Doubt it.
I don't think you can go a day without having sex, personally.
Don't dare me.
- Erase it.
- I'm not going to erase it.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.
Dude, what are you doing, man?
You're always so late.
I know, it's my car!
I got the earthquake.
- Did you really?
- On tape.
It's scary, right?
Is that Julie?
It's nothing, it's nothing.
- We're going to...
- Is that a sex tape?
Yeah.
I got...
This weird thing happened after...
She let you make a sex tape?
Yeah, but it got interrupted by the earthquake.
I wouldn't have let anything interrupt that.
Relax, man, just relax.
Would you just stop?
- Let me slow-mo shuttle forward.
- Just shut up.
Check this out.
Ready?
All right, let me tweak the contrast here.
Okay.
I'm gonna take the color out.
It looks like dust is falling on something.
It looks like a figure, right?
- You see that?
- Yeah.
Did you catch that?
- Yeah, it moved.
- Did you see the dust move?
- It moved, right?
- What was that?
I don't know.
Check it out.
- It's weird, right?
- It's kind of weird.
You know, I've been hearing these noises in the girls' room lately.
I don't know.
I feel like it's...
Something weird's going on.
- Julie?
- Yeah, I'm back here.
Hey, I wanted to talk to you...
Dennis!
Sorry!
Sorry.
Oh, my God!
Sorry.
You mind if I set up a couple cameras around the house?
I'm not going to talk to you right now.
Okay, I'll...
I'll take that as a yes?
- I hate you!
- Okay.
Love you, too.
How long do the tapes last?
About six hours each.
So you have to change them every six hours?
Yes.
Katie, can you hop out of the frame?
- Okay.
Is that good?
- Yeah, so I can...
Keep going.
- Can I see it?
- Sure.
Here.
Come here.
See it?
Yeah.
Pretty cool, right?
So, what are you trying to see?
Anything unusual or strange.
Oh, no, it's not that.
Don't touch the camera.
- Kristi?
- Yeah?
Don't touch the camera or anything.
Katie, just leave it alone.
- Dennis.
- What?
Really?
Don't you think you're overreacting a little?
This is a new house.
It shouldn't be making these noises.
Not just in here.
It's in the girls' room, too.
No...
This is not gonna work here.
Like, what do you think you're gonna catch?
Whatever's in our house.
Right, 'cause there's something here watching us.
Well, there's definitely something.
I...
I feel it.
I feel something, I'm telling you.
Yeah, I feel something, too.
I'm not gonna lie.
I feel a camera.
The earthquake, and all those...
I don't know, stuff that's been happening and...
I don't know, I just...
No, it's totally normal.
Bye, camera.
Good night, camera.
Yeah?
Yeah, probably.
In their bedroom.
Be quiet, so we don't wake Katie up.
It's okay.
Why?
Yeah, kind of.
He's very sweet.
Yeah, I saw that.
I watched some of the tapes on the camera and I saw you talking to somebody late last night.
If you saw me talking to somebody, it would be Toby.
Toby's your friend?
Yes.
He's my friend.
Yeah, what do you guys talk about?
Secrets.
He's big?
So, is he old, like Grandma, or is he young, like you?
He's old, like Grandma.
And what does he look like?
Is he tall?
Is he fat?
He's tall.
He's tall.
Don't call him fat.
Kristi, when you say that if you tell one of your secrets that you'll be in trouble with Toby, what does that mean?
Well, I won't be safe.
He's gonna...
Did he say he's gonna hurt you?
No.
But I won't be safe.
That means, I will be, like...
Be in very, very big trouble.
Big trouble.
- You saw her.
- That's how it is.
It was like he was actually there, right?
I know.
Because that's how active kids' imaginations are.
It's crazy.
I mean, imagination is one thing.
She got up in the middle of the night.
I mean, it's a little odd that she got up in the middle...
You haven't been around kids for that long.
They do weird things.
They...
Katie used to get up in the middle of the night and she used to sleep on the toilet.
What?
Okay?
I'm serious.
Really?
Yes.
Toby is a phase and he's going to be gone in a couple weeks.
I know it.
How many hours of footage do you have?
This is the job, man.
I got two cameras, six hours each.
Twelve hours.
- Twelve hours of footage?
- Yeah.
Got to do it, man.
- I'm seriously gonna review it.
- ...of footage every day.
Yes.
Now, please, I'm trying to concentrate.
That's so stupid.
There's only 24 hours in a day, Dennis.
- Hey, Julie.
- ...going?
Good.
You want to step into my office and do some work with me or...
No.
You find anything?
Yes, actually.
We did find something.
We found that your family sleeps all night.
Very funny, Randy.
- Keep up the good work.
- Okay.
I love you with all of my heart and soul.
I love you, too.
It should either be called Back to the Past...
Present.
Back to the Present.
- No, no.
- End of story.
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It makes total sense.
Let's Get Back to the Present, maybe.
But Back to the Past...
Back to the Present.
- You hear that?
- Yeah.
- Was that...
That's it.
- What the hell?
It's happening again.
Come on.
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.
It's in your closet.
Are you getting that?
Open it.
- Are you getting it?
- Yeah, I'm gettin' it.
Holy shit!
Holy shit!
That's not funny.
- Oh, my God.
You're both crazy.
- I got you guys so bad.
- I got you.
- You're both crazy.
I got you good.
I got you, too.
Are you okay?
Just go ahead and take your crap right there, 'cause I nearly crapped my pants.
Holy fuck!
You almost gave me a heart attack.
Oh, my God, get away!
- Get away from me.
- Are you okay?
Get away.
I hate you.
Wow.
Look at that tent.
Gosh.
I like this tent.
"...and disguised his voice to sound like Little Red Riding Hood.
"The poor old woman, before she could even scream, the wolf gobbled her up."
Hello.
Hey, guys.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- Good.
- That's a little bright.
I'm sorry.
- Guys?
I got you a little...
- Give it to me.
Hey, guys.
Don't tell Mom, okay?
- Okay.
- All right.
What are you guys doing?
You'll see.
We've got a little surprise for you.
- One, two, three!
- ...two, three!
Come here.
Here, tickle torture, tickle torture, tickle torture!
That's enough.
You guys are locked in the dungeon.
All right.
Good night, girls.
I love you.
- Love you, Dennis.
- Love you.
Dennis.
Dennis.
- What?
- Listen.
What?
I think the girls came inside.
I'll go check on them.
I got it.
Girls?
Dennis.
Dennis?
Don't do that to me.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- You scared me.
Did you check on them?
Why is this door locked?
Did you lock this?
What's the matter?
We're just checking on you guys.
Move that light.
We're gonna move inside, okay?
- I want to stay here.
- Why?
I'm sorry.
It's gonna be fun inside, too, though.
Come on.
Get your stuff.
We're gonna camp inside.
- Mommy.
Why?
- What?
Dennis, will you film me?
- Yep.
- I wanna show you something.
You know Spud Webb?
One, two, three, slam dunk!
Very impressive.
Very good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Katie, are you sure you didn't sneak into the house last night?
My gosh, I pinky swear,
- I did not go into the house.
- Okay.
You wanna do me a favor?
Can you tell your mom that?
Where's Dennis?
He's out, buying more tapes.
With your credit card?
Mom.
He doesn't have any money.
That is not true.
The girls love him.
I mean, they just about think he's the coolest guy ever.
I mean, I really, really do like him.
I mean that.
It's just that the girls miss their father.
I don't know.
I wish he were a little more financially secure.
He is financially secure, Mom.
He has a job.
- He shoots wedding videos.
- No.
That's...
No.
He has his own business.
You know?
It's a whole different thing.
My God, Mom.
I just told you,
I don't want to have any more kids.
I'm not gonna get pregnant.
You always said you wanted a big family.
I changed my mind, okay?
I have two beautiful girls.
You always wanted a son.
I'm happy with the way things are.
Let's go.
What the...
Fuck.
This is great.
Hang on.
That's great!
Katie, that's great.
You're doing really good.
- Thank you.
- Let her go, Jule.
Dennis, I totally believe in this shit.
Randy, watch the language.
All right, nice and slow.
My brother saw one once.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What's Bloody Mary?
You don't know what Bloody Mary is?
It's where you go in the bathroom and you say "Bloody Mary" three times in the mirror and then you see a ghost.
Dennis, I wanna play Bloody Mary.
Nothing, don't worry.
It's okay.
You say Bloody Mary three times.
I want to play!
I want to see a ghost.
I'm just saying you're missing half of the stuff in the house without cameras down there.
I know.
You don't have to tell me.
Like put it up in the corner, like, rack it up in the corner or something?
It just doesn't work.
It just...
It's not a wide enough angle.
And I don't even...
They don't even make lenses that wide.
Mirrors.
You could use mirrors.
- This thing is so cool.
- Pretty cool, right?
It's awesome.
Wow!
Look, you got it balanced out and everything, too.
What is that?
I got to work out some kinks.
Oh, man.
- Hi.
- Hey.
What is that?
Check it out.
My new thing.
- It's pretty cool, right?
- Yeah.
- What...
What is it?
- I took your fan...
And basically, took apart...
Basically, the oscillator on your fan allows me to see both in the living room and in the kitchen.
Cool.
Wait, what?
You broke my fan?
I can put it back together.
Okay, MacGyver.
It's cool, right?
This way I can...
Kristi, what are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Go back to bed.
It's really late.
Hey, babe, what are you doing up here?
Painting.
Don't you want to play outside?
Not really.
How about your friend Toby?
Do you still talk to him?
Yeah.
Did he wake you up?
No.
Did he tell you to come downstairs?
No.
You know you can tell me, right?
He told me not to talk about it.
Why don't you just ask him yourself?
He's standing right next to you.
I don't see him.
He's there.
Hey, thanks for getting these, man.
Yeah, of course.
- This is good stuff.
- Thanks.
- Randy...
- Yeah?
Did you check this out?
No, I don't have a library card.
You stole these?
I didn't steal them, Dennis.
You told me to get the books, I got you the books.
It's what a library is.
It's for borrowing.
That's what "library" means in Spanish...
It means, "Borrow book store."
Malevolent Entities.
What is this one?
I don't know.
I looked through it for a second.
It had some creepy pictures...
This stuff is creepy.
Hey.
It's your sister and her friends.
Is that a joke?
What, was that supposed to be funny?
Playing field hockey.
Says, "Kids are susceptible to spiritual contact."
Okay.
And?
Well, the whole thing with Kristi and her imaginary friend.
Remember, I was telling you the crazy stuff started happening only when she started talking to her imaginary friend.
I mean, it must want something.
That's what...
You know, that's what the book says.
They don't just stick around for no reason.
It wants something.
What does it want?
Well, the book says it feeds off of your fear.
Hey, Kristi.
- Kristi.
- Yeah?
- Wanna play a game?
- Sure.
Here.
What are you doing?
- Playing with my soccer ball?
- Yeah.
Kristi, that's mine.
Kristi!
Kristi, come on.
Kristi, come help me.
What are we doing?
- We're gonna play Bloody Mary.
- Why?
Because I wanna try to catch the ghost.
Okay.
I think it's on.
So, how you play is you say "Bloody Mary" three times into the mirror and then her dead body's supposed to appear
- in the mirror and try to kill you.
- Stop!
Stop!
Stop, Katie.
So, now what do we do?
We have to say "Bloody Mary".
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Bloody Mary.
- Kristi, I said three times, not four.
- Sorry.
- I'm scared, Katie.
- We have to be quiet.
- Guys...
- My gosh, Mom!
You scared me.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
We're just playing a game.
Okay.
Grandma just got here.
Go say hi.
- You moved his camera?
- Yeah.
- Is it taping?
- I'll pick it up, I promise.
Yeah.
We gotta move it before he comes home 'cause he's gonna be mad.
- You guys wanna go to the pool?
- Yeah.
You wanna go to the pool, Grandma?
God damn it.
- Mom?
- Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
Holy shit.
Mommy, what happened?
- Stay upstairs.
Stay upstairs.
- What happened?
Don't come down here.
- There's glass on the floor.
Stay there.
- Are you hurt?
I have no idea, I have no idea.
Looks fine, right?
It didn't even break.
That's good.
- What happened?
- It just fell.
I didn't...
What do you mean, what happened?
I was in there.
- Hi, Kristi.
- Hey.
- Say hi to the camera.
- Hey.
- Can I join you guys?
- Sure.
- I can?
- Yeah.
Okay, great.
I'm gonna set my camera here, okay?
- Okay.
- Just keep it out of the way.
Wait.
Why are you filming this?
It's just like, I'm testing out my, like, new camera and, you know, no reason.
Don't sit there.
That's Toby's spot.
Sorry.
Is Toby sitting there right now?
Okay.
Sorry.
Sorry, Toby.
Does Teddy need help with his tea?
He looks thirsty.
- Yeah.
- Here you go, Teddy.
Here.
He can't reach 'em.
Okay.
Wow.
He was thirsty.
See, I told you.
And she keeps falling.
Poke.
So, Kristi, what was the last thing that Toby said to you?
Like...
- Anything?
- Yeah.
- No?
- Secrets.
Secrets.
Regular stuff.
In her sink?
Yeah.
Sorry.
That...
Did you...
Did you...
Did he say something just now?
No, I just put my hand on him.
And he didn't like that.
He doesn't like that, when you...
No.
Sorry, Toby.
It was a mistake, right?
Yeah.
- What?
- Nothing.
- What?
- Never mind.
- What were you gonna say?
- Nothing.
It's okay, you can tell me.
Kristi, why is Dennis's camera here?
Because me and Toby were having a little tea party and he was filming us.
- I'm not!
- Yes, you are, Kristi.
Only babies have imaginary friends.
He is real.
Hey, Kristi!
Kristi's such a baby!
Baby!
Katie, stop it!
Well, you're being a baby!
Only babies have imaginary friends.
No, I'm not!
He's right in there.
In there?
Toby, come out!
Toby, come out!
Toby!
Okay, I'm gonna go in.
Katie, you shouldn't do that.
Katie!
Don't go in there.
- You shouldn't do that.
- Well, I am.
Toby, come out.
Toby...
Katie.
Kristi!
What are you doing?
Open the door!
You shouldn't do that.
Kristi, open this door!
- It's not me!
- Kristi!
- Girls!
- Open the door!
- What is this yelling?
What is going on?
- I'm not doing that.
Stop fighting right this second.
Why's Dennis's camera on the floor?
She locked me in there.
- Katie, you can't touch his stuff.
- Kristi, why...
Stop fighting right this second.
- Mom, she locked me in there!
- I don't want to hear it.
- Come on, come on.
- Then who locked me in there?
Toby did.
Yeah, like Toby locked me in there.
She's gonna be here any minute.
See?
There she is.
Mommy, Lisa's here!
Okay!
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi!
How are you?
Good.
- I wanna show you something upstairs.
- Hi, Lisa.
Wait, what are you showing me?
I got some new beads for my birthday.
Beads!
Let's see 'em.
Hi, Kristi.
How are you?
Hey.
What's that?
Don't mind this.
You know Dennis and his cameras, he just puts them...
Just ignore it.
8:30 bedtime?
No, no, no, 10:00.
- 8:30.
Nice try.
- Mommy, please.
9:30?
- 9:00.
- 9:45.
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, guys.
Love you.
Look, it made a triangle.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- Good night, girls!
- Good night.
- See you later.
- Bye, Julie.
Bye, Dennis.
Are you tired?
- Not really.
- No?
Can you tell us a story?
Sure.
What kind of story?
A ghost story.
Ghost story?
With a ghost.
Okay, let's think.
I'm a ghost!
Hello, Dennis!
You found the ghost.
Comin' to get you.
Got you!
- Good night, Lisa.
- Good night, sweetie.
Hi, Dennis.
- Hi.
- Hey!
Hi!
- How'd it go?
- Fine, it was good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, they were great.
The girls were...
Give you any trouble, or...
No, no, no, no, it was good.
But my mom's meeting me, so if I could just...
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, give her some money.
Here you go.
Thank you.
You're sure everything was good?
Yeah, no.
Thank you, guys.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Okay, bye.
Thanks.
I don't know.
- That was weird.
- Yeah.
It's so high.
Promise?
Okay.
What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Why are you up?
Why are you up?
Nothing.
Kristi, go to bed.
It's late.
- Is that the babysitter?
- Yeah, that's Lisa.
How come I never met her?
I'll put in a good word.
- See the sheet?
- Yeah.
Watch this.
- Gone.
- Holy fuck.
Am I...
Am I right?
Holy...
- Did you see that?
- ...fuck!
I'm not crazy, right?
I'm not crazy.
That just happened.
Holy!
What the fuck is that?
I don't know.
- What is that?
- I don't know.
I'm telling you, it's...
And she didn't say anything at all?
She left the room, like...
Did you show Julie?
No, man.
What, are you kidding?
She would flip out.
She would go nuts, and, you know, she'd make me take the cameras down, and I can't do that.
I really want to figure out what this thing wants.
Got to keep taping this shit, though, man.
I know.
I am.
- You got to keep taping this shit.
- I know.
She got blown in the face.
Yeah, yeah.
No.
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
I'm going to bed.
What the...
What the fuck?
Hey, how's she feeling?
We need to go to the doctor 'cause she's burning up.
Oh, no.
- Yeah, she's really...
- She's really that bad?
- Yeah, it's bad.
- All right.
It's like, I've taken it a couple times.
Do you want me to go with you or...
Well, I mean, I don't know.
Who's gonna watch Katie?
I can call Randy.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, hey.
- Thanks for coming over.
- No problemo.
- Hi, Randy.
- Hi!
Randy, thank you so much.
We're gonna be at the hospital for a little bit.
Okay.
Anything you guys want...
- I know where everything is.
- Okay, great.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Bye!
Love you.
Bye, Kristi!
You have everything?
You have papers and insurance?
Yeah, I have it.
- Thanks a lot.
- Love you.
Bye.
- I'll lock the door.
- Okay, thanks.
- Thanks again.
- I'll lock it.
All right, be good, Katie.
See you.
- Hey, hey.
- Hi.
So what's wrong with Kristi?
It's like a really high fever or something like that.
Is it contagious?
I don't think so.
I haven't gotten sick.
Okay, good.
What do you want to do?
Can we play Bloody Mary?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Seriously?
I really don't think this is a good idea, Katie.
You made a promise.
You have to do it.
- Can't we just play, like, doll house...
- Get the camera!
...or somethin'?
Sorry, Dennis.
Not my idea.
Come on.
I'm comin', I'm comin'.
So you say, "Bloody Mary" three times.
And then you wait a little bit and then you turn the lights back on and then you're supposed to see her body in the mirror and she's gonna try to kill you.
Try and kill you.
Good game.
Yep.
I don't know why you wanna play this.
One of us is gonna be dead by the end of it.
I guess it's a one-time game.
Okay, let's do it.
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Randy!
Nothing happened.
You turned the light on too soon.
Come on, Katie.
This is stupid.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You can't leave!
Let's just go play doll house or something.
No, you didn't do it right.
What did I not do right?
You need to keep the light off longer.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
You wanna play Bloody Mary?
- Let's play Bloody Mary.
- Okay, ready?
You're not gonna see anybody play Bloody Mary like I'm about to play Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Okay, can I turn it on now?
- Quiet.
- Sorry.
Sorry.
How about now?
Wait, wait.
- What?
- Did you hear that?
What was that?
I know.
I heard it, too.
Holy shit!
- Oh, my...
- Are you okay?
Huh?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
- Does it hurt?
- No.
I just scratched myself or something.
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
It's okay.
Nothing...
Close the door.
It's okay.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's okay.
I don't want to die!
Randy, I'm scared!
Holy shit!
It's okay!
Randy, I'm scared!
Holy fuck!
You okay?
You okay?
Oh, my God.
It's all right.
Dear God.
Please, God.
Please, God, be with me.
It's okay!
It's okay!
I don't want to play this.
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Stay here.
I don't wanna play anymore.
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
Holy fuck!
Okay.
- Nothing happened.
- You okay?
Nothing.
You're fine.
- I wanna get out of here.
- It's okay, all right.
We're gonna get out of here.
Come on, Randy!
Come on, Randy!
Stay here.
Dear Lord, be with me, please, be with me.
- Randy, I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.
- It's okay.
- Come here, come here.
- I'm sorry!
It's okay.
Huh?
- Please, please, don't tell.
- It's okay, it's just like an earthquake.
I'm not gonna tell.
I'm not gonna tell.
It's all right.
It's okay.
I wanna go downstairs!
Yeah, let's go downstairs.
Fuck.
Randy, Randy, where are you going, man?
Relax.
Randy, Randy, take it easy.
Randy.
What...
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm getting all my stuff.
What...
What are you getting your stuff for, man?
- Relax.
Sit down.
- Dennis.
Get the camera out of my face.
I told you, I felt something in the room with us and then I felt a claw dig into my side, okay?
Okay, okay.
When you say "something..."
Great interview.
- No, Dennis, I'm done.
Fuck.
- When you say...
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home!
Look at the fuckin' books.
This isn't, you know,
Casper, the fuckin' friendly ghost you're chasing, man.
- I'm sorry you got hurt.
- This thing is dangerous!
- I'm sorry you got hurt, okay?
- Jesus fucking Christ!
I'm sorry, but...
What are you gonna do?
You're just gonna quit?
You're acting ridiculous.
Relax!
Dennis, no, you're acting ridiculous if you're not gonna get the fuck out.
You have to tell Julie, okay?
Just watch the fucking tape, Dennis!
- What's up?
- Hey.
What?
I need to talk to you.
- Okay.
- All right, sit down.
Here.
Sit down, Jule.
Okay, where do I begin?
...from the '30s.
Look at the necklaces.
That's crazy.
Yeah?
It's the same symbol.
Isn't that the same symbol from the girls' room?
All right?
These...
These women, they were...
- Oh, my God.
- ...part of a coven.
You're really something.
I...
I...
I really need to...
To tell you this, okay?
Kristi!
You'd better run!
You sound crazy.
Do you know that?
Hang on a second, all right?
Do you know how crazy you're starting to sound?
Would you just give me a second to explain?
They would have these ceremonies and they would wait till the girls were old enough to get pregnant and then they would...
They would...
They would take their sons.
Right.
And then they would brainwash them and they didn't remember a thing.
That explains it.
Dennis, I'm not listening to...
Mom?
- I need to show you something.
- It's all you do!
There's shit...
You don't even spend any time with us anymore.
You just sit here and play with this shit all day long.
- Could you just wait one second?
- It's like you're obsessed!
Just wait one second.
I need to show you this, okay?
No, I can't.
I can't wait.
- No, no, no...
- I can't wait!
I can't!
- Why not?
- Because...
Because Kristi's upset all the time...
- Mommy?
- What the fuck?
I don't...
What?
What?
What?
Toby pulled my hair.
- What happened?
- Who?
Toby pulled my hair.
This is your fault.
Okay?
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
Hey...
I didn't...
No more cameras.
No more ghosts.
This ends tomorrow.
Julie, I...
You gotta watch the fucking tape.
Kristi.
Wake up!
Katie, go back to sleep.
What was that?
What's happening?
Kristi!
Toby's here.
I'm scared!
Mom!
Mommy!
- Mommy!
- Stop screaming!
It's okay!
Just ignore it!
Just ignore it!
Mom!
Kristi!
Kristi, help me!
Kristi!
Please...
Please...
Please help me!
Katie!
Let her go!
Let her go!
Toby, stop!
Stop, Toby!
I'll do it.
Just let her go!
I'm scared.
I want Mommy!
...to Grandma's house.
No, we're not going to Grandma's house, okay?
Why?
We're not going to Grandma's because there's no Toby, sweetie.
- Yes, there...
- There's no Toby and there's no ghost.
Hey, don't run away from me.
Hey.
There's no ghost and that's the end of it.
I don't want to hear any more of this talk, okay?
Okay?
- What'd she say?
- She said no.
No.
No.
Mom, we're not coming over.
Okay?
We're staying right here.
Because I need to get things back to normal.
All right, Mom, I gotta go.
Someone's at the door, okay?
I'll call you back.
Yeah, okay.
Hello?
Weird.
Dennis!
Dennis!
Dennis, get the girls!
We're getting out of here!
Girls, wake up, we're here.
Wake up.
We're here.
Yay, we're here.
There's Grandma.
Mommy, I'm tired.
Go park by the garage.
Oh, God.
Are you okay?
- Come on.
- Let's go, guys.
Hi, honey.
Come on, go.
You go with your mom.
I've got your sister.
Come on.
Come on.
Mommy.
Sleepy girl is what she is.
Go on in the house.
I've got apple pie and I've got...
You want water, I know.
How're we doing?
Put the camera down and come and eat some pie.
- I'm fine.
- Come on.
It makes me feel better to do something.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Feel useful.
Are you okay?
- How's it going, kiddo?
- What is going on?
- Good.
- How you feeling?
...not talk about it right now.
We can talk about it when...
Just...
Let's just drop it.
- Hey, Kristi?
- What?
Don't touch the painting, okay?
It's okay, I'm not mad.
Do you like it?
What's the matter?
Kristi!
Come and get your pie!
Hey, guys.
What's going on?
You playing some dress-up?
Doesn't she make a beautiful bride?
- Very.
- Do you want to put this on her?
Beautiful.
Try that.
So, who's the lucky guy?
Toby.
Wait.
What did she say?
- Let's go.
It's bedtime, girls.
Let's go.
- Just having fun.
- Julie...
- Mom.
Come on.
I don't want to hear Toby's name ever again.
Okay?
Julie, it's just pretend.
That's it.
He's done.
He's not in our lives.
- He's real.
Toby is...
- Let's go.
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Kristi...
Can you take them to bed, please?
Let's go.
Come on, sweetheart.
Take Grandma's stuff off and let's go to bed.
Dennis and I are gonna be right next door, okay?
We're gonna leave a light on and everything, so you can find us, and everything's gonna be...
Gonna be fine, okay?
I love you so much.
Love you.
- Good night, guys.
- I love you so much.
When are you gonna stop taping us?
Not until this thing's over.
When's your mom gonna let us sleep in the same bed?
I can't stop thinking about it.
I can't.
I know.
Just close your eyes and try to get to sleep.
Come here.
We can share a pillow, too.
That's fine.
Julie.
Do you hear that?
Like cars?
- Sorry...
- It's my mom.
She's always up at night.
She can't sleep.
Oh, my God, she's so loud.
Do you want me to go check on her?
She's gonna wake the girls up.
I'll be right back.
Julie?
Julie!
Girls?
Julie?
Hey, Julie!
Hello?
What the fuck?
Julie?
Lois?
What?
What the fuck?
Julie!
What the fuck?
Fuck.
Oh, my God.
Julie!
Julie?
What's wrong?
Fuck.
Fuck.
Julie?
Get up.
Mommy?
Oh, Kristi!
No, Kristi!
- Dennis?
- Come here, come on.
Let's go, Kristi.
What happened to Mommy?
Is she okay?
Oh, shit.
Come here.
Go, go.
Dennis, I'm scared.
It's okay.
No, Kristi, don't talk.
Is Mommy okay?
Quiet, okay?
Be quiet.
Just don't, okay?
Just quiet, okay?
It's okay.
Kristi, please, please, be quiet.
I'm gonna go check, okay?
Stay here.
Come on, Kristi.
What was that?
We're gonna get out of here, okay?
Come on, let's go.
I'm scared.
We're gonna get out of here.
Up.
Okay.
We're gonna be okay.
I don't know.
Katie!
Katie, get away from there!
Kristi, listen to me, stay right here, okay?
Don't move, okay?
Katie?
Come on, Toby.
Let's get ready.
You'll be spending a lot of time in here.
This is gonna be your room.
There's some kind of animal being de-liced or something.
Compression chamber.
That's your crib.
It's hermetically sealed.
And this is your paint color.
- What color is that, hon?
- Jamaica Bay Blue.
Jamaica!
And there you are.
- Hi.
- Yes, hi.
And there's your dad, who's playing with his new toy instead of helping me paint.
Sorry.
I can help.
- Yeah?
Come on.
- If I wasn't...
If I wasn't filming I would help.
Go and get the other ladder.
Yeah, you should have a real ladder.
That's...
You know.
All right, that's a...
- Who's that?
- Oh, it's my sister.
She's here to check out the nursery.
- Oh, Daniel, this is gorgeous.
- Yeah?
This is so gorgeous.
I love it.
I love the blue.
I'm glad y'all went with that.
It's much better than the green.
- How are you feeling?
- All right.
You know, I think I'm okay.
- How is he?
- Oh, he's doing so good.
He's kicking and, like, swimming.
- I feel like he's swimming.
- Hey, little fella!
- What did you say?
- It's Hunter.
- No!
Tyler.
It's Tyler.
- I like that.
- It's Tyler Hunter.
- It's...
I like...
I like both.
I don't wanna choose.
- I'm not gonna get into this.
- You have to.
Come on.
In preparation for the big move, I have a couple of boxes in my car that I would love to throw in your basement.
Please?
This is the last box.
Really?
Probably.
Oh, God!
So, a little bit nervous?
No, I'm excited.
I spend all my time over at Micah's anyway.
VHS?
That is old school.
- Do we have a VCR?
- Uh...
I didn't even know you had this much stuff.
Somehow I ended up with it after Grandma Lois died.
I haven't even gone through it.
- How come you got it?
- I don't know.
You can have it.
Nobody ever gives me anything.
So who's gonna get the top bunk?
We're not 12.
We can get a VCR for free.
You know, I don't remember these at all.
You guys didn't go Beta, huh?
That's fine, okay?
I'm just gonna tape over an old one.
Can you get Abby out of here, please?
She's gonna get cut on the glass!
We just got back and the whole place is pretty much destroyed.
Nothing seems to be actually missing.
It's just, everything's really...
That's what she's telling me.
Just make sure we document everything.
Don't touch anything.
This is our basement.
I don't see anything really broken.
I don't see that box of tapes that Katie brought over.
Looks like that's the only thing that's missing.
All right and there she is.
The mother of the birthday girl, my girlfriend...
Chocolate, chocolate, rainbow stuff.
- That is a good-looking cake.
- Which is exactly what she wanted.
Beautiful.
Just beautiful.
And you're beautiful.
I don't know how you do it.
Ooh!
Are you okay?
Watch your backs!
Whoa!
Watch your hair.
Good job.
All right, and here's the birthday girl.
Oh, I found some.
She looks pretty unhappy.
Something's going on.
We got the young one.
Under the trampoline.
Twenty bites and that's about all.
Twenty bites?
That's what my mother used to make me do.
That's a lot of cake on that plate.
Hey, Julie.
Go get Kristi.
Say hi, Kristi!
Hi.
Kristi's a little shy.
Oh, that's cute.
They love each other.
It's Grandma.
Happy, happy, happy birthday.
Never forget the day you were born.
I held you in my arms and you made me laugh and cry at the same time.
You were so cute.
Serious piece of equipment, so be careful.
How do you shoot those weddings with this thing?
- It must hurt your back.
- Uh, it's something, uh...
You have to work certain parts of your...
I've only been here for a few months, um...
But thank you for welcoming me into your family.
Um, I...
- I just...
I love you, and I love...
- Dennis, my shoulder.
...you so much.
Happy birthday.
- Okay, take this thing now.
- All right.
Whoa!
Oh, my God!
Katie, take it easy.
Take it easy.
It's dead.
You're a little monster.
All right, all right, I got my camera.
Here, let me help you, 'cause I don't...
- I want to see the tooth full throttle.
- Okay, all right.
This thing's coming out today.
- Is it okay if I push it a little?
- No, no, don't push it.
Lower lip.
Want some juice, babe?
Down.
Here.
Now...
Oooh!
You want some of this?
Yeah, orange juice.
Oh!
That is...
That is a good one!
- All right.
- Let's see this.
Open up.
Don't push it with your tongue.
Let's see.
- "Ah!"
- Ooh, it's ready.
- I think it might be...
- It's ready.
You're gonna get a newjob as a dentist.
Oh, thank you.
You think I'm good?
Wrap it in a tissue, put it in your pocket, and bring it home for...
- The Tooth Fairy.
- The Tooth Fairy, that's right.
And we'll put it under your pillow, tonight.
Wow.
You like the Tooth Fairy, right?
We love the Tooth Fairy.
Why does he need a bowl?
Because he wants to eat.
- He's hungry?
- Mmm-hmm.
Kristi, Toby isn't real.
- Hey.
It doesn't matter.
- Yes, he is.
My assistant Randy is currently 43 minutes late.
And this isn't the first time, he's always late.
So, today we're gonna play a little prank and see if we can teach him a lesson.
Come on around the front door.
Come on, just open the garage.
Randy, I need your help, man.
Come around the front door.
Okay, okay.
- Hey.
Whoa.
- Hey, man.
- Where were you?
What happened?
- Sorry I'm late.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.
- I got blocked in.
- I'm really sorry.
- That's all right, man.
I had a leak in the house.
I was hoping you'd get here sooner.
I had a leak in the ceiling here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Here, push this up here.
It didn't rain last night.
Hold this for a second.
I need your help.
It's been going like crazy.
And I don't know what to do,
- so I got that pole there.
- Why is it white?
- What?
- Why is it white?
I don't know.
I think it's maybe something with the paint on this.
Anyway, I gotta get some spackle.
I'll be back.
- Wait, you just want me to...
- Hang on.
- You want me to wait here and hold it?
- Thanks, Randy.
Wait, Dennis.
I'm just supposed to wait here?
Dennis.
Dennis!
- Hey.
- Okay, girls, that's far enough.
Hey.
No.
Why don't you come on in and hand me that ladder?
No.
Mmm-mmm.
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.
You know you don't have to listen to him.
He's not even your real dad.
Who wants to go jump on the trampoline?
- I do!
- Oh, come on.
I have a new trick to show you.
Okay.
Guys, come on.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.
- Ready for a surprise?
It better be a ladder.
We were playing outside.
What did we find, guys?
- A spider.
- Dennis.
- We've got a cute little spider.
- Dennis!
- Come on, man.
- Okay.
Yeah?
- Do it, do it, do it, do it!
- All right.
Run!
It wasn't even a spider.
That really hurt.
That really hurt.
- Hi.
- Big day today, right?
- Yep.
- What's today?
- Picture day.
- Picture day!
- Dennis, you're still in.
- Sorry.
- I was finishing my hair!
- This picture's for Grandma.
Smile.
All right!
- Okay...
- Kristi, come on!
Here it goes.
All right.
Cheese.
Thanks, sweetheart.
No, no, no.
Seriously, like...
- Randy?
- Yeah.
Where did you find this girl?
I don't know.
I didn't see her at all throughout any of the wedding...
- That's because I'm so happy...
- "So happy for you."
I love my job, man.
- I should've got her number.
- Probably could've.
Randy, this is great stuff.
I can't use any of this, but it's great.
Jule?
Julie?
There it goes again.
Hello?
Julie?
I like this song!
Not bad.
Mmm, that's pretty good.
Teddy?
Did you fall down?
What was that?
Oh.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What you doing?
Nothing.
I was just looking around.
What...
What...
You guys just get home?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- It was girls' day.
- I know.
How was it?
- Was it fun?
- Great.
You just really snuck up on me there.
All right.
It's time.
- Don't film this.
- Why not?
It's illegal.
Don't laugh.
We haven't even started smoking it, and you're already paranoid.
It's illegal.
What if my kids find me?
I'm a mother.
- Now relax.
- Seriously, Dennis.
Seriously, Julie.
Let's get really serious.
Seriously.
- Shut up.
- Let's be serious.
- All right.
- Real, real, real big, big...
Whoa.
That was big.
Julie, do the voice.
Dennis.
What voice?
This voice?
Dennis, I can't believe you're filming me smoke marijuana.
God, you're so beautiful.
Shut up.
I want to film us having sex.
Is that perverted?
- Is that weird?
- I don't know.
Was that a yes?
Okay.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Hey, there, pretty lady.
Oh, stop.
I don't know.
You sure...
You sure you're up for this?
No.
You know what?
Don't answer that.
Hurry up, before I change my mind.
Oh, okay, sorry.
All right.
What are you doing?
What was that?
It's porno music.
Great.
Classy.
Mmm.
Good start.
Good, right?
- All right.
- I don't know.
Mmm.
Relax.
Just relax.
Don't worry about it.
Hey.
- Yeah.
I'm okay.
- Relax.
- Yeah, what is that?
- I don't know.
Whoa!
It's an earthquake.
- Holy shit!
- Dennis, it's an earthquake!
The girls.
The girls!
Come on!
Dennis!
Dennis.
Oh, my God, I look so fat.
You don't look fat.
- Look at the size of me on top of you.
- You look beautiful.
You look like you can't breathe 'cause I'm sitting on top of you.
I want another shot at doing one of these.
- Watch this.
- Dennis, you have to erase this.
Julie, watch, watch, watch.
- See that?
- What?
Did you see that in the corner?
Yeah, I see, like, dust.
- Dirt falling.
- No, Julie.
There's something there.
- You are crazy.
- There was something there.
Wait, you can see something there.
It's very cute, but you're going a little crazy.
You're like one of those people that see things, like in their food.
Like when people think they see the Virgin Mary in their toast.
- That's you right now.
- Oh, that's hilarious.
This has to be erased and this has to be erased.
I'm sorry.
Or we're never having sex again.
I'm late.
I got to go.
Thanks for erasing both of them.
You know, you're going to regret saying that.
Doubt it.
I don't think you can go a day without having sex, personally.
Don't dare me.
- Erase it.
- I'm not going to erase it.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.
Dude, what are you doing, man?
You're always so late.
I know, it's my car!
I got the earthquake.
- Did you really?
- On tape.
It's scary, right?
Is that Julie?
It's nothing, it's nothing.
- We're going to...
- Is that a sex tape?
Yeah.
I got...
This weird thing happened after...
She let you make a sex tape?
Yeah, but it got interrupted by the earthquake.
I wouldn't have let anything interrupt that.
Relax, man, just relax.
Would you just stop?
- Let me slow-mo shuttle forward.
- Just shut up.
Check this out.
Ready?
All right, let me tweak the contrast here.
Okay.
I'm gonna take the color out.
It looks like dust is falling on something.
It looks like a figure, right?
- You see that?
- Yeah.
Did you catch that?
- Yeah, it moved.
- Did you see the dust move?
- It moved, right?
- What was that?
I don't know.
Check it out.
- It's weird, right?
- It's kind of weird.
You know, I've been hearing these noises in the girls' room lately.
I don't know.
I feel like it's...
Something weird's going on.
- Julie?
- Yeah, I'm back here.
Hey, um, I wanted to talk to you...
Dennis!
Oh, sorry!
Sorry.
Oh, my God!
Sorry.
You mind if I set up a couple cameras around the house?
I'm not going to talk to you right now.
Okay, I'll...
I'll take that as a yes?
- I hate you!
- Okay.
Love you, too.
How long do the tapes last?
About six hours each.
So you have to change them every six hours?
Mmm, yes.
Katie, can you hop out of the frame?
- Okay.
Is that good?
- Yeah, so I can...
Keep going.
- Can I see it?
- Sure.
Here.
Come here.
See it?
Yeah.
- Pretty cool, right?
- Mmm-hmm.
So, what are you trying to see?
Uh, anything unusual or strange.
Oh, no, it's not that.
Don't touch the camera.
- Kristi?
- Yeah?
Don't touch the camera or anything.
Katie, just leave it alone.
- Dennis.
- What?
Really?
Don't you think you're overreacting a little?
This is a new house.
It shouldn't be making these noises.
Not just in here.
It's in the girls' room, too.
No...
This is not gonna work here.
Like, what do you think you're gonna catch?
Whatever's in our house.
Oh, right, 'cause there's something here watching us.
Well, there's definitely something.
I...
I feel it.
I feel something, I'm telling you.
Yeah, I feel something, too.
I'm not gonna lie.
I feel a camera.
The earthquake, and all those...
I don't know, stuff that's been happening and...
I don't know, I just...
No, it's totally normal.
Bye, camera.
Good night, camera.
Yeah?
Yeah, probably.
In their bedroom.
Be quiet, so we don't wake Katie up.
It's okay.
Why?
Oh.
Yeah, kind of.
He's very sweet.
Yeah, I saw that.
I watched some of the tapes on the camera and I saw you talking to somebody late last night.
If you saw me talking to somebody, it would be Toby.
Toby's your friend?
Yes.
He's my friend.
Yeah, what do you guys talk about?
Mmm, secrets.
- He's big?
- Mmm-hmm.
So, is he old, like Grandma, or is he young, like you?
He's old, like Grandma.
And what does he look like?
Is he tall?
Is he fat?
He's tall.
He's tall.
Don't call him fat.
Kristi, when you say that if you tell one of your secrets that you'll be in trouble with Toby, what does that mean?
Well, I won't be safe.
He's gonna...
Did he say he's gonna hurt you?
No.
But I won't be safe.
That means, I will be, like...
Be in very, very big trouble.
Big trouble.
You saw her.
That's how it is.
It was like he was actually there, right?
I know.
Because that's how active kids' imaginations are.
It's crazy.
I mean, imagination is one thing.
She got up in the middle of the night.
I mean, it's a little odd that she got up in the middle...
You haven't been around kids for that long.
They do weird things.
They...
Katie used to get up in the middle of the night and she used to sleep on the toilet.
What?
Okay?
I'm serious.
Really?
Yes.
Toby is a phase and he's going to be gone in a couple weeks.
I know it.
How many hours of footage do you have?
This is the job, man.
I got two cameras, six hours each.
Twelve hours.
- Twelve hours of footage?
- Yeah.
Got to do it, man.
- I'm seriously gonna review it.
- ...of footage every day.
Yes.
Now, please, I'm trying to concentrate.
That's so stupid.
There's only 24 hours in a day, Dennis.
- Hey, Julie.
- ...going?
Um...
Good.
You want to step into my office and do some work with me or...
No.
You find anything?
Yes, actually.
We did find something.
We found that your family sleeps all night.
Oh!
Very funny, Randy.
- Keep up the good work.
- Okay.
I love you with all of my heart and soul.
I love you, too.
It should either be called Back to the Past...
Present.
Back to the Present.
- No, no.
- End of story.
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It makes total sense.
Let's Get Back to the Present, maybe.
But Back to the Past...
Back to the Present.
- You hear that?
- Yeah.
- Was that...
That's it.
- What the hell?
It's happening again.
Come on.
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.
It's in your closet.
- Are you getting that?
- Open it.
- Are you getting it?
- Yeah, I'm gettin' it.
Holy shit!
Holy shit!
That's not funny.
- Oh, my God.
You're both crazy.
- I got you guys so bad.
- Oh, oh, I got you.
- You're both crazy.
I got you good.
I got you, too.
Are you okay?
Just go ahead and take your crap right there, 'cause I nearly crapped my pants.
Holy fuck!
You almost gave me a heart attack.
Oh, my God, get away!
- Get away from me.
- Are you okay?
Get away.
I hate you.
Wow.
Look at that tent.
Gosh.
I like this tent.
"...and disguised his voice to sound like Little Red Riding Hood.
"The poor old woman, before she could even scream, the wolf gobbled her up."
Hello.
Shh.
Hey, guys.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- Good.
- That's a little bright.
I'm sorry.
Guys?
I got you a little...
- Mmm!
- Give it to me.
Hey, guys.
Don't tell Mom, okay?
- Okay.
- All right.
What are you guys doing?
You'll see.
We've got a little surprise for you.
- One, two, three!
- ...two, three!
Oh!
Ow!
Come here.
Here, tickle torture, tickle torture, tickle torture!
That's enough.
You guys are locked in the dungeon.
All right.
Good night, girls.
I love you.
- Love you, Dennis.
- Love you.
Dennis.
Dennis.
- What?
- Listen.
- What?
- Shh!
I think the girls came inside.
I'll go check on them.
I got it.
Girls?
Dennis.
Dennis?
Don't do that to me.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- You scared me.
Did you check on them?
Why is this door locked?
Did you lock this?
What's the matter?
We're just checking on you guys.
Move that light.
We're gonna move inside, okay?
- I want to stay here.
- Why?
I'm sorry.
It's gonna be fun inside, too, though.
Come on.
Get your stuff.
We're gonna camp inside.
- Mommy.
Why?
- What?
Dennis, will you film me?
- Yep.
- I wanna show you something.
You know Spud Webb?
One, two, three, slam dunk!
- Whoo!
- Very impressive.
Very good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Katie, are you sure you didn't sneak into the house last night?
My gosh, I pinky swear,
- I did not go into the house.
- Okay.
You wanna do me a favor?
Can you tell your mom that?
Where's Dennis?
Uh, he's out, buying more tapes.
With your credit card?
Mom.
He doesn't have any money.
That is not true.
The girls love him.
I mean, they just about think he's the coolest guy ever.
I mean, I really, really do like him.
I mean that.
It's just that the girls miss their father.
I don't know.
I wish he were a little more financially secure.
He is financially secure, Mom.
He has a job.
- He shoots wedding videos.
- No.
That's...
No.
He has his own business.
You know?
It's a whole different thing.
My God, Mom.
I just told you,
I don't want to have any more kids.
I'm not gonna get pregnant.
You always said you wanted a big family.
I changed my mind, okay?
I have two beautiful girls.
You always wanted a son.
I'm happy with the way things are.
Let's go.
What the...
Fuck.
Oh, this is great.
Hang on.
That's great!
Katie, that's great.
You're doing really good.
- Thank you.
- Let her go, Jule.
Dennis, I totally believe in this shit.
Randy, watch the language.
All right, nice and slow.
My brother saw one once.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What's Bloody Mary?
You don't know what Bloody Mary is?
It's, uh, where you go in the bathroom and you say "Bloody Mary" three times in the mirror and then you see a ghost.
Dennis, I wanna play Bloody Mary.
Nothing, don't worry.
Shh!
It's okay.
You say Bloody Mary three times.
Ooh, I want to play!
I want to see a ghost.
I'm just saying you're missing half of the stuff in the house without cameras down there.
I know.
You don't have to tell me.
Like put it up in the corner, like, rack it up in the corner or something?
It just doesn't work.
It just...
It's not a wide enough angle.
And I don't even...
They don't even make lenses that wide.
- Mirrors.
- Hmm?
You could use mirrors.
- This thing is so cool.
- Pretty cool, right?
It's awesome.
Wow!
Look, you got it balanced out and everything, too.
Whoa.
What is that?
I got to work out some kinks.
Oh, man.
- Hi.
- Hey.
What is that?
Check it out.
My new thing.
- It's pretty cool, right?
- Yeah.
- What...
What is it?
- I took your fan...
And basically, took apart...
Basically, the oscillator on your fan allows me to see both in the living room and in the kitchen.
Cool.
Wait, what?
You broke my fan?
I can put it back together.
Okay, MacGyver.
- It's cool, right?
- Mmm-hmm.
This way I can...
Kristi, what are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Go back to bed.
It's really late.
Hey, babe, what are you doing up here?
Painting.
Don't you want to play outside?
Not really.
How about your friend Toby?
Do you still talk to him?
Yeah.
Did he wake you up?
Mmm, no.
Did he tell you to come downstairs?
No.
You know you can tell me, right?
He told me not to talk about it.
Why don't you just ask him yourself?
He's standing right next to you.
I don't see him.
He's there.
Hey, thanks for getting these, man.
Yeah, of course.
- This is good stuff.
- Thanks.
- Randy...
- Yeah?
Did you check this out?
No, I don't have a library card.
You stole these?
I didn't steal them, Dennis.
You told me to get the books, I got you the books.
It's what a library is.
It's for borrowing.
That's what "library" means in Spanish...
It means, "Borrow book store."
Malevolent Entities.
What is this one?
Uh, I don't know.
I looked through it for a second.
It had some creepy pictures...
This stuff is creepy.
Oh, hey.
It's your sister and her friends.
Is that a joke?
What, was that supposed to be funny?
Playing field hockey.
Says, "Kids are susceptible to spiritual contact."
Okay.
And?
Well, the whole thing with Kristi and her imaginary friend.
Remember, I was telling you the crazy stuff started happening only when she started talking to her imaginary friend.
I mean, it must want something.
That's what...
You know, that's what the book says.
They don't just stick around for no reason.
It wants something.
What does it want?
Well, the book says it feeds off of your fear.
Hey, Kristi.
- Kristi.
- Yeah?
- Wanna play a game?
- Sure.
Here.
What are you doing?
- Playing with my soccer ball?
- Yeah.
Kristi, that's mine.
Kristi!
Kristi, come on.
Kristi, come help me.
What are we doing?
- We're gonna play Bloody Mary.
- Why?
Because I wanna try to catch the ghost.
Okay.
I think it's on.
So, how you play is you say "Bloody Mary" three times into the mirror and then her dead body's supposed to appear
- in the mirror and try to kill you.
- Stop!
Stop!
Stop, Katie.
So, now what do we do?
Shh.
We have to say "Bloody Mary".
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Bloody Mary.
- Kristi, I said three times, not four.
- Sorry.
- I'm scared, Katie.
- Shh!
We have to be quiet.
Guys...
My gosh, Mom!
You scared me.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
We're just playing a game.
Okay.
Grandma just got here.
Go say hi.
- You moved his camera?
- Yeah.
- Is it taping?
- I'll pick it up, I promise.
Yeah.
We gotta move it before he comes home 'cause he's gonna be mad.
- You guys wanna go to the pool?
- Yeah.
You wanna go to the pool, Grandma?
God damn it.
- Mom?
- Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
Holy shit.
Mommy, what happened?
- Stay upstairs.
Stay upstairs.
- What happened?
Don't come down here.
- There's glass on the floor.
Stay there.
- Are you hurt?
I have no idea, I have no idea.
Looks fine, right?
It didn't even break.
That's good.
- What happened?
- It just fell.
I didn't...
What do you mean, what happened?
I was in there.
- Hi, Kristi.
- Hey.
- Say hi to the camera.
- Hey.
- Can I join you guys?
- Sure.
- Oh, I can?
- Yeah.
Okay, great.
I'm gonna set my camera here, okay?
- Okay.
- Just keep it out of the way.
Wait.
Why are you filming this?
Um, it's just like, I'm testing out my, like, new camera and, you know, no reason.
Don't sit there.
That's Toby's spot.
Oh, sorry.
Is Toby sitting there right now?
Okay.
Sorry.
Sorry, Toby.
Does Teddy need help with his tea?
He looks thirsty.
- Yeah.
- Here you go, Teddy.
Here.
He can't reach 'em.
Okay.
Wow.
He was thirsty.
See, I told you.
And she keeps falling.
Poke.
So, Kristi, what was the last thing that Toby said to you?
Oh, like...
- Anything?
- Yeah.
- No?
- Secrets.
Secrets.
Regular stuff.
Oh, in her sink?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Oh, that...
Did you, uh...
Did you...
Did he say something just now?
No, I just put my hand on him.
Oh.
And he didn't like that.
He doesn't like that, when you...
- No.
- Oh.
Sorry, Toby.
It was a mistake, right?
Yeah.
- What?
- Nothing.
- What?
- Never mind.
- What were you gonna say?
- Nothing.
It's okay, you can tell me.
Kristi, why is Dennis's camera here?
Because me and Toby were having a little tea party and he was filming us.
- I'm not!
- Yes, you are, Kristi.
Only babies have imaginary friends.
He is real.
Hey, Kristi!
Kristi's such a baby!
Baby!
Katie, stop it!
Well, you're being a baby!
Only babies have imaginary friends.
No, I'm not!
He's right in there.
In there?
Toby, come out!
Toby, come out!
Toby!
Okay, I'm gonna go in.
Katie, you shouldn't do that.
Katie!
Don't go in there.
- You shouldn't do that.
- Well, I am.
Toby, come out.
Toby...
Katie.
Kristi!
What are you doing?
Open the door!
You shouldn't do that.
Kristi, open this door!
- It's not me!
- Kristi!
- Girls!
- Open the door!
- What is this yelling?
What is going on?
- I'm not doing that.
Stop fighting right this second.
Why's Dennis's camera on the floor?
She locked me in there.
- Katie, you can't touch his stuff.
- Kristi, why...
Stop fighting right this second.
- Mom, she locked me in there!
- I don't want to hear it.
- Come on, come on.
- Then who locked me in there?
Toby did.
Oh, yeah, like Toby locked me in there.
She's gonna be here any minute.
See?
There she is.
Mommy, Lisa's here!
Okay!
Hi, Lisa.
Hi!
How are you?
Good.
I wanna show you something upstairs.
Hi, Lisa.
Wait, what are you showing me?
I got some new beads for my birthday.
Beads!
Oh, let's see 'em.
Hi, Kristi.
How are you?
Hey.
What's that?
Oh, don't mind this.
You know Dennis and his cameras, he just puts them...
Just ignore it.
8:30 bedtime?
No, no, no, 10:00.
- 8:30.
Nice try.
- Mommy, please.
9:30?
- 9:00.
- 9:45.
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, guys.
Love you.
Look, it made a triangle.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- Good night, girls!
- Good night.
- See you later.
- Bye, Julie.
Bye, Dennis.
Are you tired?
- Um, not really.
- No?
Can you tell us a story?
Hmm, sure.
What kind of story?
A ghost story.
Ghost story?
With a ghost.
Okay, um, let's think.
I'm a ghost!
Hello, Dennis!
You found the ghost.
Comin' to get you.
Boo!
Got you!
- Good night, Lisa.
- Good night, sweetie.
Boo!
Hi, Dennis.
Hi.
Hey!
Hi!
- How'd it go?
- Fine, it was good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, they were great.
The girls were...
Give you any trouble, or...
No, no, no, no, it was good.
Um...
But my mom's meeting me, so if I could just...
- Oh, oh, yeah, sure.
- Oh, yeah, give her some money.
Um, here you go.
Thank you.
You're sure everything was good?
Yeah, no.
Thank you, guys.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Okay, bye.
Thanks.
I don't know.
- That was weird.
- Yeah.
It's so high.
Promise?
Okay.
What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Why are you up?
Huh?
Why are you up?
Nothing.
Kristi, go to bed.
It's late.
- Is that the babysitter?
- Yeah, that's Lisa.
How come I never met her?
I'll put in a good word.
- See the sheet?
- Yeah.
Watch this.
- Gone.
- Holy fuck.
Am I...
Am I right?
Holy...
- Did you see that?
- ...fuck!
I'm not crazy, right?
I'm not crazy.
That just happened.
Holy!
What the fuck is that?
I don't know.
- What is that?
- I don't know.
I'm telling you, it's...
And she didn't say anything at all?
She left the room, like...
Did you show Julie?
No, man.
What, are you kidding?
She would flip out.
She would go nuts, and, you know, she'd make me take the cameras down, and I can't do that.
I really want to figure out what this thing wants.
Got to keep taping this shit, though, man.
I know.
I am.
- You got to keep taping this shit.
- I know.
She got blown in the face.
Yeah, yeah.
No.
No.
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
I'm going to bed.
What the...
What the fuck?
Hey, how's she feeling?
We need to go to the doctor 'cause she's burning up.
Oh, no.
- Yeah, she's really...
- She's really that bad?
- Yeah, it's bad.
- All right.
It's like, I've taken it a couple times.
Do you want me to go with you or...
Well, I mean, I don't know.
Who's gonna watch Katie?
I can call Randy.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, hey.
- Thanks for coming over.
- No problemo.
- Hi, Randy.
- Hi!
Randy, thank you so much.
We're gonna be at the hospital for a little bit.
Okay.
Anything you guys want...
- I know where everything is.
- Okay, great.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Bye!
Love you.
Bye, Kristi!
You have everything?
You have papers and insurance?
Yeah, I have it.
Thanks a lot.
Love you.
Bye.
I'll lock the door.
Okay, thanks.
- Thanks again.
- I'll lock it.
All right, be good, Katie.
See you.
Hey, hey.
Hi.
So what's wrong with Kristi?
It's like a really high fever or something like that.
Oh.
Is it contagious?
I don't think so.
I haven't gotten sick.
Okay, good.
What do you want to do?
Can we play Bloody Mary?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Seriously?
I really don't think this is a good idea, Katie.
You made a promise.
You have to do it.
- Can't we just play, like, doll house...
- Get the camera!
...or somethin'?
Sorry, Dennis.
Not my idea.
Come on.
I'm comin', I'm comin'.
So you say, "Bloody Mary" three times.
- Mmm-hmm.
- And then you wait a little bit and then you turn the lights back on and then you're supposed to see her body in the mirror and she's gonna try to kill you.
Try and kill you.
Good game.
Yep.
I don't know why you wanna play this.
One of us is gonna be dead by the end of it.
I guess it's a one-time game.
Okay, let's do it.
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Randy!
Nothing happened.
You turned the light on too soon.
Oh, come on, Katie.
This is stupid.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You can't leave!
Let's just go play doll house or something.
No, you didn't do it right.
What did I not do right?
You need to keep the light off longer.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
You wanna play Bloody Mary?
- Let's play Bloody Mary.
- Okay, ready?
You're not gonna see anybody play Bloody Mary like I'm about to play Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Okay, can I turn it on now?
Shh!
- Quiet.
- Sorry.
Sorry.
- How about now?
- Shh.
Oh, wait, wait.
Shh.
- What?
- Did you hear that?
What was that?
I know.
I heard it, too.
Ow!
Holy shit!
- Oh, my...
- Are you okay?
Huh?
Mmm...
Are you okay?
Yeah.
- Does it hurt?
- Um, no.
Uh, I just scratched myself or something.
Oh...
Did you hear that?
Uh, yeah.
It's okay.
Nothing...
Close the door.
It's okay.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's okay.
I don't want to die!
Randy, I'm scared!
Holy shit!
It's okay!
Randy, I'm scared!
Holy fuck!
You okay?
You okay?
You okay?
You okay?
Oh, my God.
It's all right.
Oh, dear God.
Please, God.
Please, God, be with me.
It's okay!
It's okay!
I don't want to play this.
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Stay here.
I don't wanna play anymore.
It's okay, it's okay.
Shh, it's okay.
Holy fuck!
Okay.
- Nothing happened.
- You okay?
Nothing.
You're fine.
- I wanna get out of here.
- It's okay, all right.
We're gonna get out of here.
Come on, Randy!
Come on, Randy!
Stay here.
Oh!
Dear Lord, be with me, please, be with me.
Randy, I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.
It's okay.
- Come here, come here.
- I'm sorry!
It's okay.
Huh?
- Please, please, don't tell.
- It's okay, it's just like an earthquake.
I'm not gonna tell.
I'm not gonna tell.
It's all right.
It's okay.
I wanna go downstairs!
Yeah, let's go downstairs.
Oh, fuck.
Randy, Randy, where are you going, man?
Relax.
Randy, Randy, take it easy.
Randy.
What...
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm getting all my stuff.
What...
What are you getting your stuff for, man?
- Relax.
Sit down.
- Dennis.
Get the camera out of my face.
I told you, I felt something in the room with us and then I felt a claw dig into my side, okay?
Okay, okay.
When you say "something..."
Great interview.
- No, Dennis, I'm done.
Fuck.
- When you say...
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home!
Look at the fuckin' books.
This isn't, you know,
Casper, the fuckin' friendly ghost you're chasing, man.
- I'm sorry you got hurt.
- This thing is dangerous!
- I'm sorry you got hurt, okay?
- Jesus fucking Christ!
I'm sorry, but...
What are you gonna do?
You're just gonna quit?
You're acting ridiculous.
Relax!
Dennis, no, you're acting ridiculous if you're not gonna get the fuck out.
You have to tell Julie, okay?
Just watch the fucking tape, Dennis!
- What's up?
- Hey.
What?
Um...
I need to talk to you.
- Okay.
- All right, sit down.
Here.
Sit down, Jule.
Okay, where do I begin?
...from the '30s.
Look at the necklaces.
That's crazy.
Yeah?
It's the same symbol.
Isn't that the same symbol from the girls' room?
All right?
These...
These women, they were, um...
- Oh, my God.
- ...part of a coven.
You're really something.
I...
I...
I really need to...
To tell you this, okay?
Kristi!
You'd better run!
You sound crazy.
Do you know that?
Hang on a second, all right?
Do you know how crazy you're starting to sound?
Would you just give me a second to explain?
They would have these ceremonies and they would wait till the girls were old enough to get pregnant and then they would...
They would...
They would take their sons.
Oh!
Oh, right.
And then they would brainwash them and they didn't remember a thing.
That explains it.
Dennis, I'm not listening to...
Mom?
Ow!
- I need to show you something.
- It's all you do!
There's shit...
You don't even spend any time with us anymore.
You just sit here and play with this shit all day long.
- Could you just wait one second?
- It's like you're obsessed!
Just wait one second.
I need to show you this, okay?
No, I can't.
I can't wait.
- No, no, no...
- I can't wait!
I can't!
- Why not?
- Because...
Because Kristi's upset all the time...
- Mommy?
- What the fuck?
I don't...
What?
What?
What?
Toby pulled my hair.
- What happened?
- Who?
Toby pulled my hair.
This is your fault.
Okay?
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
Hey...
I didn't...
No more cameras.
No more ghosts.
This ends tomorrow.
Julie, I...
You gotta watch the fucking tape.
Kristi.
Kristi.
Wake up!
Katie, go back to sleep.
What was that?
What's happening?
Kristi!
Toby's here.
I'm scared!
Mom!
Mommy!
- Mommy!
- Stop screaming!
It's okay!
Just ignore it!
Just ignore it!
Shh!
Mom!
Kristi!
Kristi, help me!
Kristi!
Please...
Please...
Please help me!
Katie!
Let her go!
Let her go!
Toby, stop!
Stop, Toby!
I'll do it.
Just let her go!
I'm scared.
I want Mommy!
...to Grandma's house.
No, we're not going to Grandma's house, okay?
Why?
We're not going to Grandma's because there's no Toby, sweetie.
- Yes, there...
- There's no Toby and there's no ghost.
Hey, don't run away from me.
Hey.
There's no ghost and that's the end of it.
I don't want to hear any more of this talk, okay?
Okay?
- What'd she say?
- She said no.
No.
No.
Mom, we're not coming over.
Okay?
We're staying right here.
Because I need to get things back to normal.
All right, Mom, I gotta go.
Someone's at the door, okay?
I'll call you back.
Yeah, okay.
Hello?
Hello?
Weird.
Dennis!
Dennis!
Dennis, get the girls!
We're getting out of here!
Girls, wake up, we're here.
Wake up.
We're here.
Yay, we're here.
There's Grandma.
Mommy, I'm tired.
Go park by the garage.
Oh, God.
Are you okay?
- Come on.
- Let's go, guys.
Hi, honey.
Come on, go.
You go with your mom.
Oh.
I've got your sister.
Come on.
Come on.
Mommy.
Sleepy girl is what she is.
Go on in the house.
I've got apple pie and I've got...
You want water, I know.
How're we doing?
Put the camera down and come and eat some pie.
- Oh, I'm fine.
- Come on.
It makes me feel better to do something.
Okay.
Okay.
Feel useful.
Are you okay?
- How's it going, kiddo?
- What is going on?
- Good.
- How you feeling?
...not talk about it right now.
We can talk about it when...
Just...
Let's just drop it.
- Hey, Kristi?
- What?
Don't touch the painting, okay?
It's okay, I'm not mad.
Do you like it?
What's the matter?
Kristi!
Come and get your pie!
Hey, guys.
What's going on?
You playing some dress-up?
Doesn't she make a beautiful bride?
- Very.
- Do you want to put this on her?
Beautiful.
Try that.
So, who's the lucky guy?
Toby.
Wait.
What did she say?
- Let's go.
It's bedtime, girls.
Let's go.
- Just having fun.
- Julie...
- Mom.
Come on.
I don't want to hear Toby's name ever again.
Okay?
Julie, it's just pretend.
That's it.
He's done.
He's not in our lives.
- He's real.
Toby is...
- Let's go.
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Kristi...
Can you take them to bed, please?
Let's go.
Come on, sweetheart.
Take Grandma's stuff off and let's go to bed.
Dennis and I are gonna be right next door, okay?
We're gonna leave a light on and everything, so you can find us, and everything's gonna be...
Gonna be fine, okay?
I love you so much.
Love you.
- Good night, guys.
- I love you so much.
When are you gonna stop taping us?
Not until this thing's over.
When's your mom gonna let us sleep in the same bed?
I can't stop thinking about it.
I can't.
I know.
Just close your eyes and try to get to sleep.
Come here.
We can share a pillow, too.
That's fine.
Julie.
Julie.
Do you hear that?
Like cars?
- Sorry...
- It's my mom.
She's always up at night.
She can't sleep.
Oh, my God, she's so loud.
Do you want me to go check on her?
She's gonna wake the girls up.
I'll be right back.
Julie?
Julie!
Girls?
Girls?
Julie?
Hey, Julie!
Hello?
What the fuck?
Julie?
Lois?
What?
What the fuck?
Julie!
What the fuck?
Fuck.
Oh, my God.
Julie!
Julie?
What's wrong?
Ju...
Fuck.
Fuck.
Julie?
Get up.
Mommy?
Oh, Kristi!
No, Kristi!
- Dennis?
- Come here, come on.
Let's go, Kristi.
What happened to Mommy?
Is she okay?
Oh, shit.
Come here.
Go, go.
Dennis, I'm scared.
It's okay.
No, Kristi, don't talk.
Is Mommy okay?
Quiet, okay?
Be quiet.
Just don't, okay?
Just quiet, okay?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Kristi, please, please, be quiet.
I'm gonna go check, okay?
Stay here.
Come on, Kristi.
What was that?
We're gonna get out of here, okay?
Come on, let's go.
I'm scared.
We're gonna get out of here.
Up.
Shh!
Okay.
We're gonna be okay.
I don't know.
Katie!
Katie, get away from there!
Kristi, listen to me, stay right here, okay?
Don't move, okay?
Katie?
Katie?
Come on, Toby.
Let's get ready.
DANIEL:
You'll be spending a lot of time in here.
This is gonna be your room.
There's some kind of animal being de-liced or something.
Compression chamber.
That's your crib.
It's hermetically sealed.
And this is your paint color.
- What color is that, hon?
- KRISTI:
Jamaica Bay Blue.
Jamaica!
And there you are.
- Hi.
- Yes, hi.
And there's your dad, who's playing with his new toy instead of helping me paint.
- Sorry.
I can help.
- (SCOFFS)
- Yeah?
Come on.
- (CHUCKLES) If I wasn't...
If I wasn't filming I would help.
Go and get the other ladder.
Yeah, you should have a real ladder.
That's...
You know.
- (DOORBELL RINGS)
- All right, that's a...
- Who's that?
- Oh, it's my sister.
She's here to check out the nursery.
- Oh, Daniel, this is gorgeous.
- DANIEL:
Yeah?
This is so gorgeous.
I love it.
I love the blue.
I'm glad y'all went with that.
It's much better than the green.
- How are you feeling?
- All right.
You know, I think I'm okay.
- How is he?
- Oh, he's doing so good.
He's kicking and, like, swimming.
- I feel like he's swimming.
- Hey, little fella!
- What did you say?
- DANIEL:
It's Hunter.
- No!
Tyler.
It's Tyler.
- I like that.
- It's Tyler Hunter.
- It's... (LAUGHS)
I like...
I like both.
I don't wanna choose.
- I'm not gonna get into this.
- You have to.
Come on.
In preparation for the big move, I have a couple of boxes in my car that I would love to throw in your basement.
Please?
KATIE:
This is the last box.
DANIEL:
Really?
KATIE:
Probably.
- (DANIEL SIGHS)
- KATIE:
Oh, God!
DANIEL:
So, a little bit nervous?
No, I'm excited.
I spend all my time over at Micah's anyway.
DANIEL:
VHS?
That is old school.
- Do we have a VCR?
- DANIEL:
Uh...
I didn't even know you had this much stuff.
Somehow I ended up with it after Grandma Lois died.
I haven't even gone through it.
- How come you got it?
- I don't know.
You can have it.
Nobody ever gives me anything.
DANIEL:
So who's gonna get the top bunk?
- (KRISTI LAUGHING)
- KATIE:
We're not 12.
DANIEL:
We can get a VCR for free.
KRISTI:
You know, I don't remember these at all.
DANIEL:
You guys didn't go Beta, huh?
(KRISTI LAUGHS)
DANIEL:
That's fine, okay?
I'm just gonna tape over an old one.
Can you get Abby out of here, please?
She's gonna get cut on the glass!
We just got back and the whole place is pretty much destroyed.
Nothing seems to be actually missing.
It's just, everything's really...
That's what she's telling me.
Just make sure we document everything.
Don't touch anything.
DANIEL:
This is our basement.
I don't see anything really broken.
(SIGHS) I don't see that box of tapes that Katie brought over.
Looks like that's the only thing that's missing.
(STATIC CRACKLING)
DENNIS:
All right and there she is.
The mother of the birthday girl, my girlfriend...
JULIE:
Chocolate, chocolate, rainbow stuff.
- That is a good-looking cake.
- Which is exactly what she wanted.
Beautiful.
Just beautiful.
And you're beautiful.
I don't know how you do it.
- (ALL SINGING HAPPYBIRTHDAY)
- Ooh!
Are you okay?
Watch your backs!
JULIE:
Whoa!
Watch your hair.
Good job.
(ALL CHEERING)
DENNIS:
All right, and here's the birthday girl.
Oh, I found some.
DENNIS:
She looks pretty unhappy.
Something's going on.
We got the young one.
Under the trampoline.
LOIS:
Twenty bites and that's about all.
KATIE:
Twenty bites?
That's what my mother used to make me do.
JULIE:
That's a lot of cake on that plate.
DENNIS:
Hey, Julie.
Go get Kristi.
(PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
DENNIS:
Say hi, Kristi!
(SOFTLY) Hi.
(PEOPLE CHUCKLE)
DENNIS:
Kristi's a little shy.
Oh, that's cute.
They love each other.
It's Grandma.
Happy, happy, happy birthday.
(SINGS HAPPYBIRTHDAY)
Never forget the day you were born.
I held you in my arms and you made me laugh and cry at the same time.
You were so cute.
Serious piece of equipment, so be careful.
LOIS:
How do you shoot those weddings with this thing?
- It must hurt your back.
- Uh, it's something, uh...
You have to work certain parts of your...
I've only been here for a few months, um...
But thank you for welcoming me into your family.
Um, I...
- I just...
I love you, and I love...
- Dennis, my shoulder.
...you so much.
Happy birthday.
- LOIS:
Okay, take this thing now.
- All right.
DENNIS:
Whoa!
BOY:
Oh, my God!
(ALL LAUGHING)
DENNIS:
Katie, take it easy.
Take it easy.
It's dead.
You're a little monster.
DENNIS:
All right, all right, I got my camera.
Here, let me help you, 'cause I don't...
- I want to see the tooth full throttle.
- Okay, all right.
This thing's coming out today.
- Is it okay if I push it a little?
- No, no, don't push it.
DENNIS:
Lower lip.
JULIE:
Want some juice, babe?
DENNIS:
Down.
JULIE:
Here.
DENNIS:
Now...
Oooh!
JULIE:
You want some of this?
KATIE:
Yeah, orange juice.
DENNIS:
Oh!
That is...
That is a good one!
- DENNIS:
All right.
- Let's see this.
Open up.
Don't push it with your tongue.
Let's see.
- "Ah!"
- DENNIS:
Ooh, it's ready.
- I think it might be...
- DENNIS:
It's ready.
You're gonna get a newjob as a dentist.
JULIE:
Oh, thank you.
You think I'm good?
Wrap it in a tissue, put it in your pocket, and bring it home for...
- The Tooth Fairy.
- The Tooth Fairy, that's right.
And we'll put it under your pillow, tonight.
DENNIS:
Wow.
You like the Tooth Fairy, right?
We love the Tooth Fairy.
DENNIS:
Why does he need a bowl?
Because he wants to eat.
- DENNIS:
He's hungry?
- Mmm-hmm.
Kristi, Toby isn't real.
- JULIE:
Hey.
It doesn't matter.
- Yes, he is.
(WHISTLING)
My assistant Randy is currently 43 minutes late.
And this isn't the first time, he's always late.
So, today we're gonna play a little prank and see if we can teach him a lesson.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Come on around the front door.
RANDY:
Come on, just open the garage.
Randy, I need your help, man.
Come around the front door.
RANDY:
Okay, okay.
- Hey.
Whoa.
- Hey, man.
- Where were you?
What happened?
- Sorry I'm late.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.
- I got blocked in.
- I'm really sorry.
- That's all right, man.
I had a leak in the house.
I was hoping you'd get here sooner.
I had a leak in the ceiling here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Here, push this up here.
RANDY:
It didn't rain last night.
Hold this for a second.
I need your help.
It's been going like crazy.
And I don't know what to do,
- so I got that pole there.
- Why is it white?
- What?
- Why is it white?
I don't know.
I think it's maybe something with the paint on this.
Anyway, I gotta get some spackle.
I'll be back.
- Wait, you just want me to...
- Hang on.
- You want me to wait here and hold it?
- Thanks, Randy.
Wait, Dennis.
I'm just supposed to wait here?
Dennis.
Dennis!
- Hey.
- DENNIS:
Okay, girls, that's far enough.
Hey.
No.
Why don't you come on in and hand me that ladder?
KATIE:
No.
KRISTI:
Mmm-mmm.
- Are you serious?
- KATIE:
I'm serious.
You know you don't have to listen to him.
He's not even your real dad.
Who wants to go jump on the trampoline?
- GIRLS:
I do!
- Oh, come on.
KATIE:
I have a new trick to show you.
DENNIS:
Okay.
Guys, come on.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.
- DENNIS:
Ready for a surprise?
It better be a ladder.
We were playing outside.
What did we find, guys?
- GIRLS:
A spider.
- Dennis.
- We've got a cute little spider.
- Dennis!
- Come on, man.
- Okay.
Yeah?
- GIRLS:
Do it, do it, do it, do it!
- All right.
Run!
(GIRLS LAUGHING)
(DENNIS LAUGHING)
KATIE:
It wasn't even a spider.
RANDY:
That really hurt.
That really hurt.
(GIRLS SCREAMING)
- Hi.
- DENNIS:
Big day today, right?
- Yep.
- What's today?
- Picture day.
- Picture day!
- Dennis, you're still in.
- DENNIS:
Sorry.
- KATIE:
I was finishing my hair!
- This picture's for Grandma.
Smile.
(CAMERA CLICKS)
DENNIS:
All right!
- Okay...
- Kristi, come on!
DENNIS:
Here it goes.
All right.
- ALL:
Cheese.
- (CAMERA CLICKS)
(RANDY LAUGHING)
MAN:
Thanks, sweetheart.
WOMAN:
No, no, no.
Seriously, like...
- Randy?
- Yeah.
Where did you find this girl?
I don't know.
I didn't see her at all throughout any of the wedding... (BOTH LAUGHING)
- That's because I'm so happy...
- "So happy for you."
I love my job, man.
- I should've got her number.
- Probably could've.
Randy, this is great stuff.
I can't use any of this, but it's great.
(LAUGHING)
(CAMERA LENS WHIRRING)
(THUDDING)
DENNIS:
Jule?
(THUDDING CONTINUES)
Julie?
There it goes again.
DENNIS:
Hello?
Julie?
(RATTLING)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
TEDDY:
I like this song!
Not bad.
Mmm, that's pretty good.
Teddy?
Did you fall down?
(MUSIC STOPS)
(CREAKING)
DENNIS:
What was that?
(GASPS) Oh.
(DENNIS PANTING)
- Hey.
- Hey.
What you doing?
Nothing.
I was just looking around.
What...
What...
You guys just get home?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- It was girls' day.
- I know.
How was it?
- Was it fun?
- Great.
(CHUCKLES) You just really snuck up on me there.
(CHUCKLES)
DENNIS:
All right.
It's time.
- Don't film this.
- Why not?
It's illegal.
- (DENNIS LAUGHS)
- Don't laugh.
We haven't even started smoking it, and you're already paranoid.
It's illegal.
What if my kids find me?
I'm a mother.
- Now relax.
- Seriously, Dennis.
Seriously, Julie.
(MOCKING) Let's get really serious.
Seriously.
- Shut up.
- Let's be serious.
- All right.
- Real, real, real big, big...
Whoa.
That was big.
(COUGHING)
Julie, do the voice.
(IN FUNNY VOICE) Dennis.
- (IN FUNNY VOICE) What voice?
- (DENNIS LAUGHS)
This voice?
Dennis, I can't believe you're filming me smoke marijuana.
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)
DENNIS: (WHISPERING) God, you're so beautiful.
Shut up.
I want to film us having sex.
Is that perverted?
- Is that weird?
- I don't know.
Was that a yes?
Okay.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Hey, there, pretty lady.
- (CHUCKLES)
Oh, stop.
I don't know.
You sure...
You sure you're up for this?
No.
You know what?
Don't answer that.
Hurry up, before I change my mind.
Oh, okay, sorry.
- (CHUCKLES)
- All right.
(IMITATES GUITAR)
What are you doing?
What was that?
- It's porno music.
- (LAUGHS)
Great.
Classy.
Mmm.
Good start.
Good, right?
- All right.
- I don't know.
Mmm. (GROANING LUSTFULLY)
(CLATTERING IN DISTANCE)
(CLATTERING CONTINUES)
Relax.
Just relax.
Don't worry about it.
Hey.
- Yeah.
I'm okay.
- Relax.
(THUDDING)
- Yeah, what is that?
- I don't know.
Whoa!
(RUMBLING)
It's an earthquake.
- Holy shit!
- Dennis, it's an earthquake!
The girls.
The girls!
Come on!
Dennis!
(RUMBLING SUBSIDES)
JULIE:
Dennis.
Oh, my God, I look so fat.
DENNIS:
You don't look fat.
- Look at the size of me on top of you.
- You look beautiful.
You look like you can't breathe 'cause I'm sitting on top of you.
I want another shot at doing one of these.
- Watch this.
- Dennis, you have to erase this.
Julie, watch, watch, watch.
- See that?
- What?
Did you see that in the corner?
Yeah, I see, like, dust.
- Dirt falling.
- No, Julie.
There's something there.
- You are crazy.
- There was something there.
Wait, you can see something there.
It's very cute, but you're going a little crazy.
You're like one of those people that see things, like in their food.
Like when people think they see the Virgin Mary in their toast.
- That's you right now.
- Oh, that's hilarious.
This has to be erased and this has to be erased.
I'm sorry.
Or we're never having sex again.
I'm late.
I got to go.
Thanks for erasing both of them.
You know, you're going to regret saying that.
Doubt it.
I don't think you can go a day without having sex, personally.
(IN SING-SONG) Don't dare me.
- Erase it.
- I'm not going to erase it.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.
Dude, what are you doing, man?
You're always so late.
I know, it's my car!
I got the earthquake.
- Did you really?
- On tape.
It's scary, right?
Is that Julie?
It's nothing, it's nothing.
- We're going to...
- Is that a sex tape?
Yeah.
I got...
This weird thing happened after...
She let you make a sex tape?
Yeah, but it got interrupted by the earthquake.
I wouldn't have let anything interrupt that.
Relax, man, just relax.
Would you just stop?
- Let me slow-mo shuttle forward.
- Just shut up.
DENNIS:
Check this out.
Ready?
All right, let me tweak the contrast here.
Okay.
I'm gonna take the color out.
It looks like dust is falling on something.
It looks like a figure, right?
- You see that?
- Yeah.
Did you catch that?
- Yeah, it moved.
- Did you see the dust move?
- It moved, right?
- What was that?
I don't know.
Check it out.
- It's weird, right?
- It's kind of weird.
You know, I've been hearing these noises in the girls' room lately.
I don't know.
I feel like it's...
Something weird's going on.
- DENNIS:
Julie?
- Yeah, I'm back here.
Hey, um, I wanted to talk to you... (SHRIEKS) Dennis!
Oh, sorry!
Sorry.
Oh, my God!
(LAUGHS) Sorry.
You mind if I set up a couple cameras around the house?
I'm not going to talk to you right now.
Okay, I'll...
I'll take that as a yes?
- I hate you!
- Okay.
Love you, too.
KATIE:
How long do the tapes last?
DENNIS:
About six hours each.
So you have to change them every six hours?
Mmm, yes.
Katie, can you hop out of the frame?
- Okay.
Is that good?
- Yeah, so I can...
Keep going.
- KATIE:
Can I see it?
- Sure.
Here.
Come here.
See it?
Yeah.
- Pretty cool, right?
- Mmm-hmm.
So, what are you trying to see?
Uh, anything unusual or strange.
Oh, no, it's not that.
Don't touch the camera.
- Kristi?
- Yeah?
Don't touch the camera or anything.
Katie, just leave it alone.
(CLATTERING)
- Dennis.
- What?
Really?
Don't you think you're overreacting a little?
This is a new house.
It shouldn't be making these noises.
Not just in here.
It's in the girls' room, too.
No...
This is not gonna work here.
Like, what do you think you're gonna catch?
Whatever's in our house.
Oh, right, 'cause there's something here watching us.
Well, there's definitely something.
I...
I feel it.
I feel something, I'm telling you.
JULIE:
Yeah, I feel something, too.
I'm not gonna lie.
I feel a camera.
The earthquake, and all those...
I don't know, stuff that's been happening and...
I don't know, I just...
No, it's totally normal.
(SIGHS)
Bye, camera.
Good night, camera.
(KISSES)
(CREAKING)
(PATTERING)
Yeah?
Yeah, probably.
In their bedroom.
Be quiet, so we don't wake Katie up.
(WHISPERING) It's okay.
Why?
Oh.
Yeah, kind of.
He's very sweet.
Yeah, I saw that.
I watched some of the tapes on the camera and I saw you talking to somebody late last night.
If you saw me talking to somebody, it would be Toby.
(CHUCKLES) Toby's your friend?
Yes.
He's my friend.
Yeah, what do you guys talk about?
Mmm, secrets.
- He's big?
- Mmm-hmm.
So, is he old, like Grandma, or is he young, like you?
He's old, like Grandma.
And what does he look like?
Is he tall?
Is he fat?
He's tall.
He's tall.
Don't call him fat.
Kristi, when you say that if you tell one of your secrets that you'll be in trouble with Toby, what does that mean?
Well, I won't be safe.
He's gonna...
Did he say he's gonna hurt you?
No.
But I won't be safe.
That means, I will be, like...
Be in very, very big trouble.
Big trouble.
DENNIS:
You saw her.
JULIE:
That's how it is.
It was like he was actually there, right?
I know.
Because that's how active kids' imaginations are.
It's crazy.
I mean, imagination is one thing.
She got up in the middle of the night.
I mean, it's a little odd that she got up in the middle...
You haven't been around kids for that long.
They do weird things.
They...
Katie used to get up in the middle of the night and she used to sleep on the toilet.
(LAUGHING) What?
Okay?
I'm serious.
Really?
Yes.
Toby is a phase and he's going to be gone in a couple weeks.
I know it.
RANDY:
How many hours of footage do you have?
This is the job, man.
I got two cameras, six hours each.
Twelve hours.
- Twelve hours of footage?
- Yeah.
Got to do it, man.
- I'm seriously gonna review it.
- ...of footage every day.
Yes.
Now, please, I'm trying to concentrate.
That's so stupid.
There's only 24 hours in a day, Dennis.
- RANDY:
Hey, Julie.
- ...going?
DENNIS:
Um...
Good.
You want to step into my office and do some work with me or...
No.
You find anything?
RANDY:
Yes, actually.
We did find something.
We found that your family sleeps all night.
Oh!
Very funny, Randy.
- Keep up the good work.
- DENNIS:
Okay.
I love you with all of my heart and soul.
I love you, too.
It should either be called Back to the Past...
RANDY:
Present.
Back to the Present.
- No, no.
- End of story.
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It makes total sense.
Let's Get Back to the Present, maybe.
But Back to the Past...
- Back to the Present.
- (SIGHING)
(THUDDING)
- You hear that?
- Yeah.
(THUDDING CONTINUES)
- Was that...
That's it.
- What the hell?
It's happening again.
Come on.
(SHUSHING)
(CLATTERING)
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.
(METAL CLINKING)
RANDY: (WHISPERING) It's in your closet.
(KNOCKS)
- (WHISPERING) Are you getting that?
- Open it.
- Are you getting it?
- Yeah, I'm gettin' it.
- (ROARS) - (MEN SCREAM)
RANDY:
Holy shit!
(LAUGHING)
Holy shit!
That's not funny.
(IMITATES SHRIEKING)
- RANDY:
Oh, my God.
You're both crazy.
- I got you guys so bad.
- Oh, oh, I got you.
- RANDY:
You're both crazy.
I got you good.
I got you, too.
Are you okay?
Just go ahead and take your crap right there, 'cause I nearly crapped my pants.
Holy fuck!
You almost gave me a heart attack.
- Oh, my God, get away!
- (LAUGHING)
- Get away from me.
- Are you okay?
Get away.
I hate you.
(KRISTI AND KATIE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
DENNIS:
Wow.
Look at that tent.
Gosh.
I like this tent.
KATIE: "...and disguised his voice to sound like Little Red Riding Hood.
"The poor old woman, before she could even scream, the wolf gobbled her up."
Hello.
Shh.
Hey, guys.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- DENNIS:
Good.
- That's a little bright.
I'm sorry.
Guys?
I got you a little...
- Mmm!
- KATIE:
Give it to me.
Hey, guys.
Don't tell Mom, okay?
- BOTH:
Okay.
- All right.
What are you guys doing?
KATIE:
You'll see.
We've got a little surprise for you.
- One, two, three!
- ...two, three!
- Oh!
Ow!
Come here.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)
Here, tickle torture, tickle torture, tickle torture!
(ALL LAUGHING)
That's enough.
You guys are locked in the dungeon.
All right.
Good night, girls.
I love you.

- Shh!
I think the girls came inside.
I'll go check on them.
I got it.
(SWITCH CLICKS)
Girls?
(SWITCH CLICKS)
Dennis.
Dennis?
(GASPS) Don't do that to me.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- You scared me.
Did you check on them?
Why is this door locked?
Did you lock this?
What's the matter?
JULIE:
We're just checking on you guys.
Move that light.
We're gonna move inside, okay?
- I want to stay here.
- Why?
I'm sorry.
It's gonna be fun inside, too, though.
Come on.
Get your stuff.
We're gonna camp inside.
- Mommy.
Why?
- What?
KATIE:
Dennis, will you film me?
- DENNIS:
Yep.
- I wanna show you something.
You know Spud Webb?
One, two, three, slam dunk!
- Whoo!
- Very impressive.
Very good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Katie, are you sure you didn't sneak into the house last night?
My gosh, I pinky swear,
- I did not go into the house.
- Okay.
You wanna do me a favor?
Can you tell your mom that?
LOIS:
Where's Dennis?
Uh, he's out, buying more tapes.
With your credit card?
Mom.
He doesn't have any money.
That is not true.
The girls love him.
I mean, they just about think he's the coolest guy ever.
I mean, I really, really do like him.
I mean that.
It's just that the girls miss their father.
I don't know.
I wish he were a little more financially secure.
He is financially secure, Mom.
He has a job.
- He shoots wedding videos.
- No.
That's...
No.
- He has his own business.
- (SIGHS)
You know?
It's a whole different thing.
My God, Mom.
I just told you,
I don't want to have any more kids.
I'm not gonna get pregnant.
You always said you wanted a big family.
I changed my mind, okay?
I have two beautiful girls.
- You always wanted a son.
- (SIGHS)
I'm happy with the way things are.
Let's go.
(CREAKING)
DENNIS:
What the...
Fuck.
(LOUD BANG)
DENNIS:
Oh, this is great.
Hang on.
That's great!
Katie, that's great.
You're doing really good.
- Thank you.
- Let her go, Jule.
RANDY:
Dennis, I totally believe in this shit.
DENNIS:
Randy, watch the language.
All right, nice and slow.
My brother saw one once.
- DENNIS:
Really?
- Yeah.
What's Bloody Mary?
You don't know what Bloody Mary is?
It's, uh, where you go in the bathroom and you say "Bloody Mary" three times in the mirror and then you see a ghost.
KATIE:
Dennis, I wanna play Bloody Mary.
DENNIS:
Nothing, don't worry.
Shh!
It's okay.
You say Bloody Mary three times.
Ooh, I want to play!
I want to see a ghost.
I'm just saying you're missing half of the stuff in the house without cameras down there.
DENNIS:
I know.
You don't have to tell me.
Like put it up in the corner, like, rack it up in the corner or something?
It just doesn't work.
It just...
It's not a wide enough angle.
And I don't even...
They don't even make lenses that wide.
- Mirrors.
- Hmm?
You could use mirrors.
- RANDY:
This thing is so cool.
- Pretty cool, right?
It's awesome.
Wow!
Look, you got it balanced out and everything, too.
- (CREAKING)
- Whoa.
What is that?
I got to work out some kinks.
(CHUCKLING) Oh, man.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
- JULIE:
Hi.
- Hey.
What is that?
Check it out.
My new thing.
- It's pretty cool, right?
- Yeah.
- What...
What is it?
- I took your fan...
And basically, took apart...
Basically, the oscillator on your fan allows me to see both in the living room and in the kitchen.
Cool.
Wait, what?
You broke my fan?
I can put it back together.
Okay, MacGyver.
- It's cool, right?
- Mmm-hmm.
This way I can... (SNORING)

Kristi, what are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Go back to bed.
It's really late.
Hey, babe, what are you doing up here?
Painting.
Don't you want to play outside?
Not really.
How about your friend Toby?
Do you still talk to him?
Yeah.
Did he wake you up?
Mmm, no.
Did he tell you to come downstairs?
No.
You know you can tell me, right?
He told me not to talk about it.
Why don't you just ask him yourself?
He's standing right next to you.
I don't see him.
He's there.
DENNIS:
Hey, thanks for getting these, man.
RANDY:
Yeah, of course.
- This is good stuff.
- Thanks.
- Randy...
- Yeah?
Did you check this out?
No, I don't have a library card.
You stole these?
I didn't steal them, Dennis.
You told me to get the books, I got you the books.
It's what a library is.
It's for borrowing.
That's what "library" means in Spanish...
It means, "Borrow book store."
Malevolent Entities.
What is this one?
Uh, I don't know.
I looked through it for a second.
It had some creepy pictures...
This stuff is creepy.
Oh, hey.
It's your sister and her friends.
Is that a joke?
What, was that supposed to be funny?
Playing field hockey.
Says, "Kids are susceptible to spiritual contact."
Okay.
And?
Well, the whole thing with Kristi and her imaginary friend.
Remember, I was telling you the crazy stuff started happening only when she started talking to her imaginary friend.
I mean, it must want something.
That's what...
You know, that's what the book says.
They don't just stick around for no reason.
It wants something.
What does it want?
Well, the book says it feeds off of your fear.
KATIE:
Hey, Kristi.
- Kristi.
- Yeah?
- Wanna play a game?
- Sure.
Here.
What are you doing?
- Playing with my soccer ball?
- Yeah.
Kristi, that's mine.
Kristi!
Kristi, come on.
Kristi, come help me.
What are we doing?
- We're gonna play Bloody Mary.
- Why?
Because I wanna try to catch the ghost.
Okay.
I think it's on.
So, how you play is you say "Bloody Mary" three times into the mirror and then her dead body's supposed to appear
- in the mirror and try to kill you.
- Stop!
Stop!
Stop, Katie.
KRISTI:
So, now what do we do?
Shh.
We have to say "Bloody Mary".
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Bloody Mary.
- Kristi, I said three times, not four.
- Sorry.
- I'm scared, Katie.
- Shh!
We have to be quiet.
(BANGING)
JULIE:
Guys... (GASPS) My gosh, Mom!
You scared me.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
We're just playing a game.
Okay.
Grandma just got here.
Go say hi.
- You moved his camera?
- Yeah.
- Is it taping?
- I'll pick it up, I promise.
Yeah.
We gotta move it before he comes home 'cause he's gonna be mad.
- You guys wanna go to the pool?
- GIRLS:
Yeah.

You wanna go to the pool, Grandma?

Are you okay?
Holy shit.
KATIE:
Mommy, what happened?
- Stay upstairs.
Stay upstairs.
- What happened?
Don't come down here.
- There's glass on the floor.
Stay there.
- KATIE:
Are you hurt?
(DENNIS TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
JULIE: (STUTTERING) I have no idea, I have no idea.
JULIE:
Looks fine, right?
It didn't even break.
That's good.
- DENNIS:
What happened?
- It just fell.
I didn't...
What do you mean, what happened?
I was in there.
- DENNIS:
Hi, Kristi.
- Hey.
- Say hi to the camera.
- Hey.
- Can I join you guys?
- Sure.
- Oh, I can?
- Yeah.
Okay, great.
I'm gonna set my camera here, okay?
- Okay.
- Just keep it out of the way.
Wait.
Why are you filming this?
Um, it's just like, I'm testing out my, like, new camera and, you know, no reason.
Don't sit there.
That's Toby's spot.
Oh, sorry.
Is Toby sitting there right now?
Okay.
Sorry.
Sorry, Toby.
- (GIGGLES) - (CHUCKLES)
Does Teddy need help with his tea?
He looks thirsty.
- Yeah.
- Here you go, Teddy.
Here.
He can't reach 'em.
Okay.
Wow.
He was thirsty.
See, I told you.
(BOTH CHUCKLING)
And she keeps falling.
Poke.
So, Kristi, what was the last thing that Toby said to you?
Oh, like...
- Anything?
- Yeah.
- No?
- Secrets.
Secrets.
Regular stuff.
Oh, in her sink?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Oh, that...
Did you, uh...
Did you...
Did he say something just now?
No, I just put my hand on him.
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
And he didn't like that.
He doesn't like that, when you...
- No.
- Oh.
Sorry, Toby.
It was a mistake, right?
Yeah. (GIGGLES)
- What?
- Nothing.
- What?
- Never mind.
- What were you gonna say?
- Nothing.
It's okay, you can tell me.
KATIE:
Kristi, why is Dennis's camera here?
Because me and Toby were having a little tea party and he was filming us.
- I'm not!
- Yes, you are, Kristi.
Only babies have imaginary friends.
He is real.
(IN SING-SONG) Hey, Kristi!
Kristi's such a baby!
Baby!
Katie, stop it!
Well, you're being a baby!
Only babies have imaginary friends.
No, I'm not!
He's right in there.
In there?
Toby, come out!
Toby, come out!
Toby!
Okay, I'm gonna go in.
Katie, you shouldn't do that.
Katie!
Don't go in there.
(EXCLAIMS DISMISSIVELY)
- You shouldn't do that.
- Well, I am.
Toby, come out.
Toby...
- (KATIE SCREAMS)
- Katie.
Kristi!
What are you doing?
- Open the door!
- (BANGING)
- (CONTINUES BANGING)
- You shouldn't do that.
Kristi, open this door!
- It's not me!
- Kristi!
- JULIE:
Girls!
- Open the door!
- What is this yelling?
What is going on?
- I'm not doing that.
JULIE:
Stop fighting right this second.
Why's Dennis's camera on the floor?
She locked me in there.
- Katie, you can't touch his stuff.
- Kristi, why...
Stop fighting right this second.
- Mom, she locked me in there!
- I don't want to hear it.
- Come on, come on.
- KATIE:
Then who locked me in there?
KRISTI:
Toby did.
Oh, yeah, like Toby locked me in there.
KATIE:
She's gonna be here any minute.
- (DOORBELL RINGING)
- See?
There she is.
Mommy, Lisa's here!
JULIE:
Okay!
KATIE:
Hi, Lisa.
LISA:
Hi!
How are you?
KATIE:
Good.
KATIE:
I wanna show you something upstairs.
JULIE:
Hi, Lisa.
Wait, what are you showing me?
I got some new beads for my birthday.
Beads!
Oh, let's see 'em.
Hi, Kristi.
How are you?
Hey.
What's that?
Oh, don't mind this.
You know Dennis and his cameras, he just puts them...
Just ignore it.
JULIE: 8:30 bedtime?
KATIE:
No, no, no, 10:00.

Nice try.

Are you tired?
- Um, not really.
- No?
Can you tell us a story?
Hmm, sure.
What kind of story?
A ghost story.
Ghost story?
With a ghost.
Okay, um, let's think.
(LISA BOOING)
I'm a ghost!
Hello, Dennis!
You found the ghost.

Give you any trouble, or...
No, no, no, no, it was good.
Um...
But my mom's meeting me, so if I could just...
- Oh, oh, yeah, sure.
- Oh, yeah, give her some money.
Um, here you go.
Thank you.
You're sure everything was good?
Yeah, no.

Kristi, go to bed.
It's late.

- DENNIS:
Yeah, that's Lisa.
How come I never met her?
I'll put in a good word.
- See the sheet?
- Yeah.
Watch this.
- Gone.
- Holy fuck.
Am I...
Am I right?
(MIMICS WHOOSHING)
Holy...
- Did you see that?
- ...fuck!
(DENNIS LAUGHS)
I'm not crazy, right?
I'm not crazy.
That just happened.
Holy!
What the fuck is that?
I don't know.
- What is that?
- I don't know.
I'm telling you, it's...
And she didn't say anything at all?
She left the room, like...
Did you show Julie?
No, man.
What, are you kidding?
She would flip out.
She would go nuts, and, you know, she'd make me take the cameras down, and I can't do that.
I really want to figure out what this thing wants.
Got to keep taping this shit, though, man.
I know.
I am.
- You got to keep taping this shit.
- I know.
She got blown in the face.
Yeah, yeah.

DENNIS:
What the...
What the fuck?
Hey, how's she feeling?
We need to go to the doctor 'cause she's burning up.
Oh, no.
- Yeah, she's really...
- She's really that bad?
- Yeah, it's bad.
- All right.
It's like, I've taken it a couple times.
Do you want me to go with you or...
Well, I mean, I don't know.
Who's gonna watch Katie?
I can call Randy.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- DENNIS:
Hey, man.
- Hey, hey.
- Thanks for coming over.
- No problemo.
- KATIE:
Hi, Randy.
- Hi!
JULIE:
Randy, thank you so much.
DENNIS:
We're gonna be at the hospital for a little bit.
RANDY:
Okay.
Anything you guys want...
- I know where everything is.
- Okay, great.
- Yeah.
- All right.
KATIE:
Bye!
Love you.
Bye, Kristi!
You have everything?
You have papers and insurance?
JULIE:
Yeah, I have it.
DENNIS:
Thanks a lot.
KATIE:

I'll lock the door.

All right, be good, Katie.
See you.
(LATCHING DOOR)
RANDY:
Hey, hey.
KATIE:
Hi.
So what's wrong with Kristi?
It's like a really high fever or something like that.
Oh.
Is it contagious?
I don't think so.
I haven't gotten sick.
Okay, good.
(CLEARS THROAT)
What do you want to do?
Can we play Bloody Mary?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Seriously?
I really don't think this is a good idea, Katie.
You made a promise.
You have to do it.
- Can't we just play, like, doll house...
- Get the camera!
...or somethin'?
(SIGHS) Sorry, Dennis.
Not my idea.
Come on.
I'm comin', I'm comin'.
(CLEARS THROAT) So you say, "Bloody Mary" three times.
- Mmm-hmm.
- And then you wait a little bit and then you turn the lights back on and then you're supposed to see her body in the mirror and she's gonna try to kill you.
Try and kill you.
Good game.
- Yep.
- (LAUGHS)
I don't know why you wanna play this.
One of us is gonna be dead by the end of it.
I guess it's a one-time game.
Okay, let's do it.
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
- Randy!
- (GASPS)
Nothing happened. (CHUCKLING)
You turned the light on too soon.
Oh, come on, Katie.
This is stupid.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You can't leave!
Let's just go play doll house or something.
No, you didn't do it right.
What did I not do right?
You need to keep the light off longer.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
You wanna play Bloody Mary?
- Let's play Bloody Mary.
- Okay, ready?
You're not gonna see anybody play Bloody Mary like I'm about to play Bloody Mary.
(RANDY CLEARS THROAT)

(WHISPERING) Okay, can I turn it on now?
Shh!

Uh, I just scratched myself or something.

I don't want to play this.
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Stay here.
I don't wanna play anymore.
It's okay, it's okay.
(RANDY SHUSHING)

Shh, it's okay.
(CRASHING)
RANDY:

(EXCLAIMING FRIGHTFULLY)
Okay.

It's all my fault.
It's okay.
- Come here, come here.
- I'm sorry!
(CRYING) It's okay.
Huh?

- It's okay, it's just like an earthquake.
I'm not gonna tell.
I'm not gonna tell.

It's okay.
I wanna go downstairs!
Yeah, let's go downstairs.
- (KATIE WHIMPERING)
- Oh, fuck.
DENNIS:
Randy, Randy, where are you going, man?
Relax.
Randy, Randy, take it easy.
Randy.
What...
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm getting all my stuff.
What...
What are you getting your stuff for, man?
- Relax.
Sit down.
- Dennis.
Get the camera out of my face.
I told you, I felt something in the room with us and then I felt a claw dig into my side, okay?
Okay, okay.
When you say "something..."
Great interview.
- No, Dennis, I'm done.
Fuck.
- When you say...
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home!
Look at the fuckin' books.
This isn't, you know,
Casper, the fuckin' friendly ghost you're chasing, man.
- I'm sorry you got hurt.
- This thing is dangerous!
- I'm sorry you got hurt, okay?
- Jesus fucking Christ!
I'm sorry, but...
What are you gonna do?
You're just gonna quit?
You're acting ridiculous.
Relax!
Dennis, no, you're acting ridiculous if you're not gonna get the fuck out.
You have to tell Julie, okay?
Just watch the fucking tape, Dennis!
- What's up?
- DENNIS:
Hey.
What?
Um... (SIGHS) I need to talk to you.
- Okay.
- All right, sit down.
Here.
Sit down, Jule.
Okay, where do I begin?
...from the '30s.
Look at the necklaces.
That's crazy.
Yeah?
It's the same symbol.
Isn't that the same symbol from the girls' room?
All right?
These...
These women, they were, um...
- Oh, my God.
- ...part of a coven.
You're really something.
I...
I...
I really need to...
To tell you this, okay?
KATIE:
Kristi!
You'd better run!
(THUDS)
You sound crazy.
Do you know that?
Hang on a second, all right?
Do you know how crazy you're starting to sound?
Would you just give me a second to explain?
They would have these ceremonies and they would wait till the girls were old enough to get pregnant and then they would...
They would...
They would take their sons.
Oh!
Oh, right.
And then they would brainwash them and they didn't remember a thing.
That explains it.
Dennis, I'm not listening to...
Mom?
(SHUDDERING)
(CREAKING)
(SCREAMING) Ow!
- I need to show you something.
- It's all you do!
There's shit...
You don't even spend any time with us anymore.
You just sit here and play with this shit all day long.
- Could you just wait one second?
- It's like you're obsessed!
Just wait one second.
I need to show you this, okay?
No, I can't.
I can't wait.
- No, no, no...
- I can't wait!
I can't!
- Why not?
- Because...
Because Kristi's upset all the time...
- Mommy?
(SOBBING)
- What the fuck?
I don't...
What?
What?
What?
Toby pulled my hair.
- What happened?
- Who?
Toby pulled my hair.
- (SOBBING)
- This is your fault.
Okay?
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
Hey...
I didn't... (KATIE SOBBING)
No more cameras.
No more ghosts.
This ends tomorrow.

No, we're not going to Grandma's house, okay?
Why?
We're not going to Grandma's because there's no Toby, sweetie.
- Yes, there...
- There's no Toby and there's no ghost.
Hey, don't run away from me.
Hey.
There's no ghost and that's the end of it.
I don't want to hear any more of this talk, okay?

Come on.
I don't want to hear Toby's name ever again.
Okay?
Julie, it's just pretend.
That's it.
He's done.
He's not in our lives.

Toby is...
- Let's go.
- I don't wanna hear it.
- DENNIS:
Kristi...
Can you take them to bed, please?
Let's go.
Come on, sweetheart.
Take Grandma's stuff off and let's go to bed.
Dennis and I are gonna be right next door, okay?
We're gonna leave a light on and everything, so you can find us, and everything's gonna be...
Gonna be fine, okay?
I love you so much.

When are you gonna stop taping us?
Not until this thing's over.
When's your mom gonna let us sleep in the same bed?
I can't stop thinking about it.

(GLASS SHATTERS)
You'll be spending a lot of time in here.
This is gonna be your room.
There's some kind of animal being de-liced or something.
Compression chamber.
That's your crib.
It's hermetically sealed.
And this is your paint color.
- What color is that, hon?
- Jamaica Bay Blue.
Jamaica!
And there you are.
- Hi.
- Yes, hi.
And there's your dad, who's playing with his new toy instead of helping me paint.
Sorry.
I can help.
- Yeah?
Come on.
- If I wasn't...
If I wasn't filming I would help.
Go and get the other ladder.
Yeah, you should have a real ladder.
That's...
You know.
All right, that's a...
- Who's that?
- It's my sister.
She's here to check out the nursery.
- Daniel, this is gorgeous.
- Yeah?
This is so gorgeous.
I love it.
I love the blue.
I'm glad y'all went with that.
It's much better than the green.
- How are you feeling?
- All right.
You know, I think I'm okay.
- How is he?
- He's doing so good.
He's kicking and, like, swimming.
- I feel like he's swimming.
- Hey, little fella!
- What did you say?
- It's Hunter.
- No!
Tyler.
It's Tyler.
- I like that.
- It's Tyler Hunter.
- It's...
I like...
I like both.
I don't wanna choose.
- I'm not gonna get into this.
- You have to.
Come on.
In preparation for the big move, I have a couple of boxes in my car that I would love to throw in your basement.
Please?
- This is the last box.
- Really?
Probably.
Oh, God!
So, a little bit nervous?
No, I'm excited.
I spend all my time over at Micah's anyway.
VHS?
That is old school.
Do we have a VCR?
I didn't even know you had this much stuff.
Somehow I ended up with it after Grandma Lois died.
I haven't even gone through it.
- How come you got it?
- I don't know.
You can have it.
Nobody ever gives me anything.
So who's gonna get the top bunk?
We're not 12.
We can get a VCR for free.
You know, I don't remember these at all.
You guys didn't go Beta, huh?
That's fine, okay?
I'm just gonna tape over an old one.
Can you get Abby out of here, please?
She's gonna get cut on the glass!
We just got back and the whole place is pretty much destroyed.
Nothing seems to be actually missing.
It's just, everything's really...
That's what she's telling me.
Just make sure we document everything.
Don't touch anything.
This is our basement.
I don't see anything really broken.
I don't see that box of tapes that Katie brought over.
Looks like that's the only thing that's missing.
All right and there she is.
The mother of the birthday girl, my girlfriend...
Chocolate, chocolate, rainbow stuff.
- That is a good-looking cake.
- Which is exactly what she wanted.
Beautiful.
Just beautiful.
And you're beautiful.
I don't know how you do it.
Are you okay?
Watch your backs!
Watch your hair.
Good job.
All right, and here's the birthday girl.
I found some.
She looks pretty unhappy.
Something's going on.
We got the young one.
Under the trampoline.
- Twenty bites and that's about all.
- Twenty bites?
That's what my mother used to make me do.
That's a lot of cake on that plate.
Hey, Julie.
Go get Kristi.
Say hi, Kristi!
Hi.
Kristi's a little shy.
That's cute.
They love each other.
It's Grandma.
Happy, happy, happy birthday.
Never forget the day you were born.
I held you in my arms and you made me laugh and cry at the same time.
You were so cute.
Serious piece of equipment, so be careful.
How do you shoot those weddings with this thing?
- It must hurt your back.
- It's something...
You have to work certain parts of your...
I've only been here for a few months...
But thank you for welcoming me into your family.
I...
- I just...
I love you, and I love...
- Dennis, my shoulder.
...you so much.
Happy birthday.
- Okay, take this thing now.
- All right.
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God!
Katie, take it easy.
Take it easy.
It's dead.
You're a little monster.
- All right, all right, I got my camera.
- Here, let me help you, 'cause I don't...
- I want to see the tooth full throttle.
- Okay, all right.
This thing's coming out today.
- Is it okay if I push it a little?
- No, no, don't push it.
- Lower lip.
- Want some juice, babe?
- Down.
- Here.
Now...
- You want some of this?
- Yeah, orange juice.
That is...
That is a good one!
- All right.
- Let's see this.
Open up.
Don't push it with your tongue.
Let's see.
It's ready.
- I think it might be...
- It's ready.
You're gonna get a newjob as a dentist.
Thank you.
You think I'm good?
Wrap it in a tissue, put it in your pocket, and bring it home for...
- The Tooth Fairy.
- The Tooth Fairy, that's right.
And we'll put it under your pillow, tonight.
Wow.
You like the Tooth Fairy, right?
We love the Tooth Fairy.
Why does he need a bowl?
Because he wants to eat.
He's hungry?
Kristi, Toby isn't real.
- Hey.
It doesn't matter.
- Yes, he is.
My assistant Randy is currently 43 minutes late.
And this isn't the first time, he's always late.
So, today we're gonna play a little prank and see if we can teach him a lesson.
- Come on around the front door.
- Come on, just open the garage.
Randy, I need your help, man.
Come around the front door.
Okay, okay.
- Hey.
- Hey, man.
- Where were you?
What happened?
- Sorry I'm late.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.
- I got blocked in.
- I'm really sorry.
- That's all right, man.
I had a leak in the house.
I was hoping you'd get here sooner.
I had a leak in the ceiling here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Here, push this up here.
It didn't rain last night.
Hold this for a second.
I need your help.
It's been going like crazy.
And I don't know what to do,
- so I got that pole there.
- Why is it white?
- What?
- Why is it white?
I don't know.
I think it's maybe something with the paint on this.
Anyway, I gotta get some spackle.
I'll be back.
- Wait, you just want me to...
- Hang on.
- You want me to wait here and hold it?
- Thanks, Randy.
Wait, Dennis.
I'm just supposed to wait here?
Dennis.
Dennis!
- Hey.
- Okay, girls, that's far enough.
Hey.
No.
Why don't you come on in and hand me that ladder?
No.
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.
You know you don't have to listen to him.
He's not even your real dad.
Who wants to go jump on the trampoline?
- I do!
- Oh, come on.
- I have a new trick to show you.
- Okay.
Guys, come on.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.
- Ready for a surprise?
It better be a ladder.
We were playing outside.
What did we find, guys?
- A spider.
- Dennis.
- We've got a cute little spider.
- Dennis!
- Come on, man.
- Okay.
Yeah?
- Do it, do it, do it, do it!
- All right.
Run!
- It wasn't even a spider.
- That really hurt.
That really hurt.
- Hi.
- Big day today, right?
- Yep.
- What's today?
- Picture day.
- Picture day!
- Dennis, you're still in.
- Sorry.
- I was finishing my hair!
- This picture's for Grandma.
Smile.
All right!
- Okay...
- Kristi, come on!
Here it goes.
All right.
Cheese.
- Thanks, sweetheart.
- No, no, no.
Seriously, like...
- Randy?
- Yeah.
Where did you find this girl?
I don't know.
I didn't see her at all throughout any of the wedding...
- That's because I'm so happy...
- "So happy for you."
I love my job, man.
- I should've got her number.
- Probably could've.
Randy, this is great stuff.
I can't use any of this, but it's great.
Jule?
Julie?
There it goes again.
Hello?
Julie?
I like this song!
Not bad.
That's pretty good.
Teddy?
Did you fall down?
What was that?
- Hey.
- Hey.
What you doing?
Nothing.
I was just looking around.
What...
What...
You guys just get home?
Yeah.
- It was girls' day.
- I know.
How was it?
- Was it fun?
- Great.
You just really snuck up on me there.
All right.
It's time.
- Don't film this.
- Why not?
It's illegal.
Don't laugh.
We haven't even started smoking it, and you're already paranoid.
It's illegal.
What if my kids find me?
I'm a mother.
- Now relax.
- Seriously, Dennis.
Seriously, Julie.
Let's get really serious.
Seriously.
- Shut up.
- Let's be serious.
- All right.
- Real, real, real big, big...
That was big.
Julie, do the voice.
Dennis.
What voice?
This voice?
Dennis, I can't believe you're filming me smoke marijuana.
God, you're so beautiful.
Shut up.
I want to film us having sex.
Is that perverted?
- Is that weird?
- I don't know.
Was that a yes?
Okay.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Hey, there, pretty lady.
Stop.
I don't know.
You sure...
You sure you're up for this?
No.
You know what?
Don't answer that.
Hurry up, before I change my mind.
Okay, sorry.
All right.
What are you doing?
What was that?
It's porno music.
Great.
Classy.
Good start.
Good, right?
- All right.
- I don't know.
Relax.
Just relax.
Don't worry about it.
Hey.
- Yeah.
I'm okay.
- Relax.
- Yeah, what is that?
- I don't know.
It's an earthquake.
- Holy shit!
- Dennis, it's an earthquake!
The girls.
The girls!
Come on!
Dennis!
Dennis.
Oh, my God, I look so fat.
You don't look fat.
- Look at the size of me on top of you.
- You look beautiful.
You look like you can't breathe 'cause I'm sitting on top of you.
I want another shot at doing one of these.
- Watch this.
- Dennis, you have to erase this.
Julie, watch, watch, watch.
- See that?
- What?
Did you see that in the corner?
Yeah, I see, like, dust.
- Dirt falling.
- No, Julie.
There's something there.
- You are crazy.
- There was something there.
Wait, you can see something there.
It's very cute, but you're going a little crazy.
You're like one of those people that see things, like in their food.
Like when people think they see the Virgin Mary in their toast.
- That's you right now.
- That's hilarious.
This has to be erased and this has to be erased.
I'm sorry.
Or we're never having sex again.
I'm late.
I got to go.
Thanks for erasing both of them.
You know, you're going to regret saying that.
Doubt it.
I don't think you can go a day without having sex, personally.
Don't dare me.
- Erase it.
- I'm not going to erase it.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.
Dude, what are you doing, man?
You're always so late.
I know, it's my car!
I got the earthquake.
- Did you really?
- On tape.
It's scary, right?
Is that Julie?
It's nothing, it's nothing.
- We're going to...
- Is that a sex tape?
Yeah.
I got...
This weird thing happened after...
She let you make a sex tape?
Yeah, but it got interrupted by the earthquake.
I wouldn't have let anything interrupt that.
Relax, man, just relax.
Would you just stop?
- Let me slow-mo shuttle forward.
- Just shut up.
Check this out.
Ready?
All right, let me tweak the contrast here.
Okay.
I'm gonna take the color out.
It looks like dust is falling on something.
It looks like a figure, right?
- You see that?
- Yeah.
Did you catch that?
- Yeah, it moved.
- Did you see the dust move?
- It moved, right?
- What was that?
I don't know.
Check it out.
- It's weird, right?
- It's kind of weird.
You know, I've been hearing these noises in the girls' room lately.
I don't know.
I feel like it's...
Something weird's going on.
- Julie?
- Yeah, I'm back here.
Hey, I wanted to talk to you...
Dennis!
Sorry!
Sorry.
Oh, my God!
Sorry.
You mind if I set up a couple cameras around the house?
I'm not going to talk to you right now.
Okay, I'll...
I'll take that as a yes?
- I hate you!
- Okay.
Love you, too.
How long do the tapes last?
About six hours each.
So you have to change them every six hours?
Yes.
Katie, can you hop out of the frame?
- Okay.
Is that good?
- Yeah, so I can...
Keep going.
- Can I see it?
- Sure.
Here.
Come here.
See it?
Yeah.
Pretty cool, right?
So, what are you trying to see?
Anything unusual or strange.
Oh, no, it's not that.
Don't touch the camera.
- Kristi?
- Yeah?
Don't touch the camera or anything.
Katie, just leave it alone.
- Dennis.
- What?
Really?
Don't you think you're overreacting a little?
This is a new house.
It shouldn't be making these noises.
Not just in here.
It's in the girls' room, too.
No...
This is not gonna work here.
Like, what do you think you're gonna catch?
Whatever's in our house.
Right, 'cause there's something here watching us.
Well, there's definitely something.
I...
I feel it.
I feel something, I'm telling you.
Yeah, I feel something, too.
I'm not gonna lie.
I feel a camera.
The earthquake, and all those...
I don't know, stuff that's been happening and...
I don't know, I just...
No, it's totally normal.
Bye, camera.
Good night, camera.
Yeah?
Yeah, probably.
In their bedroom.
Be quiet, so we don't wake Katie up.
It's okay.
Why?
Yeah, kind of.
He's very sweet.
Yeah, I saw that.
I watched some of the tapes on the camera and I saw you talking to somebody late last night.
If you saw me talking to somebody, it would be Toby.
Toby's your friend?
Yes.
He's my friend.
Yeah, what do you guys talk about?
Secrets.
He's big?
So, is he old, like Grandma, or is he young, like you?
He's old, like Grandma.
And what does he look like?
Is he tall?
Is he fat?
He's tall.
He's tall.
Don't call him fat.
Kristi, when you say that if you tell one of your secrets that you'll be in trouble with Toby, what does that mean?
Well, I won't be safe.
He's gonna...
Did he say he's gonna hurt you?
No.
But I won't be safe.
That means, I will be, like...
Be in very, very big trouble.
Big trouble.
- You saw her.
- That's how it is.
It was like he was actually there, right?
I know.
Because that's how active kids' imaginations are.
It's crazy.
I mean, imagination is one thing.
She got up in the middle of the night.
I mean, it's a little odd that she got up in the middle...
You haven't been around kids for that long.
They do weird things.
They...
Katie used to get up in the middle of the night and she used to sleep on the toilet.
What?
Okay?
I'm serious.
Really?
Yes.
Toby is a phase and he's going to be gone in a couple weeks.
I know it.
How many hours of footage do you have?
This is the job, man.
I got two cameras, six hours each.
Twelve hours.
- Twelve hours of footage?
- Yeah.
Got to do it, man.
- I'm seriously gonna review it.
- ...of footage every day.
Yes.
Now, please, I'm trying to concentrate.
That's so stupid.
There's only 24 hours in a day, Dennis.
- Hey, Julie.
- ...going?
Good.
You want to step into my office and do some work with me or...
No.
You find anything?
Yes, actually.
We did find something.
We found that your family sleeps all night.
Very funny, Randy.
- Keep up the good work.
- Okay.
I love you with all of my heart and soul.
I love you, too.
It should either be called Back to the Past...
Present.
Back to the Present.
- No, no.
- End of story.
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It makes total sense.
Let's Get Back to the Present, maybe.
But Back to the Past...
Back to the Present.
- You hear that?
- Yeah.
- Was that...
That's it.
- What the hell?
It's happening again.
Come on.
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.
It's in your closet.
Are you getting that?
Open it.
- Are you getting it?
- Yeah, I'm gettin' it.
Holy shit!
Holy shit!
That's not funny.
- Oh, my God.
You're both crazy.
- I got you guys so bad.
- I got you.
- You're both crazy.
I got you good.
I got you, too.
Are you okay?
Just go ahead and take your crap right there, 'cause I nearly crapped my pants.
Holy fuck!
You almost gave me a heart attack.
Oh, my God, get away!
- Get away from me.
- Are you okay?
Get away.
I hate you.
Wow.
Look at that tent.
Gosh.
I like this tent.
"...and disguised his voice to sound like Little Red Riding Hood.
"The poor old woman, before she could even scream, the wolf gobbled her up."
Hello.
Hey, guys.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- Good.
- That's a little bright.
I'm sorry.
- Guys?
I got you a little...
- Give it to me.
Hey, guys.
Don't tell Mom, okay?
- Okay.
- All right.
What are you guys doing?
You'll see.
We've got a little surprise for you.
- One, two, three!
- ...two, three!
Come here.
Here, tickle torture, tickle torture, tickle torture!
That's enough.
You guys are locked in the dungeon.
All right.
Good night, girls.
I love you.
- Love you, Dennis.
- Love you.
Dennis.
Dennis.
- What?
- Listen.
What?
I think the girls came inside.
I'll go check on them.
I got it.
Girls?
Dennis.
Dennis?
Don't do that to me.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- You scared me.
Did you check on them?
Why is this door locked?
Did you lock this?
What's the matter?
We're just checking on you guys.
Move that light.
We're gonna move inside, okay?
- I want to stay here.
- Why?
I'm sorry.
It's gonna be fun inside, too, though.
Come on.
Get your stuff.
We're gonna camp inside.
- Mommy.
Why?
- What?
Dennis, will you film me?
- Yep.
- I wanna show you something.
You know Spud Webb?
One, two, three, slam dunk!
Very impressive.
Very good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Katie, are you sure you didn't sneak into the house last night?
My gosh, I pinky swear,
- I did not go into the house.
- Okay.
You wanna do me a favor?
Can you tell your mom that?
Where's Dennis?
He's out, buying more tapes.
With your credit card?
Mom.
He doesn't have any money.
That is not true.
The girls love him.
I mean, they just about think he's the coolest guy ever.
I mean, I really, really do like him.
I mean that.
It's just that the girls miss their father.
I don't know.
I wish he were a little more financially secure.
He is financially secure, Mom.
He has a job.
- He shoots wedding videos.
- No.
That's...
No.
He has his own business.
You know?
It's a whole different thing.
My God, Mom.
I just told you,
I don't want to have any more kids.
I'm not gonna get pregnant.
You always said you wanted a big family.
I changed my mind, okay?
I have two beautiful girls.
You always wanted a son.
I'm happy with the way things are.
Let's go.
What the...
Fuck.
This is great.
Hang on.
That's great!
Katie, that's great.
You're doing really good.
- Thank you.
- Let her go, Jule.
Dennis, I totally believe in this shit.
Randy, watch the language.
All right, nice and slow.
My brother saw one once.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What's Bloody Mary?
You don't know what Bloody Mary is?
It's where you go in the bathroom and you say "Bloody Mary" three times in the mirror and then you see a ghost.
Dennis, I wanna play Bloody Mary.
Nothing, don't worry.
It's okay.
You say Bloody Mary three times.
I want to play!
I want to see a ghost.
I'm just saying you're missing half of the stuff in the house without cameras down there.
I know.
You don't have to tell me.
Like put it up in the corner, like, rack it up in the corner or something?
It just doesn't work.
It just...
It's not a wide enough angle.
And I don't even...
They don't even make lenses that wide.
Mirrors.
You could use mirrors.
- This thing is so cool.
- Pretty cool, right?
It's awesome.
Wow!
Look, you got it balanced out and everything, too.
What is that?
I got to work out some kinks.
Oh, man.
- Hi.
- Hey.
What is that?
Check it out.
My new thing.
- It's pretty cool, right?
- Yeah.
- What...
What is it?
- I took your fan...
And basically, took apart...
Basically, the oscillator on your fan allows me to see both in the living room and in the kitchen.
Cool.
Wait, what?
You broke my fan?
I can put it back together.
Okay, MacGyver.
It's cool, right?
This way I can...
Kristi, what are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Go back to bed.
It's really late.
Hey, babe, what are you doing up here?
Painting.
Don't you want to play outside?
Not really.
How about your friend Toby?
Do you still talk to him?
Yeah.
Did he wake you up?
No.
Did he tell you to come downstairs?
No.
You know you can tell me, right?
He told me not to talk about it.
Why don't you just ask him yourself?
He's standing right next to you.
I don't see him.
He's there.
Hey, thanks for getting these, man.
Yeah, of course.
- This is good stuff.
- Thanks.
- Randy...
- Yeah?
Did you check this out?
No, I don't have a library card.
You stole these?
I didn't steal them, Dennis.
You told me to get the books, I got you the books.
It's what a library is.
It's for borrowing.
That's what "library" means in Spanish...
It means, "Borrow book store."
Malevolent Entities.
What is this one?
I don't know.
I looked through it for a second.
It had some creepy pictures...
This stuff is creepy.
Hey.
It's your sister and her friends.
Is that a joke?
What, was that supposed to be funny?
Playing field hockey.
Says, "Kids are susceptible to spiritual contact."
Okay.
And?
Well, the whole thing with Kristi and her imaginary friend.
Remember, I was telling you the crazy stuff started happening only when she started talking to her imaginary friend.
I mean, it must want something.
That's what...
You know, that's what the book says.
They don't just stick around for no reason.
It wants something.
What does it want?
Well, the book says it feeds off of your fear.
Hey, Kristi.
- Kristi.
- Yeah?
- Wanna play a game?
- Sure.
Here.
What are you doing?
- Playing with my soccer ball?
- Yeah.
Kristi, that's mine.
Kristi!
Kristi, come on.
Kristi, come help me.
What are we doing?
- We're gonna play Bloody Mary.
- Why?
Because I wanna try to catch the ghost.
Okay.
I think it's on.
So, how you play is you say "Bloody Mary" three times into the mirror and then her dead body's supposed to appear
- in the mirror and try to kill you.
- Stop!
Stop!
Stop, Katie.
So, now what do we do?
We have to say "Bloody Mary".
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Bloody Mary.
- Kristi, I said three times, not four.
- Sorry.
- I'm scared, Katie.
- We have to be quiet.
- Guys...
- My gosh, Mom!
You scared me.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
We're just playing a game.
Okay.
Grandma just got here.
Go say hi.
- You moved his camera?
- Yeah.
- Is it taping?
- I'll pick it up, I promise.
Yeah.
We gotta move it before he comes home 'cause he's gonna be mad.
- You guys wanna go to the pool?
- Yeah.
You wanna go to the pool, Grandma?
God damn it.
- Mom?
- Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
Holy shit.
Mommy, what happened?
- Stay upstairs.
Stay upstairs.
- What happened?
Don't come down here.
- There's glass on the floor.
Stay there.
- Are you hurt?
I have no idea, I have no idea.
Looks fine, right?
It didn't even break.
That's good.
- What happened?
- It just fell.
I didn't...
What do you mean, what happened?
I was in there.
- Hi, Kristi.
- Hey.
- Say hi to the camera.
- Hey.
- Can I join you guys?
- Sure.
- I can?
- Yeah.
Okay, great.
I'm gonna set my camera here, okay?
- Okay.
- Just keep it out of the way.
Wait.
Why are you filming this?
It's just like, I'm testing out my, like, new camera and, you know, no reason.
Don't sit there.
That's Toby's spot.
Sorry.
Is Toby sitting there right now?
Okay.
Sorry.
Sorry, Toby.
Does Teddy need help with his tea?
He looks thirsty.
- Yeah.
- Here you go, Teddy.
Here.
He can't reach 'em.
Okay.
Wow.
He was thirsty.
See, I told you.
And she keeps falling.
Poke.
So, Kristi, what was the last thing that Toby said to you?
Like...
- Anything?
- Yeah.
- No?
- Secrets.
Secrets.
Regular stuff.
In her sink?
Yeah.
Sorry.
That...
Did you...
Did you...
Did he say something just now?
No, I just put my hand on him.
And he didn't like that.
He doesn't like that, when you...
No.
Sorry, Toby.
It was a mistake, right?
Yeah.
- What?
- Nothing.
- What?
- Never mind.
- What were you gonna say?
- Nothing.
It's okay, you can tell me.
Kristi, why is Dennis's camera here?
Because me and Toby were having a little tea party and he was filming us.
- I'm not!
- Yes, you are, Kristi.
Only babies have imaginary friends.
He is real.
Hey, Kristi!
Kristi's such a baby!
Baby!
Katie, stop it!
Well, you're being a baby!
Only babies have imaginary friends.
No, I'm not!
He's right in there.
In there?
Toby, come out!
Toby, come out!
Toby!
Okay, I'm gonna go in.
Katie, you shouldn't do that.
Katie!
Don't go in there.
- You shouldn't do that.
- Well, I am.
Toby, come out.
Toby...
Katie.
Kristi!
What are you doing?
Open the door!
You shouldn't do that.
Kristi, open this door!
- It's not me!
- Kristi!
- Girls!
- Open the door!
- What is this yelling?
What is going on?
- I'm not doing that.
Stop fighting right this second.
Why's Dennis's camera on the floor?
She locked me in there.
- Katie, you can't touch his stuff.
- Kristi, why...
Stop fighting right this second.
- Mom, she locked me in there!
- I don't want to hear it.
- Come on, come on.
- Then who locked me in there?
Toby did.
Yeah, like Toby locked me in there.
She's gonna be here any minute.
See?
There she is.
Mommy, Lisa's here!
Okay!
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi!
How are you?
Good.
- I wanna show you something upstairs.
- Hi, Lisa.
Wait, what are you showing me?
I got some new beads for my birthday.
Beads!
Let's see 'em.
Hi, Kristi.
How are you?
Hey.
What's that?
Don't mind this.
You know Dennis and his cameras, he just puts them...
Just ignore it.
8:30 bedtime?
No, no, no, 10:00.
- 8:30.
Nice try.
- Mommy, please.
9:30?
- 9:00.
- 9:45.
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, guys.
Love you.
Look, it made a triangle.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- Good night, girls!
- Good night.
- See you later.
- Bye, Julie.
Bye, Dennis.
Are you tired?
- Not really.
- No?
Can you tell us a story?
Sure.
What kind of story?
A ghost story.
Ghost story?
With a ghost.
Okay, let's think.
I'm a ghost!
Hello, Dennis!
You found the ghost.
Comin' to get you.
Got you!
- Good night, Lisa.
- Good night, sweetie.
Hi, Dennis.
- Hi.
- Hey!
Hi!
- How'd it go?
- Fine, it was good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, they were great.
The girls were...
Give you any trouble, or...
No, no, no, no, it was good.
But my mom's meeting me, so if I could just...
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, give her some money.
Here you go.
Thank you.
You're sure everything was good?
Yeah, no.
Thank you, guys.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Okay, bye.
Thanks.
I don't know.
- That was weird.
- Yeah.
It's so high.
Promise?
Okay.
What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Why are you up?
Why are you up?
Nothing.
Kristi, go to bed.
It's late.
- Is that the babysitter?
- Yeah, that's Lisa.
How come I never met her?
I'll put in a good word.
- See the sheet?
- Yeah.
Watch this.
- Gone.
- Holy fuck.
Am I...
Am I right?
Holy...
- Did you see that?
- ...fuck!
I'm not crazy, right?
I'm not crazy.
That just happened.
Holy!
What the fuck is that?
I don't know.
- What is that?
- I don't know.
I'm telling you, it's...
And she didn't say anything at all?
She left the room, like...
Did you show Julie?
No, man.
What, are you kidding?
She would flip out.
She would go nuts, and, you know, she'd make me take the cameras down, and I can't do that.
I really want to figure out what this thing wants.
Got to keep taping this shit, though, man.
I know.
I am.
- You got to keep taping this shit.
- I know.
She got blown in the face.
Yeah, yeah.
No.
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
I'm going to bed.
What the...
What the fuck?
Hey, how's she feeling?
We need to go to the doctor 'cause she's burning up.
Oh, no.
- Yeah, she's really...
- She's really that bad?
- Yeah, it's bad.
- All right.
It's like, I've taken it a couple times.
Do you want me to go with you or...
Well, I mean, I don't know.
Who's gonna watch Katie?
I can call Randy.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, hey.
- Thanks for coming over.
- No problemo.
- Hi, Randy.
- Hi!
Randy, thank you so much.
We're gonna be at the hospital for a little bit.
Okay.
Anything you guys want...
- I know where everything is.
- Okay, great.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Bye!
Love you.
Bye, Kristi!
You have everything?
You have papers and insurance?
Yeah, I have it.
- Thanks a lot.
- Love you.
Bye.
- I'll lock the door.
- Okay, thanks.
- Thanks again.
- I'll lock it.
All right, be good, Katie.
See you.
- Hey, hey.
- Hi.
So what's wrong with Kristi?
It's like a really high fever or something like that.
Is it contagious?
I don't think so.
I haven't gotten sick.
Okay, good.
What do you want to do?
Can we play Bloody Mary?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Seriously?
I really don't think this is a good idea, Katie.
You made a promise.
You have to do it.
- Can't we just play, like, doll house...
- Get the camera!
...or somethin'?
Sorry, Dennis.
Not my idea.
Come on.
I'm comin', I'm comin'.
So you say, "Bloody Mary" three times.
And then you wait a little bit and then you turn the lights back on and then you're supposed to see her body in the mirror and she's gonna try to kill you.
Try and kill you.
Good game.
Yep.
I don't know why you wanna play this.
One of us is gonna be dead by the end of it.
I guess it's a one-time game.
Okay, let's do it.
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Randy!
Nothing happened.
You turned the light on too soon.
Come on, Katie.
This is stupid.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You can't leave!
Let's just go play doll house or something.
No, you didn't do it right.
What did I not do right?
You need to keep the light off longer.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
You wanna play Bloody Mary?
- Let's play Bloody Mary.
- Okay, ready?
You're not gonna see anybody play Bloody Mary like I'm about to play Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Okay, can I turn it on now?
- Quiet.
- Sorry.
Sorry.
How about now?
Wait, wait.
- What?
- Did you hear that?
What was that?
I know.
I heard it, too.
Holy shit!
- Oh, my...
- Are you okay?
Huh?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
- Does it hurt?
- No.
I just scratched myself or something.
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
It's okay.
Nothing...
Close the door.
It's okay.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's okay.
I don't want to die!
Randy, I'm scared!
Holy shit!
It's okay!
Randy, I'm scared!
Holy fuck!
You okay?
You okay?
Oh, my God.
It's all right.
Dear God.
Please, God.
Please, God, be with me.
It's okay!
It's okay!
I don't want to play this.
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Stay here.
I don't wanna play anymore.
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
Holy fuck!
Okay.
- Nothing happened.
- You okay?
Nothing.
You're fine.
- I wanna get out of here.
- It's okay, all right.
We're gonna get out of here.
Come on, Randy!
Come on, Randy!
Stay here.
Dear Lord, be with me, please, be with me.
- Randy, I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.
- It's okay.
- Come here, come here.
- I'm sorry!
It's okay.
Huh?
- Please, please, don't tell.
- It's okay, it's just like an earthquake.
I'm not gonna tell.
I'm not gonna tell.
It's all right.
It's okay.
I wanna go downstairs!
Yeah, let's go downstairs.
Fuck.
Randy, Randy, where are you going, man?
Relax.
Randy, Randy, take it easy.
Randy.
What...
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm getting all my stuff.
What...
What are you getting your stuff for, man?
- Relax.
Sit down.
- Dennis.
Get the camera out of my face.
I told you, I felt something in the room with us and then I felt a claw dig into my side, okay?
Okay, okay.
When you say "something..."
Great interview.
- No, Dennis, I'm done.
Fuck.
- When you say...
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home!
Look at the fuckin' books.
This isn't, you know,
Casper, the fuckin' friendly ghost you're chasing, man.
- I'm sorry you got hurt.
- This thing is dangerous!
- I'm sorry you got hurt, okay?
- Jesus fucking Christ!
I'm sorry, but...
What are you gonna do?
You're just gonna quit?
You're acting ridiculous.
Relax!
Dennis, no, you're acting ridiculous if you're not gonna get the fuck out.
You have to tell Julie, okay?
Just watch the fucking tape, Dennis!
- What's up?
- Hey.
What?
I need to talk to you.
- Okay.
- All right, sit down.
Here.
Sit down, Jule.
Okay, where do I begin?
...from the '30s.
Look at the necklaces.
That's crazy.
Yeah?
It's the same symbol.
Isn't that the same symbol from the girls' room?
All right?
These...
These women, they were...
- Oh, my God.
- ...part of a coven.
You're really something.
I...
I...
I really need to...
To tell you this, okay?
Kristi!
You'd better run!
You sound crazy.
Do you know that?
Hang on a second, all right?
Do you know how crazy you're starting to sound?
Would you just give me a second to explain?
They would have these ceremonies and they would wait till the girls were old enough to get pregnant and then they would...
They would...
They would take their sons.
Right.
And then they would brainwash them and they didn't remember a thing.
That explains it.
Dennis, I'm not listening to...
Mom?
- I need to show you something.
- It's all you do!
There's shit...
You don't even spend any time with us anymore.
You just sit here and play with this shit all day long.
- Could you just wait one second?
- It's like you're obsessed!
Just wait one second.
I need to show you this, okay?
No, I can't.
I can't wait.
- No, no, no...
- I can't wait!
I can't!
- Why not?
- Because...
Because Kristi's upset all the time...
- Mommy?
- What the fuck?
I don't...
What?
What?
What?
Toby pulled my hair.
- What happened?
- Who?
Toby pulled my hair.
This is your fault.
Okay?
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
Hey...
I didn't...
No more cameras.
No more ghosts.
This ends tomorrow.
Julie, I...
You gotta watch the fucking tape.
Kristi.
Wake up!
Katie, go back to sleep.
What was that?
What's happening?
Kristi!
Toby's here.
I'm scared!
Mom!
Mommy!
- Mommy!
- Stop screaming!
It's okay!
Just ignore it!
Just ignore it!
Mom!
Kristi!
Kristi, help me!
Kristi!
Please...
Please...
Please help me!
Katie!
Let her go!
Let her go!
Toby, stop!
Stop, Toby!
I'll do it.
Just let her go!
I'm scared.
I want Mommy!
...to Grandma's house.
No, we're not going to Grandma's house, okay?
Why?
We're not going to Grandma's because there's no Toby, sweetie.
- Yes, there...
- There's no Toby and there's no ghost.
Hey, don't run away from me.
Hey.
There's no ghost and that's the end of it.
I don't want to hear any more of this talk, okay?
Okay?
- What'd she say?
- She said no.
No.
No.
Mom, we're not coming over.
Okay?
We're staying right here.
Because I need to get things back to normal.
All right, Mom, I gotta go.
Someone's at the door, okay?
I'll call you back.
Yeah, okay.
Hello?
Weird.
Dennis!
Dennis!
Dennis, get the girls!
We're getting out of here!
Girls, wake up, we're here.
Wake up.
We're here.
Yay, we're here.
There's Grandma.
Mommy, I'm tired.
Go park by the garage.
Oh, God.
Are you okay?
- Come on.
- Let's go, guys.
Hi, honey.
Come on, go.
You go with your mom.
I've got your sister.
Come on.
Come on.
Mommy.
Sleepy girl is what she is.
Go on in the house.
I've got apple pie and I've got...
You want water, I know.
How're we doing?
Put the camera down and come and eat some pie.
- I'm fine.
- Come on.
It makes me feel better to do something.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Feel useful.
Are you okay?
- How's it going, kiddo?
- What is going on?
- Good.
- How you feeling?
...not talk about it right now.
We can talk about it when...
Just...
Let's just drop it.
- Hey, Kristi?
- What?
Don't touch the painting, okay?
It's okay, I'm not mad.
Do you like it?
What's the matter?
Kristi!
Come and get your pie!
Hey, guys.
What's going on?
You playing some dress-up?
Doesn't she make a beautiful bride?
- Very.
- Do you want to put this on her?
Beautiful.
Try that.
So, who's the lucky guy?
Toby.
Wait.
What did she say?
- Let's go.
It's bedtime, girls.
Let's go.
- Just having fun.
- Julie...
- Mom.
Come on.
I don't want to hear Toby's name ever again.
Okay?
Julie, it's just pretend.
That's it.
He's done.
He's not in our lives.
- He's real.
Toby is...
- Let's go.
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Kristi...
Can you take them to bed, please?
Let's go.
Come on, sweetheart.
Take Grandma's stuff off and let's go to bed.
Dennis and I are gonna be right next door, okay?
We're gonna leave a light on and everything, so you can find us, and everything's gonna be...
Gonna be fine, okay?
I love you so much.
Love you.
- Good night, guys.
- I love you so much.
When are you gonna stop taping us?
Not until this thing's over.
When's your mom gonna let us sleep in the same bed?
I can't stop thinking about it.
I can't.
I know.
Just close your eyes and try to get to sleep.
Come here.
We can share a pillow, too.
That's fine.
Julie.
Do you hear that?
Like cars?
- Sorry...
- It's my mom.
She's always up at night.
She can't sleep.
Oh, my God, she's so loud.
Do you want me to go check on her?
She's gonna wake the girls up.
I'll be right back.
Julie?
Julie!
Girls?
Julie?
Hey, Julie!
Hello?
What the fuck?
Julie?
Lois?
What?
What the fuck?
Julie!
What the fuck?
Fuck.
Oh, my God.
Julie!
Julie?
What's wrong?
Fuck.
Fuck.
Julie?
Get up.
Mommy?
Oh, Kristi!
No, Kristi!
- Dennis?
- Come here, come on.
Let's go, Kristi.
What happened to Mommy?
Is she okay?
Oh, shit.
Come here.
Go, go.
Dennis, I'm scared.
It's okay.
No, Kristi, don't talk.
Is Mommy okay?
Quiet, okay?
Be quiet.
Just don't, okay?
Just quiet, okay?
It's okay.
Kristi, please, please, be quiet.
I'm gonna go check, okay?
Stay here.
Come on, Kristi.
What was that?
We're gonna get out of here, okay?
Come on, let's go.
I'm scared.
We're gonna get out of here.
Up.
Okay.
We're gonna be okay.
I don't know.
Katie!
Katie, get away from there!
Kristi, listen to me, stay right here, okay?
Don't move, okay?
Katie?
Come on, Toby.
Let's get ready.
DANIEL:
You'll be spending a lot of time in here.
This is gonna be your room.
There's some kind of animal being de-liced or something.
Compression chamber.
That's your crib.
It's hermetically sealed.
And this is your paint color.
- What color is that, hon?
- KRISTI:
Jamaica Bay Blue.
Jamaica!
And there you are.
- Hi.
- Yes, hi.
And there's your dad, who's playing with his new toy instead of helping me paint.
- Sorry.
I can help.
- (SCOFFS)
- Yeah?
Come on.
- (CHUCKLES) If I wasn't...
If I wasn't filming I would help.
Go and get the other ladder.
Yeah, you should have a real ladder.
That's...
You know.
- (DOORBELL RINGS)
- All right, that's a...
- Who's that?
- Oh, it's my sister.
She's here to check out the nursery.
- Oh, Daniel, this is gorgeous.
- DANIEL:
Yeah?
This is so gorgeous.
I love it.
I love the blue.
I'm glad y'all went with that.
It's much better than the green.
- How are you feeling?
- All right.
You know, I think I'm okay.
- How is he?
- Oh, he's doing so good.
He's kicking and, like, swimming.
- I feel like he's swimming.
- Hey, little fella!
- What did you say?
- DANIEL:
It's Hunter.
- No!
Tyler.
It's Tyler.
- I like that.
- It's Tyler Hunter.
- It's... (LAUGHS)
I like...
I like both.
I don't wanna choose.
- I'm not gonna get into this.
- You have to.
Come on.
In preparation for the big move, I have a couple of boxes in my car that I would love to throw in your basement.
Please?
KATIE:
This is the last box.
DANIEL:
Really?
KATIE:
Probably.
- (DANIEL SIGHS)
- KATIE:
Oh, God!
DANIEL:
So, a little bit nervous?
No, I'm excited.
I spend all my time over at Micah's anyway.
DANIEL:
VHS?
That is old school.
- Do we have a VCR?
- DANIEL:
Uh...
I didn't even know you had this much stuff.
Somehow I ended up with it after Grandma Lois died.
I haven't even gone through it.
- How come you got it?
- I don't know.
You can have it.
Nobody ever gives me anything.
DANIEL:
So who's gonna get the top bunk?
- (KRISTI LAUGHING)
- KATIE:
We're not 12.
DANIEL:
We can get a VCR for free.
KRISTI:
You know, I don't remember these at all.
DANIEL:
You guys didn't go Beta, huh?
(KRISTI LAUGHS)
DANIEL:
That's fine, okay?
I'm just gonna tape over an old one.
Can you get Abby out of here, please?
She's gonna get cut on the glass!
We just got back and the whole place is pretty much destroyed.
Nothing seems to be actually missing.
It's just, everything's really...
That's what she's telling me.
Just make sure we document everything.
Don't touch anything.
DANIEL:
This is our basement.
I don't see anything really broken.
(SIGHS) I don't see that box of tapes that Katie brought over.
Looks like that's the only thing that's missing.
(STATIC CRACKLING)
DENNIS:
All right and there she is.
The mother of the birthday girl, my girlfriend...
JULIE:
Chocolate, chocolate, rainbow stuff.
- That is a good-looking cake.
- Which is exactly what she wanted.
Beautiful.
Just beautiful.
And you're beautiful.
I don't know how you do it.
- (ALL SINGING HAPPYBIRTHDAY)
- Ooh!
Are you okay?
Watch your backs!
JULIE:
Whoa!
Watch your hair.
Good job.
(ALL CHEERING)
DENNIS:
All right, and here's the birthday girl.
Oh, I found some.
DENNIS:
She looks pretty unhappy.
Something's going on.
We got the young one.
Under the trampoline.
LOIS:
Twenty bites and that's about all.
KATIE:
Twenty bites?
That's what my mother used to make me do.
JULIE:
That's a lot of cake on that plate.
DENNIS:
Hey, Julie.
Go get Kristi.
(PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
DENNIS:
Say hi, Kristi!
(SOFTLY) Hi.
(PEOPLE CHUCKLE)
DENNIS:
Kristi's a little shy.
Oh, that's cute.
They love each other.
It's Grandma.
Happy, happy, happy birthday.
(SINGS HAPPYBIRTHDAY)
Never forget the day you were born.
I held you in my arms and you made me laugh and cry at the same time.
You were so cute.
Serious piece of equipment, so be careful.
LOIS:
How do you shoot those weddings with this thing?
- It must hurt your back.
- Uh, it's something, uh...
You have to work certain parts of your...
I've only been here for a few months, um...
But thank you for welcoming me into your family.
Um, I...
- I just...
I love you, and I love...
- Dennis, my shoulder.
...you so much.
Happy birthday.
- LOIS:
Okay, take this thing now.
- All right.
DENNIS:
Whoa!
BOY:
Oh, my God!
(ALL LAUGHING)
DENNIS:
Katie, take it easy.
Take it easy.
It's dead.
You're a little monster.
DENNIS:
All right, all right, I got my camera.
Here, let me help you, 'cause I don't...
- I want to see the tooth full throttle.
- Okay, all right.
This thing's coming out today.
- Is it okay if I push it a little?
- No, no, don't push it.
DENNIS:
Lower lip.
JULIE:
Want some juice, babe?
DENNIS:
Down.
JULIE:
Here.
DENNIS:
Now...
Oooh!
JULIE:
You want some of this?
KATIE:
Yeah, orange juice.
DENNIS:
Oh!
That is...
That is a good one!
- DENNIS:
All right.
- Let's see this.
Open up.
Don't push it with your tongue.
Let's see.
- "Ah!"
- DENNIS:
Ooh, it's ready.
- I think it might be...
- DENNIS:
It's ready.
You're gonna get a newjob as a dentist.
JULIE:
Oh, thank you.
You think I'm good?
Wrap it in a tissue, put it in your pocket, and bring it home for...
- The Tooth Fairy.
- The Tooth Fairy, that's right.
And we'll put it under your pillow, tonight.
DENNIS:
Wow.
You like the Tooth Fairy, right?
We love the Tooth Fairy.
DENNIS:
Why does he need a bowl?
Because he wants to eat.
- DENNIS:
He's hungry?
- Mmm-hmm.
Kristi, Toby isn't real.
- JULIE:
Hey.
It doesn't matter.
- Yes, he is.
(WHISTLING)
My assistant Randy is currently 43 minutes late.
And this isn't the first time, he's always late.
So, today we're gonna play a little prank and see if we can teach him a lesson.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Come on around the front door.
RANDY:
Come on, just open the garage.
Randy, I need your help, man.
Come around the front door.
RANDY:
Okay, okay.
- Hey.
Whoa.
- Hey, man.
- Where were you?
What happened?
- Sorry I'm late.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.
- I got blocked in.
- I'm really sorry.
- That's all right, man.
I had a leak in the house.
I was hoping you'd get here sooner.
I had a leak in the ceiling here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Here, push this up here.
RANDY:
It didn't rain last night.
Hold this for a second.
I need your help.
It's been going like crazy.
And I don't know what to do,
- so I got that pole there.
- Why is it white?
- What?
- Why is it white?
I don't know.
I think it's maybe something with the paint on this.
Anyway, I gotta get some spackle.
I'll be back.
- Wait, you just want me to...
- Hang on.
- You want me to wait here and hold it?
- Thanks, Randy.
Wait, Dennis.
I'm just supposed to wait here?
Dennis.
Dennis!
- Hey.
- DENNIS:
Okay, girls, that's far enough.
Hey.
No.
Why don't you come on in and hand me that ladder?
KATIE:
No.
KRISTI:
Mmm-mmm.
- Are you serious?
- KATIE:
I'm serious.
You know you don't have to listen to him.
He's not even your real dad.
Who wants to go jump on the trampoline?
- GIRLS:
I do!
- Oh, come on.
KATIE:
I have a new trick to show you.
DENNIS:
Okay.
Guys, come on.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.
- DENNIS:
Ready for a surprise?
It better be a ladder.
We were playing outside.
What did we find, guys?
- GIRLS:
A spider.
- Dennis.
- We've got a cute little spider.
- Dennis!
- Come on, man.
- Okay.
Yeah?
- GIRLS:
Do it, do it, do it, do it!
- All right.
Run!
(GIRLS LAUGHING)
(DENNIS LAUGHING)
KATIE:
It wasn't even a spider.
RANDY:
That really hurt.
That really hurt.
(GIRLS SCREAMING)
- Hi.
- DENNIS:
Big day today, right?
- Yep.
- What's today?
- Picture day.
- Picture day!
- Dennis, you're still in.
- DENNIS:
Sorry.
- KATIE:
I was finishing my hair!
- This picture's for Grandma.
Smile.
(CAMERA CLICKS)
DENNIS:
All right!
- Okay...
- Kristi, come on!
DENNIS:
Here it goes.
All right.
- ALL:
Cheese.
- (CAMERA CLICKS)
(RANDY LAUGHING)
MAN:
Thanks, sweetheart.
WOMAN:
No, no, no.
Seriously, like...
- Randy?
- Yeah.
Where did you find this girl?
I don't know.
I didn't see her at all throughout any of the wedding... (BOTH LAUGHING)
- That's because I'm so happy...
- "So happy for you."
I love my job, man.
- I should've got her number.
- Probably could've.
Randy, this is great stuff.
I can't use any of this, but it's great.
(LAUGHING)
(CAMERA LENS WHIRRING)
(THUDDING)
DENNIS:
Jule?
(THUDDING CONTINUES)
Julie?
There it goes again.
DENNIS:
Hello?
Julie?
(RATTLING)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
TEDDY:
I like this song!
Not bad.
Mmm, that's pretty good.
Teddy?
Did you fall down?
(MUSIC STOPS)
(CREAKING)
DENNIS:
What was that?
(GASPS) Oh.
(DENNIS PANTING)
- Hey.
- Hey.
What you doing?
Nothing.
I was just looking around.
What...
What...
You guys just get home?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- It was girls' day.
- I know.
How was it?
- Was it fun?
- Great.
(CHUCKLES) You just really snuck up on me there.
(CHUCKLES)
DENNIS:
All right.
It's time.
- Don't film this.
- Why not?
It's illegal.
- (DENNIS LAUGHS)
- Don't laugh.
We haven't even started smoking it, and you're already paranoid.
It's illegal.
What if my kids find me?
I'm a mother.
- Now relax.
- Seriously, Dennis.
Seriously, Julie.
(MOCKING) Let's get really serious.
Seriously.
- Shut up.
- Let's be serious.
- All right.
- Real, real, real big, big...
Whoa.
That was big.
(COUGHING)
Julie, do the voice.
(IN FUNNY VOICE) Dennis.
- (IN FUNNY VOICE) What voice?
- (DENNIS LAUGHS)
This voice?
Dennis, I can't believe you're filming me smoke marijuana.
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)
DENNIS: (WHISPERING) God, you're so beautiful.
Shut up.
I want to film us having sex.
Is that perverted?
- Is that weird?
- I don't know.
Was that a yes?
Okay.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Hey, there, pretty lady.
- (CHUCKLES)
Oh, stop.
I don't know.
You sure...
You sure you're up for this?
No.
You know what?
Don't answer that.
Hurry up, before I change my mind.
Oh, okay, sorry.
- (CHUCKLES)
- All right.
(IMITATES GUITAR)
What are you doing?
What was that?
- It's porno music.
- (LAUGHS)
Great.
Classy.
Mmm.
Good start.
Good, right?
- All right.
- I don't know.
Mmm. (GROANING LUSTFULLY)
(CLATTERING IN DISTANCE)
(CLATTERING CONTINUES)
Relax.
Just relax.
Don't worry about it.
Hey.
- Yeah.
I'm okay.
- Relax.
(THUDDING)
- Yeah, what is that?
- I don't know.
Whoa!
(RUMBLING)
It's an earthquake.
- Holy shit!
- Dennis, it's an earthquake!
The girls.
The girls!
Come on!
Dennis!
(RUMBLING SUBSIDES)
JULIE:
Dennis.
Oh, my God, I look so fat.
DENNIS:
You don't look fat.
- Look at the size of me on top of you.
- You look beautiful.
You look like you can't breathe 'cause I'm sitting on top of you.
I want another shot at doing one of these.
- Watch this.
- Dennis, you have to erase this.
Julie, watch, watch, watch.
- See that?
- What?
Did you see that in the corner?
Yeah, I see, like, dust.
- Dirt falling.
- No, Julie.
There's something there.
- You are crazy.
- There was something there.
Wait, you can see something there.
It's very cute, but you're going a little crazy.
You're like one of those people that see things, like in their food.
Like when people think they see the Virgin Mary in their toast.
- That's you right now.
- Oh, that's hilarious.
This has to be erased and this has to be erased.
I'm sorry.
Or we're never having sex again.
I'm late.
I got to go.
Thanks for erasing both of them.
You know, you're going to regret saying that.
Doubt it.
I don't think you can go a day without having sex, personally.
(IN SING-SONG) Don't dare me.
- Erase it.
- I'm not going to erase it.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.
Dude, what are you doing, man?
You're always so late.
I know, it's my car!
I got the earthquake.
- Did you really?
- On tape.
It's scary, right?
Is that Julie?
It's nothing, it's nothing.
- We're going to...
- Is that a sex tape?
Yeah.
I got...
This weird thing happened after...
She let you make a sex tape?
Yeah, but it got interrupted by the earthquake.
I wouldn't have let anything interrupt that.
Relax, man, just relax.
Would you just stop?
- Let me slow-mo shuttle forward.
- Just shut up.
DENNIS:
Check this out.
Ready?
All right, let me tweak the contrast here.
Okay.
I'm gonna take the color out.
It looks like dust is falling on something.
It looks like a figure, right?
- You see that?
- Yeah.
Did you catch that?
- Yeah, it moved.
- Did you see the dust move?
- It moved, right?
- What was that?
I don't know.
Check it out.
- It's weird, right?
- It's kind of weird.
You know, I've been hearing these noises in the girls' room lately.
I don't know.
I feel like it's...
Something weird's going on.
- DENNIS:
Julie?
- Yeah, I'm back here.
Hey, um, I wanted to talk to you... (SHRIEKS) Dennis!
Oh, sorry!
Sorry.
Oh, my God!
(LAUGHS) Sorry.
You mind if I set up a couple cameras around the house?
I'm not going to talk to you right now.
Okay, I'll...
I'll take that as a yes?
- I hate you!
- Okay.
Love you, too.
KATIE:
How long do the tapes last?
DENNIS:
About six hours each.
So you have to change them every six hours?
Mmm, yes.
Katie, can you hop out of the frame?
- Okay.
Is that good?
- Yeah, so I can...
Keep going.
- KATIE:
Can I see it?
- Sure.
Here.
Come here.
See it?
Yeah.
- Pretty cool, right?
- Mmm-hmm.
So, what are you trying to see?
Uh, anything unusual or strange.
Oh, no, it's not that.
Don't touch the camera.
- Kristi?
- Yeah?
Don't touch the camera or anything.
Katie, just leave it alone.
(CLATTERING)
- Dennis.
- What?
Really?
Don't you think you're overreacting a little?
This is a new house.
It shouldn't be making these noises.
Not just in here.
It's in the girls' room, too.
No...
This is not gonna work here.
Like, what do you think you're gonna catch?
Whatever's in our house.
Oh, right, 'cause there's something here watching us.
Well, there's definitely something.
I...
I feel it.
I feel something, I'm telling you.
JULIE:
Yeah, I feel something, too.
I'm not gonna lie.
I feel a camera.
The earthquake, and all those...
I don't know, stuff that's been happening and...
I don't know, I just...
No, it's totally normal.
(SIGHS)
Bye, camera.
Good night, camera.
(KISSES)
(CREAKING)
(PATTERING)
Yeah?
Yeah, probably.
In their bedroom.
Be quiet, so we don't wake Katie up.
(WHISPERING) It's okay.
Why?
Oh.
Yeah, kind of.
He's very sweet.
Yeah, I saw that.
I watched some of the tapes on the camera and I saw you talking to somebody late last night.
If you saw me talking to somebody, it would be Toby.
(CHUCKLES) Toby's your friend?
Yes.
He's my friend.
Yeah, what do you guys talk about?
Mmm, secrets.
- He's big?
- Mmm-hmm.
So, is he old, like Grandma, or is he young, like you?
He's old, like Grandma.
And what does he look like?
Is he tall?
Is he fat?
He's tall.
He's tall.
Don't call him fat.
Kristi, when you say that if you tell one of your secrets that you'll be in trouble with Toby, what does that mean?
Well, I won't be safe.
He's gonna...
Did he say he's gonna hurt you?
No.
But I won't be safe.
That means, I will be, like...
Be in very, very big trouble.
Big trouble.
DENNIS:
You saw her.
JULIE:
That's how it is.
It was like he was actually there, right?
I know.
Because that's how active kids' imaginations are.
It's crazy.
I mean, imagination is one thing.
She got up in the middle of the night.
I mean, it's a little odd that she got up in the middle...
You haven't been around kids for that long.
They do weird things.
They...
Katie used to get up in the middle of the night and she used to sleep on the toilet.
(LAUGHING) What?
Okay?
I'm serious.
Really?
Yes.
Toby is a phase and he's going to be gone in a couple weeks.
I know it.
RANDY:
How many hours of footage do you have?
This is the job, man.
I got two cameras, six hours each.
Twelve hours.
- Twelve hours of footage?
- Yeah.
Got to do it, man.
- I'm seriously gonna review it.
- ...of footage every day.
Yes.
Now, please, I'm trying to concentrate.
That's so stupid.
There's only 24 hours in a day, Dennis.
- RANDY:
Hey, Julie.
- ...going?
DENNIS:
Um...
Good.
You want to step into my office and do some work with me or...
No.
You find anything?
RANDY:
Yes, actually.
We did find something.
We found that your family sleeps all night.
Oh!
Very funny, Randy.
- Keep up the good work.
- DENNIS:
Okay.
I love you with all of my heart and soul.
I love you, too.
It should either be called Back to the Past...
RANDY:
Present.
Back to the Present.
- No, no.
- End of story.
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It makes total sense.
Let's Get Back to the Present, maybe.
But Back to the Past...
- Back to the Present.
- (SIGHING)
(THUDDING)
- You hear that?
- Yeah.
(THUDDING CONTINUES)
- Was that...
That's it.
- What the hell?
It's happening again.
Come on.
(SHUSHING)
(CLATTERING)
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.
(METAL CLINKING)
RANDY: (WHISPERING) It's in your closet.
(KNOCKS)
- (WHISPERING) Are you getting that?
- Open it.
- Are you getting it?
- Yeah, I'm gettin' it.
- (ROARS) - (MEN SCREAM)
RANDY:
Holy shit!
(LAUGHING)
Holy shit!
That's not funny.
(IMITATES SHRIEKING)
- RANDY:
Oh, my God.
You're both crazy.
- I got you guys so bad.
- Oh, oh, I got you.
- RANDY:
You're both crazy.
I got you good.
I got you, too.
Are you okay?
Just go ahead and take your crap right there, 'cause I nearly crapped my pants.
Holy fuck!
You almost gave me a heart attack.
- Oh, my God, get away!
- (LAUGHING)
- Get away from me.
- Are you okay?
Get away.
I hate you.
(KRISTI AND KATIE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
DENNIS:
Wow.
Look at that tent.
Gosh.
I like this tent.
KATIE: "...and disguised his voice to sound like Little Red Riding Hood.
"The poor old woman, before she could even scream, the wolf gobbled her up."
Hello.
Shh.
Hey, guys.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- DENNIS:
Good.
- That's a little bright.
I'm sorry.
Guys?
I got you a little...
- Mmm!
- KATIE:
Give it to me.
Hey, guys.
Don't tell Mom, okay?
- BOTH:
Okay.
- All right.
What are you guys doing?
KATIE:
You'll see.
We've got a little surprise for you.
- One, two, three!
- ...two, three!
- Oh!
Ow!
Come here.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)
Here, tickle torture, tickle torture, tickle torture!
(ALL LAUGHING)
That's enough.
You guys are locked in the dungeon.
All right.
Good night, girls.

I think the girls came inside.
I'll go check on them.

(SWITCH CLICKS)
Girls?
(SWITCH CLICKS)
Dennis.
Dennis?
(GASPS) Don't do that to me.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- You scared me.
Did you check on them?
Why is this door locked?
Did you lock this?
What's the matter?
JULIE:
We're just checking on you guys.
Move that light.
We're gonna move inside, okay?
- I want to stay here.
- Why?
I'm sorry.
It's gonna be fun inside, too, though.
Come on.
Get your stuff.
We're gonna camp inside.
- Mommy.
Why?
- What?
KATIE:
Dennis, will you film me?
- DENNIS:
Yep.
- I wanna show you something.
You know Spud Webb?
One, two, three, slam dunk!
- Whoo!
- Very impressive.
Very good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Katie, are you sure you didn't sneak into the house last night?
My gosh, I pinky swear,
- I did not go into the house.
- Okay.
You wanna do me a favor?
Can you tell your mom that?
LOIS:
Where's Dennis?
Uh, he's out, buying more tapes.
With your credit card?
Mom.
He doesn't have any money.
That is not true.
The girls love him.
I mean, they just about think he's the coolest guy ever.
I mean, I really, really do like him.
I mean that.
It's just that the girls miss their father.
I don't know.
I wish he were a little more financially secure.
He is financially secure, Mom.
He has a job.
- He shoots wedding videos.
- No.
That's...
No.
- He has his own business.
- (SIGHS)
You know?
It's a whole different thing.
My God, Mom.
I just told you,
I don't want to have any more kids.
I'm not gonna get pregnant.
You always said you wanted a big family.
I changed my mind, okay?
I have two beautiful girls.
- You always wanted a son.
- (SIGHS)
I'm happy with the way things are.
Let's go.
(CREAKING)
DENNIS:
What the...
Fuck.
(LOUD BANG)
DENNIS:
Oh, this is great.
Hang on.
That's great!
Katie, that's great.
You're doing really good.
- Thank you.
- Let her go, Jule.
RANDY:
Dennis, I totally believe in this shit.
DENNIS:
Randy, watch the language.
All right, nice and slow.
My brother saw one once.
- DENNIS:
Really?
- Yeah.
What's Bloody Mary?
You don't know what Bloody Mary is?
It's, uh, where you go in the bathroom and you say "Bloody Mary" three times in the mirror and then you see a ghost.
KATIE:
Dennis, I wanna play Bloody Mary.
DENNIS:
Nothing, don't worry.
Shh!
It's okay.
You say Bloody Mary three times.
Ooh, I want to play!
I want to see a ghost.
I'm just saying you're missing half of the stuff in the house without cameras down there.
DENNIS:
I know.
You don't have to tell me.
Like put it up in the corner, like, rack it up in the corner or something?
It just doesn't work.
It just...
It's not a wide enough angle.
And I don't even...
They don't even make lenses that wide.
- Mirrors.
- Hmm?
You could use mirrors.
- RANDY:
This thing is so cool.
- Pretty cool, right?
It's awesome.
Wow!
Look, you got it balanced out and everything, too.
- (CREAKING)
- Whoa.
What is that?
I got to work out some kinks.
(CHUCKLING) Oh, man.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
- JULIE:
Hi.
- Hey.
What is that?
Check it out.
My new thing.
- It's pretty cool, right?
- Yeah.
- What...
What is it?
- I took your fan...
And basically, took apart...
Basically, the oscillator on your fan allows me to see both in the living room and in the kitchen.
Cool.
Wait, what?
You broke my fan?
I can put it back together.
Okay, MacGyver.
- It's cool, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

Kristi, what are you doing?

- Go back to bed.
It's really late.
Hey, babe, what are you doing up here?
Painting.
Don't you want to play outside?
Not really.
How about your friend Toby?
Do you still talk to him?
Yeah.
Did he wake you up?
Mmm, no.
Did he tell you to come downstairs?
No.
You know you can tell me, right?
He told me not to talk about it.
Why don't you just ask him yourself?
He's standing right next to you.
I don't see him.
He's there.
DENNIS:
Hey, thanks for getting these, man.
RANDY:
Yeah, of course.
- This is good stuff.
- Thanks.
- Randy...
- Yeah?
Did you check this out?
No, I don't have a library card.
You stole these?
I didn't steal them, Dennis.
You told me to get the books, I got you the books.
It's what a library is.
It's for borrowing.
That's what "library" means in Spanish...
It means, "Borrow book store."
Malevolent Entities.
What is this one?
Uh, I don't know.
I looked through it for a second.
It had some creepy pictures...
This stuff is creepy.
Oh, hey.
It's your sister and her friends.
Is that a joke?
What, was that supposed to be funny?
Playing field hockey.
Says, "Kids are susceptible to spiritual contact."
Okay.
And?
Well, the whole thing with Kristi and her imaginary friend.
Remember, I was telling you the crazy stuff started happening only when she started talking to her imaginary friend.
I mean, it must want something.
That's what...
You know, that's what the book says.
They don't just stick around for no reason.
It wants something.
What does it want?
Well, the book says it feeds off of your fear.
KATIE:
Hey, Kristi.
- Kristi.
- Yeah?
- Wanna play a game?
- Sure.
Here.
What are you doing?
- Playing with my soccer ball?
- Yeah.
Kristi, that's mine.
Kristi!
Kristi, come on.
Kristi, come help me.
What are we doing?
- We're gonna play Bloody Mary.
- Why?
Because I wanna try to catch the ghost.
Okay.
I think it's on.
So, how you play is you say "Bloody Mary" three times into the mirror and then her dead body's supposed to appear
- in the mirror and try to kill you.
- Stop!
Stop!
Stop, Katie.
KRISTI:
So, now what do we do?
Shh.
We have to say "Bloody Mary".
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Bloody Mary.
- Kristi, I said three times, not four.
- Sorry.
- I'm scared, Katie.
- Shh!
We have to be quiet.
(BANGING)
JULIE:
Guys... (GASPS) My gosh, Mom!
You scared me.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
We're just playing a game.
Okay.
Grandma just got here.
Go say hi.
- You moved his camera?
- Yeah.
- Is it taping?
- I'll pick it up, I promise.
Yeah.
We gotta move it before he comes home 'cause he's gonna be mad.
- You guys wanna go to the pool?

KATIE:
Mommy, what happened?
- Stay upstairs.
Stay upstairs.
- What happened?
Don't come down here.
- There's glass on the floor.
Stay there.
- KATIE:
Are you hurt?
(DENNIS TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
JULIE: (STUTTERING) I have no idea, I have no idea.
JULIE:
Looks fine, right?
It didn't even break.
That's good.
- DENNIS:
What happened?
- It just fell.
I didn't...
What do you mean, what happened?
I was in there.
- DENNIS:
Hi, Kristi.
- Hey.
- Say hi to the camera.
- Hey.
- Can I join you guys?
- Sure.
- Oh, I can?
- Yeah.
Okay, great.
I'm gonna set my camera here, okay?
- Okay.
- Just keep it out of the way.
Wait.
Why are you filming this?
Um, it's just like, I'm testing out my, like, new camera and, you know, no reason.
Don't sit there.
That's Toby's spot.
Oh, sorry.
Is Toby sitting there right now?
Okay.
Sorry.
Sorry, Toby.
- (GIGGLES) - (CHUCKLES)
Does Teddy need help with his tea?
He looks thirsty.
- Yeah.
- Here you go, Teddy.
Here.
He can't reach 'em.
Okay.
Wow.
He was thirsty.
See, I told you.
(BOTH CHUCKLING)
And she keeps falling.
Poke.
So, Kristi, what was the last thing that Toby said to you?
Oh, like...
- Anything?
- Yeah.
- No?
- Secrets.
Secrets.
Regular stuff.
Oh, in her sink?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Oh, that...
Did you, uh...
Did you...
Did he say something just now?
No, I just put my hand on him.
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
And he didn't like that.
He doesn't like that, when you...
- No.
- Oh.
Sorry, Toby.
It was a mistake, right?
Yeah. (GIGGLES)
- What?
- Nothing.
- What?
- Never mind.
- What were you gonna say?
- Nothing.
It's okay, you can tell me.
KATIE:
Kristi, why is Dennis's camera here?
Because me and Toby were having a little tea party and he was filming us.
- I'm not!
- Yes, you are, Kristi.
Only babies have imaginary friends.
He is real.
(IN SING-SONG) Hey, Kristi!
Kristi's such a baby!
Baby!
Katie, stop it!
Well, you're being a baby!
Only babies have imaginary friends.
No, I'm not!
He's right in there.
In there?
Toby, come out!
Toby, come out!
Toby!
Okay, I'm gonna go in.
Katie, you shouldn't do that.
Katie!
Don't go in there.
(EXCLAIMS DISMISSIVELY)
- You shouldn't do that.
- Well, I am.
Toby, come out.
Toby...
- (KATIE SCREAMS)
- Katie.
Kristi!
What are you doing?
- Open the door!
- (BANGING)

- You shouldn't do that.
Kristi, open this door!
- It's not me!
- Kristi!
- JULIE:
Girls!
- Open the door!
- What is this yelling?
What is going on?
- I'm not doing that.
JULIE:
Stop fighting right this second.
Why's Dennis's camera on the floor?
She locked me in there.
- Katie, you can't touch his stuff.
- Kristi, why...
Stop fighting right this second.
- Mom, she locked me in there!
- I don't want to hear it.
- Come on, come on.
- KATIE:
Then who locked me in there?
KRISTI:
Toby did.
Oh, yeah, like Toby locked me in there.
KATIE:
She's gonna be here any minute.

There she is.
Mommy, Lisa's here!
JULIE:

I got some new beads for my birthday.

Oh, let's see 'em.
Hi, Kristi.
How are you?
Hey.
What's that?
Oh, don't mind this.
You know Dennis and his cameras, he just puts them...
Just ignore it.

A ghost story.
Ghost story?

Okay, um, let's think.

I'm not crazy, right?
I'm not crazy.
That just happened.
Holy!
What the fuck is that?
I don't know.
- What is that?
- I don't know.
I'm telling you, it's...
And she didn't say anything at all?
She left the room, like...
Did you show Julie?
No, man.
What, are you kidding?
She would flip out.
She would go nuts, and, you know, she'd make me take the cameras down, and I can't do that.
I really want to figure out what this thing wants.
Got to keep taping this shit, though, man.
I know.
I am.

We need to go to the doctor 'cause she's burning up.
Oh, no.
- Yeah, she's really...
- She's really that bad?
- Yeah, it's bad.
- All right.
It's like, I've taken it a couple times.
Do you want me to go with you or...
Well, I mean, I don't know.
Who's gonna watch Katie?
I can call Randy.

So what's wrong with Kristi?
It's like a really high fever or something like that.
Oh.
Is it contagious?
I don't think so.
I haven't gotten sick.
Okay, good.
(CLEARS THROAT)
What do you want to do?
Can we play Bloody Mary?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Seriously?
I really don't think this is a good idea, Katie.
You made a promise.
You have to do it.
- Can't we just play, like, doll house...
- Get the camera!
...or somethin'?
(SIGHS) Sorry, Dennis.
Not my idea.
Come on.
I'm comin', I'm comin'.
(CLEARS THROAT) So you say, "Bloody Mary" three times.
- Mmm-hmm.
- And then you wait a little bit and then you turn the lights back on and then you're supposed to see her body in the mirror and she's gonna try to kill you.
Try and kill you.
Good game.
- Yep.
- (LAUGHS)
I don't know why you wanna play this.
One of us is gonna be dead by the end of it.
I guess it's a one-time game.
Okay, let's do it.
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
- Randy!
- (GASPS)
Nothing happened. (CHUCKLING)
You turned the light on too soon.
Oh, come on, Katie.
This is stupid.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You can't leave!
Let's just go play doll house or something.
No, you didn't do it right.
What did I not do right?
You need to keep the light off longer.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
You wanna play Bloody Mary?
- Let's play Bloody Mary.
- Okay, ready?
You're not gonna see anybody play Bloody Mary like I'm about to play Bloody Mary.
(RANDY CLEARS THROAT)
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
(WHISPERING) Okay, can I turn it on now?
Shh!

I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Stay here.
I don't wanna play anymore.
It's okay, it's okay.
(RANDY SHUSHING)
(KATIE WHIMPERING)
Shh, it's okay.
(CRASHING)
RANDY:
Holy fuck!
(EXCLAIMING FRIGHTFULLY)
Okay.
- Nothing happened.
- You okay?
Nothing.
You're fine.
- I wanna get out of here.
- It's okay, all right.
We're gonna get out of here.
Come on, Randy!
Come on, Randy!
Stay here.
(GROANS) Oh!
(WHISPERING) Dear Lord, be with me, please, be with me.
(RANDY SHUDDERING)
(CRYING) Randy, I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.
It's okay.
- Come here, come here.
- I'm sorry!
(CRYING) It's okay.
Huh?
- Please, please, don't tell.
- It's okay, it's just like an earthquake.
I'm not gonna tell.
I'm not gonna tell.
- (KATIE SOBBING)
- It's all right.
It's okay.
I wanna go downstairs!
Yeah, let's go downstairs.
- (KATIE WHIMPERING)
- Oh, fuck.
DENNIS:
Randy, Randy, where are you going, man?
Relax.
Randy, Randy, take it easy.
Randy.
What...
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm getting all my stuff.
What...
What are you getting your stuff for, man?
- Relax.
Sit down.
- Dennis.
Get the camera out of my face.
I told you, I felt something in the room with us and then I felt a claw dig into my side, okay?
Okay, okay.
When you say "something..."
Great interview.
- No, Dennis, I'm done.
Fuck.
- When you say...
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home!
Look at the fuckin' books.
This isn't, you know,
Casper, the fuckin' friendly ghost you're chasing, man.
- I'm sorry you got hurt.
- This thing is dangerous!
- I'm sorry you got hurt, okay?
- Jesus fucking Christ!
I'm sorry, but...
What are you gonna do?
You're just gonna quit?
You're acting ridiculous.
Relax!
Dennis, no, you're acting ridiculous if you're not gonna get the fuck out.
You have to tell Julie, okay?
Just watch the fucking tape, Dennis!
- What's up?
- DENNIS:
Hey.
What?
Um... (SIGHS) I need to talk to you.
- Okay.
- All right, sit down.
Here.
Sit down, Jule.
Okay, where do I begin?
...from the '30s.
Look at the necklaces.
That's crazy.
Yeah?
It's the same symbol.
Isn't that the same symbol from the girls' room?
All right?
These...
These women, they were, um...
- Oh, my God.
- ...part of a coven.
You're really something.
I...
I...
I really need to...
To tell you this, okay?
KATIE:
Kristi!
You'd better run!
(THUDS)
You sound crazy.
Do you know that?
Hang on a second, all right?
Do you know how crazy you're starting to sound?
Would you just give me a second to explain?
They would have these ceremonies and they would wait till the girls were old enough to get pregnant and then they would...
They would...
They would take their sons.
Oh!
Oh, right.
And then they would brainwash them and they didn't remember a thing.
That explains it.
Dennis, I'm not listening to...
Mom?
(SHUDDERING)
(CREAKING)
(SCREAMING) Ow!
- I need to show you something.
- It's all you do!
There's shit...
You don't even spend any time with us anymore.
You just sit here and play with this shit all day long.
- Could you just wait one second?
- It's like you're obsessed!
Just wait one second.
I need to show you this, okay?
No, I can't.
I can't wait.
- No, no, no...
- I can't wait!
I can't!
- Why not?
- Because...
Because Kristi's upset all the time...
- Mommy?
(SOBBING)
- What the fuck?
I don't...
What?
What?
What?
Toby pulled my hair.
- What happened?
- Who?
Toby pulled my hair.
- (SOBBING)
- This is your fault.
Okay?
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
Hey...
I didn't... (KATIE SOBBING)
No more cameras.
No more ghosts.
This ends tomorrow.
Julie, I...
You gotta watch the fucking tape.

No, we're not going to Grandma's house, okay?
Why?
We're not going to Grandma's because there's no Toby, sweetie.
- Yes, there...
- There's no Toby and there's no ghost.
Hey, don't run away from me.
Hey.
There's no ghost and that's the end of it.
I don't want to hear any more of this talk, okay?
Okay?

Feel useful.

We can talk about it when...

Beautiful.

Toby.

It's bedtime, girls.
Let's go.
- Just having fun.
- Julie...
- Mom.
Come on.
I don't want to hear Toby's name ever again.
Okay?
Julie, it's just pretend.
That's it.
He's done.
He's not in our lives.
- He's real.
Toby is...
- Let's go.
- I don't wanna hear it.
- DENNIS:
Kristi...
Can you take them to bed, please?
Let's go.
Come on, sweetheart.
Take Grandma's stuff off and let's go to bed.
Dennis and I are gonna be right next door, okay?
We're gonna leave a light on and everything, so you can find us, and everything's gonna be...
Gonna be fine, okay?
I love you so much.
Love you.

Good night, guys.

(DOOR CLOSES)
When are you gonna stop taping us?
Not until this thing's over.
When's your mom gonna let us sleep in the same bed?
I can't stop thinking about it.

(GLASS SHATTERS)
You'll be spending a lot of time in here.
This is gonna be your room.
There's some kind of animal being de-liced or something.
Compression chamber.
That's your crib.
It's hermetically sealed.
And this is your paint color.
- What color is that, hon?
- Jamaica Bay Blue.
Jamaica!
And there you are.
- Hi.
- Yes, hi.
And there's your dad, who's playing with his new toy instead of helping me paint.
Sorry.
I can help.
- Yeah?
Come on.
- If I wasn't...
If I wasn't filming I would help.
Go and get the other ladder.
Yeah, you should have a real ladder.
That's...
You know.
All right, that's a...
- Who's that?
- It's my sister.
She's here to check out the nursery.
- Daniel, this is gorgeous.
- Yeah?
This is so gorgeous.
I love it.
I love the blue.
I'm glad y'all went with that.
It's much better than the green.
- How are you feeling?
- All right.
You know, I think I'm okay.
- How is he?
- He's doing so good.
He's kicking and, like, swimming.
- I feel like he's swimming.
- Hey, little fella!
- What did you say?
- It's Hunter.
- No!
Tyler.
It's Tyler.
- I like that.
- It's Tyler Hunter.
- It's...
I like...
I like both.
I don't wanna choose.
- I'm not gonna get into this.
- You have to.
Come on.
In preparation for the big move, I have a couple of boxes in my car that I would love to throw in your basement.
Please?
- This is the last box.
- Really?
Probably.
Oh, God!
So, a little bit nervous?
No, I'm excited.
I spend all my time over at Micah's anyway.
VHS?
That is old school.
Do we have a VCR?
I didn't even know you had this much stuff.
Somehow I ended up with it after Grandma Lois died.
I haven't even gone through it.
- How come you got it?
- I don't know.
You can have it.
Nobody ever gives me anything.
So who's gonna get the top bunk?
We're not 12.
We can get a VCR for free.
You know, I don't remember these at all.
You guys didn't go Beta, huh?
That's fine, okay?
I'm just gonna tape over an old one.
Can you get Abby out of here, please?
She's gonna get cut on the glass!
We just got back and the whole place is pretty much destroyed.
Nothing seems to be actually missing.
It's just, everything's really...
That's what she's telling me.
Just make sure we document everything.
Don't touch anything.
This is our basement.
I don't see anything really broken.
I don't see that box of tapes that Katie brought over.
Looks like that's the only thing that's missing.
All right and there she is.
The mother of the birthday girl, my girlfriend...
Chocolate, chocolate, rainbow stuff.
- That is a good-looking cake.
- Which is exactly what she wanted.
Beautiful.
Just beautiful.
And you're beautiful.
I don't know how you do it.
Are you okay?
Watch your backs!
Watch your hair.
Good job.
All right, and here's the birthday girl.
I found some.
She looks pretty unhappy.
Something's going on.
We got the young one.
Under the trampoline.
- Twenty bites and that's about all.
- Twenty bites?
That's what my mother used to make me do.
That's a lot of cake on that plate.
Hey, Julie.
Go get Kristi.
Say hi, Kristi!
Hi.
Kristi's a little shy.
That's cute.
They love each other.
It's Grandma.
Happy, happy, happy birthday.
Never forget the day you were born.
I held you in my arms and you made me laugh and cry at the same time.
You were so cute.
Serious piece of equipment, so be careful.
How do you shoot those weddings with this thing?
- It must hurt your back.
- It's something...
You have to work certain parts of your...
I've only been here for a few months...
But thank you for welcoming me into your family.
I...
- I just...
I love you, and I love...
- Dennis, my shoulder.
...you so much.
Happy birthday.
- Okay, take this thing now.
- All right.
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God!
Katie, take it easy.
Take it easy.
It's dead.
You're a little monster.
- All right, all right, I got my camera.
- Here, let me help you, 'cause I don't...
- I want to see the tooth full throttle.
- Okay, all right.
This thing's coming out today.
- Is it okay if I push it a little?
- No, no, don't push it.
- Lower lip.
- Want some juice, babe?
- Down.
- Here.
Now...
- You want some of this?
- Yeah, orange juice.
That is...
That is a good one!
- All right.
- Let's see this.
Open up.
Don't push it with your tongue.
Let's see.
It's ready.
- I think it might be...
- It's ready.
You're gonna get a newjob as a dentist.
Thank you.
You think I'm good?
Wrap it in a tissue, put it in your pocket, and bring it home for...
- The Tooth Fairy.
- The Tooth Fairy, that's right.
And we'll put it under your pillow, tonight.
Wow.
You like the Tooth Fairy, right?
We love the Tooth Fairy.
Why does he need a bowl?
Because he wants to eat.
He's hungry?
Kristi, Toby isn't real.
- Hey.
It doesn't matter.
- Yes, he is.
My assistant Randy is currently 43 minutes late.
And this isn't the first time, he's always late.
So, today we're gonna play a little prank and see if we can teach him a lesson.
- Come on around the front door.
- Come on, just open the garage.
Randy, I need your help, man.
Come around the front door.
Okay, okay.
- Hey.
- Hey, man.
- Where were you?
What happened?
- Sorry I'm late.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.
- I got blocked in.
- I'm really sorry.
- That's all right, man.
I had a leak in the house.
I was hoping you'd get here sooner.
I had a leak in the ceiling here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Here, push this up here.
It didn't rain last night.
Hold this for a second.
I need your help.
It's been going like crazy.
And I don't know what to do,
- so I got that pole there.
- Why is it white?
- What?
- Why is it white?
I don't know.
I think it's maybe something with the paint on this.
Anyway, I gotta get some spackle.
I'll be back.
- Wait, you just want me to...
- Hang on.
- You want me to wait here and hold it?
- Thanks, Randy.
Wait, Dennis.
I'm just supposed to wait here?
Dennis.
Dennis!
- Hey.
- Okay, girls, that's far enough.
Hey.
No.
Why don't you come on in and hand me that ladder?
No.
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.
You know you don't have to listen to him.
He's not even your real dad.
Who wants to go jump on the trampoline?
- I do!
- Oh, come on.
- I have a new trick to show you.
- Okay.
Guys, come on.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.
- Ready for a surprise?
It better be a ladder.
We were playing outside.
What did we find, guys?
- A spider.
- Dennis.
- We've got a cute little spider.
- Dennis!
- Come on, man.
- Okay.
Yeah?
- Do it, do it, do it, do it!
- All right.
Run!
- It wasn't even a spider.
- That really hurt.
That really hurt.
- Hi.
- Big day today, right?
- Yep.
- What's today?
- Picture day.
- Picture day!
- Dennis, you're still in.
- Sorry.
- I was finishing my hair!
- This picture's for Grandma.
Smile.
All right!
- Okay...
- Kristi, come on!
Here it goes.
All right.
Cheese.
- Thanks, sweetheart.
- No, no, no.
Seriously, like...
- Randy?
- Yeah.
Where did you find this girl?
I don't know.
I didn't see her at all throughout any of the wedding...
- That's because I'm so happy...
- "So happy for you."
I love my job, man.
- I should've got her number.
- Probably could've.
Randy, this is great stuff.
I can't use any of this, but it's great.
Jule?
Julie?
There it goes again.
Hello?
Julie?
I like this song!
Not bad.
That's pretty good.
Teddy?
Did you fall down?
What was that?
- Hey.
- Hey.
What you doing?
Nothing.
I was just looking around.
What...
What...
You guys just get home?
Yeah.
- It was girls' day.
- I know.
How was it?
- Was it fun?
- Great.
You just really snuck up on me there.
All right.
It's time.
- Don't film this.
- Why not?
It's illegal.
Don't laugh.
We haven't even started smoking it, and you're already paranoid.
It's illegal.
What if my kids find me?
I'm a mother.
- Now relax.
- Seriously, Dennis.
Seriously, Julie.
Let's get really serious.
Seriously.
- Shut up.
- Let's be serious.
- All right.
- Real, real, real big, big...
That was big.
Julie, do the voice.
Dennis.
What voice?
This voice?
Dennis, I can't believe you're filming me smoke marijuana.
God, you're so beautiful.
Shut up.
I want to film us having sex.
Is that perverted?
- Is that weird?
- I don't know.
Was that a yes?
Okay.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Hey, there, pretty lady.
Stop.
I don't know.
You sure...
You sure you're up for this?
No.
You know what?
Don't answer that.
Hurry up, before I change my mind.
Okay, sorry.
All right.
What are you doing?
What was that?
It's porno music.
Great.
Classy.
Good start.
Good, right?
- All right.
- I don't know.
Relax.
Just relax.
Don't worry about it.
Hey.
- Yeah.
I'm okay.
- Relax.
- Yeah, what is that?
- I don't know.
It's an earthquake.
- Holy shit!
- Dennis, it's an earthquake!
The girls.
The girls!
Come on!
Dennis!
Dennis.
Oh, my God, I look so fat.
You don't look fat.
- Look at the size of me on top of you.
- You look beautiful.
You look like you can't breathe 'cause I'm sitting on top of you.
I want another shot at doing one of these.
- Watch this.
- Dennis, you have to erase this.
Julie, watch, watch, watch.
- See that?
- What?
Did you see that in the corner?
Yeah, I see, like, dust.
- Dirt falling.
- No, Julie.
There's something there.
- You are crazy.
- There was something there.
Wait, you can see something there.
It's very cute, but you're going a little crazy.
You're like one of those people that see things, like in their food.
Like when people think they see the Virgin Mary in their toast.
- That's you right now.
- That's hilarious.
This has to be erased and this has to be erased.
I'm sorry.
Or we're never having sex again.
I'm late.
I got to go.
Thanks for erasing both of them.
You know, you're going to regret saying that.
Doubt it.
I don't think you can go a day without having sex, personally.
Don't dare me.
- Erase it.
- I'm not going to erase it.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.
Dude, what are you doing, man?
You're always so late.
I know, it's my car!
I got the earthquake.
- Did you really?
- On tape.
It's scary, right?
Is that Julie?
It's nothing, it's nothing.
- We're going to...
- Is that a sex tape?
Yeah.
I got...
This weird thing happened after...
She let you make a sex tape?
Yeah, but it got interrupted by the earthquake.
I wouldn't have let anything interrupt that.
Relax, man, just relax.
Would you just stop?
- Let me slow-mo shuttle forward.
- Just shut up.
Check this out.
Ready?
All right, let me tweak the contrast here.
Okay.
I'm gonna take the color out.
It looks like dust is falling on something.
It looks like a figure, right?
- You see that?
- Yeah.
Did you catch that?
- Yeah, it moved.
- Did you see the dust move?
- It moved, right?
- What was that?
I don't know.
Check it out.
- It's weird, right?
- It's kind of weird.
You know, I've been hearing these noises in the girls' room lately.
I don't know.
I feel like it's...
Something weird's going on.
- Julie?
- Yeah, I'm back here.
Hey, I wanted to talk to you...
Dennis!
Sorry!
Sorry.
Oh, my God!
Sorry.
You mind if I set up a couple cameras around the house?
I'm not going to talk to you right now.
Okay, I'll...
I'll take that as a yes?
- I hate you!
- Okay.
Love you, too.
How long do the tapes last?
About six hours each.
So you have to change them every six hours?
Yes.
Katie, can you hop out of the frame?
- Okay.
Is that good?
- Yeah, so I can...
Keep going.
- Can I see it?
- Sure.
Here.
Come here.
See it?
Yeah.
Pretty cool, right?
So, what are you trying to see?
Anything unusual or strange.
Oh, no, it's not that.
Don't touch the camera.
- Kristi?
- Yeah?
Don't touch the camera or anything.
Katie, just leave it alone.
- Dennis.
- What?
Really?
Don't you think you're overreacting a little?
This is a new house.
It shouldn't be making these noises.
Not just in here.
It's in the girls' room, too.
No...
This is not gonna work here.
Like, what do you think you're gonna catch?
Whatever's in our house.
Right, 'cause there's something here watching us.
Well, there's definitely something.
I...
I feel it.
I feel something, I'm telling you.
Yeah, I feel something, too.
I'm not gonna lie.
I feel a camera.
The earthquake, and all those...
I don't know, stuff that's been happening and...
I don't know, I just...
No, it's totally normal.
Bye, camera.
Good night, camera.
Yeah?
Yeah, probably.
In their bedroom.
Be quiet, so we don't wake Katie up.
It's okay.
Why?
Yeah, kind of.
He's very sweet.
Yeah, I saw that.
I watched some of the tapes on the camera and I saw you talking to somebody late last night.
If you saw me talking to somebody, it would be Toby.
Toby's your friend?
Yes.
He's my friend.
Yeah, what do you guys talk about?
Secrets.
He's big?
So, is he old, like Grandma, or is he young, like you?
He's old, like Grandma.
And what does he look like?
Is he tall?
Is he fat?
He's tall.
He's tall.
Don't call him fat.
Kristi, when you say that if you tell one of your secrets that you'll be in trouble with Toby, what does that mean?
Well, I won't be safe.
He's gonna...
Did he say he's gonna hurt you?
No.
But I won't be safe.
That means, I will be, like...
Be in very, very big trouble.
Big trouble.
- You saw her.
- That's how it is.
It was like he was actually there, right?
I know.
Because that's how active kids' imaginations are.
It's crazy.
I mean, imagination is one thing.
She got up in the middle of the night.
I mean, it's a little odd that she got up in the middle...
You haven't been around kids for that long.
They do weird things.
They...
Katie used to get up in the middle of the night and she used to sleep on the toilet.
What?
Okay?
I'm serious.
Really?
Yes.
Toby is a phase and he's going to be gone in a couple weeks.
I know it.
How many hours of footage do you have?
This is the job, man.
I got two cameras, six hours each.
Twelve hours.
- Twelve hours of footage?
- Yeah.
Got to do it, man.
- I'm seriously gonna review it.
- ...of footage every day.
Yes.
Now, please, I'm trying to concentrate.
That's so stupid.
There's only 24 hours in a day, Dennis.
- Hey, Julie.
- ...going?
Good.
You want to step into my office and do some work with me or...
No.
You find anything?
Yes, actually.
We did find something.
We found that your family sleeps all night.
Very funny, Randy.
- Keep up the good work.
- Okay.
I love you with all of my heart and soul.
I love you, too.
It should either be called Back to the Past...
Present.
Back to the Present.
- No, no.
- End of story.
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It makes total sense.
Let's Get Back to the Present, maybe.
But Back to the Past...
Back to the Present.
- You hear that?
- Yeah.
- Was that...
That's it.
- What the hell?
It's happening again.
Come on.
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.
It's in your closet.
Are you getting that?
Open it.
- Are you getting it?
- Yeah, I'm gettin' it.
Holy shit!
Holy shit!
That's not funny.
- Oh, my God.
You're both crazy.
- I got you guys so bad.
- I got you.
- You're both crazy.
I got you good.
I got you, too.
Are you okay?
Just go ahead and take your crap right there, 'cause I nearly crapped my pants.
Holy fuck!
You almost gave me a heart attack.
Oh, my God, get away!
- Get away from me.
- Are you okay?
Get away.
I hate you.
Wow.
Look at that tent.
Gosh.
I like this tent.
"...and disguised his voice to sound like Little Red Riding Hood.
"The poor old woman, before she could even scream, the wolf gobbled her up."
Hello.
Hey, guys.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- Good.
- That's a little bright.
I'm sorry.
- Guys?
I got you a little...
- Give it to me.
Hey, guys.
Don't tell Mom, okay?
- Okay.
- All right.
What are you guys doing?
You'll see.
We've got a little surprise for you.
- One, two, three!
- ...two, three!
Come here.
Here, tickle torture, tickle torture, tickle torture!
That's enough.
You guys are locked in the dungeon.
All right.
Good night, girls.
I love you.
- Love you, Dennis.
- Love you.
Dennis.
Dennis.
- What?
- Listen.
What?
I think the girls came inside.
I'll go check on them.
I got it.
Girls?
Dennis.
Dennis?
Don't do that to me.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- You scared me.
Did you check on them?
Why is this door locked?
Did you lock this?
What's the matter?
We're just checking on you guys.
Move that light.
We're gonna move inside, okay?
- I want to stay here.
- Why?
I'm sorry.
It's gonna be fun inside, too, though.
Come on.
Get your stuff.
We're gonna camp inside.
- Mommy.
Why?
- What?
Dennis, will you film me?
- Yep.
- I wanna show you something.
You know Spud Webb?
One, two, three, slam dunk!
Very impressive.
Very good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Katie, are you sure you didn't sneak into the house last night?
My gosh, I pinky swear,
- I did not go into the house.
- Okay.
You wanna do me a favor?
Can you tell your mom that?
Where's Dennis?
He's out, buying more tapes.
With your credit card?
Mom.
He doesn't have any money.
That is not true.
The girls love him.
I mean, they just about think he's the coolest guy ever.
I mean, I really, really do like him.
I mean that.
It's just that the girls miss their father.
I don't know.
I wish he were a little more financially secure.
He is financially secure, Mom.
He has a job.
- He shoots wedding videos.
- No.
That's...
No.
He has his own business.
You know?
It's a whole different thing.
My God, Mom.
I just told you,
I don't want to have any more kids.
I'm not gonna get pregnant.
You always said you wanted a big family.
I changed my mind, okay?
I have two beautiful girls.
You always wanted a son.
I'm happy with the way things are.
Let's go.
What the...
Fuck.
This is great.
Hang on.
That's great!
Katie, that's great.
You're doing really good.
- Thank you.
- Let her go, Jule.
Dennis, I totally believe in this shit.
Randy, watch the language.
All right, nice and slow.
My brother saw one once.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What's Bloody Mary?
You don't know what Bloody Mary is?
It's where you go in the bathroom and you say "Bloody Mary" three times in the mirror and then you see a ghost.
Dennis, I wanna play Bloody Mary.
Nothing, don't worry.
It's okay.
You say Bloody Mary three times.
I want to play!
I want to see a ghost.
I'm just saying you're missing half of the stuff in the house without cameras down there.
I know.
You don't have to tell me.
Like put it up in the corner, like, rack it up in the corner or something?
It just doesn't work.
It just...
It's not a wide enough angle.
And I don't even...
They don't even make lenses that wide.
Mirrors.
You could use mirrors.
- This thing is so cool.
- Pretty cool, right?
It's awesome.
Wow!
Look, you got it balanced out and everything, too.
What is that?
I got to work out some kinks.
Oh, man.
- Hi.
- Hey.
What is that?
Check it out.
My new thing.
- It's pretty cool, right?
- Yeah.
- What...
What is it?
- I took your fan...
And basically, took apart...
Basically, the oscillator on your fan allows me to see both in the living room and in the kitchen.
Cool.
Wait, what?
You broke my fan?
I can put it back together.
Okay, MacGyver.
It's cool, right?
This way I can...
Kristi, what are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Go back to bed.
It's really late.
Hey, babe, what are you doing up here?
Painting.
Don't you want to play outside?
Not really.
How about your friend Toby?
Do you still talk to him?
Yeah.
Did he wake you up?
No.
Did he tell you to come downstairs?
No.
You know you can tell me, right?
He told me not to talk about it.
Why don't you just ask him yourself?
He's standing right next to you.
I don't see him.
He's there.
Hey, thanks for getting these, man.
Yeah, of course.
- This is good stuff.
- Thanks.
- Randy...
- Yeah?
Did you check this out?
No, I don't have a library card.
You stole these?
I didn't steal them, Dennis.
You told me to get the books, I got you the books.
It's what a library is.
It's for borrowing.
That's what "library" means in Spanish...
It means, "Borrow book store."
Malevolent Entities.
What is this one?
I don't know.
I looked through it for a second.
It had some creepy pictures...
This stuff is creepy.
Hey.
It's your sister and her friends.
Is that a joke?
What, was that supposed to be funny?
Playing field hockey.
Says, "Kids are susceptible to spiritual contact."
Okay.
And?
Well, the whole thing with Kristi and her imaginary friend.
Remember, I was telling you the crazy stuff started happening only when she started talking to her imaginary friend.
I mean, it must want something.
That's what...
You know, that's what the book says.
They don't just stick around for no reason.
It wants something.
What does it want?
Well, the book says it feeds off of your fear.
Hey, Kristi.
- Kristi.
- Yeah?
- Wanna play a game?
- Sure.
Here.
What are you doing?
- Playing with my soccer ball?
- Yeah.
Kristi, that's mine.
Kristi!
Kristi, come on.
Kristi, come help me.
What are we doing?
- We're gonna play Bloody Mary.
- Why?
Because I wanna try to catch the ghost.
Okay.
I think it's on.
So, how you play is you say "Bloody Mary" three times into the mirror and then her dead body's supposed to appear
- in the mirror and try to kill you.
- Stop!
Stop!
Stop, Katie.
So, now what do we do?
We have to say "Bloody Mary".
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Bloody Mary.
- Kristi, I said three times, not four.
- Sorry.
- I'm scared, Katie.
- We have to be quiet.
- Guys...
- My gosh, Mom!
You scared me.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
We're just playing a game.
Okay.
Grandma just got here.
Go say hi.
- You moved his camera?
- Yeah.
- Is it taping?
- I'll pick it up, I promise.
Yeah.
We gotta move it before he comes home 'cause he's gonna be mad.
- You guys wanna go to the pool?
- Yeah.
You wanna go to the pool, Grandma?
God damn it.
- Mom?
- Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
Holy shit.
Mommy, what happened?
- Stay upstairs.
Stay upstairs.
- What happened?
Don't come down here.
- There's glass on the floor.
Stay there.
- Are you hurt?
I have no idea, I have no idea.
Looks fine, right?
It didn't even break.
That's good.
- What happened?
- It just fell.
I didn't...
What do you mean, what happened?
I was in there.
- Hi, Kristi.
- Hey.
- Say hi to the camera.
- Hey.
- Can I join you guys?
- Sure.
- I can?
- Yeah.
Okay, great.
I'm gonna set my camera here, okay?
- Okay.
- Just keep it out of the way.
Wait.
Why are you filming this?
It's just like, I'm testing out my, like, new camera and, you know, no reason.
Don't sit there.
That's Toby's spot.
Sorry.
Is Toby sitting there right now?
Okay.
Sorry.
Sorry, Toby.
Does Teddy need help with his tea?
He looks thirsty.
- Yeah.
- Here you go, Teddy.
Here.
He can't reach 'em.
Okay.
Wow.
He was thirsty.
See, I told you.
And she keeps falling.
Poke.
So, Kristi, what was the last thing that Toby said to you?
Like...
- Anything?
- Yeah.
- No?
- Secrets.
Secrets.
Regular stuff.
In her sink?
Yeah.
Sorry.
That...
Did you...
Did you...
Did he say something just now?
No, I just put my hand on him.
And he didn't like that.
He doesn't like that, when you...
No.
Sorry, Toby.
It was a mistake, right?
Yeah.
- What?
- Nothing.
- What?
- Never mind.
- What were you gonna say?
- Nothing.
It's okay, you can tell me.
Kristi, why is Dennis's camera here?
Because me and Toby were having a little tea party and he was filming us.
- I'm not!
- Yes, you are, Kristi.
Only babies have imaginary friends.
He is real.
Hey, Kristi!
Kristi's such a baby!
Baby!
Katie, stop it!
Well, you're being a baby!
Only babies have imaginary friends.
No, I'm not!
He's right in there.
In there?
Toby, come out!
Toby, come out!
Toby!
Okay, I'm gonna go in.
Katie, you shouldn't do that.
Katie!
Don't go in there.
- You shouldn't do that.
- Well, I am.
Toby, come out.
Toby...
Katie.
Kristi!
What are you doing?
Open the door!
You shouldn't do that.
Kristi, open this door!
- It's not me!
- Kristi!
- Girls!
- Open the door!
- What is this yelling?
What is going on?
- I'm not doing that.
Stop fighting right this second.
Why's Dennis's camera on the floor?
She locked me in there.
- Katie, you can't touch his stuff.
- Kristi, why...
Stop fighting right this second.
- Mom, she locked me in there!
- I don't want to hear it.
- Come on, come on.
- Then who locked me in there?
Toby did.
Yeah, like Toby locked me in there.
She's gonna be here any minute.
See?
There she is.
Mommy, Lisa's here!
Okay!
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi!
How are you?
Good.
- I wanna show you something upstairs.
- Hi, Lisa.
Wait, what are you showing me?
I got some new beads for my birthday.
Beads!
Let's see 'em.
Hi, Kristi.
How are you?
Hey.
What's that?
Don't mind this.
You know Dennis and his cameras, he just puts them...
Just ignore it.
8:30 bedtime?
No, no, no, 10:00.
- 8:30.
Nice try.
- Mommy, please.
9:30?
- 9:00.
- 9:45.
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, guys.
Love you.
Look, it made a triangle.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- Good night, girls!
- Good night.
- See you later.
- Bye, Julie.
Bye, Dennis.
Are you tired?
- Not really.
- No?
Can you tell us a story?
Sure.
What kind of story?
A ghost story.
Ghost story?
With a ghost.
Okay, let's think.
I'm a ghost!
Hello, Dennis!
You found the ghost.
Comin' to get you.
Got you!
- Good night, Lisa.
- Good night, sweetie.
Hi, Dennis.
- Hi.
- Hey!
Hi!
- How'd it go?
- Fine, it was good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, they were great.
The girls were...
Give you any trouble, or...
No, no, no, no, it was good.
But my mom's meeting me, so if I could just...
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, give her some money.
Here you go.
Thank you.
You're sure everything was good?
Yeah, no.
Thank you, guys.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Okay, bye.
Thanks.
I don't know.
- That was weird.
- Yeah.
It's so high.
Promise?
Okay.
What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Why are you up?
Why are you up?
Nothing.
Kristi, go to bed.
It's late.
- Is that the babysitter?
- Yeah, that's Lisa.
How come I never met her?
I'll put in a good word.
- See the sheet?
- Yeah.
Watch this.
- Gone.
- Holy fuck.
Am I...
Am I right?
Holy...
- Did you see that?
- ...fuck!
I'm not crazy, right?
I'm not crazy.
That just happened.
Holy!
What the fuck is that?
I don't know.
- What is that?
- I don't know.
I'm telling you, it's...
And she didn't say anything at all?
She left the room, like...
Did you show Julie?
No, man.
What, are you kidding?
She would flip out.
She would go nuts, and, you know, she'd make me take the cameras down, and I can't do that.
I really want to figure out what this thing wants.
Got to keep taping this shit, though, man.
I know.
I am.
- You got to keep taping this shit.
- I know.
She got blown in the face.
Yeah, yeah.
No.
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
I'm going to bed.
What the...
What the fuck?
Hey, how's she feeling?
We need to go to the doctor 'cause she's burning up.
Oh, no.
- Yeah, she's really...
- She's really that bad?
- Yeah, it's bad.
- All right.
It's like, I've taken it a couple times.
Do you want me to go with you or...
Well, I mean, I don't know.
Who's gonna watch Katie?
I can call Randy.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, hey.
- Thanks for coming over.
- No problemo.
- Hi, Randy.
- Hi!
Randy, thank you so much.
We're gonna be at the hospital for a little bit.
Okay.
Anything you guys want...
- I know where everything is.
- Okay, great.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Bye!
Love you.
Bye, Kristi!
You have everything?
You have papers and insurance?
Yeah, I have it.
- Thanks a lot.
- Love you.
Bye.
- I'll lock the door.
- Okay, thanks.
- Thanks again.
- I'll lock it.
All right, be good, Katie.
See you.
- Hey, hey.
- Hi.
So what's wrong with Kristi?
It's like a really high fever or something like that.
Is it contagious?
I don't think so.
I haven't gotten sick.
Okay, good.
What do you want to do?
Can we play Bloody Mary?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Seriously?
I really don't think this is a good idea, Katie.
You made a promise.
You have to do it.
- Can't we just play, like, doll house...
- Get the camera!
...or somethin'?
Sorry, Dennis.
Not my idea.
Come on.
I'm comin', I'm comin'.
So you say, "Bloody Mary" three times.
And then you wait a little bit and then you turn the lights back on and then you're supposed to see her body in the mirror and she's gonna try to kill you.
Try and kill you.
Good game.
Yep.
I don't know why you wanna play this.
One of us is gonna be dead by the end of it.
I guess it's a one-time game.
Okay, let's do it.
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Randy!
Nothing happened.
You turned the light on too soon.
Come on, Katie.
This is stupid.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You can't leave!
Let's just go play doll house or something.
No, you didn't do it right.
What did I not do right?
You need to keep the light off longer.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
You wanna play Bloody Mary?
- Let's play Bloody Mary.
- Okay, ready?
You're not gonna see anybody play Bloody Mary like I'm about to play Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Okay, can I turn it on now?
- Quiet.
- Sorry.
Sorry.
How about now?
Wait, wait.
- What?
- Did you hear that?
What was that?
I know.
I heard it, too.
Holy shit!
- Oh, my...
- Are you okay?
Huh?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
- Does it hurt?
- No.
I just scratched myself or something.
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
It's okay.
Nothing...
Close the door.
It's okay.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's okay.
I don't want to die!
Randy, I'm scared!
Holy shit!
It's okay!
Randy, I'm scared!
Holy fuck!
You okay?
You okay?
Oh, my God.
It's all right.
Dear God.
Please, God.
Please, God, be with me.
It's okay!
It's okay!
I don't want to play this.
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Stay here.
I don't wanna play anymore.
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
Holy fuck!
Okay.
- Nothing happened.
- You okay?
Nothing.
You're fine.
- I wanna get out of here.
- It's okay, all right.
We're gonna get out of here.
Come on, Randy!
Come on, Randy!
Stay here.
Dear Lord, be with me, please, be with me.
- Randy, I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.
- It's okay.
- Come here, come here.
- I'm sorry!
It's okay.
Huh?
- Please, please, don't tell.
- It's okay, it's just like an earthquake.
I'm not gonna tell.
I'm not gonna tell.
It's all right.
It's okay.
I wanna go downstairs!
Yeah, let's go downstairs.
Fuck.
Randy, Randy, where are you going, man?
Relax.
Randy, Randy, take it easy.
Randy.
What...
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm getting all my stuff.
What...
What are you getting your stuff for, man?
- Relax.
Sit down.
- Dennis.
Get the camera out of my face.
I told you, I felt something in the room with us and then I felt a claw dig into my side, okay?
Okay, okay.
When you say "something..."
Great interview.
- No, Dennis, I'm done.
Fuck.
- When you say...
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home!
Look at the fuckin' books.
This isn't, you know,
Casper, the fuckin' friendly ghost you're chasing, man.
- I'm sorry you got hurt.
- This thing is dangerous!
- I'm sorry you got hurt, okay?
- Jesus fucking Christ!
I'm sorry, but...
What are you gonna do?
You're just gonna quit?
You're acting ridiculous.
Relax!
Dennis, no, you're acting ridiculous if you're not gonna get the fuck out.
You have to tell Julie, okay?
Just watch the fucking tape, Dennis!
- What's up?
- Hey.
What?
I need to talk to you.
- Okay.
- All right, sit down.
Here.
Sit down, Jule.
Okay, where do I begin?
...from the '30s.
Look at the necklaces.
That's crazy.
Yeah?
It's the same symbol.
Isn't that the same symbol from the girls' room?
All right?
These...
These women, they were...
- Oh, my God.
- ...part of a coven.
You're really something.
I...
I...
I really need to...
To tell you this, okay?
Kristi!
You'd better run!
You sound crazy.
Do you know that?
Hang on a second, all right?
Do you know how crazy you're starting to sound?
Would you just give me a second to explain?
They would have these ceremonies and they would wait till the girls were old enough to get pregnant and then they would...
They would...
They would take their sons.
Right.
And then they would brainwash them and they didn't remember a thing.
That explains it.
Dennis, I'm not listening to...
Mom?
- I need to show you something.
- It's all you do!
There's shit...
You don't even spend any time with us anymore.
You just sit here and play with this shit all day long.
- Could you just wait one second?
- It's like you're obsessed!
Just wait one second.
I need to show you this, okay?
No, I can't.
I can't wait.
- No, no, no...
- I can't wait!
I can't!
- Why not?
- Because...
Because Kristi's upset all the time...
- Mommy?
- What the fuck?
I don't...
What?
What?
What?
Toby pulled my hair.
- What happened?
- Who?
Toby pulled my hair.
This is your fault.
Okay?
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
Hey...
I didn't...
No more cameras.
No more ghosts.
This ends tomorrow.
Julie, I...
You gotta watch the fucking tape.
Kristi.
Wake up!
Katie, go back to sleep.
What was that?
What's happening?
Kristi!
Toby's here.
I'm scared!
Mom!
Mommy!
- Mommy!
- Stop screaming!
It's okay!
Just ignore it!
Just ignore it!
Mom!
Kristi!
Kristi, help me!
Kristi!
Please...
Please...
Please help me!
Katie!
Let her go!
Let her go!
Toby, stop!
Stop, Toby!
I'll do it.
Just let her go!
I'm scared.
I want Mommy!
...to Grandma's house.
No, we're not going to Grandma's house, okay?
Why?
We're not going to Grandma's because there's no Toby, sweetie.
- Yes, there...
- There's no Toby and there's no ghost.
Hey, don't run away from me.
Hey.
There's no ghost and that's the end of it.
I don't want to hear any more of this talk, okay?
Okay?
- What'd she say?
- She said no.
No.
No.
Mom, we're not coming over.
Okay?
We're staying right here.
Because I need to get things back to normal.
All right, Mom, I gotta go.
Someone's at the door, okay?
I'll call you back.
Yeah, okay.
Hello?
Weird.
Dennis!
Dennis!
Dennis, get the girls!
We're getting out of here!
Girls, wake up, we're here.
Wake up.
We're here.
Yay, we're here.
There's Grandma.
Mommy, I'm tired.
Go park by the garage.
Oh, God.
Are you okay?
- Come on.
- Let's go, guys.
Hi, honey.
Come on, go.
You go with your mom.
I've got your sister.
Come on.
Come on.
Mommy.
Sleepy girl is what she is.
Go on in the house.
I've got apple pie and I've got...
You want water, I know.
How're we doing?
Put the camera down and come and eat some pie.
- I'm fine.
- Come on.
It makes me feel better to do something.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Feel useful.
Are you okay?
- How's it going, kiddo?
- What is going on?
- Good.
- How you feeling?
...not talk about it right now.
We can talk about it when...
Just...
Let's just drop it.
- Hey, Kristi?
- What?
Don't touch the painting, okay?
It's okay, I'm not mad.
Do you like it?
What's the matter?
Kristi!
Come and get your pie!
Hey, guys.
What's going on?
You playing some dress-up?
Doesn't she make a beautiful bride?
- Very.
- Do you want to put this on her?
Beautiful.
Try that.
So, who's the lucky guy?
Toby.
Wait.
What did she say?
- Let's go.
It's bedtime, girls.
Let's go.
- Just having fun.
- Julie...
- Mom.
Come on.
I don't want to hear Toby's name ever again.
Okay?
Julie, it's just pretend.
That's it.
He's done.
He's not in our lives.
- He's real.
Toby is...
- Let's go.
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Kristi...
Can you take them to bed, please?
Let's go.
Come on, sweetheart.
Take Grandma's stuff off and let's go to bed.
Dennis and I are gonna be right next door, okay?
We're gonna leave a light on and everything, so you can find us, and everything's gonna be...
Gonna be fine, okay?
I love you so much.
Love you.
- Good night, guys.
- I love you so much.
When are you gonna stop taping us?
Not until this thing's over.
When's your mom gonna let us sleep in the same bed?
I can't stop thinking about it.
I can't.
I know.
Just close your eyes and try to get to sleep.
Come here.
We can share a pillow, too.
That's fine.
Julie.
Do you hear that?
Like cars?
- Sorry...
- It's my mom.
She's always up at night.
She can't sleep.
Oh, my God, she's so loud.
Do you want me to go check on her?
She's gonna wake the girls up.
I'll be right back.
Julie?
Julie!
Girls?
Julie?
Hey, Julie!
Hello?
What the fuck?
Julie?
Lois?
What?
What the fuck?
Julie!
What the fuck?
Fuck.
Oh, my God.
Julie!
Julie?
What's wrong?
Fuck.
Fuck.
Julie?
Get up.
Mommy?
Oh, Kristi!
No, Kristi!
- Dennis?
- Come here, come on.
Let's go, Kristi.
What happened to Mommy?
Is she okay?
Oh, shit.
Come here.
Go, go.
Dennis, I'm scared.
It's okay.
No, Kristi, don't talk.
Is Mommy okay?
Quiet, okay?
Be quiet.
Just don't, okay?
Just quiet, okay?
It's okay.
Kristi, please, please, be quiet.
I'm gonna go check, okay?
Stay here.
Come on, Kristi.
What was that?
We're gonna get out of here, okay?
Come on, let's go.
I'm scared.
We're gonna get out of here.
Up.
Okay.
We're gonna be okay.
I don't know.
Katie!
Katie, get away from there!
Kristi, listen to me, stay right here, okay?
Don't move, okay?
Katie?
Come on, Toby.
Let's get ready.
You'll be spending a lot of time in here.
This is gonna be your room.
There's some kind of animal being de-liced or something.
Compression chamber.
That's your crib.
It's hermetically sealed.
And this is your paint color.
- What color is that, hon?
- Jamaica Bay Blue.
Jamaica!
And there you are.
- Hi.
- Yes, hi.
And there's your dad, who's playing with his new toy instead of helping me paint.
Sorry.
I can help.
- Yeah?
Come on.
- If I wasn't...
If I wasn't filming I would help.
Go and get the other ladder.
Yeah, you should have a real ladder.
That's...
You know.
All right, that's a...
- Who's that?
- It's my sister.
She's here to check out the nursery.
- Daniel, this is gorgeous.
- Yeah?
This is so gorgeous.
I love it.
I love the blue.
I'm glad y'all went with that.
It's much better than the green.
- How are you feeling?
- All right.
You know, I think I'm okay.
- How is he?
- He's doing so good.
He's kicking and, like, swimming.
- I feel like he's swimming.
- Hey, little fella!
- What did you say?
- It's Hunter.
- No!
Tyler.
It's Tyler.
- I like that.
- It's Tyler Hunter.
- It's...
I like...
I like both.
I don't wanna choose.
- I'm not gonna get into this.
- You have to.
Come on.
In preparation for the big move, I have a couple of boxes in my car that I would love to throw in your basement.
Please?
- This is the last box.
- Really?
Probably.
Oh, God!
So, a little bit nervous?
No, I'm excited.
I spend all my time over at Micah's anyway.
VHS?
That is old school.
Do we have a VCR?
I didn't even know you had this much stuff.
Somehow I ended up with it after Grandma Lois died.
I haven't even gone through it.
- How come you got it?
- I don't know.
You can have it.
Nobody ever gives me anything.
So who's gonna get the top bunk?
We're not 12.
We can get a VCR for free.
You know, I don't remember these at all.
You guys didn't go Beta, huh?
That's fine, okay?
I'm just gonna tape over an old one.
Can you get Abby out of here, please?
She's gonna get cut on the glass!
We just got back and the whole place is pretty much destroyed.
Nothing seems to be actually missing.
It's just, everything's really...
That's what she's telling me.
Just make sure we document everything.
Don't touch anything.
This is our basement.
I don't see anything really broken.
I don't see that box of tapes that Katie brought over.
Looks like that's the only thing that's missing.
All right and there she is.
The mother of the birthday girl, my girlfriend...
Chocolate, chocolate, rainbow stuff.
- That is a good-looking cake.
- Which is exactly what she wanted.
Beautiful.
Just beautiful.
And you're beautiful.
I don't know how you do it.
Are you okay?
Watch your backs!
Watch your hair.
Good job.
All right, and here's the birthday girl.
I found some.
She looks pretty unhappy.
Something's going on.
We got the young one.
Under the trampoline.
- Twenty bites and that's about all.
- Twenty bites?
That's what my mother used to make me do.
That's a lot of cake on that plate.
Hey, Julie.
Go get Kristi.
Say hi, Kristi!
Hi.
Kristi's a little shy.
That's cute.
They love each other.
It's Grandma.
Happy, happy, happy birthday.
Never forget the day you were born.
I held you in my arms and you made me laugh and cry at the same time.
You were so cute.
Serious piece of equipment, so be careful.
How do you shoot those weddings with this thing?
- It must hurt your back.
- It's something...
You have to work certain parts of your...
I've only been here for a few months...
But thank you for welcoming me into your family.
I...
- I just...
I love you, and I love...
- Dennis, my shoulder.
...you so much.
Happy birthday.
- Okay, take this thing now.
- All right.
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God!
Katie, take it easy.
Take it easy.
It's dead.
You're a little monster.
- All right, all right, I got my camera.
- Here, let me help you, 'cause I don't...
- I want to see the tooth full throttle.
- Okay, all right.
This thing's coming out today.
- Is it okay if I push it a little?
- No, no, don't push it.
- Lower lip.
- Want some juice, babe?
- Down.
- Here.
Now...
- You want some of this?
- Yeah, orange juice.
That is...
That is a good one!
- All right.
- Let's see this.
Open up.
Don't push it with your tongue.
Let's see.
It's ready.
- I think it might be...
- It's ready.
You're gonna get a newjob as a dentist.
Thank you.
You think I'm good?
Wrap it in a tissue, put it in your pocket, and bring it home for...
- The Tooth Fairy.
- The Tooth Fairy, that's right.
And we'll put it under your pillow, tonight.
Wow.
You like the Tooth Fairy, right?
We love the Tooth Fairy.
Why does he need a bowl?
Because he wants to eat.
He's hungry?
Kristi, Toby isn't real.
- Hey.
It doesn't matter.
- Yes, he is.
My assistant Randy is currently 43 minutes late.
And this isn't the first time, he's always late.
So, today we're gonna play a little prank and see if we can teach him a lesson.
- Come on around the front door.
- Come on, just open the garage.
Randy, I need your help, man.
Come around the front door.
Okay, okay.
- Hey.
- Hey, man.
- Where were you?
What happened?
- Sorry I'm late.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.
- I got blocked in.
- I'm really sorry.
- That's all right, man.
I had a leak in the house.
I was hoping you'd get here sooner.
I had a leak in the ceiling here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Here, push this up here.
It didn't rain last night.
Hold this for a second.
I need your help.
It's been going like crazy.
And I don't know what to do,
- so I got that pole there.
- Why is it white?
- What?
- Why is it white?
I don't know.
I think it's maybe something with the paint on this.
Anyway, I gotta get some spackle.
I'll be back.
- Wait, you just want me to...
- Hang on.
- You want me to wait here and hold it?
- Thanks, Randy.
Wait, Dennis.
I'm just supposed to wait here?
Dennis.
Dennis!
- Hey.
- Okay, girls, that's far enough.
Hey.
No.
Why don't you come on in and hand me that ladder?
No.
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.
You know you don't have to listen to him.
He's not even your real dad.
Who wants to go jump on the trampoline?
- I do!
- Oh, come on.
- I have a new trick to show you.
- Okay.
Guys, come on.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.
- Ready for a surprise?
It better be a ladder.
We were playing outside.
What did we find, guys?
- A spider.
- Dennis.
- We've got a cute little spider.
- Dennis!
- Come on, man.
- Okay.
Yeah?
- Do it, do it, do it, do it!
- All right.
Run!
- It wasn't even a spider.
- That really hurt.
That really hurt.
- Hi.
- Big day today, right?
- Yep.
- What's today?
- Picture day.
- Picture day!
- Dennis, you're still in.
- Sorry.
- I was finishing my hair!
- This picture's for Grandma.
Smile.
All right!
- Okay...
- Kristi, come on!
Here it goes.
All right.
Cheese.
- Thanks, sweetheart.
- No, no, no.
Seriously, like...
- Randy?
- Yeah.
Where did you find this girl?
I don't know.
I didn't see her at all throughout any of the wedding...
- That's because I'm so happy...
- "So happy for you."
I love my job, man.
- I should've got her number.
- Probably could've.
Randy, this is great stuff.
I can't use any of this, but it's great.
Jule?
Julie?
There it goes again.
Hello?
Julie?
I like this song!
Not bad.
That's pretty good.
Teddy?
Did you fall down?
What was that?
- Hey.
- Hey.
What you doing?
Nothing.
I was just looking around.
What...
What...
You guys just get home?
Yeah.
- It was girls' day.
- I know.
How was it?
- Was it fun?
- Great.
You just really snuck up on me there.
All right.
It's time.
- Don't film this.
- Why not?
It's illegal.
Don't laugh.
We haven't even started smoking it, and you're already paranoid.
It's illegal.
What if my kids find me?
I'm a mother.
- Now relax.
- Seriously, Dennis.
Seriously, Julie.
Let's get really serious.
Seriously.
- Shut up.
- Let's be serious.
- All right.
- Real, real, real big, big...
That was big.
Julie, do the voice.
Dennis.
What voice?
This voice?
Dennis, I can't believe you're filming me smoke marijuana.
God, you're so beautiful.
Shut up.
I want to film us having sex.
Is that perverted?
- Is that weird?
- I don't know.
Was that a yes?
Okay.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Hey, there, pretty lady.
Stop.
I don't know.
You sure...
You sure you're up for this?
No.
You know what?
Don't answer that.
Hurry up, before I change my mind.
Okay, sorry.
All right.
What are you doing?
What was that?
It's porno music.
Great.
Classy.
Good start.
Good, right?
- All right.
- I don't know.
Relax.
Just relax.
Don't worry about it.
Hey.
- Yeah.
I'm okay.
- Relax.
- Yeah, what is that?
- I don't know.
It's an earthquake.
- Holy shit!
- Dennis, it's an earthquake!
The girls.
The girls!
Come on!
Dennis!
Dennis.
Oh, my God, I look so fat.
You don't look fat.
- Look at the size of me on top of you.
- You look beautiful.
You look like you can't breathe 'cause I'm sitting on top of you.
I want another shot at doing one of these.
- Watch this.
- Dennis, you have to erase this.
Julie, watch, watch, watch.
- See that?
- What?
Did you see that in the corner?
Yeah, I see, like, dust.
- Dirt falling.
- No, Julie.
There's something there.
- You are crazy.
- There was something there.
Wait, you can see something there.
It's very cute, but you're going a little crazy.
You're like one of those people that see things, like in their food.
Like when people think they see the Virgin Mary in their toast.
- That's you right now.
- That's hilarious.
This has to be erased and this has to be erased.
I'm sorry.
Or we're never having sex again.
I'm late.
I got to go.
Thanks for erasing both of them.
You know, you're going to regret saying that.
Doubt it.
I don't think you can go a day without having sex, personally.
Don't dare me.
- Erase it.
- I'm not going to erase it.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.
Dude, what are you doing, man?
You're always so late.
I know, it's my car!
I got the earthquake.
- Did you really?
- On tape.
It's scary, right?
Is that Julie?
It's nothing, it's nothing.
- We're going to...
- Is that a sex tape?
Yeah.
I got...
This weird thing happened after...
She let you make a sex tape?
Yeah, but it got interrupted by the earthquake.
I wouldn't have let anything interrupt that.
Relax, man, just relax.
Would you just stop?
- Let me slow-mo shuttle forward.
- Just shut up.
Check this out.
Ready?
All right, let me tweak the contrast here.
Okay.
I'm gonna take the color out.
It looks like dust is falling on something.
It looks like a figure, right?
- You see that?
- Yeah.
Did you catch that?
- Yeah, it moved.
- Did you see the dust move?
- It moved, right?
- What was that?
I don't know.
Check it out.
- It's weird, right?
- It's kind of weird.
You know, I've been hearing these noises in the girls' room lately.
I don't know.
I feel like it's...
Something weird's going on.
- Julie?
- Yeah, I'm back here.
Hey, I wanted to talk to you...
Dennis!
Sorry!
Sorry.
Oh, my God!
Sorry.
You mind if I set up a couple cameras around the house?
I'm not going to talk to you right now.
Okay, I'll...
I'll take that as a yes?
- I hate you!
- Okay.
Love you, too.
How long do the tapes last?
About six hours each.
So you have to change them every six hours?
Yes.
Katie, can you hop out of the frame?
- Okay.
Is that good?
- Yeah, so I can...
Keep going.
- Can I see it?
- Sure.
Here.
Come here.
See it?
Yeah.
Pretty cool, right?
So, what are you trying to see?
Anything unusual or strange.
Oh, no, it's not that.
Don't touch the camera.
- Kristi?
- Yeah?
Don't touch the camera or anything.
Katie, just leave it alone.
- Dennis.
- What?
Really?
Don't you think you're overreacting a little?
This is a new house.
It shouldn't be making these noises.
Not just in here.
It's in the girls' room, too.
No...
This is not gonna work here.
Like, what do you think you're gonna catch?
Whatever's in our house.
Right, 'cause there's something here watching us.
Well, there's definitely something.
I...
I feel it.
I feel something, I'm telling you.
Yeah, I feel something, too.
I'm not gonna lie.
I feel a camera.
The earthquake, and all those...
I don't know, stuff that's been happening and...
I don't know, I just...
No, it's totally normal.
Bye, camera.
Good night, camera.
Yeah?
Yeah, probably.
In their bedroom.
Be quiet, so we don't wake Katie up.
It's okay.
Why?
Yeah, kind of.
He's very sweet.
Yeah, I saw that.
I watched some of the tapes on the camera and I saw you talking to somebody late last night.
If you saw me talking to somebody, it would be Toby.
Toby's your friend?
Yes.
He's my friend.
Yeah, what do you guys talk about?
Secrets.
He's big?
So, is he old, like Grandma, or is he young, like you?
He's old, like Grandma.
And what does he look like?
Is he tall?
Is he fat?
He's tall.
He's tall.
Don't call him fat.
Kristi, when you say that if you tell one of your secrets that you'll be in trouble with Toby, what does that mean?
Well, I won't be safe.
He's gonna...
Did he say he's gonna hurt you?
No.
But I won't be safe.
That means, I will be, like...
Be in very, very big trouble.
Big trouble.
- You saw her.
- That's how it is.
It was like he was actually there, right?
I know.
Because that's how active kids' imaginations are.
It's crazy.
I mean, imagination is one thing.
She got up in the middle of the night.
I mean, it's a little odd that she got up in the middle...
You haven't been around kids for that long.
They do weird things.
They...
Katie used to get up in the middle of the night and she used to sleep on the toilet.
What?
Okay?
I'm serious.
Really?
Yes.
Toby is a phase and he's going to be gone in a couple weeks.
I know it.
How many hours of footage do you have?
This is the job, man.
I got two cameras, six hours each.
Twelve hours.
- Twelve hours of footage?
- Yeah.
Got to do it, man.
- I'm seriously gonna review it.
- ...of footage every day.
Yes.
Now, please, I'm trying to concentrate.
That's so stupid.
There's only 24 hours in a day, Dennis.
- Hey, Julie.
- ...going?
Good.
You want to step into my office and do some work with me or...
No.
You find anything?
Yes, actually.
We did find something.
We found that your family sleeps all night.
Very funny, Randy.
- Keep up the good work.
- Okay.
I love you with all of my heart and soul.
I love you, too.
It should either be called Back to the Past...
Present.
Back to the Present.
- No, no.
- End of story.
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It makes total sense.
Let's Get Back to the Present, maybe.
But Back to the Past...
Back to the Present.
- You hear that?
- Yeah.
- Was that...
That's it.
- What the hell?
It's happening again.
Come on.
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.
It's in your closet.
Are you getting that?
Open it.
- Are you getting it?
- Yeah, I'm gettin' it.
Holy shit!
Holy shit!
That's not funny.
- Oh, my God.
You're both crazy.
- I got you guys so bad.
- I got you.
- You're both crazy.
I got you good.
I got you, too.
Are you okay?
Just go ahead and take your crap right there, 'cause I nearly crapped my pants.
Holy fuck!
You almost gave me a heart attack.
Oh, my God, get away!
- Get away from me.
- Are you okay?
Get away.
I hate you.
Wow.
Look at that tent.
Gosh.
I like this tent.
"...and disguised his voice to sound like Little Red Riding Hood.
"The poor old woman, before she could even scream, the wolf gobbled her up."
Hello.
Hey, guys.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- Good.
- That's a little bright.
I'm sorry.
- Guys?
I got you a little...
- Give it to me.
Hey, guys.
Don't tell Mom, okay?
- Okay.
- All right.
What are you guys doing?
You'll see.
We've got a little surprise for you.
- One, two, three!
- ...two, three!
Come here.
Here, tickle torture, tickle torture, tickle torture!
That's enough.
You guys are locked in the dungeon.
All right.
Good night, girls.
I love you.
- Love you, Dennis.
- Love you.
Dennis.
Dennis.
- What?
- Listen.
What?
I think the girls came inside.
I'll go check on them.
I got it.
Girls?
Dennis.
Dennis?
Don't do that to me.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- You scared me.
Did you check on them?
Why is this door locked?
Did you lock this?
What's the matter?
We're just checking on you guys.
Move that light.
We're gonna move inside, okay?
- I want to stay here.
- Why?
I'm sorry.
It's gonna be fun inside, too, though.
Come on.
Get your stuff.
We're gonna camp inside.
- Mommy.
Why?
- What?
Dennis, will you film me?
- Yep.
- I wanna show you something.
You know Spud Webb?
One, two, three, slam dunk!
Very impressive.
Very good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Katie, are you sure you didn't sneak into the house last night?
My gosh, I pinky swear,
- I did not go into the house.
- Okay.
You wanna do me a favor?
Can you tell your mom that?
Where's Dennis?
He's out, buying more tapes.
With your credit card?
Mom.
He doesn't have any money.
That is not true.
The girls love him.
I mean, they just about think he's the coolest guy ever.
I mean, I really, really do like him.
I mean that.
It's just that the girls miss their father.
I don't know.
I wish he were a little more financially secure.
He is financially secure, Mom.
He has a job.
- He shoots wedding videos.
- No.
That's...
No.
He has his own business.
You know?
It's a whole different thing.
My God, Mom.
I just told you,
I don't want to have any more kids.
I'm not gonna get pregnant.
You always said you wanted a big family.
I changed my mind, okay?
I have two beautiful girls.
You always wanted a son.
I'm happy with the way things are.
Let's go.
What the...
Fuck.
This is great.
Hang on.
That's great!
Katie, that's great.
You're doing really good.
- Thank you.
- Let her go, Jule.
Dennis, I totally believe in this shit.
Randy, watch the language.
All right, nice and slow.
My brother saw one once.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What's Bloody Mary?
You don't know what Bloody Mary is?
It's where you go in the bathroom and you say "Bloody Mary" three times in the mirror and then you see a ghost.
Dennis, I wanna play Bloody Mary.
Nothing, don't worry.
It's okay.
You say Bloody Mary three times.
I want to play!
I want to see a ghost.
I'm just saying you're missing half of the stuff in the house without cameras down there.
I know.
You don't have to tell me.
Like put it up in the corner, like, rack it up in the corner or something?
It just doesn't work.
It just...
It's not a wide enough angle.
And I don't even...
They don't even make lenses that wide.
Mirrors.
You could use mirrors.
- This thing is so cool.
- Pretty cool, right?
It's awesome.
Wow!
Look, you got it balanced out and everything, too.
What is that?
I got to work out some kinks.
Oh, man.
- Hi.
- Hey.
What is that?
Check it out.
My new thing.
- It's pretty cool, right?
- Yeah.
- What...
What is it?
- I took your fan...
And basically, took apart...
Basically, the oscillator on your fan allows me to see both in the living room and in the kitchen.
Cool.
Wait, what?
You broke my fan?
I can put it back together.
Okay, MacGyver.
It's cool, right?
This way I can...
Kristi, what are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Go back to bed.
It's really late.
Hey, babe, what are you doing up here?
Painting.
Don't you want to play outside?
Not really.
How about your friend Toby?
Do you still talk to him?
Yeah.
Did he wake you up?
No.
Did he tell you to come downstairs?
No.
You know you can tell me, right?
He told me not to talk about it.
Why don't you just ask him yourself?
He's standing right next to you.
I don't see him.
He's there.
Hey, thanks for getting these, man.
Yeah, of course.
- This is good stuff.
- Thanks.
- Randy...
- Yeah?
Did you check this out?
No, I don't have a library card.
You stole these?
I didn't steal them, Dennis.
You told me to get the books, I got you the books.
It's what a library is.
It's for borrowing.
That's what "library" means in Spanish...
It means, "Borrow book store."
Malevolent Entities.
What is this one?
I don't know.
I looked through it for a second.
It had some creepy pictures...
This stuff is creepy.
Hey.
It's your sister and her friends.
Is that a joke?
What, was that supposed to be funny?
Playing field hockey.
Says, "Kids are susceptible to spiritual contact."
Okay.
And?
Well, the whole thing with Kristi and her imaginary friend.
Remember, I was telling you the crazy stuff started happening only when she started talking to her imaginary friend.
I mean, it must want something.
That's what...
You know, that's what the book says.
They don't just stick around for no reason.
It wants something.
What does it want?
Well, the book says it feeds off of your fear.
Hey, Kristi.
- Kristi.
- Yeah?
- Wanna play a game?
- Sure.
Here.
What are you doing?
- Playing with my soccer ball?
- Yeah.
Kristi, that's mine.
Kristi!
Kristi, come on.
Kristi, come help me.
What are we doing?
- We're gonna play Bloody Mary.
- Why?
Because I wanna try to catch the ghost.
Okay.
I think it's on.
So, how you play is you say "Bloody Mary" three times into the mirror and then her dead body's supposed to appear
- in the mirror and try to kill you.
- Stop!
Stop!
Stop, Katie.
So, now what do we do?
We have to say "Bloody Mary".
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Bloody Mary.
- Kristi, I said three times, not four.
- Sorry.
- I'm scared, Katie.
- We have to be quiet.
- Guys...
- My gosh, Mom!
You scared me.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
We're just playing a game.
Okay.
Grandma just got here.
Go say hi.
- You moved his camera?
- Yeah.
- Is it taping?
- I'll pick it up, I promise.
Yeah.
We gotta move it before he comes home 'cause he's gonna be mad.
- You guys wanna go to the pool?
- Yeah.
You wanna go to the pool, Grandma?
God damn it.
- Mom?
- Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
Holy shit.
Mommy, what happened?
- Stay upstairs.
Stay upstairs.
- What happened?
Don't come down here.
- There's glass on the floor.
Stay there.
- Are you hurt?
I have no idea, I have no idea.
Looks fine, right?
It didn't even break.
That's good.
- What happened?
- It just fell.
I didn't...
What do you mean, what happened?
I was in there.
- Hi, Kristi.
- Hey.
- Say hi to the camera.
- Hey.
- Can I join you guys?
- Sure.
- I can?
- Yeah.
Okay, great.
I'm gonna set my camera here, okay?
- Okay.
- Just keep it out of the way.
Wait.
Why are you filming this?
It's just like, I'm testing out my, like, new camera and, you know, no reason.
Don't sit there.
That's Toby's spot.
Sorry.
Is Toby sitting there right now?
Okay.
Sorry.
Sorry, Toby.
Does Teddy need help with his tea?
He looks thirsty.
- Yeah.
- Here you go, Teddy.
Here.
He can't reach 'em.
Okay.
Wow.
He was thirsty.
See, I told you.
And she keeps falling.
Poke.
So, Kristi, what was the last thing that Toby said to you?
Like...
- Anything?
- Yeah.
- No?
- Secrets.
Secrets.
Regular stuff.
In her sink?
Yeah.
Sorry.
That...
Did you...
Did you...
Did he say something just now?
No, I just put my hand on him.
And he didn't like that.
He doesn't like that, when you...
No.
Sorry, Toby.
It was a mistake, right?
Yeah.
- What?
- Nothing.
- What?
- Never mind.
- What were you gonna say?
- Nothing.
It's okay, you can tell me.
Kristi, why is Dennis's camera here?
Because me and Toby were having a little tea party and he was filming us.
- I'm not!
- Yes, you are, Kristi.
Only babies have imaginary friends.
He is real.
Hey, Kristi!
Kristi's such a baby!
Baby!
Katie, stop it!
Well, you're being a baby!
Only babies have imaginary friends.
No, I'm not!
He's right in there.
In there?
Toby, come out!
Toby, come out!
Toby!
Okay, I'm gonna go in.
Katie, you shouldn't do that.
Katie!
Don't go in there.
- You shouldn't do that.
- Well, I am.
Toby, come out.
Toby...
Katie.
Kristi!
What are you doing?
Open the door!
You shouldn't do that.
Kristi, open this door!
- It's not me!
- Kristi!
- Girls!
- Open the door!
- What is this yelling?
What is going on?
- I'm not doing that.
Stop fighting right this second.
Why's Dennis's camera on the floor?
She locked me in there.
- Katie, you can't touch his stuff.
- Kristi, why...
Stop fighting right this second.
- Mom, she locked me in there!
- I don't want to hear it.
- Come on, come on.
- Then who locked me in there?
Toby did.
Yeah, like Toby locked me in there.
She's gonna be here any minute.
See?
There she is.
Mommy, Lisa's here!
Okay!
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi!
How are you?
Good.
- I wanna show you something upstairs.
- Hi, Lisa.
Wait, what are you showing me?
I got some new beads for my birthday.
Beads!
Let's see 'em.
Hi, Kristi.
How are you?
Hey.
What's that?
Don't mind this.
You know Dennis and his cameras, he just puts them...
Just ignore it.
8:30 bedtime?
No, no, no, 10:00.
- 8:30.
Nice try.
- Mommy, please.
9:30?
- 9:00.
- 9:45.
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, guys.
Love you.
Look, it made a triangle.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- Good night, girls!
- Good night.
- See you later.
- Bye, Julie.
Bye, Dennis.
Are you tired?
- Not really.
- No?
Can you tell us a story?
Sure.
What kind of story?
A ghost story.
Ghost story?
With a ghost.
Okay, let's think.
I'm a ghost!
Hello, Dennis!
You found the ghost.
Comin' to get you.
Got you!
- Good night, Lisa.
- Good night, sweetie.
Hi, Dennis.
- Hi.
- Hey!
Hi!
- How'd it go?
- Fine, it was good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, they were great.
The girls were...
Give you any trouble, or...
No, no, no, no, it was good.
But my mom's meeting me, so if I could just...
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, give her some money.
Here you go.
Thank you.
You're sure everything was good?
Yeah, no.
Thank you, guys.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Okay, bye.
Thanks.
I don't know.
- That was weird.
- Yeah.
It's so high.
Promise?
Okay.
What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Why are you up?
Why are you up?
Nothing.
Kristi, go to bed.
It's late.
- Is that the babysitter?
- Yeah, that's Lisa.
How come I never met her?
I'll put in a good word.
- See the sheet?
- Yeah.
Watch this.
- Gone.
- Holy fuck.
Am I...
Am I right?
Holy...
- Did you see that?
- ...fuck!
I'm not crazy, right?
I'm not crazy.
That just happened.
Holy!
What the fuck is that?
I don't know.
- What is that?
- I don't know.
I'm telling you, it's...
And she didn't say anything at all?
She left the room, like...
Did you show Julie?
No, man.
What, are you kidding?
She would flip out.
She would go nuts, and, you know, she'd make me take the cameras down, and I can't do that.
I really want to figure out what this thing wants.
Got to keep taping this shit, though, man.
I know.
I am.
- You got to keep taping this shit.
- I know.
She got blown in the face.
Yeah, yeah.
No.
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
I'm going to bed.
What the...
What the fuck?
Hey, how's she feeling?
We need to go to the doctor 'cause she's burning up.
Oh, no.
- Yeah, she's really...
- She's really that bad?
- Yeah, it's bad.
- All right.
It's like, I've taken it a couple times.
Do you want me to go with you or...
Well, I mean, I don't know.
Who's gonna watch Katie?
I can call Randy.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, hey.
- Thanks for coming over.
- No problemo.
- Hi, Randy.
- Hi!
Randy, thank you so much.
We're gonna be at the hospital for a little bit.
Okay.
Anything you guys want...
- I know where everything is.
- Okay, great.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Bye!
Love you.
Bye, Kristi!
You have everything?
You have papers and insurance?
Yeah, I have it.
- Thanks a lot.
- Love you.
Bye.
- I'll lock the door.
- Okay, thanks.
- Thanks again.
- I'll lock it.
All right, be good, Katie.
See you.
- Hey, hey.
- Hi.
So what's wrong with Kristi?
It's like a really high fever or something like that.
Is it contagious?
I don't think so.
I haven't gotten sick.
Okay, good.
What do you want to do?
Can we play Bloody Mary?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Seriously?
I really don't think this is a good idea, Katie.
You made a promise.
You have to do it.
- Can't we just play, like, doll house...
- Get the camera!
...or somethin'?
Sorry, Dennis.
Not my idea.
Come on.
I'm comin', I'm comin'.
So you say, "Bloody Mary" three times.
And then you wait a little bit and then you turn the lights back on and then you're supposed to see her body in the mirror and she's gonna try to kill you.
Try and kill you.
Good game.
Yep.
I don't know why you wanna play this.
One of us is gonna be dead by the end of it.
I guess it's a one-time game.
Okay, let's do it.
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Randy!
Nothing happened.
You turned the light on too soon.
Come on, Katie.
This is stupid.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You can't leave!
Let's just go play doll house or something.
No, you didn't do it right.
What did I not do right?
You need to keep the light off longer.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
You wanna play Bloody Mary?
- Let's play Bloody Mary.
- Okay, ready?
You're not gonna see anybody play Bloody Mary like I'm about to play Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Okay, can I turn it on now?
- Quiet.
- Sorry.
Sorry.
How about now?
Wait, wait.
- What?
- Did you hear that?
What was that?
I know.
I heard it, too.
Holy shit!
- Oh, my...
- Are you okay?
Huh?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
- Does it hurt?
- No.
I just scratched myself or something.
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
It's okay.
Nothing...
Close the door.
It's okay.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's okay.
I don't want to die!
Randy, I'm scared!
Holy shit!
It's okay!
Randy, I'm scared!
Holy fuck!
You okay?
You okay?
Oh, my God.
It's all right.
Dear God.
Please, God.
Please, God, be with me.
It's okay!
It's okay!
I don't want to play this.
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Stay here.
I don't wanna play anymore.
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
Holy fuck!
Okay.
- Nothing happened.
- You okay?
Nothing.
You're fine.
- I wanna get out of here.
- It's okay, all right.
We're gonna get out of here.
Come on, Randy!
Come on, Randy!
Stay here.
Dear Lord, be with me, please, be with me.
- Randy, I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.
- It's okay.
- Come here, come here.
- I'm sorry!
It's okay.
Huh?
- Please, please, don't tell.
- It's okay, it's just like an earthquake.
I'm not gonna tell.
I'm not gonna tell.
It's all right.
It's okay.
I wanna go downstairs!
Yeah, let's go downstairs.
Fuck.
Randy, Randy, where are you going, man?
Relax.
Randy, Randy, take it easy.
Randy.
What...
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm getting all my stuff.
What...
What are you getting your stuff for, man?
- Relax.
Sit down.
- Dennis.
Get the camera out of my face.
I told you, I felt something in the room with us and then I felt a claw dig into my side, okay?
Okay, okay.
When you say "something..."
Great interview.
- No, Dennis, I'm done.
Fuck.
- When you say...
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home!
Look at the fuckin' books.
This isn't, you know,
Casper, the fuckin' friendly ghost you're chasing, man.
- I'm sorry you got hurt.
- This thing is dangerous!
- I'm sorry you got hurt, okay?
- Jesus fucking Christ!
I'm sorry, but...
What are you gonna do?
You're just gonna quit?
You're acting ridiculous.
Relax!
Dennis, no, you're acting ridiculous if you're not gonna get the fuck out.
You have to tell Julie, okay?
Just watch the fucking tape, Dennis!
- What's up?
- Hey.
What?
I need to talk to you.
- Okay.
- All right, sit down.
Here.
Sit down, Jule.
Okay, where do I begin?
...from the '30s.
Look at the necklaces.
That's crazy.
Yeah?
It's the same symbol.
Isn't that the same symbol from the girls' room?
All right?
These...
These women, they were...
- Oh, my God.
- ...part of a coven.
You're really something.
I...
I...
I really need to...
To tell you this, okay?
Kristi!
You'd better run!
You sound crazy.
Do you know that?
Hang on a second, all right?
Do you know how crazy you're starting to sound?
Would you just give me a second to explain?
They would have these ceremonies and they would wait till the girls were old enough to get pregnant and then they would...
They would...
They would take their sons.
Right.
And then they would brainwash them and they didn't remember a thing.
That explains it.
Dennis, I'm not listening to...
Mom?
- I need to show you something.
- It's all you do!
There's shit...
You don't even spend any time with us anymore.
You just sit here and play with this shit all day long.
- Could you just wait one second?
- It's like you're obsessed!
Just wait one second.
I need to show you this, okay?
No, I can't.
I can't wait.
- No, no, no...
- I can't wait!
I can't!
- Why not?
- Because...
Because Kristi's upset all the time...
- Mommy?
- What the fuck?
I don't...
What?
What?
What?
Toby pulled my hair.
- What happened?
- Who?
Toby pulled my hair.
This is your fault.
Okay?
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
Hey...
I didn't...
No more cameras.
No more ghosts.
This ends tomorrow.
Julie, I...
You gotta watch the fucking tape.
Kristi.
Wake up!
Katie, go back to sleep.
What was that?
What's happening?
Kristi!
Toby's here.
I'm scared!
Mom!
Mommy!
- Mommy!
- Stop screaming!
It's okay!
Just ignore it!
Just ignore it!
Mom!
Kristi!
Kristi, help me!
Kristi!
Please...
Please...
Please help me!
Katie!
Let her go!
Let her go!
Toby, stop!
Stop, Toby!
I'll do it.
Just let her go!
I'm scared.
I want Mommy!
...to Grandma's house.
No, we're not going to Grandma's house, okay?
Why?
We're not going to Grandma's because there's no Toby, sweetie.
- Yes, there...
- There's no Toby and there's no ghost.
Hey, don't run away from me.
Hey.
There's no ghost and that's the end of it.
I don't want to hear any more of this talk, okay?
Okay?
- What'd she say?
- She said no.
No.
No.
Mom, we're not coming over.
Okay?
We're staying right here.
Because I need to get things back to normal.
All right, Mom, I gotta go.
Someone's at the door, okay?
I'll call you back.
Yeah, okay.
Hello?
Weird.
Dennis!
Dennis!
Dennis, get the girls!
We're getting out of here!
Girls, wake up, we're here.
Wake up.
We're here.
Yay, we're here.
There's Grandma.
Mommy, I'm tired.
Go park by the garage.
Oh, God.
Are you okay?
- Come on.
- Let's go, guys.
Hi, honey.
Come on, go.
You go with your mom.
I've got your sister.
Come on.
Come on.
Mommy.
Sleepy girl is what she is.
Go on in the house.
I've got apple pie and I've got...
You want water, I know.
How're we doing?
Put the camera down and come and eat some pie.
- I'm fine.
- Come on.
It makes me feel better to do something.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Feel useful.
Are you okay?
- How's it going, kiddo?
- What is going on?
- Good.
- How you feeling?
...not talk about it right now.
We can talk about it when...
Just...
Let's just drop it.
- Hey, Kristi?
- What?
Don't touch the painting, okay?
It's okay, I'm not mad.
Do you like it?
What's the matter?
Kristi!
Come and get your pie!
Hey, guys.
What's going on?
You playing some dress-up?
Doesn't she make a beautiful bride?
- Very.
- Do you want to put this on her?
Beautiful.
Try that.
So, who's the lucky guy?
Toby.
Wait.
What did she say?
- Let's go.
It's bedtime, girls.
Let's go.
- Just having fun.
- Julie...
- Mom.
Come on.
I don't want to hear Toby's name ever again.
Okay?
Julie, it's just pretend.
That's it.
He's done.
He's not in our lives.
- He's real.
Toby is...
- Let's go.
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Kristi...
Can you take them to bed, please?
Let's go.
Come on, sweetheart.
Take Grandma's stuff off and let's go to bed.
Dennis and I are gonna be right next door, okay?
We're gonna leave a light on and everything, so you can find us, and everything's gonna be...
Gonna be fine, okay?
I love you so much.
Love you.
- Good night, guys.
- I love you so much.
When are you gonna stop taping us?
Not until this thing's over.
When's your mom gonna let us sleep in the same bed?
I can't stop thinking about it.
I can't.
I know.
Just close your eyes and try to get to sleep.
Come here.
We can share a pillow, too.
That's fine.
Julie.
Do you hear that?
Like cars?
- Sorry...
- It's my mom.
She's always up at night.
She can't sleep.
Oh, my God, she's so loud.
Do you want me to go check on her?
She's gonna wake the girls up.
I'll be right back.
Julie?
Julie!
Girls?
Julie?
Hey, Julie!
Hello?
What the fuck?
Julie?
Lois?
What?
What the fuck?
Julie!
What the fuck?
Fuck.
Oh, my God.
Julie!
Julie?
What's wrong?
Fuck.
Fuck.
Julie?
Get up.
Mommy?
Oh, Kristi!
No, Kristi!
- Dennis?
- Come here, come on.
Let's go, Kristi.
What happened to Mommy?
Is she okay?
Oh, shit.
Come here.
Go, go.
Dennis, I'm scared.
It's okay.
No, Kristi, don't talk.
Is Mommy okay?
Quiet, okay?
Be quiet.
Just don't, okay?
Just quiet, okay?
It's okay.
Kristi, please, please, be quiet.
I'm gonna go check, okay?
Stay here.
Come on, Kristi.
What was that?
We're gonna get out of here, okay?
Come on, let's go.
I'm scared.
We're gonna get out of here.
Up.
Okay.
We're gonna be okay.
I don't know.
Katie!
Katie, get away from there!
Kristi, listen to me, stay right here, okay?
Don't move, okay?
Katie?
Come on, Toby.
Let's get ready.
This is gonna be your room.
Compression chamber.
That's your crib.
It's hermetically sealed.
And this is your paint color.
- What color is that, hon?
- Jamaica Bay Blue.
Jamaica!
And there you are.
- Hi.
- Yes, hi.
And there's your dad, who's playing with his new toy instead of helping me paint.
Sorry.
I can help.
- Yeah?
Come on.
- If I wasn't...
If I wasn't filming I would help.
Go and get the other ladder.
Yeah, you should have a real ladder.
That's...
You know.
All right, that's a...
- Who's that?
- It's my sister.
She's here to check out the nursery.
- Daniel, this is gorgeous.
- Yeah?
This is so gorgeous.
I love it.
I love the blue.
I'm glad y'all went with that.
It's much better than the green.
- How are you feeling?
- All right.
You know, I think I'm okay.
- How is he?
- He's doing so good.
He's kicking and, like, swimming.
- I feel like he's swimming.
- Hey, little fella!
- What did you say?
- It's Hunter.
- No!
Tyler.
It's Tyler.
- I like that.
- It's Tyler Hunter.
- It's...
I like...
I like both.
I don't wanna choose.
- I'm not gonna get into this.
- You have to.
Come on.
In preparation for the big move, I have a couple of boxes in my car that I would love to throw in your basement.
Please?
- This is the last box.
- Really?
Probably.
Oh, God!
So, a little bit nervous?
No, I'm excited.
I spend all my time over at Micah's anyway.
VHS?
That is old school.
Do we have a VCR?
I didn't even know you had this much stuff.
Somehow I ended up with it after Grandma Lois died.
I haven't even gone through it.
- How come you got it?
- I don't know.
You can have it.
Nobody ever gives me anything.
So who's gonna get the top bunk?
We're not 12.
We can get a VCR for free.
You know, I don't remember these at all.
You guys didn't go Beta, huh?
That's fine, okay?
I'm just gonna tape over an old one.
Can you get Abby out of here, please?
She's gonna get cut on the glass!
We just got back and the whole place is pretty much destroyed.
Nothing seems to be actually missing.
It's just, everything's really...
That's what she's telling me.
Just make sure we document everything.
Don't touch anything.
This is our basement.
I don't see anything really broken.
I don't see that box of tapes that Katie brought over.
Looks like that's the only thing that's missing.
All right and there she is.
The mother of the birthday girl, my girlfriend...
Chocolate, chocolate, rainbow stuff.
- That is a good-looking cake.
- Which is exactly what she wanted.
Beautiful.
Just beautiful.
And you're beautiful.
I don't know how you do it.
Are you okay?
Watch your backs!
Watch your hair.
Good job.
All right, and here's the birthday girl.
I found some.
She looks pretty unhappy.
Something's going on.
We got the young one.
Under the trampoline.
- Twenty bites and that's about all.
- Twenty bites?
That's what my mother used to make me do.
That's a lot of cake on that plate.
Hey, Julie.
Go get Kristi.
Say hi, Kristi!
Hi.
Kristi's a little shy.
That's cute.
They love each other.
It's Grandma.
Happy, happy, happy birthday.
Never forget the day you were born.
I held you in my arms and you made me laugh and cry at the same time.
You were so cute.
Serious piece of equipment, so be careful.
How do you shoot those weddings with this thing?
- It must hurt your back.
- It's something...
You have to work certain parts of your...
I've only been here for a few months...
But thank you for welcoming me into your family.
I...
- I just...
I love you, and I love...
- Dennis, my shoulder.
...you so much.
Happy birthday.
- Okay, take this thing now.
- All right.
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God!
Katie, take it easy.
Take it easy.
It's dead.
You're a little monster.
- All right, all right, I got my camera.
- Here, let me help you, 'cause I don't...
- I want to see the tooth full throttle.
- Okay, all right.
This thing's coming out today.
- Is it okay if I push it a little?
- No, no, don't push it.
- Lower lip.
- Want some juice, babe?
- Down.
- Here.
Now...
- You want some of this?
- Yeah, orange juice.
That is...
That is a good one!
- All right.
- Let's see this.
Open up.
Don't push it with your tongue.
Let's see.
It's ready.
- I think it might be...
- It's ready.
You're gonna get a newjob as a dentist.
Thank you.
You think I'm good?
Wrap it in a tissue, put it in your pocket, and bring it home for...
- The Tooth Fairy.
- The Tooth Fairy, that's right.
And we'll put it under your pillow, tonight.
Wow.
You like the Tooth Fairy, right?
We love the Tooth Fairy.
Why does he need a bowl?
Because he wants to eat.
He's hungry?
Kristi, Toby isn't real.
- Hey.
It doesn't matter.
- Yes, he is.
My assistant Randy is currently 43 minutes late.
And this isn't the first time, he's always late.
So, today we're gonna play a little prank and see if we can teach him a lesson.
- Come on around the front door.
- Come on, just open the garage.
Randy, I need your help, man.
Come around the front door.
Okay, okay.
- Hey.
- Hey, man.
- Where were you?
What happened?
- Sorry I'm late.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.
- I got blocked in.
- I'm really sorry.
- That's all right, man.
I had a leak in the house.
I was hoping you'd get here sooner.
I had a leak in the ceiling here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Here, push this up here.
It didn't rain last night.
Hold this for a second.
I need your help.
It's been going like crazy.
And I don't know what to do,
- so I got that pole there.
- Why is it white?
- What?
- Why is it white?
I don't know.
I think it's maybe something with the paint on this.
Anyway, I gotta get some spackle.
I'll be back.
- Wait, you just want me to...
- Hang on.
- You want me to wait here and hold it?
- Thanks, Randy.
Wait, Dennis.
I'm just supposed to wait here?
Dennis.
Dennis!
- Hey.
- Okay, girls, that's far enough.
Hey.
No.
Why don't you come on in and hand me that ladder?
No.
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.
You know you don't have to listen to him.
He's not even your real dad.
Who wants to go jump on the trampoline?
- I do!
- Oh, come on.
- I have a new trick to show you.
- Okay.
Guys, come on.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.
- Ready for a surprise?
It better be a ladder.
We were playing outside.
What did we find, guys?
- A spider.
- Dennis.
- We've got a cute little spider.
- Dennis!
- Come on, man.
- Okay.
Yeah?
- Do it, do it, do it, do it!
- All right.
Run!
- It wasn't even a spider.
- That really hurt.
That really hurt.
- Hi.
- Big day today, right?
- Yep.
- What's today?
- Picture day.
- Picture day!
- Dennis, you're still in.
- Sorry.
- I was finishing my hair!
- This picture's for Grandma.
Smile.
All right!
- Okay...
- Kristi, come on!
Here it goes.
All right.
Cheese.
- Thanks, sweetheart.
- No, no, no.
Seriously, like...
- Randy?
- Yeah.
Where did you find this girl?
I don't know.
I didn't see her at all throughout any of the wedding...
- That's because I'm so happy...
- "So happy for you."
I love my job, man.
- I should've got her number.
- Probably could've.
Randy, this is great stuff.
I can't use any of this, but it's great.
Jule?
Julie?
There it goes again.
Hello?
Julie?
I like this song!
Not bad.
That's pretty good.
Teddy?
Did you fall down?
What was that?
- Hey.
- Hey.
What you doing?
Nothing.
I was just looking around.
What...
What...
You guys just get home?
Yeah.
- It was girls' day.
- I know.
How was it?
- Was it fun?
- Great.
You just really snuck up on me there.
All right.
It's time.
- Don't film this.
- Why not?
It's illegal.
Don't laugh.
We haven't even started smoking it, and you're already paranoid.
It's illegal.
What if my kids find me?
I'm a mother.
- Now relax.
- Seriously, Dennis.
Seriously, Julie.
Let's get really serious.
Seriously.
- Shut up.
- Let's be serious.
- All right.
- Real, real, real big, big...
That was big.
Julie, do the voice.
Dennis.
What voice?
This voice?
Dennis, I can't believe you're filming me smoke marijuana.
God, you're so beautiful.
Shut up.
I want to film us having sex.
Is that perverted?
- Is that weird?
- I don't know.
Was that a yes?
Okay.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Hey, there, pretty lady.
Stop.
I don't know.
You sure...
You sure you're up for this?
No.
You know what?
Don't answer that.
Hurry up, before I change my mind.
Okay, sorry.
All right.
What are you doing?
What was that?
It's porno music.
Great.
Classy.
Good start.
Good, right?
- All right.
- I don't know.
Relax.
Just relax.
Don't worry about it.
Hey.
- Yeah.
I'm okay.
- Relax.
- Yeah, what is that?
- I don't know.
It's an earthquake.
- Holy shit!
- Dennis, it's an earthquake!
The girls.
The girls!
Come on!
Dennis!
Dennis.
Oh, my God, I look so fat.
You don't look fat.
- Look at the size of me on top of you.
- You look beautiful.
You look like you can't breathe 'cause I'm sitting on top of you.
I want another shot at doing one of these.
- Watch this.
- Dennis, you have to erase this.
Julie, watch, watch, watch.
- See that?
- What?
Did you see that in the corner?
Yeah, I see, like, dust.
- Dirt falling.
- No, Julie.
There's something there.
- You are crazy.
- There was something there.
Wait, you can see something there.
It's very cute, but you're going a little crazy.
You're like one of those people that see things, like in their food.
Like when people think they see the Virgin Mary in their toast.
- That's you right now.
- That's hilarious.
This has to be erased and this has to be erased.
I'm sorry.
Or we're never having sex again.
I'm late.
I got to go.
Thanks for erasing both of them.
You know, you're going to regret saying that.
Doubt it.
I don't think you can go a day without having sex, personally.
Don't dare me.
- Erase it.
- I'm not going to erase it.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.
Dude, what are you doing, man?
You're always so late.
I know, it's my car!
I got the earthquake.
- Did you really?
- On tape.
It's scary, right?
Is that Julie?
It's nothing, it's nothing.
- We're going to...
- Is that a sex tape?
Yeah.
I got...
This weird thing happened after...
She let you make a sex tape?
Yeah, but it got interrupted by the earthquake.
I wouldn't have let anything interrupt that.
Relax, man, just relax.
Would you just stop?
- Let me slow-mo shuttle forward.
- Just shut up.
Check this out.
Ready?
All right, let me tweak the contrast here.
Okay.
I'm gonna take the color out.
It looks like dust is falling on something.
It looks like a figure, right?
- You see that?
- Yeah.
Did you catch that?
- Yeah, it moved.
- Did you see the dust move?
- It moved, right?
- What was that?
I don't know.
Check it out.
- It's weird, right?
- It's kind of weird.
You know, I've been hearing these noises in the girls' room lately.
I don't know.
I feel like it's...
Something weird's going on.
- Julie?
- Yeah, I'm back here.
Hey, I wanted to talk to you...
Dennis!
Sorry!
Sorry.
Oh, my God!
Sorry.
You mind if I set up a couple cameras around the house?
I'm not going to talk to you right now.
Okay, I'll...
I'll take that as a yes?
- I hate you!
- Okay.
Love you, too.
How long do the tapes last?
About six hours each.
So you have to change them every six hours?
Yes.
Katie, can you hop out of the frame?
- Okay.
Is that good?
- Yeah, so I can...
Keep going.
- Can I see it?
- Sure.
Here.
Come here.
See it?
Yeah.
Pretty cool, right?
So, what are you trying to see?
Anything unusual or strange.
Oh, no, it's not that.
Don't touch the camera.
- Kristi?
- Yeah?
Don't touch the camera or anything.
Katie, just leave it alone.
- Dennis.
- What?
Really?
Don't you think you're overreacting a little?
This is a new house.
It shouldn't be making these noises.
Not just in here.
It's in the girls' room, too.
No...
This is not gonna work here.
Like, what do you think you're gonna catch?
Whatever's in our house.
Right, 'cause there's something here watching us.
Well, there's definitely something.
I...
I feel it.
I feel something, I'm telling you.
Yeah, I feel something, too.
I'm not gonna lie.
I feel a camera.
The earthquake, and all those...
I don't know, stuff that's been happening and...
I don't know, I just...
No, it's totally normal.
Bye, camera.
Good night, camera.
Yeah?
Yeah, probably.
In their bedroom.
Be quiet, so we don't wake Katie up.
It's okay.
Why?
Yeah, kind of.
He's very sweet.
Yeah, I saw that.
I watched some of the tapes on the camera and I saw you talking to somebody late last night.
If you saw me talking to somebody, it would be Toby.
Toby's your friend?
Yes.
He's my friend.
Yeah, what do you guys talk about?
Secrets.
He's big?
So, is he old, like Grandma, or is he young, like you?
He's old, like Grandma.
And what does he look like?
Is he tall?
Is he fat?
He's tall.
He's tall.
Don't call him fat.
Kristi, when you say that if you tell one of your secrets that you'll be in trouble with Toby, what does that mean?
Well, I won't be safe.
He's gonna...
Did he say he's gonna hurt you?
No.
But I won't be safe.
That means, I will be, like...
Be in very, very big trouble.
Big trouble.
- You saw her.
- That's how it is.
It was like he was actually there, right?
I know.
Because that's how active kids' imaginations are.
It's crazy.
I mean, imagination is one thing.
She got up in the middle of the night.
I mean, it's a little odd that she got up in the middle...
You haven't been around kids for that long.
They do weird things.
They...
Katie used to get up in the middle of the night and she used to sleep on the toilet.
What?
Okay?
I'm serious.
Really?
Yes.
Toby is a phase and he's going to be gone in a couple weeks.
I know it.
How many hours of footage do you have?
This is the job, man.
I got two cameras, six hours each.
Twelve hours.
- Twelve hours of footage?
- Yeah.
Got to do it, man.
- I'm seriously gonna review it.
- ...of footage every day.
Yes.
Now, please, I'm trying to concentrate.
That's so stupid.
There's only 24 hours in a day, Dennis.
- Hey, Julie.
- ...going?
Good.
You want to step into my office and do some work with me or...
No.
You find anything?
Yes, actually.
We did find something.
We found that your family sleeps all night.
Very funny, Randy.
- Keep up the good work.
- Okay.
I love you with all of my heart and soul.
I love you, too.
It should either be called Back to the Past...
Present.
Back to the Present.
- No, no.
- End of story.
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It makes total sense.
Let's Get Back to the Present, maybe.
But Back to the Past...
Back to the Present.
- You hear that?
- Yeah.
- Was that...
That's it.
- What the hell?
It's happening again.
Come on.
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.
It's in your closet.
Are you getting that?
Open it.
- Are you getting it?
- Yeah, I'm gettin' it.
Holy shit!
Holy shit!
That's not funny.
- Oh, my God.
You're both crazy.
- I got you guys so bad.
- I got you.
- You're both crazy.
I got you good.
I got you, too.
Are you okay?
Just go ahead and take your crap right there, 'cause I nearly crapped my pants.
Holy fuck!
You almost gave me a heart attack.
Oh, my God, get away!
- Get away from me.
- Are you okay?
Get away.
I hate you.
Wow.
Look at that tent.
Gosh.
I like this tent.
"...and disguised his voice to sound like Little Red Riding Hood.
"The poor old woman, before she could even scream, the wolf gobbled her up."
Hello.
Hey, guys.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- Good.
- That's a little bright.
I'm sorry.
- Guys?
I got you a little...
- Give it to me.
Hey, guys.
Don't tell Mom, okay?
- Okay.
- All right.
What are you guys doing?
You'll see.
We've got a little surprise for you.
- One, two, three!
- ...two, three!
Come here.
Here, tickle torture, tickle torture, tickle torture!
That's enough.
You guys are locked in the dungeon.
All right.
Good night, girls.
I love you.
- Love you, Dennis.
- Love you.
Dennis.
Dennis.
- What?
- Listen.
What?
I think the girls came inside.
I'll go check on them.
I got it.
Girls?
Dennis.
Dennis?
Don't do that to me.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- You scared me.
Did you check on them?
Why is this door locked?
Did you lock this?
What's the matter?
We're just checking on you guys.
Move that light.
We're gonna move inside, okay?
- I want to stay here.
- Why?
I'm sorry.
It's gonna be fun inside, too, though.
Come on.
Get your stuff.
We're gonna camp inside.
- Mommy.
Why?
- What?
Dennis, will you film me?
- Yep.
- I wanna show you something.
You know Spud Webb?
One, two, three, slam dunk!
Very impressive.
Very good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Katie, are you sure you didn't sneak into the house last night?
My gosh, I pinky swear,
- I did not go into the house.
- Okay.
You wanna do me a favor?
Can you tell your mom that?
Where's Dennis?
He's out, buying more tapes.
With your credit card?
Mom.
He doesn't have any money.
That is not true.
The girls love him.
I mean, they just about think he's the coolest guy ever.
I mean, I really, really do like him.
I mean that.
It's just that the girls miss their father.
I don't know.
I wish he were a little more financially secure.
He is financially secure, Mom.
He has a job.
- He shoots wedding videos.
- No.
That's...
No.
He has his own business.
You know?
It's a whole different thing.
My God, Mom.
I just told you,
I don't want to have any more kids.
I'm not gonna get pregnant.
You always said you wanted a big family.
I changed my mind, okay?
I have two beautiful girls.
You always wanted a son.
I'm happy with the way things are.
Let's go.
What the...
Fuck.
This is great.
Hang on.
That's great!
Katie, that's great.
You're doing really good.
- Thank you.
- Let her go, Jule.
Dennis, I totally believe in this shit.
Randy, watch the language.
All right, nice and slow.
My brother saw one once.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What's Bloody Mary?
You don't know what Bloody Mary is?
It's where you go in the bathroom and you say "Bloody Mary" three times in the mirror and then you see a ghost.
Dennis, I wanna play Bloody Mary.
Nothing, don't worry.
It's okay.
You say Bloody Mary three times.
I want to play!
I want to see a ghost.
I'm just saying you're missing half of the stuff in the house without cameras down there.
I know.
You don't have to tell me.
Like put it up in the corner, like, rack it up in the corner or something?
It just doesn't work.
It just...
It's not a wide enough angle.
And I don't even...
They don't even make lenses that wide.
Mirrors.
You could use mirrors.
- This thing is so cool.
- Pretty cool, right?
It's awesome.
Wow!
Look, you got it balanced out and everything, too.
What is that?
I got to work out some kinks.
Oh, man.
- Hi.
- Hey.
What is that?
Check it out.
My new thing.
- It's pretty cool, right?
- Yeah.
- What...
What is it?
- I took your fan...
And basically, took apart...
Basically, the oscillator on your fan allows me to see both in the living room and in the kitchen.
Cool.
Wait, what?
You broke my fan?
I can put it back together.
Okay, MacGyver.
It's cool, right?
This way I can...
Kristi, what are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Go back to bed.
It's really late.
Hey, babe, what are you doing up here?
Painting.
Don't you want to play outside?
Not really.
How about your friend Toby?
Do you still talk to him?
Yeah.
Did he wake you up?
No.
Did he tell you to come downstairs?
No.
You know you can tell me, right?
He told me not to talk about it.
Why don't you just ask him yourself?
He's standing right next to you.
I don't see him.
He's there.
Hey, thanks for getting these, man.
Yeah, of course.
- This is good stuff.
- Thanks.
- Randy...
- Yeah?
Did you check this out?
No, I don't have a library card.
You stole these?
I didn't steal them, Dennis.
You told me to get the books, I got you the books.
It's what a library is.
It's for borrowing.
That's what "library" means in Spanish...
It means, "Borrow book store."
Malevolent Entities.
What is this one?
I don't know.
I looked through it for a second.
It had some creepy pictures...
This stuff is creepy.
Hey.
It's your sister and her friends.
Is that a joke?
What, was that supposed to be funny?
Playing field hockey.
Says, "Kids are susceptible to spiritual contact."
Okay.
And?
Well, the whole thing with Kristi and her imaginary friend.
Remember, I was telling you the crazy stuff started happening only when she started talking to her imaginary friend.
I mean, it must want something.
That's what...
You know, that's what the book says.
They don't just stick around for no reason.
It wants something.
What does it want?
Well, the book says it feeds off of your fear.
Hey, Kristi.
- Kristi.
- Yeah?
- Wanna play a game?
- Sure.
Here.
What are you doing?
- Playing with my soccer ball?
- Yeah.
Kristi, that's mine.
Kristi!
Kristi, come on.
Kristi, come help me.
What are we doing?
- We're gonna play Bloody Mary.
- Why?
Because I wanna try to catch the ghost.
Okay.
I think it's on.
So, how you play is you say "Bloody Mary" three times into the mirror and then her dead body's supposed to appear
- in the mirror and try to kill you.
- Stop!
Stop!
Stop, Katie.
So, now what do we do?
We have to say "Bloody Mary".
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Bloody Mary.
- Kristi, I said three times, not four.
- Sorry.
- I'm scared, Katie.
- We have to be quiet.
- Guys...
- My gosh, Mom!
You scared me.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
We're just playing a game.
Okay.
Grandma just got here.
Go say hi.
- You moved his camera?
- Yeah.
- Is it taping?
- I'll pick it up, I promise.
Yeah.
We gotta move it before he comes home 'cause he's gonna be mad.
- You guys wanna go to the pool?
- Yeah.
You wanna go to the pool, Grandma?
God damn it.
- Mom?
- Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
Holy shit.
Mommy, what happened?
- Stay upstairs.
Stay upstairs.
- What happened?
Don't come down here.
- There's glass on the floor.
Stay there.
- Are you hurt?
I have no idea, I have no idea.
Looks fine, right?
It didn't even break.
That's good.
- What happened?
- It just fell.
I didn't...
What do you mean, what happened?
I was in there.
- Hi, Kristi.
- Hey.
- Say hi to the camera.
- Hey.
- Can I join you guys?
- Sure.
- I can?
- Yeah.
Okay, great.
I'm gonna set my camera here, okay?
- Okay.
- Just keep it out of the way.
Wait.
Why are you filming this?
It's just like, I'm testing out my, like, new camera and, you know, no reason.
Don't sit there.
That's Toby's spot.
Sorry.
Is Toby sitting there right now?
Okay.
Sorry.
Sorry, Toby.
Does Teddy need help with his tea?
He looks thirsty.
- Yeah.
- Here you go, Teddy.
Here.
He can't reach 'em.
Okay.
Wow.
He was thirsty.
See, I told you.
And she keeps falling.
Poke.
So, Kristi, what was the last thing that Toby said to you?
Like...
- Anything?
- Yeah.
- No?
- Secrets.
Secrets.
Regular stuff.
In her sink?
Yeah.
Sorry.
That...
Did you...
Did you...
Did he say something just now?
No, I just put my hand on him.
And he didn't like that.
He doesn't like that, when you...
No.
Sorry, Toby.
It was a mistake, right?
Yeah.
- What?
- Nothing.
- What?
- Never mind.
- What were you gonna say?
- Nothing.
It's okay, you can tell me.
Kristi, why is Dennis's camera here?
Because me and Toby were having a little tea party and he was filming us.
- I'm not!
- Yes, you are, Kristi.
Only babies have imaginary friends.
He is real.
Hey, Kristi!
Kristi's such a baby!
Baby!
Katie, stop it!
Well, you're being a baby!
Only babies have imaginary friends.
No, I'm not!
He's right in there.
In there?
Toby, come out!
Toby, come out!
Toby!
Okay, I'm gonna go in.
Katie, you shouldn't do that.
Katie!
Don't go in there.
- You shouldn't do that.
- Well, I am.
Toby, come out.
Toby...
Katie.
Kristi!
What are you doing?
Open the door!
You shouldn't do that.
Kristi, open this door!
- It's not me!
- Kristi!
- Girls!
- Open the door!
- What is this yelling?
What is going on?
- I'm not doing that.
Stop fighting right this second.
Why's Dennis's camera on the floor?
She locked me in there.
- Katie, you can't touch his stuff.
- Kristi, why...
Stop fighting right this second.
- Mom, she locked me in there!
- I don't want to hear it.
- Come on, come on.
- Then who locked me in there?
Toby did.
Yeah, like Toby locked me in there.
She's gonna be here any minute.
See?
There she is.
Mommy, Lisa's here!
Okay!
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi!
How are you?
Good.
- I wanna show you something upstairs.
- Hi, Lisa.
Wait, what are you showing me?
I got some new beads for my birthday.
Beads!
Let's see 'em.
Hi, Kristi.
How are you?
Hey.
What's that?
Don't mind this.
You know Dennis and his cameras, he just puts them...
Just ignore it.
8:30 bedtime?
No, no, no, 10:00.
- 8:30.
Nice try.
- Mommy, please.
9:30?
- 9:00.
- 9:45.
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, guys.
Love you.
Look, it made a triangle.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- Good night, girls!
- Good night.
- See you later.
- Bye, Julie.
Bye, Dennis.
Are you tired?
- Not really.
- No?
Can you tell us a story?
Sure.
What kind of story?
A ghost story.
Ghost story?
With a ghost.
Okay, let's think.
I'm a ghost!
Hello, Dennis!
You found the ghost.
Comin' to get you.
Got you!
- Good night, Lisa.
- Good night, sweetie.
Hi, Dennis.
- Hi.
- Hey!
Hi!
- How'd it go?
- Fine, it was good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, they were great.
The girls were...
Give you any trouble, or...
No, no, no, no, it was good.
But my mom's meeting me, so if I could just...
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, give her some money.
Here you go.
Thank you.
You're sure everything was good?
Yeah, no.
Thank you, guys.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Okay, bye.
Thanks.
I don't know.
- That was weird.
- Yeah.
It's so high.
Promise?
Okay.
What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Why are you up?
Why are you up?
Nothing.
Kristi, go to bed.
It's late.
- Is that the babysitter?
- Yeah, that's Lisa.
How come I never met her?
I'll put in a good word.
- See the sheet?
- Yeah.
Watch this.
- Gone.
- Holy fuck.
Am I...
Am I right?
Holy...
- Did you see that?
- ...fuck!
I'm not crazy, right?
I'm not crazy.
That just happened.
Holy!
What the fuck is that?
I don't know.
- What is that?
- I don't know.
I'm telling you, it's...
And she didn't say anything at all?
She left the room, like...
Did you show Julie?
No, man.
What, are you kidding?
She would flip out.
She would go nuts, and, you know, she'd make me take the cameras down, and I can't do that.
I really want to figure out what this thing wants.
Got to keep taping this shit, though, man.
I know.
I am.
- You got to keep taping this shit.
- I know.
She got blown in the face.
Yeah, yeah.
No.
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
I'm going to bed.
What the...
What the fuck?
Hey, how's she feeling?
We need to go to the doctor 'cause she's burning up.
Oh, no.
- Yeah, she's really...
- She's really that bad?
- Yeah, it's bad.
- All right.
It's like, I've taken it a couple times.
Do you want me to go with you or...
Well, I mean, I don't know.
Who's gonna watch Katie?
I can call Randy.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, hey.
- Thanks for coming over.
- No problemo.
- Hi, Randy.
- Hi!
Randy, thank you so much.
We're gonna be at the hospital for a little bit.
Okay.
Anything you guys want...
- I know where everything is.
- Okay, great.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Bye!
Love you.
Bye, Kristi!
You have everything?
You have papers and insurance?
Yeah, I have it.
- Thanks a lot.
- Love you.
Bye.
- I'll lock the door.
- Okay, thanks.
- Thanks again.
- I'll lock it.
All right, be good, Katie.
See you.
- Hey, hey.
- Hi.
So what's wrong with Kristi?
It's like a really high fever or something like that.
Is it contagious?
I don't think so.
I haven't gotten sick.
Okay, good.
What do you want to do?
Can we play Bloody Mary?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Seriously?
I really don't think this is a good idea, Katie.
You made a promise.
You have to do it.
- Can't we just play, like, doll house...
- Get the camera!
...or somethin'?
Sorry, Dennis.
Not my idea.
Come on.
I'm comin', I'm comin'.
So you say, "Bloody Mary" three times.
And then you wait a little bit and then you turn the lights back on and then you're supposed to see her body in the mirror and she's gonna try to kill you.
Try and kill you.
Good game.
Yep.
I don't know why you wanna play this.
One of us is gonna be dead by the end of it.
I guess it's a one-time game.
Okay, let's do it.
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Randy!
Nothing happened.
You turned the light on too soon.
Come on, Katie.
This is stupid.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You can't leave!
Let's just go play doll house or something.
No, you didn't do it right.
What did I not do right?
You need to keep the light off longer.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
You wanna play Bloody Mary?
- Let's play Bloody Mary.
- Okay, ready?
You're not gonna see anybody play Bloody Mary like I'm about to play Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Okay, can I turn it on now?
- Quiet.
- Sorry.
Sorry.
How about now?
Wait, wait.
- What?
- Did you hear that?
What was that?
I know.
I heard it, too.
Holy shit!
- Oh, my...
- Are you okay?
Huh?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
- Does it hurt?
- No.
I just scratched myself or something.
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
It's okay.
Nothing...
Close the door.
It's okay.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's okay.
I don't want to die!
Randy, I'm scared!
Holy shit!
It's okay!
Randy, I'm scared!
Holy fuck!
You okay?
You okay?
Oh, my God.
It's all right.
Dear God.
Please, God.
Please, God, be with me.
It's okay!
It's okay!
I don't want to play this.
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Stay here.
I don't wanna play anymore.
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
Holy fuck!
Okay.
- Nothing happened.
- You okay?
Nothing.
You're fine.
- I wanna get out of here.
- It's okay, all right.
We're gonna get out of here.
Come on, Randy!
Come on, Randy!
Stay here.
Dear Lord, be with me, please, be with me.
- Randy, I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.
- It's okay.
- Come here, come here.
- I'm sorry!
It's okay.
Huh?
- Please, please, don't tell.
- It's okay, it's just like an earthquake.
I'm not gonna tell.
I'm not gonna tell.
It's all right.
It's okay.
I wanna go downstairs!
Yeah, let's go downstairs.
Fuck.
Randy, Randy, where are you going, man?
Relax.
Randy, Randy, take it easy.
Randy.
What...
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm getting all my stuff.
What...
What are you getting your stuff for, man?
- Relax.
Sit down.
- Dennis.
Get the camera out of my face.
I told you, I felt something in the room with us and then I felt a claw dig into my side, okay?
Okay, okay.
When you say "something..."
Great interview.
- No, Dennis, I'm done.
Fuck.
- When you say...
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home!
Look at the fuckin' books.
This isn't, you know,
Casper, the fuckin' friendly ghost you're chasing, man.
- I'm sorry you got hurt.
- This thing is dangerous!
- I'm sorry you got hurt, okay?
- Jesus fucking Christ!
I'm sorry, but...
What are you gonna do?
You're just gonna quit?
You're acting ridiculous.
Relax!
Dennis, no, you're acting ridiculous if you're not gonna get the fuck out.
You have to tell Julie, okay?
Just watch the fucking tape, Dennis!
- What's up?
- Hey.
What?
I need to talk to you.
- Okay.
- All right, sit down.
Here.
Sit down, Jule.
Okay, where do I begin?
...from the '30s.
Look at the necklaces.
That's crazy.
Yeah?
It's the same symbol.
Isn't that the same symbol from the girls' room?
All right?
These...
These women, they were...
- Oh, my God.
- ...part of a coven.
You're really something.
I...
I...
I really need to...
To tell you this, okay?
Kristi!
You'd better run!
You sound crazy.
Do you know that?
Hang on a second, all right?
Do you know how crazy you're starting to sound?
Would you just give me a second to explain?
They would have these ceremonies and they would wait till the girls were old enough to get pregnant and then they would...
They would...
They would take their sons.
Right.
And then they would brainwash them and they didn't remember a thing.
That explains it.
Dennis, I'm not listening to...
Mom?
- I need to show you something.
- It's all you do!
There's shit...
You don't even spend any time with us anymore.
You just sit here and play with this shit all day long.
- Could you just wait one second?
- It's like you're obsessed!
Just wait one second.
I need to show you this, okay?
No, I can't.
I can't wait.
- No, no, no...
- I can't wait!
I can't!
- Why not?
- Because...
Because Kristi's upset all the time...
- Mommy?
- What the fuck?
I don't...
What?
What?
What?
Toby pulled my hair.
- What happened?
- Who?
Toby pulled my hair.
This is your fault.
Okay?
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
Hey...
I didn't...
No more cameras.
No more ghosts.
This ends tomorrow.
Julie, I...
You gotta watch the fucking tape.
Kristi.
Wake up!
Katie, go back to sleep.
What was that?
What's happening?
Kristi!
Toby's here.
I'm scared!
Mom!
Mommy!
- Mommy!
- Stop screaming!
It's okay!
Just ignore it!
Just ignore it!
Mom!
Kristi!
Kristi, help me!
Kristi!
Please...
Please...
Please help me!
Katie!
Let her go!
Let her go!
Toby, stop!
Stop, Toby!
I'll do it.
Just let her go!
I'm scared.
I want Mommy!
...to Grandma's house.
No, we're not going to Grandma's house, okay?
Why?
We're not going to Grandma's because there's no Toby, sweetie.
- Yes, there...
- There's no Toby and there's no ghost.
Hey, don't run away from me.
Hey.
There's no ghost and that's the end of it.
I don't want to hear any more of this talk, okay?
Okay?
- What'd she say?
- She said no.
No.
No.
Mom, we're not coming over.
Okay?
We're staying right here.
Because I need to get things back to normal.
All right, Mom, I gotta go.
Someone's at the door, okay?
I'll call you back.
Yeah, okay.
Hello?
Weird.
Dennis!
Dennis!
Dennis, get the girls!
We're getting out of here!
Girls, wake up, we're here.
Wake up.
We're here.
Yay, we're here.
There's Grandma.
Mommy, I'm tired.
Go park by the garage.
Oh, God.
Are you okay?
- Come on.
- Let's go, guys.
Hi, honey.
Come on, go.
You go with your mom.
I've got your sister.
Come on.
Come on.
Mommy.
Sleepy girl is what she is.
Go on in the house.
I've got apple pie and I've got...
You want water, I know.
How're we doing?
Put the camera down and come and eat some pie.
- I'm fine.
- Come on.
It makes me feel better to do something.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Feel useful.
Are you okay?
- How's it going, kiddo?
- What is going on?
- Good.
- How you feeling?
...not talk about it right now.
We can talk about it when...
Just...
Let's just drop it.
- Hey, Kristi?
- What?
Don't touch the painting, okay?
It's okay, I'm not mad.
Do you like it?
What's the matter?
Kristi!
Come and get your pie!
Hey, guys.
What's going on?
You playing some dress-up?
Doesn't she make a beautiful bride?
- Very.
- Do you want to put this on her?
Beautiful.
Try that.
So, who's the lucky guy?
Toby.
Wait.
What did she say?
- Let's go.
It's bedtime, girls.
Let's go.
- Just having fun.
- Julie...
- Mom.
Come on.
I don't want to hear Toby's name ever again.
Okay?
Julie, it's just pretend.
That's it.
He's done.
He's not in our lives.
- He's real.
Toby is...
- Let's go.
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Kristi...
Can you take them to bed, please?
Let's go.
Come on, sweetheart.
Take Grandma's stuff off and let's go to bed.
Dennis and I are gonna be right next door, okay?
We're gonna leave a light on and everything, so you can find us, and everything's gonna be...
Gonna be fine, okay?
I love you so much.
Love you.
- Good night, guys.
- I love you so much.
When are you gonna stop taping us?
Not until this thing's over.
When's your mom gonna let us sleep in the same bed?
I can't stop thinking about it.
I can't.
I know.
Just close your eyes and try to get to sleep.
Come here.
We can share a pillow, too.
That's fine.
Julie.
Do you hear that?
Like cars?
- Sorry...
- It's my mom.
She's always up at night.
She can't sleep.
Oh, my God, she's so loud.
Do you want me to go check on her?
She's gonna wake the girls up.
I'll be right back.
Julie?
Julie!
Girls?
Julie?
Hey, Julie!
Hello?
What the fuck?
Julie?
Lois?
What?
What the fuck?
Julie!
What the fuck?
Fuck.
Oh, my God.
Julie!
Julie?
What's wrong?
Fuck.
Fuck.
Julie?
Get up.
Mommy?
Oh, Kristi!
No, Kristi!
- Dennis?
- Come here, come on.
Let's go, Kristi.
What happened to Mommy?
Is she okay?
Oh, shit.
Come here.
Go, go.
Dennis, I'm scared.
It's okay.
No, Kristi, don't talk.
Is Mommy okay?
Quiet, okay?
Be quiet.
Just don't, okay?
Just quiet, okay?
It's okay.
Kristi, please, please, be quiet.
I'm gonna go check, okay?
Stay here.
Come on, Kristi.
What was that?
We're gonna get out of here, okay?
Come on, let's go.
I'm scared.
We're gonna get out of here.
Up.
Okay.
We're gonna be okay.
I don't know.
Katie!
Katie, get away from there!
Kristi, listen to me, stay right here, okay?
Don't move, okay?
Katie?
Come on, Toby.
Let's get ready.
DANIEL:
You'll be spending a lot of time in here.
This is gonna be your room.
There's some kind of animal being de-liced or something.
Compression chamber.
That's your crib.
It's hermetically sealed.
And this is your paint color.
- What color is that, hon?
- KRISTI:
Jamaica Bay Blue.
Jamaica!
And there you are.
- Hi.
- Yes, hi.
And there's your dad, who's playing with his new toy instead of helping me paint.
- Sorry.
I can help.
- (SCOFFS)
- Yeah?
Come on.
- (CHUCKLES) If I wasn't...
If I wasn't filming I would help.
Go and get the other ladder.
Yeah, you should have a real ladder.
That's...
You know.
- (DOORBELL RINGS)
- All right, that's a...
- Who's that?
- Oh, it's my sister.
She's here to check out the nursery.
- Oh, Daniel, this is gorgeous.
- DANIEL:
Yeah?
This is so gorgeous.
I love it.
I love the blue.
I'm glad y'all went with that.
It's much better than the green.
- How are you feeling?
- All right.
You know, I think I'm okay.
- How is he?
- Oh, he's doing so good.
He's kicking and, like, swimming.
- I feel like he's swimming.
- Hey, little fella!
- What did you say?
- DANIEL:
It's Hunter.
- No!
Tyler.
It's Tyler.
- I like that.
- It's Tyler Hunter.
- It's... (LAUGHS)
I like...
I like both.
I don't wanna choose.
- I'm not gonna get into this.
- You have to.
Come on.
In preparation for the big move, I have a couple of boxes in my car that I would love to throw in your basement.
Please?
KATIE:
This is the last box.
DANIEL:
Really?
KATIE:
Probably.
- (DANIEL SIGHS)
- KATIE:
Oh, God!
DANIEL:
So, a little bit nervous?
No, I'm excited.
I spend all my time over at Micah's anyway.
DANIEL:
VHS?
That is old school.
- Do we have a VCR?
- DANIEL:
Uh...
I didn't even know you had this much stuff.
Somehow I ended up with it after Grandma Lois died.
I haven't even gone through it.
- How come you got it?
- I don't know.
You can have it.
Nobody ever gives me anything.
DANIEL:
So who's gonna get the top bunk?
- (KRISTI LAUGHING)
- KATIE:
We're not 12.
DANIEL:
We can get a VCR for free.
KRISTI:
You know, I don't remember these at all.
DANIEL:
You guys didn't go Beta, huh?
(KRISTI LAUGHS)
DANIEL:
That's fine, okay?
I'm just gonna tape over an old one.
Can you get Abby out of here, please?
She's gonna get cut on the glass!
We just got back and the whole place is pretty much destroyed.
Nothing seems to be actually missing.
It's just, everything's really...
That's what she's telling me.
Just make sure we document everything.
Don't touch anything.
DANIEL:
This is our basement.
I don't see anything really broken.
(SIGHS) I don't see that box of tapes that Katie brought over.
Looks like that's the only thing that's missing.
(STATIC CRACKLING)
DENNIS:
All right and there she is.
The mother of the birthday girl, my girlfriend...
JULIE:
Chocolate, chocolate, rainbow stuff.
- That is a good-looking cake.
- Which is exactly what she wanted.
Beautiful.
Just beautiful.
And you're beautiful.
I don't know how you do it.
- (ALL SINGING HAPPYBIRTHDAY)
- Ooh!
Are you okay?
Watch your backs!
JULIE:
Whoa!
Watch your hair.
Good job.
(ALL CHEERING)
DENNIS:
All right, and here's the birthday girl.
Oh, I found some.
DENNIS:
She looks pretty unhappy.
Something's going on.
We got the young one.
Under the trampoline.
LOIS:
Twenty bites and that's about all.
KATIE:
Twenty bites?
That's what my mother used to make me do.
JULIE:
That's a lot of cake on that plate.
DENNIS:
Hey, Julie.
Go get Kristi.
(PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
DENNIS:
Say hi, Kristi!
(SOFTLY) Hi.
(PEOPLE CHUCKLE)
DENNIS:
Kristi's a little shy.
Oh, that's cute.
They love each other.
It's Grandma.
Happy, happy, happy birthday.
(SINGS HAPPYBIRTHDAY)
Never forget the day you were born.
I held you in my arms and you made me laugh and cry at the same time.
You were so cute.
Serious piece of equipment, so be careful.
LOIS:
How do you shoot those weddings with this thing?
- It must hurt your back.
- Uh, it's something, uh...
You have to work certain parts of your...
I've only been here for a few months, um...
But thank you for welcoming me into your family.
Um, I...
- I just...
I love you, and I love...
- Dennis, my shoulder.
...you so much.
Happy birthday.
- LOIS:
Okay, take this thing now.
- All right.
DENNIS:
Whoa!
BOY:
Oh, my God!
(ALL LAUGHING)
DENNIS:
Katie, take it easy.
Take it easy.
It's dead.
You're a little monster.
DENNIS:
All right, all right, I got my camera.
Here, let me help you, 'cause I don't...
- I want to see the tooth full throttle.
- Okay, all right.
This thing's coming out today.
- Is it okay if I push it a little?
- No, no, don't push it.
DENNIS:
Lower lip.
JULIE:
Want some juice, babe?
DENNIS:
Down.
JULIE:
Here.
DENNIS:
Now...
Oooh!
JULIE:
You want some of this?
KATIE:
Yeah, orange juice.
DENNIS:
Oh!
That is...
That is a good one!
- DENNIS:
All right.
- Let's see this.
Open up.
Don't push it with your tongue.
Let's see.
- "Ah!"
- DENNIS:
Ooh, it's ready.
- I think it might be...
- DENNIS:
It's ready.
You're gonna get a newjob as a dentist.
JULIE:
Oh, thank you.
You think I'm good?
Wrap it in a tissue, put it in your pocket, and bring it home for...
- The Tooth Fairy.
- The Tooth Fairy, that's right.
And we'll put it under your pillow, tonight.
DENNIS:
Wow.
You like the Tooth Fairy, right?
We love the Tooth Fairy.
DENNIS:
Why does he need a bowl?
Because he wants to eat.
- DENNIS:
He's hungry?
- Mmm-hmm.
Kristi, Toby isn't real.
- JULIE:
Hey.
It doesn't matter.
- Yes, he is.
(WHISTLING)
My assistant Randy is currently 43 minutes late.
And this isn't the first time, he's always late.
So, today we're gonna play a little prank and see if we can teach him a lesson.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Come on around the front door.
RANDY:
Come on, just open the garage.
Randy, I need your help, man.
Come around the front door.
RANDY:
Okay, okay.
- Hey.
Whoa.
- Hey, man.
- Where were you?
What happened?
- Sorry I'm late.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.
- I got blocked in.
- I'm really sorry.
- That's all right, man.
I had a leak in the house.
I was hoping you'd get here sooner.
I had a leak in the ceiling here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Here, push this up here.
RANDY:
It didn't rain last night.
Hold this for a second.
I need your help.
It's been going like crazy.
And I don't know what to do,
- so I got that pole there.
- Why is it white?
- What?
- Why is it white?
I don't know.
I think it's maybe something with the paint on this.
Anyway, I gotta get some spackle.
I'll be back.
- Wait, you just want me to...
- Hang on.
- You want me to wait here and hold it?
- Thanks, Randy.
Wait, Dennis.
I'm just supposed to wait here?
Dennis.
Dennis!
- Hey.
- DENNIS:
Okay, girls, that's far enough.
Hey.
No.
Why don't you come on in and hand me that ladder?
KATIE:
No.
KRISTI:
Mmm-mmm.
- Are you serious?
- KATIE:
I'm serious.
You know you don't have to listen to him.
He's not even your real dad.
Who wants to go jump on the trampoline?
- GIRLS:
I do!
- Oh, come on.
KATIE:
I have a new trick to show you.
DENNIS:
Okay.
Guys, come on.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.
- DENNIS:
Ready for a surprise?
It better be a ladder.
We were playing outside.
What did we find, guys?
- GIRLS:
A spider.
- Dennis.
- We've got a cute little spider.
- Dennis!
- Come on, man.
- Okay.
Yeah?
- GIRLS:
Do it, do it, do it, do it!
- All right.
Run!
(GIRLS LAUGHING)
(DENNIS LAUGHING)
KATIE:
It wasn't even a spider.
RANDY:
That really hurt.
That really hurt.
(GIRLS SCREAMING)
- Hi.
- DENNIS:
Big day today, right?
- Yep.
- What's today?
- Picture day.
- Picture day!
- Dennis, you're still in.
- DENNIS:
Sorry.
- KATIE:
I was finishing my hair!
- This picture's for Grandma.
Smile.
(CAMERA CLICKS)
DENNIS:
All right!
- Okay...
- Kristi, come on!
DENNIS:
Here it goes.
All right.
- ALL:
Cheese.
- (CAMERA CLICKS)
(RANDY LAUGHING)
MAN:
Thanks, sweetheart.
WOMAN:
No, no, no.
Seriously, like...
- Randy?
- Yeah.
Where did you find this girl?
I don't know.
I didn't see her at all throughout any of the wedding... (BOTH LAUGHING)
- That's because I'm so happy...
- "So happy for you."
I love my job, man.
- I should've got her number.
- Probably could've.
Randy, this is great stuff.
I can't use any of this, but it's great.
(LAUGHING)
(CAMERA LENS WHIRRING)
(THUDDING)
DENNIS:
Jule?
(THUDDING CONTINUES)
Julie?
There it goes again.
DENNIS:
Hello?
Julie?
(RATTLING)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
TEDDY:
I like this song!
Not bad.
Mmm, that's pretty good.
Teddy?
Did you fall down?
(MUSIC STOPS)
(CREAKING)
DENNIS:
What was that?
(GASPS) Oh.
(DENNIS PANTING)
- Hey.
- Hey.
What you doing?
Nothing.
I was just looking around.
What...
What...
You guys just get home?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- It was girls' day.
- I know.
How was it?
- Was it fun?
- Great.
(CHUCKLES) You just really snuck up on me there.
(CHUCKLES)
DENNIS:
All right.
It's time.
- Don't film this.
- Why not?
It's illegal.
- (DENNIS LAUGHS)
- Don't laugh.
We haven't even started smoking it, and you're already paranoid.
It's illegal.
What if my kids find me?
I'm a mother.
- Now relax.
- Seriously, Dennis.
Seriously, Julie.
(MOCKING) Let's get really serious.
Seriously.
- Shut up.
- Let's be serious.
- All right.
- Real, real, real big, big...
Whoa.
That was big.
(COUGHING)
Julie, do the voice.
(IN FUNNY VOICE) Dennis.
- (IN FUNNY VOICE) What voice?
- (DENNIS LAUGHS)
This voice?
Dennis, I can't believe you're filming me smoke marijuana.
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)
DENNIS: (WHISPERING) God, you're so beautiful.
Shut up.
I want to film us having sex.
Is that perverted?
- Is that weird?
- I don't know.
Was that a yes?
Okay.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Hey, there, pretty lady.
- (CHUCKLES)
Oh, stop.
I don't know.
You sure...
You sure you're up for this?
No.
You know what?
Don't answer that.
Hurry up, before I change my mind.
Oh, okay, sorry.
- (CHUCKLES)
- All right.
(IMITATES GUITAR)
What are you doing?
What was that?
- It's porno music.
- (LAUGHS)
Great.
Classy.
Mmm.
Good start.
Good, right?
- All right.
- I don't know.
Mmm. (GROANING LUSTFULLY)
(CLATTERING IN DISTANCE)
(CLATTERING CONTINUES)
Relax.
Just relax.
Don't worry about it.
Hey.
- Yeah.
I'm okay.
- Relax.
(THUDDING)
- Yeah, what is that?
- I don't know.
Whoa!
(RUMBLING)
It's an earthquake.
- Holy shit!
- Dennis, it's an earthquake!
The girls.
The girls!
Come on!
Dennis!
(RUMBLING SUBSIDES)
JULIE:
Dennis.
Oh, my God, I look so fat.
DENNIS:
You don't look fat.
- Look at the size of me on top of you.
- You look beautiful.
You look like you can't breathe 'cause I'm sitting on top of you.
I want another shot at doing one of these.
- Watch this.
- Dennis, you have to erase this.
Julie, watch, watch, watch.
- See that?
- What?
Did you see that in the corner?
Yeah, I see, like, dust.
- Dirt falling.
- No, Julie.
There's something there.
- You are crazy.
- There was something there.
Wait, you can see something there.
It's very cute, but you're going a little crazy.
You're like one of those people that see things, like in their food.
Like when people think they see the Virgin Mary in their toast.
- That's you right now.
- Oh, that's hilarious.
This has to be erased and this has to be erased.
I'm sorry.
Or we're never having sex again.
I'm late.
I got to go.
Thanks for erasing both of them.
You know, you're going to regret saying that.
Doubt it.
I don't think you can go a day without having sex, personally.
(IN SING-SONG) Don't dare me.
- Erase it.
- I'm not going to erase it.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.
Dude, what are you doing, man?
You're always so late.
I know, it's my car!
I got the earthquake.
- Did you really?
- On tape.
It's scary, right?
Is that Julie?
It's nothing, it's nothing.
- We're going to...
- Is that a sex tape?
Yeah.
I got...
This weird thing happened after...
She let you make a sex tape?
Yeah, but it got interrupted by the earthquake.
I wouldn't have let anything interrupt that.
Relax, man, just relax.
Would you just stop?
- Let me slow-mo shuttle forward.
- Just shut up.
DENNIS:
Check this out.
Ready?
All right, let me tweak the contrast here.
Okay.
I'm gonna take the color out.
It looks like dust is falling on something.
It looks like a figure, right?
- You see that?
- Yeah.
Did you catch that?
- Yeah, it moved.
- Did you see the dust move?
- It moved, right?
- What was that?
I don't know.
Check it out.
- It's weird, right?
- It's kind of weird.
You know, I've been hearing these noises in the girls' room lately.
I don't know.
I feel like it's...
Something weird's going on.
- DENNIS:
Julie?
- Yeah, I'm back here.
Hey, um, I wanted to talk to you... (SHRIEKS) Dennis!
Oh, sorry!
Sorry.
Oh, my God!
(LAUGHS) Sorry.
You mind if I set up a couple cameras around the house?
I'm not going to talk to you right now.
Okay, I'll...
I'll take that as a yes?
- I hate you!
- Okay.
Love you, too.
KATIE:
How long do the tapes last?
DENNIS:
About six hours each.
So you have to change them every six hours?
Mmm, yes.
Katie, can you hop out of the frame?
- Okay.
Is that good?
- Yeah, so I can...
Keep going.
- KATIE:
Can I see it?
- Sure.
Here.
Come here.
See it?
Yeah.
- Pretty cool, right?
- Mmm-hmm.
So, what are you trying to see?
Uh, anything unusual or strange.
Oh, no, it's not that.
Don't touch the camera.
- Kristi?
- Yeah?
Don't touch the camera or anything.
Katie, just leave it alone.
(CLATTERING)
- Dennis.
- What?
Really?
Don't you think you're overreacting a little?
This is a new house.
It shouldn't be making these noises.
Not just in here.
It's in the girls' room, too.
No...
This is not gonna work here.
Like, what do you think you're gonna catch?
Whatever's in our house.
Oh, right, 'cause there's something here watching us.
Well, there's definitely something.
I...
I feel it.
I feel something, I'm telling you.
JULIE:
Yeah, I feel something, too.
I'm not gonna lie.
I feel a camera.
The earthquake, and all those...
I don't know, stuff that's been happening and...
I don't know, I just...
No, it's totally normal.
(SIGHS)
Bye, camera.
Good night, camera.
(KISSES)
(CREAKING)
(PATTERING)
Yeah?
Yeah, probably.
In their bedroom.
Be quiet, so we don't wake Katie up.
(WHISPERING) It's okay.
Why?
Oh.
Yeah, kind of.
He's very sweet.
Yeah, I saw that.
I watched some of the tapes on the camera and I saw you talking to somebody late last night.
If you saw me talking to somebody, it would be Toby.
(CHUCKLES) Toby's your friend?
Yes.
He's my friend.
Yeah, what do you guys talk about?
Mmm, secrets.
- He's big?
- Mmm-hmm.
So, is he old, like Grandma, or is he young, like you?
He's old, like Grandma.
And what does he look like?
Is he tall?
Is he fat?
He's tall.
He's tall.
Don't call him fat.
Kristi, when you say that if you tell one of your secrets that you'll be in trouble with Toby, what does that mean?
Well, I won't be safe.
He's gonna...
Did he say he's gonna hurt you?
No.
But I won't be safe.
That means, I will be, like...
Be in very, very big trouble.
Big trouble.
DENNIS:
You saw her.
JULIE:
That's how it is.
It was like he was actually there, right?
I know.
Because that's how active kids' imaginations are.
It's crazy.
I mean, imagination is one thing.
She got up in the middle of the night.
I mean, it's a little odd that she got up in the middle...
You haven't been around kids for that long.
They do weird things.
They...
Katie used to get up in the middle of the night and she used to sleep on the toilet.
(LAUGHING) What?
Okay?
I'm serious.
Really?
Yes.
Toby is a phase and he's going to be gone in a couple weeks.
I know it.
RANDY:
How many hours of footage do you have?
This is the job, man.
I got two cameras, six hours each.
Twelve hours.
- Twelve hours of footage?
- Yeah.
Got to do it, man.
- I'm seriously gonna review it.
- ...of footage every day.
Yes.
Now, please, I'm trying to concentrate.
That's so stupid.
There's only 24 hours in a day, Dennis.
- RANDY:
Hey, Julie.
- ...going?
DENNIS:
Um...
Good.
You want to step into my office and do some work with me or...
No.
You find anything?
RANDY:
Yes, actually.
We did find something.
We found that your family sleeps all night.
Oh!
Very funny, Randy.
- Keep up the good work.
- DENNIS:
Okay.
I love you with all of my heart and soul.
I love you, too.
It should either be called Back to the Past...
RANDY:
Present.
Back to the Present.
- No, no.
- End of story.
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It makes total sense.
Let's Get Back to the Present, maybe.
But Back to the Past...
- Back to the Present.
- (SIGHING)
(THUDDING)
- You hear that?
- Yeah.
(THUDDING CONTINUES)
- Was that...
That's it.
- What the hell?
It's happening again.
Come on.
(SHUSHING)
(CLATTERING)
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.
(METAL CLINKING)
RANDY: (WHISPERING) It's in your closet.
(KNOCKS)
- (WHISPERING) Are you getting that?
- Open it.
- Are you getting it?
- Yeah, I'm gettin' it.
- (ROARS) - (MEN SCREAM)
RANDY:
Holy shit!
(LAUGHING)
Holy shit!
That's not funny.
(IMITATES SHRIEKING)
- RANDY:
Oh, my God.
You're both crazy.
- I got you guys so bad.
- Oh, oh, I got you.
- RANDY:
You're both crazy.
I got you good.
I got you, too.
Are you okay?
Just go ahead and take your crap right there, 'cause I nearly crapped my pants.
Holy fuck!
You almost gave me a heart attack.
- Oh, my God, get away!
- (LAUGHING)
- Get away from me.
- Are you okay?
Get away.
I hate you.
(KRISTI AND KATIE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
DENNIS:
Wow.
Look at that tent.
Gosh.
I like this tent.
KATIE: "...and disguised his voice to sound like Little Red Riding Hood.
"The poor old woman, before she could even scream, the wolf gobbled her up."
Hello.
Shh.
Hey, guys.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- DENNIS:
Good.
- That's a little bright.
I'm sorry.
Guys?
I got you a little...
- Mmm!
- KATIE:
Give it to me.
Hey, guys.
Don't tell Mom, okay?
- BOTH:
Okay.
- All right.
What are you guys doing?
KATIE:
You'll see.
We've got a little surprise for you.
- One, two, three!
- ...two, three!
- Oh!
Ow!
Come here.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)
Here, tickle torture, tickle torture, tickle torture!
(ALL LAUGHING)
That's enough.
You guys are locked in the dungeon.
All right.
Good night, girls.
I love you.
- BOTH:
Love you, Dennis.
- Love you.

Dennis.
Dennis.
- What?
- Listen.
- What?
- Shh!
I think the girls came inside.
I'll go check on them.
I got it.
(SWITCH CLICKS)
Girls?
(SWITCH CLICKS)
Dennis.
Dennis?
(GASPS) Don't do that to me.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- You scared me.
Did you check on them?
Why is this door locked?
Did you lock this?
What's the matter?
JULIE:
We're just checking on you guys.
Move that light.
We're gonna move inside, okay?
- I want to stay here.
- Why?
I'm sorry.
It's gonna be fun inside, too, though.
Come on.
Get your stuff.
We're gonna camp inside.
- Mommy.
Why?
- What?
KATIE:
Dennis, will you film me?
- DENNIS:
Yep.
- I wanna show you something.
You know Spud Webb?
One, two, three, slam dunk!
- Whoo!
- Very impressive.
Very good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Katie, are you sure you didn't sneak into the house last night?
My gosh, I pinky swear,
- I did not go into the house.
- Okay.
You wanna do me a favor?
Can you tell your mom that?
LOIS:
Where's Dennis?
Uh, he's out, buying more tapes.
With your credit card?
Mom.
He doesn't have any money.
That is not true.
The girls love him.
I mean, they just about think he's the coolest guy ever.
I mean, I really, really do like him.
I mean that.
It's just that the girls miss their father.
I don't know.
I wish he were a little more financially secure.
He is financially secure, Mom.
He has a job.
- He shoots wedding videos.
- No.
That's...
No.
- He has his own business.
- (SIGHS)
You know?
It's a whole different thing.
My God, Mom.
I just told you,
I don't want to have any more kids.
I'm not gonna get pregnant.
You always said you wanted a big family.
I changed my mind, okay?
I have two beautiful girls.
- You always wanted a son.
- (SIGHS)
I'm happy with the way things are.
Let's go.
(CREAKING)
DENNIS:
What the...
Fuck.
(LOUD BANG)
DENNIS:
Oh, this is great.
Hang on.
That's great!
Katie, that's great.
You're doing really good.
- Thank you.
- Let her go, Jule.
RANDY:
Dennis, I totally believe in this shit.
DENNIS:
Randy, watch the language.
All right, nice and slow.
My brother saw one once.
- DENNIS:
Really?
- Yeah.
What's Bloody Mary?
You don't know what Bloody Mary is?
It's, uh, where you go in the bathroom and you say "Bloody Mary" three times in the mirror and then you see a ghost.
KATIE:
Dennis, I wanna play Bloody Mary.
DENNIS:
Nothing, don't worry.
Shh!
It's okay.
You say Bloody Mary three times.
Ooh, I want to play!
I want to see a ghost.
I'm just saying you're missing half of the stuff in the house without cameras down there.
DENNIS:
I know.
You don't have to tell me.
Like put it up in the corner, like, rack it up in the corner or something?
It just doesn't work.
It just...
It's not a wide enough angle.
And I don't even...
They don't even make lenses that wide.
- Mirrors.
- Hmm?
You could use mirrors.
- RANDY:
This thing is so cool.
- Pretty cool, right?
It's awesome.
Wow!
Look, you got it balanced out and everything, too.
- (CREAKING)
- Whoa.
What is that?
I got to work out some kinks.
(CHUCKLING) Oh, man.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
- JULIE:
Hi.
- Hey.
What is that?
Check it out.
My new thing.
- It's pretty cool, right?
- Yeah.
- What...
What is it?
- I took your fan...
And basically, took apart...
Basically, the oscillator on your fan allows me to see both in the living room and in the kitchen.
Cool.
Wait, what?
You broke my fan?
I can put it back together.
Okay, MacGyver.
- It's cool, right?
- Mmm-hmm.
This way I can... (SNORING)
(FOOTSTEPS PATTERING)
(CHAIR SCRAPES)
(GIGGLES)
(FAINT THUD)
(KRISTI GIGGLING)
Kristi, what are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Go back to bed.
It's really late.
Hey, babe, what are you doing up here?
Painting.
Don't you want to play outside?
Not really.
How about your friend Toby?
Do you still talk to him?
Yeah.
Did he wake you up?
Mmm, no.
Did he tell you to come downstairs?
No.
You know you can tell me, right?
He told me not to talk about it.
Why don't you just ask him yourself?
He's standing right next to you.
I don't see him.
He's there.
DENNIS:
Hey, thanks for getting these, man.
RANDY:
Yeah, of course.
- This is good stuff.
- Thanks.
- Randy...
- Yeah?
Did you check this out?
No, I don't have a library card.
You stole these?
I didn't steal them, Dennis.
You told me to get the books, I got you the books.
It's what a library is.
It's for borrowing.
That's what "library" means in Spanish...
It means, "Borrow book store."
Malevolent Entities.
What is this one?
Uh, I don't know.
I looked through it for a second.
It had some creepy pictures...
This stuff is creepy.
Oh, hey.
It's your sister and her friends.
Is that a joke?
What, was that supposed to be funny?
Playing field hockey.
Says, "Kids are susceptible to spiritual contact."
Okay.
And?
Well, the whole thing with Kristi and her imaginary friend.
Remember, I was telling you the crazy stuff started happening only when she started talking to her imaginary friend.
I mean, it must want something.
That's what...
You know, that's what the book says.
They don't just stick around for no reason.
It wants something.
What does it want?
Well, the book says it feeds off of your fear.
KATIE:
Hey, Kristi.
- Kristi.
- Yeah?
- Wanna play a game?
- Sure.
Here.
What are you doing?
- Playing with my soccer ball?
- Yeah.
Kristi, that's mine.
Kristi!
Kristi, come on.
Kristi, come help me.
What are we doing?
- We're gonna play Bloody Mary.
- Why?
Because I wanna try to catch the ghost.
Okay.
I think it's on.
So, how you play is you say "Bloody Mary" three times into the mirror and then her dead body's supposed to appear
- in the mirror and try to kill you.
- Stop!
Stop!
Stop, Katie.
KRISTI:
So, now what do we do?
Shh.
We have to say "Bloody Mary".
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
Bloody Mary.
- Kristi, I said three times, not four.
- Sorry.
- I'm scared, Katie.
- Shh!
We have to be quiet.
(BANGING)
JULIE:
Guys... (GASPS) My gosh, Mom!
You scared me.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
We're just playing a game.
Okay.
Grandma just got here.
Go say hi.
- You moved his camera?
- Yeah.
- Is it taping?
- I'll pick it up, I promise.
Yeah.
We gotta move it before he comes home 'cause he's gonna be mad.
- You guys wanna go to the pool?
- GIRLS:
Yeah.

You wanna go to the pool, Grandma?

DENNIS:
Are you okay?
Holy shit.
KATIE:
Mommy, what happened?
- Stay upstairs.
Stay upstairs.
- What happened?
Don't come down here.
- There's glass on the floor.
Stay there.
- KATIE:
Are you hurt?
(DENNIS TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
JULIE: (STUTTERING) I have no idea, I have no idea.
JULIE:
Looks fine, right?
It didn't even break.
That's good.
- DENNIS:
What happened?
- It just fell.
I didn't...
What do you mean, what happened?
I was in there.
- DENNIS:
Hi, Kristi.
- Hey.
- Say hi to the camera.
- Hey.
- Can I join you guys?
- Sure.
- Oh, I can?
- Yeah.
Okay, great.
I'm gonna set my camera here, okay?
- Okay.
- Just keep it out of the way.
Wait.
Why are you filming this?
Um, it's just like, I'm testing out my, like, new camera and, you know, no reason.
Don't sit there.
That's Toby's spot.
Oh, sorry.
Is Toby sitting there right now?
Okay.
Sorry.
Sorry, Toby.
- (GIGGLES) - (CHUCKLES)
Does Teddy need help with his tea?
He looks thirsty.
- Yeah.
- Here you go, Teddy.
Here.
He can't reach 'em.
Okay.
Wow.
He was thirsty.
See, I told you.
(BOTH CHUCKLING)
And she keeps falling.
Poke.
So, Kristi, what was the last thing that Toby said to you?
Oh, like...
- Anything?
- Yeah.
- No?
- Secrets.
Secrets.
Regular stuff.
Oh, in her sink?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Oh, that...
Did you, uh...
Did you...
Did he say something just now?
No, I just put my hand on him.
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
And he didn't like that.
He doesn't like that, when you...
- No.
- Oh.
Sorry, Toby.
It was a mistake, right?
Yeah. (GIGGLES)
- What?
- Nothing.
- What?
- Never mind.
- What were you gonna say?
- Nothing.
It's okay, you can tell me.
KATIE:
Kristi, why is Dennis's camera here?
Because me and Toby were having a little tea party and he was filming us.
- I'm not!
- Yes, you are, Kristi.
Only babies have imaginary friends.
He is real.
(IN SING-SONG) Hey, Kristi!
Kristi's such a baby!
Baby!
Katie, stop it!
Well, you're being a baby!
Only babies have imaginary friends.
No, I'm not!
He's right in there.
In there?
Toby, come out!
Toby, come out!
Toby!
Okay, I'm gonna go in.
Katie, you shouldn't do that.
Katie!
Don't go in there.
(EXCLAIMS DISMISSIVELY)
- You shouldn't do that.
- Well, I am.
Toby, come out.
Toby...
- (KATIE SCREAMS)
- Katie.
Kristi!
What are you doing?
- Open the door!
- (BANGING)
- (CONTINUES BANGING)
- You shouldn't do that.
Kristi, open this door!
- It's not me!
- Kristi!
- JULIE:
Girls!
- Open the door!
- What is this yelling?
What is going on?
- I'm not doing that.
JULIE:
Stop fighting right this second.
Why's Dennis's camera on the floor?
She locked me in there.
- Katie, you can't touch his stuff.
- Kristi, why...
Stop fighting right this second.
- Mom, she locked me in there!
- I don't want to hear it.
- Come on, come on.
- KATIE:
Then who locked me in there?
KRISTI:
Toby did.
Oh, yeah, like Toby locked me in there.
KATIE:
She's gonna be here any minute.

There she is.
Mommy, Lisa's here!
JULIE:
Okay!
KATIE:
Hi, Lisa.
LISA:
Hi!
How are you?
KATIE:
Good.
KATIE:
I wanna show you something upstairs.
JULIE:
Hi, Lisa.
Wait, what are you showing me?
I got some new beads for my birthday.
Beads!
Oh, let's see 'em.
Hi, Kristi.
How are you?
Hey.
What's that?
Oh, don't mind this.
You know Dennis and his cameras, he just puts them...
Just ignore it.
JULIE: 8:30 bedtime?
KATIE:
No, no, no, 10:00.

Nice try.

Can you tell us a story?
Hmm, sure.
What kind of story?
A ghost story.
Ghost story?
With a ghost.
Okay, um, let's think.
(LISA BOOING)
I'm a ghost!
Hello, Dennis!
You found the ghost.

The girls were...
Give you any trouble, or...
No, no, no, no, it was good.
Um...
But my mom's meeting me, so if I could just...
- Oh, oh, yeah, sure.
- Oh, yeah, give her some money.
Um, here you go.
Thank you.
You're sure everything was good?
Yeah, no.
Thank you, guys.

Nothing.
Kristi, go to bed.
It's late.

Yeah, that's Lisa.
How come I never met her?
I'll put in a good word.

That just happened.
Holy!
What the fuck is that?
I don't know.
- What is that?
- I don't know.
I'm telling you, it's...
And she didn't say anything at all?
She left the room, like...
Did you show Julie?
No, man.
What, are you kidding?
She would flip out.
She would go nuts, and, you know, she'd make me take the cameras down, and I can't do that.
I really want to figure out what this thing wants.
Got to keep taping this shit, though, man.
I know.
I am.
- You got to keep taping this shit.

She got blown in the face.
Yeah, yeah.

What the fuck?
Hey, how's she feeling?
We need to go to the doctor 'cause she's burning up.
Oh, no.
- Yeah, she's really...
- She's really that bad?
- Yeah, it's bad.
- All right.
It's like, I've taken it a couple times.
Do you want me to go with you or...
Well, I mean, I don't know.
Who's gonna watch Katie?
I can call Randy.

RANDY:
Hey, hey.
KATIE:
Hi.
So what's wrong with Kristi?
It's like a really high fever or something like that.
Oh.
Is it contagious?
I don't think so.
I haven't gotten sick.
Okay, good.
(CLEARS THROAT)
What do you want to do?
Can we play Bloody Mary?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Seriously?
I really don't think this is a good idea, Katie.
You made a promise.
You have to do it.
- Can't we just play, like, doll house...
- Get the camera!
...or somethin'?
(SIGHS) Sorry, Dennis.
Not my idea.
Come on.
I'm comin', I'm comin'.
(CLEARS THROAT) So you say, "Bloody Mary" three times.
- Mmm-hmm.
- And then you wait a little bit and then you turn the lights back on and then you're supposed to see her body in the mirror and she's gonna try to kill you.
Try and kill you.
Good game.
- Yep.
- (LAUGHS)
I don't know why you wanna play this.
One of us is gonna be dead by the end of it.
I guess it's a one-time game.
Okay, let's do it.
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
- Randy!
- (GASPS)
Nothing happened. (CHUCKLING)
You turned the light on too soon.
Oh, come on, Katie.
This is stupid.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You can't leave!
Let's just go play doll house or something.
No, you didn't do it right.
What did I not do right?
You need to keep the light off longer.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
You wanna play Bloody Mary?
- Let's play Bloody Mary.
- Okay, ready?
You're not gonna see anybody play Bloody Mary like I'm about to play Bloody Mary.
(RANDY CLEARS THROAT)
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.
(WHISPERING) Okay, can I turn it on now?

I'm not gonna tell.
I'm not gonna tell.

It's okay.
I wanna go downstairs!
Yeah, let's go downstairs.

DENNIS:
Randy, Randy, where are you going, man?
Relax.
Randy, Randy, take it easy.
Randy.
What...
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm getting all my stuff.
What...
What are you getting your stuff for, man?
- Relax.
Sit down.
- Dennis.
Get the camera out of my face.
I told you, I felt something in the room with us and then I felt a claw dig into my side, okay?
Okay, okay.
When you say "something..."
Great interview.
- No, Dennis, I'm done.
Fuck.
- When you say...
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home!
Look at the fuckin' books.
This isn't, you know,
Casper, the fuckin' friendly ghost you're chasing, man.
- I'm sorry you got hurt.
- This thing is dangerous!
- I'm sorry you got hurt, okay?
- Jesus fucking Christ!
I'm sorry, but...
What are you gonna do?
You're just gonna quit?
You're acting ridiculous.
Relax!
Dennis, no, you're acting ridiculous if you're not gonna get the fuck out.
You have to tell Julie, okay?
Just watch the fucking tape, Dennis!
- What's up?
- DENNIS:
Hey.
What?
Um... (SIGHS) I need to talk to you.
- Okay.
- All right, sit down.
Here.
Sit down, Jule.
Okay, where do I begin?
...from the '30s.
Look at the necklaces.
That's crazy.
Yeah?
It's the same symbol.
Isn't that the same symbol from the girls' room?
All right?
These...
These women, they were, um...
- Oh, my God.
- ...part of a coven.
You're really something.
I...
I...
I really need to...
To tell you this, okay?
KATIE:
Kristi!
You'd better run!
(THUDS)
You sound crazy.
Do you know that?
Hang on a second, all right?
Do you know how crazy you're starting to sound?
Would you just give me a second to explain?
They would have these ceremonies and they would wait till the girls were old enough to get pregnant and then they would...
They would...
They would take their sons.
Oh!
Oh, right.
And then they would brainwash them and they didn't remember a thing.
That explains it.
Dennis, I'm not listening to...
Mom?
(SHUDDERING)
(CREAKING)
(SCREAMING) Ow!
- I need to show you something.
- It's all you do!
There's shit...
You don't even spend any time with us anymore.
You just sit here and play with this shit all day long.
- Could you just wait one second?
- It's like you're obsessed!
Just wait one second.
I need to show you this, okay?
No, I can't.
I can't wait.
- No, no, no...
- I can't wait!
I can't!
- Why not?
- Because...
Because Kristi's upset all the time...
- Mommy?
(SOBBING)
- What the fuck?
I don't...
What?
What?
What?
Toby pulled my hair.
- What happened?
- Who?
Toby pulled my hair.
- (SOBBING)
- This is your fault.
Okay?
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
Hey...
I didn't... (KATIE SOBBING)
No more cameras.
No more ghosts.
This ends tomorrow.

She doesn't really mean it when she screams and calls me a...
Calls me something bad.
You realize that, right, Joakim?
Mom can get so mad that she doesn't know what she says.
But it always passes.
And you know mom loves you.
Very, very much, Joakim.
Listen, why don't you and I go to grandma's?
When we go home again, everything will be forgotten.
You want to do that?
Maybe Uncle Terje will be there.
Wouldn't that be fun?
And while we're down there, maybe we can drop by grandpa too.
Huh?
What do you say to that, Joakim?
Huh?
We can do that!
We can go to grandpa's!
Let's go to grandpa's first!
Wouldn't that be nice?
That would be nice.
That would be great.
NORWEGIAN COZY
You have to admit it's not that bad, Terje.
It's supposed to be soul!
She might as well have sung her tax return.
It sounds like she's singing with her...her vulva.
Her vagina.
I think it will be a hit.
Of course it will be a hit!
My point is...
Georg is proud of his girlfriend.
Say you like it, out of respect.
Lie.
For me.
To lighten the mood.
-Fine, mother.
-Thank you.
-Hello!
-Hi.
Hi there!
-Come on in.
-Thank you.
-Hi, Georg.
-Hi, Liv.
Nice to see you!
Hey.
How's it going?
But...
Where is Hege?
She says hi.
She's busy with PR work.
Promo tour, album release, signings...
She's real busy.
We have listened to her album and we all agree it will be a hit.
What did you think, Terje?
I think it will be a hit.
It will be a hit.
But...
What's even better is that we...
-Are you getting married?
-No.
I mean, who knows?
But we have just heard that...
I know you're supposed to wait three months, but...
-Are you serious?
-What takes three months?
-She's pregnant?
-Yes!
-I'm going to be a grandmother!
-Are we that old?
-And she's the mother?
-You bet.
-You're going to be an uncle!
-Are you sure you're the dad?
I thought your testicles didn't descend, or something.
-They work just fine, Terje.
-Really?
-So they just suddenly descended?
-Yup.
You looking for trouble?
Huh?
You want trouble?
Knock it off!
Stop it, Georg.
Stop it!
My lucky troll.
There you go.
This looks lovely!
I thought maybe...
I thought I'd drop by...
Grandpa, I guess you could call him.
Dad?
-Are you kidding?
-Nope.
Care to join me?
-Do you know how he is?
-I guess I'll find out.
Have you heard anything?
-I'm sure he'll be pleased.
-What makes you say that?
Come on.
Join me.
-Go with him, Terje.
-You go with him!
He doesn't want to see me, but I'm sure he'd love to see you.
-You think so?
-No!
No one would want this.
It's a nice thought, but no way!
It would be better if you both went.
No matter how bitter or crazy you are, you still love your children.
That may sound right, Liv, but it's bullshit.
It's scary how warm it is outside.
That climate change is grotesque.
"Grotesque"?
I thought coming out of the closet would loosen her up, but she's hopeless.
"Grotesque"?
Thanks for joining me.
I'm not joining you.
I just said that to get us out of there.
Let's go get a beer.
Unless you want to hear Liv preach more about love.
-Are you really going to dad's?
-Yes.
Come with me.
-Are you still afraid of him?
-Shouldn't I be?
Yes.
So why visit him?
Because I have good news.
-Don't you wonder how he's doing?
-No.
Fine.
See you later.
Georg!
Relax, Bente.
They're all grown up now.
-Why worry?
-They didn't even bring any wine.
I'm nothing but a pantry to them.
They behave like babies.
That's your punishment for having been straight.
The wheels on the bus go round and round...
Itsy bitsy spider climbed up the waterspout...
Hello?
Hello?
Dad?
Dad?
EVERYONE FEEDS THE FAT BOY
Are you here, dad?
It's me.
Georg.
Dad?
Dad?
Dad...
Dad!
Terje Broch-Hansen, your last book was about the culture of greed.
Your latest book is about indignation.
But apparently you have no publisher.
I don't need a publisher in the Internet age.
So much for Terje Broch-Hansen, who has gone from greed to indign...
This is Terje Broch-Hansen.
You omitted the whole point of the interview.
My flag project!
Of course I am.
I have the flag right here.
Whatever.
Fuck off!
Are you kidding?
Is that him?
He's gotten old.
Imagine if he doesn't wake up.
Beware, Georg!
His leather chair, the green couch, mom's trolls, the gnu...
It's all still there.
I found a whole box of your book.
-A whole box of Fat Boy?
-Yeah.
People say he's crazy, but it seems like everyone's crazy.
He was wearing his general's coat.
Right, your father...
He'll survive.
Dad has fallen down loads of staircases.
He drinks poison and eats trash, but never dies.
He's a cockroach.
-Hi.
-Hi.
I hoped you wouldn't have any more experiences like that.
I'll stay at Terje's tonight.
And Liv:
Just as dad, in his general's coat, ambushed Georg, he truly loved his son.
-He didn't know it was me.
-At least you have each other.
-What a fucking relief!
Bye.
First opportunity he gets, he attacks both of us.
Like when he referred to you saying we love our children.
You don't even have children.
-That's how I think it is.
-It isn't always.
He blames you for everything about his father.
-He blames me for being born!
-That was your fault, Bente.
I wanted a daughter.
-Who is this?
-Friends of mine.
Want to meet them?
-Have you become a nerd?
-Necessity is the mother of HTML.
-What are you doing there?
-Making fart noises with my armpit.
-I mean, with your mouth?
-What else?
Fart noises.
The ambulance personnel said, "Here comes Frank again."
-Do they call you?
-Not anymore.
-Who do they call?
-I don't know.
I know as little about him as you do.
Even horrible fathers can become goofy when they get grandkids.
-Goofy?
-You know, they become softer.
-You think dad will become goofy?
-I don't know.
-But I have to talk to him.
-About what?
-I have questions.
-This isn't the Disney Channel.
-What would you ask him?
-If he ever liked me.
I don't think he did.
But how can you not like your own child?
Our parents should never have met, Georg.
Dad married mom because the other lawyers had wives.
Period.
We should never have been born.
We went from nothing to nothing.
We're rotten fruit.
-How depressed are you, Terje?
-About average, I think.
-You seem to be cultivating it.
-I'm not at the gym running from it.
I do my best.
I just want to stay inside.
Outside I feel like a waste of space.
A waste of time.
A waste of air.
-Christ!
-The same goes for you.
All we do is pollute and take up space.
Don't you want to find a girlfriend?
-Raise a family?
-Yeah?
Aren't you listening to me?
Kids?
Never!
Our genes should stop right here.
That doesn't mean...
Hege seems like a...decent woman.
Good genes.
Lately things have been out of whack.
After she signed the album deal and lost 20 kg, I seem to make her sick.
Good morning.
I know.
But...
No, it could have been much worse.
Right.
What?
I'll do that.
Talk to you later.
OK.
Bye.
He broke his foot.
But he's been transferred to the psych ward.
OK.
-Gro asked me to drop by.
-To make you his legal guardian.
Just say no, Georg.
Careful how you treat the Norwegian flag!
-Have you become a Nationalist?
-I'm going to crap on it.
Check out this headline, Georg:
"Six Billion More In Oil Profits.
You Get Nothing."
-They sell indignation.
-That's what they want.
"They get everything, I get nothing."
I plan to make people truly indignant by crapping on their flags on-line.
My hope is to get enough viewers to live off the ad revenue.
-Get a grip.
-I'm serious!
I'm not kidding.
It's enough with one family member in the psych ward.
Go away!
You wanted to see me?
Georg!
Boy, have you gotten fat!
-You're bloated!
Good to see you.
-Long time no see.
You need to start exercising.
Do you smoke?
No...
-You wanted to see me?
-Your father is very sick.
-How much do you know?
Nothing?
-Nothing.
I diagnosed him to be of unsound mind.
So now he can do whatever he wants.
Schizophrenia.
-He has schizophrenia?
-Whatever it is, your father is nuts.
Alcohol and weak nerves is never a good combination.
He has delusions of grandeur...
but is highly intelligent...
He left a turd outside my house after I diagnosed him.
We can't hold him against his will.
We can declare him without legal capacity.
But my assistant's heart is with him.
When she heard you were back, it started beating.
-What?
-Her heart.
Thump-thump.
Henriette!
She's a great lady.
No nonsense.
Stop that, Gro.
It's embarrassing!
What do you want now?
Your slippers?
The paper?
This is Frank Broch-Hansen's eldest son.
Hi there.
-Henriette Astrup.
-Georg.
-I heard you met your father.
-Briefly.
And Miss Tactful here gave you an update?
Did she tell you about our provisional guardian plan?
-You know what a guardian does?
-Takes care of someone?
-I want you to take care of Frank.
-I don't think so.
Your brother would rather give birth through his penis.
Dad wouldn't want it.
He could be declared without legal capacity.
I thought that was for people with Down's.
-Down's is nothing compared to him.
-We can force him.
All you have to do is keep an eye on him.
Make sure he doesn't die.
Just call us when he starts deteriorating again.
It doesn't have to be that bad.
Read this.
Call me when you're done.
OK.
-Why do you care about him?
-We are obliged to care for him.
He's sweet, but you really should take over now.
He already has someone here.
-No, he doesn't have anyone.
-Sure he does.
It doesn't have to be that bad.
Maybe you'll get to know each other.
It could work.
And could you clean up his place before he goes home?
OK.
But then I have to get back to my girlfriend.
I thought you had broken up.
-No.
Why would you say that?
-Didn't you used to date Soul Hege?
I still am!
No, I don't know how those magazines work!
Give me Hege!
Was this your idea?
No?
Then let me talk to Hege!
Let me talk to Hege!
-Hi, Georg.
-Hi, honey.
How are you feeling?
-How are you feeling?
-Well, mom says hi.
I told her about us and the baby.
-Georg, can't you...
-I know it's early.
But I couldn't help it.
I've tried calling you so many times.
-I've noticed.
-What's going on?
-What do you mean?
-What's this magazine article about?
Let's not discuss it over the phone, Georg.
-When can we meet?
-Tomorrow.
We need to have a real talk.
Shit!
Southeastern News
There are a lot of good boy names.
We wrote down our favorites.
Then pulled one out of a hat.
-Joakim was the winner.
-Joakim is a nice name.
You'll be a great father.
Thanks for subscribing all these years.
I've thought a lot about you.
Especially whenever I wrote about your dad.
-You wrote about dad?
-I wondered if you knew it was him.
-Apparently not.
-No.
Now you've seen him for yourself.
This was your father.
And this.
Claimed He Owned Traffic Circle
This was your father.
And this.
Drunk Threatened Wine Seller
EVERYONE FEEDS THE FAT BOY
Everyone has given up on him.
And now he's become...
Darth Vader.
Fucking psycho Nazi!
He's in there somewhere.
It's been years since Frank came to the pub.
He used to start the best conversations.
He'd go off on great leaders, commanders, generals.
Then he simply stopped coming.
The rest of us stayed there and drank.
We were booze buddies, not real friends.
Right.
I'd love to know how he ended up like he did.
I spent half my life trying not to become like dad.
-Did you succeed?
-No.
But after dad died, I figured out a few things.
I had inherited my fear of becoming like my father.
He had also run from his father.
We both moved to different towns.
If I really wanted to break all ties with my dad, -
- I would have been at his deathbed.
-So you regret?
Daily.
But...
Even if your dad needs you now, little Joakim needs you more.
That's true.
I'd better go clean house.
Brilliant About Western Greed
"The New Weed"
Hey.
-Sorry.
-Holy shit!
-What are you doing here?
-I shouldn't be here.
I wanted to see how many of my books he had bought.
I found two more boxes.
-What's that about?
-Maybe he wanted to boost sales.
-Or help you financially.
-Or give them to his 400 friends.
Where have you been?
Trying to find out if he has any friends.
-What are you doing?
-He has no one!
If he died in here, no one would find him for a year!
How can I explain to my son that that's OK?
Families don't do that!
The hospital asked me to clean up in here before he comes back.
Care to help me?
You drew Hitler mustaches in his magazines.
"Georg, have you been drawing in my periodicals?"
"Beware!"
Wow!
Look at this.
Holy shit!
Do you think he kept it like this because he missed us?
Check this out!
Is that what you were up to?
It was so annoying...
Come out!
Hi.
-We were expecting you tomorrow.
-What are you doing here?
Do you remember attacking me?
I asked you a question.
Fuck this!
What do you expect to find here?
Money, hidden in my mattress?
-Or did your mother send you?
-No.
The hospital asked me to clean up before you came home.
Did they?
So, how are you doing?
There's nothing wrong with me.
I merely sprained my ankle.
Do you remember but only a drop of water.
I think that most plants...
All right, I'll...
I'll be leaving then.
Håkon Hensvold has 240 different species of waxflower....
Henriette told me you have been kicked out of your house.
You have failed in most of life's phases.
You can stay in the cellar apartment until your life gets back in order.
But then I want you out.
For Christ's sake, Terje!
It took seven shots.
I held myself for two days.
I can see that.
-What happened?
-You're both crazy.
-Welcome home.
-I didn't think you'd actually do it!
-Are you leaving?
-You shat in there!
-Come on, Georg!
-Don't you see who you resemble?
That's the opposite of mom and dad.
That keeps me balanced.
You look just like dad before he loses it.
I'm not losing it!
They've both lost it.
You're more like me, Georg.
He's more like Frank.
You call every Sunday.
Terje, never.
You were always empathetic, kind and considerate.
Hege said so, too.
She called you considerate.
Have you talked to her?
Of course.
That magazine article was a big misunderstanding.
She's all hormonal.
I'm seeing her tomorrow.
Solid, but boring at times
Respectable debut
Soul devoid of soul
Hi!
-Hey.
-Hi.
-Did you read it?
-Yeah.
A lot was positive.
Four 4s.
-Not those.
Did you read VG?
-One bad review, in a shitty paper.
It's true.
I've known it all along.
I've been exposed.
I have no soul.
Come here.
-How are you doing, Georg?
-Fine.
I met my father.
Yeah.
He's in pretty bad shape.
He wants me to stay and take care of him.
-Are you kidding?
-No.
Maybe that's a good idea?
You can't escape from him anyway.
I'm sure it's easy to find a day-care if we move here.
-What is he doing here?
-He's my manager.
I know.
Are you sleeping with him?
-No.
-You know what he's up to.
He's in love with you.
Does everything to keep me away.
He refused to give me your new phone number.
That's psycho!
I had to get a new number because of you.
You texted me to death.
-You sent hundreds of messages.
-Not hundreds...
You didn't respond.
What did I tell you after our last argument?
You're hormonal.
That happens when you're pregnant.
-You've broken up with me before.
-I meant it this time.
We've never been better.
With the pregnancy and all...
-I haven't been happy.
-When?
You haven't even noticed that I've had an awful year?
-But we've been good.
-No, we haven't.
-I've cried and been despondent.
-Even TV commercials make you cry.
What are you trying to say?
Want me to get a grip?
Fine.
Remember I said it's not you, it's me?
It is you, Georg.
I've tried to help, but you isolate yourself.
-No, I don't.
-You don't work, have no friends...
-I have you!
-But I don't know if I have you.
-I'm sitting right here.
-But do you really see me?
We had this conversation before you went off the pill.
And we agreed:
Two parents, not one!
It's too late to freak out.
You want Joakim to have divorced parents?
-Joakim?
-We drew names out of a hat!
-I wanted him to have two parents.
-What do you mean, "wanted"?
Has something happened, Hege?
Have you lost...
-Are you still pregnant, Hege?
-No.
Hege, why didn't you tell me?
What happened?
-I'm sorry, Georg.
-Christ, don't blame yourself.
I didn't want to, but you refused to listen to me.
You didn't...
Not without discussing it with me, Hege!
Was it your fault?
I had an abortion.
What?
You have killed Joakim!
Do you realize that?
-There.
-It was like it wasn't happening.
-It was...
-Unreal?
If you beat her up, and it felt real, then you should worry.
I've spent the last year in some sort of bubble.
I've tried to convince both you and your father that you aren't crazy.
Maybe a little chubby, but otherwise normal.
-Remember the toy drawer?
Want one?
-No way.
Hi.
How's your nose?
You have dad's entire history, right?
How old was he when he first started losing it?
Have you decided to stay?
Dear Joakim.
I am writing to you because -
- I have now reached the age where your grandfather started going crazy.
He is now utterly insane.
I have no idea who he is.
I don't want that to happen to you.
So I am going to tell you everything about me while I am still sane.
I hope I'll keep my sanity, so you and I can understand each other.
And I hope I will find someone who wants to be your mother.
So you can be born.
Instead I found a self-absorbed bitch who thinks she's Beyoncé.
How could I be so stupid, Joakim?
You should be glad she isn't your mother.
You'll have to live with my brother, unfortunately.
But I wish I could have given you a more jovial uncle.
Terje's head is so far up his ass I'm afraid he'll never get it out.
At best he is driven by a very late-blooming puberty.
At worst, he is nuts.
It flows through us.
And I'm sorry, Joakim, but your grandmother is a lesbian.
Maybe when you grow up, lesbian grandmothers will be normal?
I just hope she'll be happy.
This family doesn't really do happiness.
But that's the family you're going to inherit.
I tried to escape it.
We all tried to escape from each other.
-Hi.
-Hi.
We thought we could replace it with something new.
Growing up, you think you'll get more and more new friends.
And that's true for a while.
But you end up alone.
And all you have left, no matter what, is the family you were dealt.
I miss you, Joakim.
I can't wait till you get here.
Until then I plan on staying here.
I think this will be OK.
For once, I think I may be doing the right thing.
Subtitles:
Nick Norris
She doesn't really mean it when she screams and calls me a...
Calls me something bad.
You realize that, right, Joakim?
Mom can get so mad that she doesn't know what she says.
But it always passes.
And you know mom loves you.
Very, very much, Joakim.
Listen, why don't you and I go to grandma's?
When we go home again, everything will be forgotten.
You want to do that?
Maybe Uncle Terje will be there.
Wouldn't that be fun?
And while we're down there, maybe we can drop by grandpa too.
Huh?
What do you say to that, Joakim?
Huh?
We can do that!
We can go to grandpa's!
Let's go to grandpa's first!
Wouldn't that be nice?
That would be nice.
That would be great.
NORWEGIAN COZY
You have to admit it's not that bad, Terje.
It's supposed to be soul!
She might as well have sung her tax return.
It sounds like she's singing with her...her vulva.
Her vagina.
I think it will be a hit.
Of course it will be a hit!
My point is...
Georg is proud of his girlfriend.
Say you like it, out of respect.
Lie.
For me.
To lighten the mood.
-Fine, mother.
-Thank you.
-Hello!
-Hi.
Hi there!
-Come on in.
-Thank you.
-Hi, Georg.
-Hi, Liv.
Nice to see you!
Hey.
How's it going?
But...
Where is Hege?
She says hi.
She's busy with PR work.
Promo tour, album release, signings...
She's real busy.
We have listened to her album and we all agree it will be a hit.
What did you think, Terje?
I think it will be a hit.
It will be a hit.
But...
What's even better is that we...
-Are you getting married?
-No.
I mean, who knows?
But we have just heard that...
I know you're supposed to wait three months, but...
-Are you serious?
-What takes three months?
-She's pregnant?
-Yes!
-I'm going to be a grandmother!
-Are we that old?
-And she's the mother?
-You bet.
-You're going to be an uncle!
-Are you sure you're the dad?
I thought your testicles didn't descend, or something.
-They work just fine, Terje.
-Really?
-So they just suddenly descended?
-Yup.
You looking for trouble?
Huh?
You want trouble?
Knock it off!
Stop it, Georg.
Stop it!
My lucky troll.
There you go.
This looks lovely!
I thought maybe...
I thought I'd drop by...
Grandpa, I guess you could call him.
Dad?
-Are you kidding?
-Nope.
Care to join me?
-Do you know how he is?
-I guess I'll find out.
Have you heard anything?
-I'm sure he'll be pleased.
-What makes you say that?
Come on.
Join me.
-Go with him, Terje.
-You go with him!
He doesn't want to see me, but I'm sure he'd love to see you.
-You think so?
-No!
No one would want this.
It's a nice thought, but no way!
It would be better if you both went.
No matter how bitter or crazy you are, you still love your children.
That may sound right, Liv, but it's bullshit.

Go away!
You wanted to see me?

Boy, have you gotten fat!

We can declare him without legal capacity.
But my assistant's heart is with him.
When she heard you were back, it started beating.
-What?
-Her heart.
Thump-thump.
Henriette!
She's a great lady.
No nonsense.
Stop that, Gro.
It's embarrassing!
What do you want now?
Your slippers?
The paper?
This is Frank Broch-Hansen's eldest son.
Hi there.
-Henriette Astrup.
-Georg.
-I heard you met your father.
-Briefly.
And Miss Tactful here gave you an update?
Did she tell you about our provisional guardian plan?
-You know what a guardian does?
-Takes care of someone?
-I want you to take care of Frank.
-I don't think so.
Your brother would rather give birth through his penis.
Dad wouldn't want it.
He could be declared without legal capacity.
I thought that was for people with Down's.
-Down's is nothing compared to him.
-We can force him.
All you have to do is keep an eye on him.
Make sure he doesn't die.
Just call us when he starts deteriorating again.
It doesn't have to be that bad.
Read this.
Call me when you're done.
OK.
-Why do you care about him?
-We are obliged to care for him.
He's sweet, but you really should take over now.
He already has someone here.
-No, he doesn't have anyone.
-Sure he does.
It doesn't have to be that bad.
Maybe you'll get to know each other.
It could work.
And could you clean up his place before he goes home?
OK.
But then I have to get back to my girlfriend.
I thought you had broken up.
-No.
Why would you say that?
-Didn't you used to date Soul Hege?
I still am!
No, I don't know how those magazines work!
Give me Hege!
Was this your idea?
No?
Then let me talk to Hege!
Let me talk to Hege!
-Hi, Georg.
-Hi, honey.
How are you feeling?
-How are you feeling?
-Well, mom says hi.
I told her about us and the baby.
-Georg, can't you...
-I know it's early.
But I couldn't help it.
I've tried calling you so many times.
-I've noticed.
-What's going on?
-What do you mean?
-What's this magazine article about?
Let's not discuss it over the phone, Georg.
-When can we meet?
-Tomorrow.
We need to have a real talk.
Shit!
Southeastern News
There are a lot of good boy names.
We wrote down our favorites.
Then pulled one out of a hat.
-Joakim was the winner.
-Joakim is a nice name.
You'll be a great father.
Thanks for subscribing all these years.
I've thought a lot about you.
Especially whenever I wrote about your dad.
-You wrote about dad?
-I wondered if you knew it was him.
-Apparently not.
-No.
Now you've seen him for yourself.
This was your father.
And this.
Claimed He Owned Traffic Circle
This was your father.
And this.
Drunk Threatened Wine Seller
EVERYONE FEEDS THE FAT BOY
Everyone has given up on him.
And now he's become...
Darth Vader.
Fucking psycho Nazi!
He's in there somewhere.
It's been years since Frank came to the pub.
He used to start the best conversations.
He'd go off on great leaders, commanders, generals.
Then he simply stopped coming.
The rest of us stayed there and drank.
We were booze buddies, not real friends.
Right.
I'd love to know how he ended up like he did.
I spent half my life trying not to become like dad.
-Did you succeed?
-No.
But after dad died, I figured out a few things.
I had inherited my fear of becoming like my father.
He had also run from his father.
We both moved to different towns.
If I really wanted to break all ties with my dad, -
- I would have been at his deathbed.
-So you regret?
Daily.
But...
Even if your dad needs you now, little Joakim needs you more.
That's true.
I'd better go clean house.
Brilliant About Western Greed
"The New Weed"
Hey.
-Sorry.
-Holy shit!
-What are you doing here?
-I shouldn't be here.
I wanted to see how many of my books he had bought.
I found two more boxes.
-What's that about?
-Maybe he wanted to boost sales.
-Or help you financially.
-Or give them to his 400 friends.
Where have you been?
Trying to find out if he has any friends.
-What are you doing?
-He has no one!
If he died in here, no one would find him for a year!
How can I explain to my son that that's OK?
Families don't do that!
The hospital asked me to clean up in here before he comes back.
Care to help me?
You drew Hitler mustaches in his magazines.
"Georg, have you been drawing in my periodicals?"
"Beware!"
Wow!
Look at this.
Holy shit!
Do you think he kept it like this because he missed us?
Check this out!
Is that what you were up to?
It was so annoying...
Come out!
Hi.
-We were expecting you tomorrow.
-What are you doing here?
Do you remember attacking me?
I asked you a question.
Fuck this!
What do you expect to find here?
Money, hidden in my mattress?
-Or did your mother send you?
-No.
The hospital asked me to clean up before you came home.
Did they?
So, how are you doing?
There's nothing wrong with me.
I merely sprained my ankle.
Do you remember but only a drop of water.
I think that most plants...
All right, I'll...
I'll be leaving then.
Håkon Hensvold has 240 different species of waxflower....
Henriette told me you have been kicked out of your house.
You have failed in most of life's phases.
You can stay in the cellar apartment until your life gets back in order.
But then I want you out.
For Christ's sake, Terje!
It took seven shots.
I held myself for two days.
I can see that.
-What happened?
-You're both crazy.
-Welcome home.
-I didn't think you'd actually do it!
-Are you leaving?
-You shat in there!
-Come on, Georg!
-Don't you see who you resemble?
That's the opposite of mom and dad.
That keeps me balanced.
You look just like dad before he loses it.
I'm not losing it!
They've both lost it.
You're more like me, Georg.
He's more like Frank.
You call every Sunday.
Terje, never.
You were always empathetic, kind and considerate.
Hege said so, too.
She called you considerate.
Have you talked to her?
Of course.
That magazine article was a big misunderstanding.
She's all hormonal.
I'm seeing her tomorrow.
Solid, but boring at times
Respectable debut
Soul devoid of soul
Hi!
-Hey.
-Hi.
-Did you read it?
-Yeah.
A lot was positive.
Four 4s.
-Not those.
Did you read VG?
-One bad review, in a shitty paper.
It's true.
I've known it all along.
I've been exposed.
I have no soul.
Come here.
-How are you doing, Georg?
-Fine.
I met my father.
Yeah.
He's in pretty bad shape.
He wants me to stay and take care of him.
-Are you kidding?
-No.
Maybe that's a good idea?
You can't escape from him anyway.
I'm sure it's easy to find a day-care if we move here.
-What is he doing here?
-He's my manager.
I know.
Are you sleeping with him?
-No.
-You know what he's up to.
He's in love with you.
Does everything to keep me away.
He refused to give me your new phone number.
That's psycho!
I had to get a new number because of you.
You texted me to death.
-You sent hundreds of messages.
-Not hundreds...
You didn't respond.
What did I tell you after our last argument?
You're hormonal.
That happens when you're pregnant.
-You've broken up with me before.
-I meant it this time.
We've never been better.
With the pregnancy and all...
-I haven't been happy.
-When?
You haven't even noticed that I've had an awful year?
-But we've been good.
-No, we haven't.
-I've cried and been despondent.
-Even TV commercials make you cry.
What are you trying to say?
Want me to get a grip?
Fine.
Remember I said it's not you, it's me?
It is you, Georg.
I've tried to help, but you isolate yourself.
-No, I don't.
-You don't work, have no friends...
-I have you!
-But I don't know if I have you.
-I'm sitting right here.
-But do you really see me?
We had this conversation before you went off the pill.
And we agreed:
Two parents, not one!
It's too late to freak out.
You want Joakim to have divorced parents?
-Joakim?
-We drew names out of a hat!
-I wanted him to have two parents.
-What do you mean, "wanted"?
Has something happened, Hege?
Have you lost...
-Are you still pregnant, Hege?
-No.
Hege, why didn't you tell me?
What happened?
-I'm sorry, Georg.
-Christ, don't blame yourself.
I didn't want to, but you refused to listen to me.
You didn't...
Not without discussing it with me, Hege!
Was it your fault?
I had an abortion.
What?
You have killed Joakim!
Do you realize that?
-There.
-It was like it wasn't happening.
-It was...
-Unreal?
If you beat her up, and it felt real, then you should worry.
I've spent the last year in some sort of bubble.
I've tried to convince both you and your father that you aren't crazy.
Maybe a little chubby, but otherwise normal.
-Remember the toy drawer?
Want one?
-No way.
Hi.
How's your nose?
You have dad's entire history, right?
How old was he when he first started losing it?
Have you decided to stay?
Dear Joakim.
I am writing to you because -
- I have now reached the age where your grandfather started going crazy.
He is now utterly insane.
I have no idea who he is.
I don't want that to happen to you.
So I am going to tell you everything about me while I am still sane.
I hope I'll keep my sanity, so you and I can understand each other.
And I hope I will find someone who wants to be your mother.
So you can be born.
Instead I found a self-absorbed bitch who thinks she's Beyoncé.
How could I be so stupid, Joakim?
You should be glad she isn't your mother.
You'll have to live with my brother, unfortunately.
But I wish I could have given you a more jovial uncle.
Terje's head is so far up his ass I'm afraid he'll never get it out.
At best he is driven by a very late-blooming puberty.
At worst, he is nuts.
It flows through us.
And I'm sorry, Joakim, but your grandmother is a lesbian.
Maybe when you grow up, lesbian grandmothers will be normal?
I just hope she'll be happy.
This family doesn't really do happiness.
But that's the family you're going to inherit.
I tried to escape it.
We all tried to escape from each other.
-Hi.
-Hi.
We thought we could replace it with something new.
Growing up, you think you'll get more and more new friends.
And that's true for a while.
But you end up alone.
And all you have left, no matter what, is the family you were dealt.
I miss you, Joakim.
I can't wait till you get here.
Until then I plan on staying here.
I think this will be OK.
For once, I think I may be doing the right thing.

SOMEWHERE ELSE
Just as man is the measure of all things.
The beginning and the ending, the core of otherwise random lives, each place is the centre of the universe.
Which also goes for our own community.
In the cold eyes of the heavens, we simply inhabit the same, insignificant, planet regardless of where or why...
But obviously, this is not the case...
This is not how we see it from down here, as we roam through fragrant forests finding our way between pines and fir.
Or when we raise our gaze to catch a sparrow in flight.
Then, our location springs to life within us, and we enliven the location.
Our hometown pulls us in, like spring brings the migrant birds.
Why is that?
Better ask someone who knows...
We here in Borunda know, not only this region, but each other, as well.
We feel for each other.
He who seeks good finds goodwill, but evil comes to him who searches for it.
That's from Proverbs.
Every morning, I open my Bible at random and read.
And this morning, it was Ecclesiastes.
And Ecclesiastes tell us of...
I know.
But I would really like you to return to the events of that night.
Could we go over it again, from the beginning?
- The kitchen, you said...
- I know what I said.
I know what I saw, I told you that already!
- And you were in the kitchen?
- Certainly.
In my kitchen...
- Or do you mean some other kitchen?
- I mean your own.
You saw them.
I was checking the temperature and my first thought was:
Right, they're here.
- Who?
- Romanians, Albanians...
Whatever.
And I couldn't figure out what they were doing here.
Why not pick Ove Karlsson?
The fellow must have bushels of it at home.
Though I expect, by now, that he drank up most of it...
Please concentrate on the actual events.
Unless you'd like to take a break?
- Make?
Make what?
- No, "break".
I said "take a break".
- Why?
- Nothing, that's just the way I feel.
So it's over, then?
Just like that?
Is it?
Don't worry, the door's solid...
Which is more than you could say about me!
Six million kronor!
Six million...
Yet here I am, a bloody loser.
It's all right, you don't have to say anything.
- My dirty laundry is my own...
- Don't you have any clean sheets?
Christ, Anki...
How long have we known each other?
It must be about 30 years now?
I've got to pick up Max at school in an hour.
It's past one, you know.
So, what's it going to be?
You want to do it?
I just need to...
I need to take a shower first.
- No alarm system?
- This isn't fancy, like Stockholm.
We never locked our doors.
- When was that, 30 years ago?
- Nothing's changed.
- What about neighbours and stuff?
- It's cool.
Smooth sailing.
No one can see us from the lake side.
And besides, there are lots of other houses to choose from nearby.
It's as... "easy as a pancake".
An even zero...
Animals or humans?
- A hard-on?
- Yes, a hard-on.
I'm just telling you the facts, regardless of what you want to hear.
- Or how unpleasant...
- I don't give a damn!
We have an iron to go home to.
Bye, dear...
There's only 800 here...
I forgot to withdraw more cash.
You'll get the rest on Friday.
Unless an old friend qualifies for a discount?
- What?
- A discount, if you'd consider...
I heard you the first time.
Right, and I was looking forward to seeing you.
- It's been ages since I was... home.
- This happens all the time!
- What about next weekend?
- I don't know...
No, I'm working next Saturday.
- How are things going?
- The house is almost done now.
- I meant you.
- Don't be upset that I'm ill.
I'm just concerned, that's all.
Hang on.
I've got to go, I'll call you later.
Look at him!
Look...
What a bloody pig!
His mess lowers the prices in this neighbourhood by at least 100 grand!
That fucking draining ditch!
What's it been, two years?
There's got to be a law that would force him to fill those damn trenches.
Looks like she's playing with one of those model airplanes.
- Imagine being under that.
- What?
Her, the fatty over there.
Some cutie, right?
Why would she be on top of you?
I don't know, it was just something I said.
I said "imagine".
Where are you going?
Our hometown pulls us in.
What forces lead us to return, to abandon the buzz of the city for the burble of a brook?
The calm?
The silence?
The security?
"The simple life,"some say.
"The closeness,"says yet another.
"The predictable life,"says a third.
And to this I respond:
Explain the gravity of the sparrow.
Explain the flight of the snail.
Explain the roar of the brook.
Greatness can be housed in small packages.
- This weekend just isn't good...
- You can't live like this.
The guest room isn't ready yet, that's all.
You've been drinking, I can tell.
I can come and get you, if you like.
Anytime, you know that.
Anneli?
Hello.
Hello!
We haven't really talked, have we?
It's Anneli, right?
Roland Göransson.
Welcome to the neighbourhood.
Everything going fine with the house?
It's quite different from living in a big city like Stockholm.
- You're a teacher, aren't you?
- That's right.
English and Swedish.
Mostly for deaf ears, unfortunately.
It's nice to see Erik back in town again.
I always figured it would be him and not Bengt who would take over the old place when the time came.
- Have you settled on a date?
- Sorry?
I talked to Erik a few weeks back, about having you over for dinner.
Oh, I don't know...
Go ahead and talk to Erik, and I'll talk to Anki, and we'll see.
Sure.
Sounds like fun.
- You're a hairdresser, right?
- Yes, at Pernilla's salon.
Do you do private sessions?
- What do you mean?
- Do you cut hair "off the clock"?
Well, I guess.
I do Erik's hair.
Are you unhappy with your barber?
This might sound strange to you, but I cut my own hair.
It doesn't really make a difference.
Well, it does, but...
What the hell...
No, he's not going to sleep, is he?
!
Every night he's on display!
He could at least pull down the blinds.
For God's sake, speak Swedish!
I wonder if it's the brewer's yeast that makes me sweat rivers like this.
I can't go on like this.
Shaking so badly the whole damn house is rocking.
If I put a hand on the wall, it stops, but as soon as I take it away everything spins like I'm in a dryer!
I was staring at the ceiling...
Wondering what the damn stuff is called...
Fibre?
Pasteboard?
Some stupid name...
Guess it could be something in the soil, though.
That it's jinxed or something...
Are you coming?
Are you?
No, I don't want to.
- What don't you want?
- I don't want to do this.
It's over...
The whole damn thing is over.
- What do you mean?
- Take your money and leave.
I'm not going to do this anymore.
Yeah, you say that a lot...
Go...
Get out.
"Name in November"?
Three letters, "name in November".
Holy crap!
"O...
V...
E... "
"Ove", Christ...
Lord, give him strength.
Give him the strength!
"All man's efforts are for his mouth, yet his appetite is never satisfied."
- Indeed: never satisfied!
- That's possible...
It's society's most dangerous disease!
The root of all evil!
Solidarity.
Fair play.
Christian ethics.
I use to say that I had three good things to lean on in life:
The good book, a good job, and a good wrestling match!
- But if we could...
- Good wrestlers, you know...
- Know when they have to go on fighting!
- Let's get back to that night.
- When you first saw them.
- Sodom?
What do you mean?
The hometown in our hearts is, and always will be, a place of open arms, a sanctuary.
The sense of community is a fortress of peace we build together, in a collective effort, generation after generation, stone by stone.
Monika speaking...
Anneli?
Anneli, is that you?
Let's go, Ove.
Hello...
Sorry I'm late...
Is there room for one more?
Don't see those very often these days.
- What?
- Bags like that.
They're nice.
Serviceable.
- Roomy.
- Yes, it's...
I've certainly had it for a while.
He's good...
- Who?
- Roland.
But it's pretty difficult, though.
Or maybe I don't have an ear for it.
I don't care about grammar.
I just want to improve my conversation in English.
That's right, "neighbours".
Want to forget about it?
Turn around and leave?
Guess not...
Then let's drop the subject.
Bloody hot...
You never want to.
Talk about it.
What's the point?
You've already made your mind up.
Listen to yourself.
What you just said.
- Where are you going?
- To get a napkin.
Sorry.
Sketch it for me.
The house, the surroundings...
- I can't draw.
- Christ, we don't need a work of art.
- I just want to get a picture.
- I've told you everything!
Show me!
Go on, draw like kid would.
The lake...
Abridge...
We don't go there, though...
What the fuck is that?
Borunda from an airplane?
I told you I can't draw!
That's the most pathetic thing I've ever seen!
- Christ!
- Whatever!
Christ...
Hello.
I need razor blades.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
An old classmate I don't want to talk to.
- The guy with the long hair?
- No, the other one.
- Don't look!
- It can't be that bad.
- For you, no.
- Were you, like, enemies?
No, we barely talked.
We weren't in the same class.
- You said you were classmates.
- Briefly.
But then he went into a Special Education class.
Not sure he even finished junior high.
I'm not big on that kind of"reunion".
- Does he still live in Borunda?
- I don't think so.
He moved in with his sister.
His parents died, they were really old when they had him.
He was younger than his sister's oldest child.
Krille "Neefen".
That's what we called him, "Neefen".
Once, in English, we were reading vocabulary lists aloud in class.
And he read the Swedish translations like they were in English.
And pronounced "kniv" like "neef".
"Rakapparat"...
Shaver.
- We thought it was funny.
- I bet he didn't.
How come you're so sure he didn't vote for the Sweden Democrats?
- Your dad, how do you know?
- Don't start in on that again.
- Just say what you think.
- The man has brain damage.
- All I'm saying is...
- That I should tell them to fuck off?
Stand up for your beliefs.
- Despite his injury?
- What was wrong with him before that?
Maybe we should forget about this.
Turn around and leave.
The knife?
You said that Olsson was bending over Nilsson.
And that he was holding the knife.
Now you're saying that he came at you with the knife.
- That's right.
- Which version?
That he was standing where I said.
- Bending over Nilsson?
- Right, and then he came at me.
Let's drop Olsson for a while, shall we?
According to the autopsy,
Petterson was hit right above the back of his right knee.
Yes?
- Can you explain that?
- That's what I've been doing!
Well, so Petterson must have had his back to you when you shot him.
- Does he say that?
- No, I do.
- It's an undeniable fact.
- "Eye of a bull"?
- Did you tell him that?
- You sound afraid...
- Did you?
- No.
- Why did you call my home number?
- I wanted to hear his voice.
I'll pick you up tomorrow, and we'll take it from there.
Anneli?
What's wrong?
- I don't know...
Anneli, what's going on?
I
Anneli, can you hear me?
Anneli?
Anneli?
Why didn't you answer me?
- When I called your name.
- I didn't hear you.
- When will they be here?
- Seven.
- Your sister called.
- I know.
Like a drink?
Careful.
My ribs, please...
I'm sorry I lost my temper.
You're so hot!
I love you.
You know that, right?
What time is it?
Seven.
No...
Yeah...
- I have a bad feeling about this.
- Don't, it's cool.
- What the hell...
- What's the problem?
I thought I saw somebody.
But I was wrong.
- Where are you going?
- To the can.
Want another beer?
I just bought one!
It's K-k-kri-i-ille, Stefan.
Re-re-remember me?
Krille, with the st-st-stutter?
Or have you forgotten about stuffing my head in the toilet?
You and that caveman, Erik?
Wanna know what it feels like to drink piss?
Cheers...
You've really fixed the place up.
How long have you been together, you and Erik?
Four years...
What am I saying, it's six years.
Do you like it here in Borunda?
Country living?
Scary business, that thing that happened to Erik.
In Stockholm.
When he was on duty, right?
Just a millimetre or so from...
Is that right?
He could just as well have died.
The world is full of crazies.
Well, not here, though.
Except for Ralf, the boy with the earphones.
He seems pretty harmless.
We'll see how long he gets to stay at home this time.
I think I'll have another cigarette.
You do that...
I've been thinking of putting in a Jacuzzi, too...
- Again?
I feel tempted...
I've managed without for ten years, so I'll pass.
It's just character!
Reason isn't always capable of triumphing over... desire.
- Anyone you know?
- No, but you can still be neighbourly.
Let's get this over with.
It's just one night, okay?
Door's open!
- You're late.
Was there much traffic?
- No, it wasn't bad.
- There's drinks in the box.
- I'll get glasses.
- I bought a bottle of wine.
- See the car?
On Larsson's driveway.
Should bloody well be against the law!
- The neighbour...
- Looks like a tank!
Dad and I have already eaten, but there is some food left.
Sit down.
It just started.
- I need to go to the loo.
- You know where it is.
How about it, would you like to have something to eat?
Hand me a brewski.
- Hey, a brewski!
Were you asleep?
- Nah...
- Want me to drive?
- Funny...
- Is it far?
- 10 to 20 kilometres, that's all.
Maybe 30.
Fucking morons...
- "Blue vegetable".
- What?
- "B-b-blue vegetable".
- What are you babbling about?
Someone wrote that on the wall back there, or maybe it was "blue greenery".
There aren't any, are there?
Blue vegetables?
All I can think of are b-b-blueberries, but that's not a v-v-vegetable.
Where did that stutter come from?
- That's fruit, right?
- Yeah, right.
- Britta speaking.
- You called.
I just wanted to hear how you were doing at the trade fair.
It's the regular headache.
- What time will you be home?
- Late, I guess.
Why?
- I was thinking about dinner...
- I'll grab something on the way.
I'm going out tonight.
I'm going out with Ulla and Karin, from my English class.
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- You don't have to call all the time.
- Well, hope you feel better.
- I'm not sick!
Let's say good night, then.
There...
- You look nice.
- Thank you, so do you.
That alcohol smell comes from my new aftershave.
- I think it smells nice.
- Good.
Well...
It's lovely...
I was going to go for English food, but then I decided
Italian was a better bet.
Mozzarella, tomato salad...
And lasagne.
- Do you like lasagne?
- I love lasagne.
Have a bread stick.
- I made them myself.
- Wow.
What would you like to drink?
I have wine and beer.
Not if you're not...
I'll have what you're having.
- Water.
- Yes.
"Sparkling"...
Is it rough?
The worst time is 5 to 10 pm.
You need to keep busy.
He was on me six months ago, about some list he wanted me to sign.
Really?
That's terrible!
Practically indecent...
- Torbjörn Ingvarsson.
- Married to Britta, the checker...
He has a petition to force that guy Ove to move away?
- He could get a lot of names.
- That's disgusting!
But you've seen the mess, haven't you?
That bloody ditch around the house?
He hasn't done a damn thing since he won the Lottery.
- A cool six million...
- It's his house.
Anki and Ove used to be a couple.
More than 30 years ago, back in high school.
Briefly...
Ove's taking English.
And so is Britta.
And he's sober there.
Is he planning a trip?
"I live in a different world, while yours stays the same."
Ekelöf...
- Well...
- Gunnar Ekelöf.
Sweden's finest poet.
- One of them...
He's dead.
- It was a book...
The Lagercrantz book?
Have you read it?
No, a customer left it behind at the salon.
It's good.
I have a copy if you want to read it.
Since when do you read poetry?
- Where are you going?
- To have a smoke.
- Again?
- Have one for me, too.
Hi.
Is this yours?
- Didn't know they had whiskey in those.
- Larsson bought it in Germany.
- Sorry, I couldn't find a corkscrew,
- He buys a carload twice a year.
- How much?
For the box.
- His car?
- Want some?
- There's pear brandy, too.
250.
Only a hundred per litre, that's not bad!
- Don't you want a refill?
- No thanks, I'm not big on whiskey.
- Want coke in that?
- There's more in the fridge.
Time for your present...
- Happy big 70th.
- Well, blow me over...
Let's take a look...
- What is it?
- An Alessi.
- Alessi, it's a brand.
- Oh...
- Thank you.
- It's from both of us.
Well then, cheers!
There's pear brandy, too.
Look at that poof!
There's one in every damn show!
Did you want to eat?
- Gay television...
- They're a demographic, too.
Is that one a homo, too?
The one with the braces and the hair?
- What are we watching?
- Junk, they only show junk on Fridays.
There's a movie coming up.
What about those fancy sandwiches?
Fancy a fancy sandwich?
No, I need to go to the loo.
Do you have a bladder infection?
I hope not...
Look at the bugger!
It's cold!
No one's forcing you to go.
- Like me to freshen your drinks?
- No thanks, we're good.
- Tomorrow's another day!
- For some people...
We were talking about Bengt.
Have you met him?
Erik's brother?
Never met the man.
Don't even know what he does for a living.
- That was my question, actually.
- We don't see much of each other.
It happens.
My old man and his brother... 20 years could pass.
But he still lives in...
was it Göteborg?
As far as I know.
"I live in a different world, while yours stays the same."
I think I'd like to borrow that book.
- If that's all right.
- Of course.
- Do you like to read, Erik?
- I read more than you do!
What's going on?
Sounded like someone texted me.
- Ow...
- What's the matter?
I don't know...
It was as if I couldn't move, that's all.
- You just went out.
- I'm going to the loo.
With your drink?
Maybe it's time... to call it a night.
- Oh shit!
- What's the matter?
My eye...
It hit me in the eye.
You...
Can Not Live Here.
You Can Not Live Here.
What's going on?
Downstairs?
- What the hell are you doing?
- Stop it...
- Are you making fun of me?
- I didn't say anything.
Is that what you want?
For you and Roland to start a book club?
Do you know how that makes me feel?
When you sit down there and...
Do you understand?
Do you?
!
Why the hell did we do this?
- Peanuts in your eye...
- Shut up!
Do you have the hots for her so bad that you can't even...?
- Were you hoping for some group sex?
- That would suit you.
- I'm going home!
- Go ahead!
I don't care who you sleep with, but don't be so damn pathetic!
- Bell peppers...
- What?
Blue bell peppers...
I've had that.
- No way!
- Way!
What do they taste like?
They taste like...
Bell peppers.
- Just more bluish...
- Blue bell peppers.
Cool...
Blue bell peppers.
Did she go to bed?
Is she all right?
If you're going to blabber, do it in the kitchen.
I think I'll call it a night, as well.
- What about the movie?
- I've seen it.
- Oh, sleep tight.
- Good night.
You asleep?
I've made my mind up.
I'm moving.
Somewhere else.
Anywhere else.
I'm done here.
What about your "fifteen"?
Your fifteen minutes of fame.
In the spotlight...
- Nah...
- Go on!
Nah, I don't know what to say.
I don't think like that.
Come on!
There's got to be something!
Well, maybe to screw that TV presenter.
The one with the lips.
That's cool...
That's good!
In front of an audience, right?
Screw her brains out in front of the entire nation!
From "let's dance" to "let's fuck".
- I just wanna screw her.
- God, you're boring!
- Do you have any imagination at all?
- Nope.
They were a pain...
What are you doing?
I just wanted to...
Let's go to bed.
What do you say?
Don't...
Forget about the dishes.
I said, don't.
We could cuddle...
You're so pretty...
Do you know that?
Stop it...
Stop it!
Wake up!
It's time.
It's bloody cold!
- Did you bring everything?
- The torch and the tape, yes.
Shit!
"Easy as a pancake", huh?
How was I supposed to know about this?
- It's been 25 years!
- Yeah, right.
Where are we?
Point!
How far is it?
Up that road.
- Shit!
- Cool...
- Get your act together!
- My mouth is dry.
You talk too much!
Let's all start dancing...
- Shut up!
- Look at you!
- Like some giant condom.
- Stop giggling like a girl!
It's just a wild hare.
Let's go.
And shut up!
- I didn't say anything.
- Just shut up.
No!
Shit, shit, shit!
- Stefan?
- What's wrong?
- Let's go.
I'm going.
- Time...?
- It's in the middle of the night.
- I can't stay another second!
- Please calm down...
- I'm leaving, no matter what.
I'm not going to stay.
- You can't leave like this...
- I'm going to the car.
- Stefan, what's going on?
- We've got to go.
We left an iron on at home.
I'll call you.
Go.
Would you chill out and tell me what happened.
I want to leave.
Now!
- Tell me what happened?
- Go!
I will never set foot here again!
I feel sick to my stomach.
Disgusted...
Tell me what happened.
Like you don't have eyes?
Go!
For God's sake, go!
Bloody thorns...
Are they up?
Old people need to pee.
Come on.
An even zero...
Animals or humans?
- Sure this is the right place?
- Yes, shut up!
- This is ridiculous!
- I told you so.
Jesus...
Some Schwarzenegger guy?
This must be the wrong house.
Let's do this, okay!
Trust me.
- It feels all wrong.
- Don't be so damn negative.
Bloody hell!
Too bad you didn't bring a bowling ball.
Give me the torch.
- Shit, let's go!
- No way.
What the...
I can't breathe!
All you do is sit there!
No matter what he says.
Blacks and homos and lesbos and on and on.
And what a way to welcome us!
"Dad and I have already eaten."
And then he gropes me...
He gropes you?
What...?
- Yes.
Not like that.
- Either he does or he doesn't!
- Don't you see how he touches me?
- No, and I want you to stop.
He had a hard-on!
Didn't you notice?
!
- A hard-on?
- Yes, a hard-on.
I'm just telling you the facts, regardless of what you want to hear.
However unpleasant it is.
I don't care.
I don't give a damn.
We have an iron to get home to.
Rick up, pick up!
- An iron?
- Yes.
Anneli, Anneli?
Are you there?
Anneli!
Nothing is forever.
We cannot stop progress, the merciless march of time.
But we can defend what we believe in.
What we nurture under glass.
Seeds sprout regardless of the size of the plot.
That's why we remain.
Why we continue to tend our gardens in the place we call our hometown, our place here on Earth:
Borunda.
The warmth of illusion?
The hub of a random existence?
The cold eyes of the heavens...
A well-made basket to lie in.
Cold eyes?
The eyes of the universe?
Gee...
Who the hell do you think you are?
Do you really think you can break it off and go hide?
!
You can have your money back, if that's it!
30 years...
Doesn't that mean a damn thing?
!
Don't I mean anything?
Max?
Max!
Look who's here, it's Max.
So you're going to town, too.
Nice to have some company.
And you've got your clubs.
You've got your golf.
That's good, Max.
We all need something to cling to in times like these.
As we ponder in the wilderness...
It's just terrible, what happened.
A...
A dark day forever carved into the bark of this community.
Yet still, an opportunity for communion and reflection.
We must go on.
We must raise above our despair, no matter how hard it is to bear.
We must never allow fear to take root within us.
We are neighbours and we are bigger than that!
Isn't that right, Max?
- Max!
Max, get in.
- Ann-Kristin...
Hello, Allan.
- Max...
Get in.
- Are you going into town?
- Well, yes...
Good, then I can ride along.
I'm going to the library.
Hello...
I have something to tell you.
- I'm busy right now...
- I've been with someone.
- What?
- I've been unfaithful.
With Ove.
- What?
- Ove Karlsson.
- I can't hear what you're saying.
- I slept with Ove.
Torbjörn?
Are you still there?
That was a blow.
That was one hell of a blow!
Well then...
We'll be having a funeral.
A double funeral...
So we can expect a few guests, maybe even from afar.
I have to say a few words.
Pen a few thoughts to recite.
I was thinking of beginning with Setterlind's "Death, I picture thus".
- What do you think?
- What?
Oh, that's nice...
An old yeoman sings as he plies his fields
A basket of seeds on one arm, he scatters as he goes beginnings and endings, the cycle of life...
He toils from sunrise to sunrise 'til the dawning of the final day
Frozen like a tiny hare, I see him approaching from afar
He gathers me...
Sorry, sorry...
- Awed by his beautiful song
- Ralf, turn that off!
He gathers me up, puts me in his basket
And as I fall asleep, he continues on his rounds
Death, I picture thus
This terrible tragedy cannot be undone.
On the contrary, it will forever be carved into the bark of our community, as a dark day in the minds of all of us here, in Borunda
Bloody hell...
Christ!
Are you all right?
Come on, take my hand.
Don't you touch me!
Don't...
Don't touch me...
Our hometown pulls us in.
But why is that?
What forces lead us to return?
That cause us to abandon the buzz of the city for the gentle burble of the brook?
To that I respond...
Explain the flight of the sparrow.
Explain the gravity of the snail.
No, it's...
Explain the gravity of the sparrow.
Explain the flight of the snail.
Explain the roar of the brook.
Closeness awakens consideration and compassion.
In our neighbour, we see ourselves.
We see the differences and acknowledge the similarities.
Closeness becomes a bridge.
In the small divide between us grows understanding and respect.
A large gap generates questions, alienation.
Our hometown provides freedom, and demands accountability.
It is forgiving and demanding.
The community is the fortress of peace...
Good thing he didn't break his neck.
Why not wait until spring?
No, I want to sell the place now.
The sooner, the better.
I'm done here.
- Take a cinnamon roll.
- No thanks, I'm fine.
So...
There's no going back?
How could there be?
- What does Max say?
- He's turned his back on us.
He wants to leave home.
22 years... 22...
Twenty-two bloody years!
You seem to be doing fine, though.
Cinnamon rolls and coffee...
One day at a time, that's all I can do.
- I'm sorry, that wasn't very nice.
- Don't worry.
It will be empty here without you.
I'll miss you, too.
I wish certain things could be undone.
Do you despise me?
- I want to know how you feel...
- Don't...
Don't, please don't.
- I want you to know...
- Let it go.
Let it go, Anki.
Do you have any booze at home?
Sorry...
Sorry...
Anki, Anki...
Who said that?
"Life's but a poor paid player, that struts and frets his hour upon the stage?"
- Was it Shakespeare?
- Possibly...
I know I'm repeating myself, but could you...
If you're up to it, could you describe the events again?
Again?
- From the beginning?
-Again.
From the very beginning.
February 9th, 1995 Seventh anniversary of the death of Osamu Tezuka.
I started visiting him, when I was only 15 years old.
It has been approximately 34 years.
It's a great honour for me to have lived the same age as Mr. Tezuka.
Mr. Tezuka traversed the Showa era at lightning speed.
I regret that he didn't have longer to work on his creation.
He's gone too soon.
Time absorbs all men without distinction, whether great or ordinary.
I felt it sorely.
The world of Manga is very empty without Mr. Tezuka.
Haunted by memories of the past,
I could not stand it and left the ceremony before it was over.
I felt so tired.
The days of my youth devoted to the passionate pursuit of my dream of Gekiga
I miss sorely.
Three years after the end of war, the sound of hammers echoed again and Osaka finally seemed to come back to life.
But for us ordinary people, the lack of food was a day-to-day routine.
I was born in Osaka, in 1935.
At the end of the Second World War,
I was only 10 years old.
August 6th, 1971
Peace Park in Hiroshima
Get lost, Minister Satô!
Calm down!
Get off me!
It was raining that day.
A black rain ... for 26 years, black rain continues to fall on my heart, never letting me rest.
In 1945
August 6th at 8:00 am,
an atomic bomb exploded 480 meters over Hiroshima instantly turning the world into hell.
Appointed by the press service of the Department of War
I was immediately sent to Hiroshima.
A black rain ...
Gloomy ...
The passengers were sitting quietly, in the burned out tram.
As I got closer,
I realised they were burnt on site.
The powerful radiation of the bomb had printed a human shadow on the steps of a bank.
The shadow of a spiral staircase engraved forever ...
I pressed the trigger like one possessed.
I walked through the debris to reach an alley where a burned out house stood.
I discovered a sight so upsetting, that I immediately burst into tears.
On a wall, two human shadows were printed clearly.
Probably a mother and her son?
The devoted son was massaging his mother when the bomb surprised them.
Sobbing,
I pressed the shutter button.
My eyes filled with tears,
I was blinded.
Does God not exist?
How can such things happen?
Not stopping to cry, I helped to carry victims to a health centre.
I was completely numb when I returned to the department.
Looking at the prints that night,
I burst into tears again.
Three days later, I returned to the location of the photograph.
The wall on which the shadows were printed had disappeared.
Excuse me ...
Do you know who lived here?
It was the house of the Yamadas.
They lived here in pairs, a mother and her son.
They were found burned, both.
My hunch was right ... a devoted son massaging his mother.
Despite the smell of dozens of thousands of corpses burning all around, the sight of the sunset was incredibly beautiful.
Then the war ended.
Japan barely recovered, signed the Treaty of Peace in September 1951.
Journal Sanyô Maiasa
This photograph is exceptional.
It could move all of Japan ...
Who knows, even the world?
I'd like to sell it to you.
For over 6 years I kept it without showing anyone.
Today, I need money.
Thanks to the treaty, we can finally publish pictures of the bomb.
We offer you a good price.
The money I got for the photo allowed me to feed my family despite my unemployment.
But I was tortured by the voice of my conscience.
Mom ...
let me massage you!
What's gotten into you?
You're soaked in sweat!
A bad dream ...
A devoted son and his mother!
The moving shadows of the Yamadas
The photograph upset all of Japan.
The Maiasa published a series of articles on the sacrificed mother and son.
The faces of the son Kiyoshi and his mother Mado are finally revealed
Let's raise a fund to build a statue in their memory.
Their image must live forever!
Poems and movies dedicated to the devoted son
Another article calling you a great photographer!
With the impact of my photography, my guilt faded.
I even developed a secret pride.
Fantastic, right?
A famous sculptor created this statue.
The Maiasa decided to send him abroad to represent our campaign
No More Hiroshima worldwide.
Mr. Koyanagi, take the lead of our movement!
Me travelling the world?
I'll do my best.
I carry with me the memory of the 200,000 victims of the bomb.
I'll spread No More Hiroshima in the world!
We count on you, Mr. Koyanagi!
Every day, when the limousine of the journal came to pick me up with its flag,
I was carried in pride.
Rest in peace Our mistakes will not be repeated
You are Mr. Koyanagi?
So you're the one who invited me here.
I'm in a hurry, tell me what you want.
Will you attend the inauguration ceremony of the statue?
You became famous!
With nothing but a miserable picture.
What a charade.
The photo of a devoted son?
Takes a lot of nerve to pass a murder for a simple massage.
What do you say?
That it was the image of a murder.
He was going to strangle her when the bomb exploded.
What?
I have proof!
Who are you?
You're crazy!
Tell me who you are!
Don't you recognise this face?
Remember.
I was in the newspaper!
I'm Kiyoshi Yamada.
The devoted son of the statue!
What are you talking about?
The mother and her son were dead on the spot.
They were found burned!
They are on the list of victims.
There has been two deaths ... but the boy was one of my friends.
I asked him to kill my mother.
On the day of the bomb,
I was mobilised in Kure in a weapons factory.
My friend had to take care of my mother during this time.
The bomb was dropped that morning.
I quickly returned to Hiroshima.
I saw the printed image, the murder that I commissioned.
I rushed to tear down the wall.
The wall ...
It's true that it has been collapsed.
Yes, it was I who destroyed it.
I thought I had cleared all the evidence ...
But then your statue and all the fuss.
That I didn't expect!
What do you think?
You have before you the devoted son that makes people cry in their cottages!
Why kill your mother?
I wanted money ...
Sell the house ...
Money for my pleasure.
I had enough of labouring like a maniac.
But everything is screwed.
Now, here I'm deprived of identity, forced to live hidden like a rat.
I can not believe it.
It's impossible.
This statue, would it be the symbol of matricide?
NO MORE HIROSHIMA Inauguration Ceremony
These two children, bomb survivors, will unveil the statue.
Are you okay, Mr. Koyanagi?
Call a doctor!
How is he, doctor?
Just a little anaemic.
He will be released soon.
A statue in honour of murder ...
I want money.
I want to have my share of the funds collected.
I'm sick.
My lungs ...
In return, I'll keep the secret.
You'd be annoyed if it came out now, right?
I count on you, Koyanagi.
I expect the money.
Is he okay?
He regained consciousness.
Thank you, Mr. Koyanagi.
Thanks to you, the pain of the victims of the bomb is known throughout the world.
Hold on!
Can I shake your hand?
One bomb was enough to make more than 200,000 deaths.
More than 200,000!
One more ...
One more person added these 200,000 ...
It will not change anything.
Sorry for the delay, Koyanagi.
On this day ... victims of the bomb came here to find water.
A final walk.
Countless corpses floated here.
We still find bones.
You got the money?
I'll not give it to you, forget it.
This is donation money.
In this case,
I'll reveal the truth about the statue.
I don't have much longer.
I have nothing to lose.
Everyone will be disappointed, Koyanagi.
Your reputation will suffer.
Body recovered from the Motoyasu river
The statue?
The campaign has been canceled by the management.
Apparently, the son in question is still alive.
We have seen better as a devoted son.
He came to seek compensation from the newspaper yesterday during the day.
According to our survey, he does appear in the records of deaths, but it's him.
I saw hell trapped in my own heart.
And for 20 years
I lived as if I was endlessly travelling hell.
The penalty for this murder is barred.
And yet ...
I can not find the courage to confess my crime.
Lost in the crowd gathered for the 25th Memorial of Peace,
I live alone in the middle of hell.
Rest in peace Our mistakes will not be repeated
After the war, the paper shortage gives birth to rental libraries lending 3 books for 5 Yen.
I was 12 when I started drawing Manga, influenced by Yoshioki, my elder brother, two years older than me.
I worked diligently every day on a long strip.
We named Yoshioki Okichan.
He had been admitted to Toneyama hospital, but our limited resources had forced him to return, aborting his treatment.
Because he could no longer go to school, his attitude towards me suddenly changed.
When I went out in the morning, his gaze hardened,
and his eyes seemed to me full of jealousy and anger against me.
Sometimes he found an excuse to hit me for no reason.
These days, I went to school weeping bitterly.
It took me 40 minutes of walking every day to get to the College of Toyonaka 2.
We were six in the family, but my father was rarely seen.
I'm hungry.
Wait for Dad before starting dinner.
No, start without him.
We will not wait for a guy that you cannot be sure to return at all.
Mom ignores Dad completely when he returns.
They are quarrelling.
Divorced under the same roof.
Divorced?
I'm exhausted!
Let me sleep.
Ahead, I'll send manuscripts everywhere!
Nothing can stop me!
Like being possessed,
I drew Manga every night, that I sent to the magazines.
From 1949 on new magazines
Manga for children saw the day, one after the other.
BOOKS AND MANGA
I'm in!
My first publication.
The Korean War breaks in June 1950, and Japan takes on the role as a strategic base for the U.S. Army.
The revival of demand allows the country to rebuild its economy.
Excuse me, can you repeat that?
Yes, the Mainichi Newspaper.
Yoshihiro, it's incredible!
It was in 1950, during the summer holidays.
A reporter from the Osaka Mainichi paid us an unexpected visit.
Get changed quickly.
The gentleman of the Mainichi is waiting.
Yes, but what does he want?
He writes an article about the young geniuses of Manga.
A genius?
Who?
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
This is Yoshihiro.
I'm delighted.
So it was you?
Thank you for the great Manga you send to us.
This is me ...
In fact, I came today because I'd like you to introduce yourself to our readers.
Mainichi Journal
Relax yourself a little and smile!
Who is your favourite artist?
There is an author I adore at the moment.
Who?
Osamu Tezuka!
I read all his Manga.
Would you like to meet him?
Unbelievable!
I'll meet Tezuka in person!
What a stately home!
This is where he lives.
I realised that up to this point
I had only drawn in order to meet Mr. Tezuka.
Under my amazed eyes, the feet, the hands,
the characters of Mr. Tezuka came to life.
I still hold dear this unforgettable memory.
This is the happiest day of my life.
Thank you.
You should attempt at long series.
I returned to the silent house of Tezuka, crept over by an unreal feeling.
I had the chance to return several times, but his huge amount of work finally led Mr. Tezuka to Tokyo for that he left Osaka.
I then realised that my mentor was now far and out of reach.
Tokyo had kidnapped him.
I thought of nothing else, but going there.
Habit is a horrible thing.
For me, always working in the centre of noise, silence seems to be the most sinister of all there is.
When you have no intention to speak any conversation seems pointless.
Machinery noise dominates, and men each live in their own corner.
Men are more numerous, the connections between them are fading and their loneliness deepens.
Izumi Residence
My Castle of 9 square meters ...
It's only when I'm alone when I finally feel less lonely.
My companion, Monkey.
For whatever reason, he never dares to face me.
My girlfriend is next to me in my bed, and my records invigorate my manhood.
Here, the Vietnam War,
Okinawa, the disease of Minamata, crossing the Pacific in a yacht all these events seem unreal.
Suffice to say that the only time I finally feel human is when I'm with my monkey.
BLAM !
Do not push!
The door will release!
Fuck!
While we suffocate, these cows travel like princesses.
That morning, I was thrown out by the masses, forced to descend during the journey.
I had not been back to Ueno since my arrival from the countryside five years before.
Naturally I set myself in motion, nostalgic.
It was 5 years ago
I arrived at Ueno my chest swollen with aspiration.
I no longer had the strength to commit myself to the factory work.
The zoo was less frequented that morning and it was as if the animals observed the humans.
What do they have?
Looks like you are affecting them!
It was really funny.
The monkeys seemed troubled by your presence.
This has encouraged me to get to know you better.
Could we meet again?
I'm just a working man.
It does not matter.
Please.
My name is Reiko.
Call me when you are free.
Good-bye.
You've spent the day smiling.
Good news?
A girl?
I doubt it, but in any case, beware.

The 3 Million Yen Dog
Boss.
Yoshida.
You look good.
Here's your allowance. 300,000 Yen.
The company is in trouble.
Your carelessness will cost us dearly.
But don't worry too much.
Rest well.
I forgot ...
Your denouncement has been accepted.
I missed you!
I knew you'd come.
Thank you for having called.
I'm a hostess here.
I'll make you a treatment.
You have money, right?
It's said that the workers make a good living.
The Otowa plant is hiring:
10 men, 3 women
Difficult with this disability ...
Hiring employees, urgent
Looking for graduates, good pay
It's time to say goodbye, Monkey.
I can not keep you.
Forgive me, Monkey.
What are you afraid of?
They are like you.
Go with your new friends.
Stop it!
Monkey!
September 8th, 1951
Minister Shigeru Yoshida signs the Treaty of Peace in San Francisco.
Japan makes its first step towards an independent country.
Pawnshop
Mom ...
My father didn't really took the effort to support us.
If only ...
I had some money ...
This is too little.
I have to take a chance with the short-time work tests.
We were poor and I multiplied the shipments hoping to win a prize.
Dad.
Here I am ...
You're home very late, aren't you?
A little ...
You have got mail.
Two registered mails and a letter.
Is this a prize?
A new 500 Yen note?
They have just been issued!
This is the first one I see.
You should not make yourself so much trouble, Yoshihiro.
Thank you, that's nice.
Here I'm!
What happened to you, Mom?
Yoshihiro.
Forgive him.
I beg you.
Do not be too hard.
What has he done?
Okichan had no chance.
He returned from the hospital and he suddenly began to tear up your plates.
He is desperate.
You have to understand.
My plates!
Why?
Bastard!
Stop, Yoshihiro, forgive him.
Yoshihiro!
I give up.
Never again ...
I'll never draw any more Manga!
My sadness passed over time.
Should I really give up the fragile dream of becoming an artist?
In 1954, I finally published my first album entitled Children's Island.
That's it!
It's out!
Unbelievable!
I was intoxicated with the sweet smell of fresh ink emanating from the new book.
I often wondered why I need drawing so much.
Of course, it was primarily a means of earning a living, but I knew that it wasn't the only reason that pushed me towards Manga.
At age 19, without a solid guarantee for the future, the only thing giving me the energy to move forward were my journeys into my imagination.
My daily life was far from easy, but I was still inhabited by a feeling of abundance.
In 1956, the post-war economic restrictions draw to a close and Japan quickly moves to its period of large growth.
THE SPARROW INN
During the summer of 1956,
I moved into a small apartment with three illustrators of the Hinomaru Edition to work together on the magazine Shadows.
It was a small room located in the area of Tennôji, Osaka.
This is unbearable!
What a heat!
We are dying!
And if we are going to see a movie?
They play The Lady and the Tramp.
And the job?
We can complete it tonight, as it's best.
You're right!
I could have fun all night without hindrance, with no one to stop me.
It was a sweet life and full of aspiration, new to me.
The cinema is my mentor.
THE SPARROW INN
Of course, the young owner there also prevented me from concentrating.
Look who's here!
Could you make me something to eat?
It's rare to see you alone.
Saichan has a date and Macchan went to see his parents.
His parents?
The celibacy must pressure him.
A grill, would that suit you?
Perfect!
I want a drink.
Can I sit down?
Of course!
Is it good?
Can I have one?
Once this is done.
I want this one.
The sausage that you are chewing on.
Hurry!
But I've chewed it already ...
That is the one I want.
Give it to me.
Come on ...
Chirp!
I'm not a bird.
Me, I'm your little sparrow.
Make me eat.
The attitude of the owner was no doubt a way of expressing her affection,
this was my first experience with a woman.
Within a month, he'll be marked as senior and will be buried by the company.
He could not bear the idea of a boring retirement accompanied by his old wife.
Section Manager
Already, nobody put any papers on his desk anymore.
No employee spoke to him anymore or called him director.
All the work was divided between his successors and everyone completely ignored him.
In brief, Saburô Hanayama might as well not exist anymore.
Director.
Thank you for your dedication, Miss Okawa.
Director?
You are very kind today.
He was touched.
Had he been a little younger, and if she wanted, he could love her at the peril of his life.
If only I could sleep with her just once,
I could die without regrets.
No, no.
I should not have these thoughts on a woman so sweet and pure.
Miss Okawa, forgive me.
Bank
Mr. Hanayama!
300,000 Yen.
The money I secretly saved.
I'll spend it during my remaining months.
It should be 5 million.
Surely more.
Like so ...
You're home.
We have not heard you.
Good evening!
You still calculate my retirement?
Do you never get tired?
This will be our only income once you're retired.
Yes.
And us too, we are counting on it.
His wife had never cared about him.
This malevolent woman had humiliated him for 30 years gradually, never resigning from her arrogance.
His only daughter thought only of herself.
Her mother had arranged her marriage, and Hanayama knew that his wife had carnal relations with her young son-in-law.
You're going to take a bath or do you want dinner?
I'll take a bath.
He had not slept with his wife for over 10 years.
Suddenly bottomless anger filled his heart.
This is hell.
I'll never spend the rest of my life cloistered with such a monster!
Yasukuni Band of Brothers ...
You left at the right time.
Look at me.
My company abandoned me and my wife has betrayed me.
I'm a walking corpse.
The gun enthroned in the middle of the sanctuary appeared to him majestic, like the symbol for the virility of his youth, forever buried.
Suddenly his blood boiled in his veins, and a feeling of potent determination invaded him there.
I'm still a man!
I'll show him that I can cheat on her!
I'm going to buy women with my 300,000 Yen.
He decided to betray his wife by cheating on her for the first time.
He thought that deceiving his wife would grant him a retreat from the visions of hell present in her company.
It's rare to see a client take a bath in a Turkish Bath.
What are they for then?
Well you know it ...
What would you like?
The clock is ticking.
A special or a double?
It's not enough to sleep with a woman to be unfaithful.
It must be a real woman, one I'm in love with.
Otherwise, it's not betrayal.
A rendezvous at night-time in Tokyo?
Meet a beauty!
Feeling lonely?
Call me!
Mika
Here is my registration fee of 3000 Yen.
What kind of girls are they?
They are all amateurs.
Good evening.
She is pretty.
I'm starving of hunger!
Let's go eat sushi.
That looks delicious!
I'd love to have dessert now!
This is sweet!
I'd like to sleep with you.
You are a nice girl.
What's your name?
Kazumi.
That's a pretty name.
Mister ...
What is it?
I'm starving.
Can I have eel before?
Please.
Having an affair with a woman is not as simple as that.
Miss Okawa.
You look lonely, Sir.
No, why ...
Thank you.
I feel very lonely too.
Impossible ...
Someone as lovely as you.
If you agree, we could have dinner tonight.
Really?
Go ahead, please.
I'm happy.
You're so nice to me.
He invited her to a luxury restaurant.
He was thrilled.
They walked through the city hand in hand.
He felt like in a dream.
Miss Okawa ...
You should not drink so much.
It's okay.
I want to be drunk.
Director ...
Today,
I have a broken heart.
My lover ... married the daughter of a rich man.
The goddess he worshiped laid in his arms.
His heart was about to burst, but unlike his feelings, the organ of his manhood refused to respond to the excitement.
This can't be.
He panicked.
What is it, Sir?
He burst into tears.
And she wept as well.
Yet, their adventure had liberated them from their grief.
In the Yasukuni Shrine, the night was mournful.
He thought of suicide in front of his comrades, but changed his mind.
My wife certainly awaits my death with impatience.
When I die, she'll receive the money from my life insurance.
I can not die.
I have to live long, whatever happens.
This is the only way to avenge myself.
The barrel of the sanctuary stood there, a black mass in the darkness.
He climbed onto the barrel and urinated on it at length.
Maybe I'm impotent facing life.
But look at you, canon.
You are as impotent as me.
In fact, you are the symbol of impotence.
I'm a murderer?
Lies!
After two months with Masahiko Matsumoto and Takao Saito, I left the apartment to devote myself to a long narration
Black Blizzard
My pencil slid easily and I felt confident again.
So that's it, the pleasure of creation!
I didn't know!
I had never experienced it before!
Vulgar Manga on the rise Parents of students are protesting
What is bothering you?
An article on the Manga rentals.
Another one!
It will not advance you to pay attention to that.
We don't draw for children.
Parents are complaining without even reading them.
Our readers are old enough to understand.
They know that you bleed when you are stabbed.
Our influence is not bad.
Yes, but our Manga are on the same shelf as the Manga for children.
Of course they are taken for what they are not.
BLACK BLIZZARD
It's true what Okichan told me, we should not call Black Blizzard a Manga.
Our works are different from the Manga for children.
Let's be clear on this.
Here, some new names.
Ryûdôga is too dark.
Setsuga is not bad ...
Let's proceed by elimination.
Gekiga
That sounds awfully good.
Yes, I also like Gekiga.
It has body and gives a dramatic nuance.
That is agreed.
Go for Gekiga!
GEKIGA
Now, it must be ensured that the term is spread.
How are you going to do this?
I'll take it to Tokyo!
This will be our banner!
Then you'll really go to ...
It has been decided.
We, the signees have decided to found Studio Gekiga.
We aim for a new kind of Manga ... for adult readers, characterised by a realistic drawing style and psychologically nuanced narrations.
I must not forget that I'm talking to adults.
Studio Gekiga Manifesto
I printed 150 postcards and sent them to different newspapers, editors and artists.
Without thinking,
I also sent one to master Osamu Tezuka.
In the book that he wrote later, he acknowledged having been perplexed by Gekiga, and when this genre experienced a great success by having been pushed down the stairs, having been struck with jealousy.
On April 1st, 1964 travels abroad are legalised.
The Dollar exchange rate rises to 360 Yen and everyone is allowed to take 500 Dollar abroad.
That does not work at all.
I should not have worked that much.
I have dizziness, nausea, and a chronic colic.
It's worse in recent days.
I lost weight and my body hurts everywhere.
Books for Children Publishing Office
Are you done, Mr. Shimokawa?
Excuse me.
As I told you, your series don't sell anymore.
You are at the lowest in the surveys.
I spend sleepless nights trying to entertain the children.
That is the problem.
Children lead you to the cane.
An author must know how to guide children where he wants them.
Anyway, the next episode has to be the last one.
My head is going to explode.
Shit, look at me!
Those fat dirty brats!
Give me back my health!
I should not have forced myself to eat.
I arrived too late and vomited on the wall.
When I saw the obscene graffiti, a violent nausea overcame me again.
For an artist as adherent to a unique series as myself, the last episode meant the loss of my job.
I was exhausted.
After two days of resting in my bed,
I felt a little better.
Well, going for the last episode!
♫ A man must know how to withdraw in style ... ♫
Do not let the children dominate you.
You take a drink?
I'll make you a treat.
You are more naive than you look.
You don't know why I asked you to wipe my fingers?
I'll wipe them myself.
Excuse me.
Okay, tell me you are quite something, yet ...
Little pervert.
It wasn't much.
She just excited me, plucked me and threw me out unceremoniously.
I suddenly wanted to see her again.
Only two days later, the graffiti had already changed.
Someone had drawn them again, after their removal.
I guess for the last episode, that will do the trick.
Thank you for your cooperation so far.
I'll call you soon.
I knew he'd not do anything.
It was over.
My talent was gone.
Say there was a time when I could not help but draw.
It's been more than 10 years and I have not felt that urge since.
When I regained my senses, I was already on the toilet.
The graffiti were all obscene and repetitive.
I imagined the man who drew them.
At least he was tortured by the desire to draw.
I felt evil, alone on the toilet thinking such thoughts.
I laughed out loud.
The crowd rushes about outside, but in here everything is quiet.
This is the place where I'm at best.
I sat at my desk, but the inspiration would not come.
I was afraid to leave my desk, but could not manage to concentrate.
What will I become?
The author of the graffiti, didn't he draw only by going to the toilet?
Or did he deliberately went there to draw?
So you no longer work on children's books?
That is good.
We thought of you for our magazine Play.
What do you say?
But Play is a magazine for adults.
Exactly.
You don't miss talent, but you'll not draw for children.
So come to my office in an hour.
I'll be waiting for you.
Manga for adults?
I had never thought about this genre.
But thinking about it, vibrant images crossed my mind.
I can do it!
This is the opportunity I was waiting for!
It was as if I woke up from a sleep of several years.
I freed you.
My body was boiling with excitement.
My heart beat so violently, I could not sit still.
I have to draw!
This desire occupied all my mind.
The toilet walls were all clean.
The charwoman had made the effort to clean them.
What ails you?
A pervert!
In the toilet!
There's a pervert in the toilet.
Call the police.
What is it?
A pervert?
Is it him?
Quick, call the police!
Like the hero of Occupied.
I had no other choice than to publish in monthly or weekly journals.
The stories you have seen were all written in the seventies.
All my works from this period are imbued with a deep malaise .
This was the period of large growth in Japan and many Japanese enjoyed that wealth.
I could not bear to see all these euphoric and indecent people.
The wave of wealth didn't caught on to us, neither to me nor to the people surrounding me.
My anger against this state of affairs concentrated in a black mass at the bottom of my heart.
This is one explanation.
I devise my stories more and more often in cafés close to me.
I attend four different cafés to work on my stories.
My wife was working in one of those cafés.
We settled down together, of course.
I never knew anything besides drawing and I lived just on my works.
Dealing with a white sheet, a pencil in the hand for drawing tirelessly, is a hard and lonely work.
Once cured of his chest disease,
Okichan had no other choice than to opt for an ordinary job distant from Manga.
It has been very hard for him with his health problems.
My greatest joy is to invent stories.
It's an opportunity to rediscover and glimpse into unknown worlds.
A Manga is 70% complete, once the story is defined.
The remaining 30%, it's fun to draw.
But my ideal is not so much of developing stories, but passionately giving life to images, gushing spontaneously from my mind.
Everything artificial resembles a lie.
Come!
Joe, come!
I'm coming, baby!
I love you, Mari.
I love you so much.
We will get married, okay?
No worry, no worry.
I'm okay.
No, no.
I'll marry you and
I'll take you back to America.
Again, the brats from next door.
Hey, you whore!
Beat it!
Get the hell out of here!
Ouch!
Bitch!
Soldiers slut!
Mariko, are you okay?
What do you want, again?
Why talk like that to your old father.
I just came to see my little darling.
I took the liberty to return.
You promised me not to come back anymore.
A new client?
This is not the same sergeant as before.
How do you do?
I'm this girls father.
Father?
Yes, yes, papa.
Thank you very much.
Mariko, you allowed yourself a nice big bed.
It's because these Americans are beefy!
What is with the money?
You came for that, right?
So take it and go away.
This is unfair.
Is this any way to treat a father who came to see his daughter?
You are very ungrateful.
That does not work on me anymore.
The last time you pulled that trick, my ring was gone with your departure.
I know I'm a bad father.
Everything is my fault.
You, a father?
You steal the money I earn from selling my body.
I don't think of you as a father.
I'm going.
And never come back!
Mari, your poor father is crying.
No, it's just theatre.
I'll not bother you anymore.
Take care of yourself.
Now, you are crying.
Poor thing.
Rotgut
Barkeeper, another one!
It's not my fault that we lost the war.
She thinks she's an American ...
Hey, you!
What are you looking at?
Hey!
Leave us alone!
Stop drooling!
We are the dolls of the Yanks!
Learn that lesson!
Joe, let's drink.
I want to get drunk.
♫ I read my future ♫
♫ in the stream of stars ♫
You drink during the day?
Business must be good!
This season the rain exceeded the limits.
How's the Yank ...
Joe, right?
That bastard is back in America.
He fucked me.
He has a wife and children there.
So you drown your sorrows in alcohol?
Good-bye!
I don't care about the future!
All men are dirty perverts!
Mariko, stop!
You are hurting yourself.
Why do you interfere?
Do not play father now.
What are you doing, Mariko!
Stop it!
That is more like it.
I don't need a family.
This is just a man, like any other.
Good-bye.
I'm now 75 years old.
I don't know if I still have the energy to give birth to numerous works, but I'd like to draw new worlds, again.

The times with you and the children,
I've never been happier.
You made me pregnant.

That blood is thicker than water.

- Come out from there.
You're upsetting your sister.
No!
- You're home.
- Be it ever so humble.
What's the problem?
Why is he under there?
He doesn't want to go to school.
You want to grow up to be a fishmonger?
- Yes!
- No, you don't.
You want to be a doctor or something, remember?
- Like Dr. Surran.
- Sister Bernice--
He was misbehaving apparently and she took the ruler to him.
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.
- Well, nuns don't just go around hitting people.

A nun hit me when I was your age, I'd get another whipping from my dad.
Go with Katy, dear.

- You too.
- This way, sweethearts.
Come on.
It's nearly 8:00 a.m.

I'll take some ham and some eggs.
Oh, well, I know how he likes them, dear.

- Yeah.
- Jimmy.
- What?
- He's too young.
- No, I'm not.
I was his age, I used to go all the time.
Younger, with your father.
Actually it was with Nucky mostly.
- I don't think it's safe.
- Tommy:
Please!
- Please please.
- Jimmy:
Come on.
He's a big boy.
Relax, Ange.
You worry too much.
- Tommy:
Please!
- Make sure he dresses warmly.
- All right, come on, let's go.
- Your plaid pants.
- Got it.
- You got it?
And be careful.
Are we gonna shoot some real seagulls with real guns?
Yes, we are.
- I really wish you wouldn't do that.
- Do what, dear?
- Undercut me.
- Oh, sweetie,
I would never.
You're his wife.
Yes, and I'm Tommy's mother.
( faintly ) No problem.
I was only trying to help, dear-- as your husband's mother.
Boys will be boys, after all.
You know, when Jimmy was a baby and I would change his diaper...
I used to kiss his little winkie.
( men grunting )

Sir, we weren't expecting you, sir.
Mrs. Van Alden wanted to see the office.
The field reports, we were just about to hop to it.
I take almost no comfort in "about to," agent Clarkson.
- Yes sir.
- Van Alden:
Gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce my wife.
Dear, these are agents Sawicki and Clarkson.
- Ma'am.
- How do you do?
Agent Sawicki is of polish stock.
He joins us from Mt.
Olivet.
Outside Pittsburgh.
Yes, they have a large Christian community.
Mrs. Van Alden is visiting for the weekend.
Well, there's no shortage of wholesome entertainment.
I picked up this tourist guide
Yesterday.
Oh.
- Does it list the churches?
- Clarkson:
I assume so.
- I haven't read it yet.
- Oh.
Consider it a gift.
Thank you.
If I'm needed, we're staying at the hotel Metropole.
Though I anticipate we'll be out mostly, taking in the sights.
Save the roughhouse for your own time, gentlemen.
Both:
Yes sir.
( music playing )
( giggling, chatting )
Man:
That's a fine how-do-you-do.
Woman:
It's so hot.
I could just come down on the weekend.
- It's just gonna be another minute.
- What's hurting him now?
He's got an earache.
Mr. Torrio's a man beset by convenient maladies.
- What's that mean?
- Nothing cures him faster than someone else doing his laundry.
I ain't his washerwoman.
( chuckles ) Don't take it personally, kid.
What do you think George Remus spent five years doing?
- Come again?
- I said what do you think
George Remus was doing for him?
Ain't you George Remus?
Who'd you think I was?
You just said it like it was someone else.
Torrio:
This shyster-- had him on a $500 retainer, keep me out of the hoosegow.
Cheaper lawyer, more time in jail.
Why the fuck you move to Cincinnati?
Well, John, draw a circle 300 miles around, know what you get?
- 300 miles of cowshit.
- ( laughter )
And 80% of the bonded whiskey being stored in this country.
- How much's in your pocket?
- Enough to float your speaks, plus a whole lot more.
We're looking to keep business steady-- no heartburn,
No blood on the floor.
Buy from George Remus, there won't be any.
Remus owns the distilleries and the pharmacies they're allowed to sell to.
Even better, Remus owns the trucks that hijack his own liquor.
- That's a neat trick.
- No trick, my boy.
Remus read the Volstead Act very closely.
We oughta be in business with him.
The fuck you talking about?
He's Remus.
I know.
I'm just- 4,000 cases a month.
- You're good for eight easy.
Let's see how it goes.
Buying from Canada, john?
Makes sense.
But you never know what can happen on that lake.
As for Atlantic City, Cincinnati's a lot closer.
And who really likes Nucky Thompson anyway?
I take it Remus doesn't.
A man lays out two grand for a weekend on the shore, he doesn't expect an altercation over the telephone bill.
Well, it's all on the house here, Georgie.
Go say hello to Odette.
( moans )
We'll work out the details later.
Hi.
- When you go to Atlantic City-- - when am I doing that?
Next month, before you head to Brooklyn.
Johnny, I got this thing for my father.
So leave a day early.
Go see Nucky, tell him things have changed.
That's it?
You'll think of something.
Yeah, your fucking laundry.
Straight through Gloucester county, all you can get.
Me and the boys here are gobbling it all up.
- It's pennies an acre.
- ( irish accent ) Because it's worthless land.
- Not for long.
- The road appropriations come through, we steer the planning commissioners right where we want them.
With the old golden handshake?
- Well, how does anything get done, Ernie?
Once that's settled, we sell the land back to the great state of New Jersey.
- At a tenfold profit.
- So how does a fella get a piece?
- Quickly, my boy, quickly.
- The blue plots are all taken.
Jesus, you fellas own all that?
- Not all, but most.
- ( all chuckle )
Land barons of barren land.
And it gets even better.
Once the roads are approved, they're gonna need to be built, right?
It just so happens I have a very close friend in the construction business.
Edward Bader, master builder.
Yeah, with his own two hands.
( laughs )
And you, my friend, are hereby notified we are currently accepting bids to supply the gravel.
- For 40 miles of road?
- You can do the math yourself.
I will.
But in the meantime, let this pave the way in my direction.
Well, it's a fine start.
Perfect, Ernie.
- We're all set for McGarrigle?
- My house Monday night.
- You're a credit to the cause, Nucky.
- Always happy to help.
Nucky, we have an emergency.
There's a reporter calling.
He claims Chalky White has shot a klansman.
- Get my brother--
- I have already called him.
Barker:
Right here on the Atlantic City boardwalk,
- for over 40 years...
- Boy:
Five more minutes?
They have a hotel shaped like an elephant.
It's in Margate-- six stories.
It's quite something.
The tusks are genuine ivory apparently.
Beg your pardon?
The elephant.
We can take a drive.
Oh no.
Thank you.
Who was that?
No one of any consequence.
If you're hungry, there's a soda fountain.
They sell potato cakes called kor-nishes.
- ( gasps )
- What's wrong?
This guide--
It lists the taverns, the houses of ill-repute.
- "If Jesus came to Atlantic City..."
- The places he wouldn't go.
The author's attempt at cynicism.
I'm sorry you had to see that, dear.
Maybe it's better we don't have children.
This world, Nelson.
( piano playing )
Are you sure I can't offer you gentlemen luncheon?
Oh, thank you, Lenore, no.
We need some privacy, dear.
Lester baby?
- It's very nice, Lester.
- Talented.
- Thank you, sir.
- Lester will be attending Morehouse in two years.
The college.
Jesus Christ, what the fuck happened?
It don't matter now, does it?
I took care of it my own self.
You shot a white man in the throat.
Which I had to hear about from some fucking reporter.
Hermanacus, he's a schoolteacher.
The other one lost his arm.
I've got four boys dead in that warehouse.
Half a dozen wounded-- including a woman.
- You know I'll take care of it.
- How I know that?
We're supposed to be protected from these ofays.
- Look, I can't control--
- No, you look!
I'm done with this shit.
- Just like that, huh?
- I got my family and I got my people.
Your people?
The 10,000 black folk who make this city hum.
Busboys, trash collectors, porters.
Meaning what exactly?
Meaning... you go school these crackers,
Lest you all find out.
You do understand
I'm the only thing keeping you from a lynch mob?
Are you ready for what happens here
I turn up on the end of a rope?
Nucky:
Things go that way, your people have a lot more to lose than I do.
You gonna arrest me or not?
I can handle this for now.
Stay in the fucking house.
You can see yourselves out.
This klan shit, Eli, I thought you had it under control.
That is one uppity shine.
Sister Bernice?
I'm Margaret Schroeder, Teddy's mother.
I stopped by the convent.
They told me I could find you here.
Much quieter this time of day.
Ben Franklin...
Apparently he discovered lightning.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you no.
- My son.
- Mm-hmm.
He came home yesterday with bruises.
Where I struck him with a ruler.
Did he tell you why he was punished?
No, not specifically.
What did he tell you?
That he did nothing wrong.
Then you're raising a liar, Mrs. Schroeder.
He was playing with matches... in a coat closet in a school full of children.
I-
- I don't know what to say.
You're a widow,
Is that right?
- I am.
- And you live with Teddy's uncle?
Is my son to be expelled?
No.
Father Brennan intervened.
Apparently he's close with your Mr. Thompson.
Thank you for seeing me.
Eli:
We agreed we were gonna put him out of business, but this-- it's fucking madness.
They had to shoot a woman?
Did you mollycoddle the enemy in France, Jimmy?
He cut off a man's finger.
They were champing at a bit.
10,000 coloreds up in arms now.
The klan boys are in our corner.
There's a lot more than 10,000 of them.
What am I supposed to tell Nucky?
Nucky Thompson was weaned on my teat!
I know him backwards and forwards.
Governor Edwards, he hates the bastard more than I do.
They're ready, him and his people?
Will you stop worrying, for god's sake?
- I need to know what's going on, Lou!
- The less you know the better.
Well, that's just peachy, isn't it?
Worry about yourself, Eli.
I'll handle Nucky.
I gotta go.
Commodore:
Some men, I'll tell you.
You give 'em a badge and a gun, a county treasurership, they think they have power.
Soon you'll see what real power is.
- How soon?
- I want you to start laying some groundwork--
Meet the governor, cultivate relationships;
New York, Philly;
alcohol's the key.
What about here?
Chalky's out of the game, that's a pretty good start.
Got that whole warehouse that's there for the taking.
Jimmy.
Don't worry about Nucky.
I'm not.
Hmm.
Look around, boy.
These animals?
Beasts.
Any one of 'em could've torn me to pieces.
But they didn't.
This fucker, he was a giant.
600lbs, over seven feet tall.
I tracked him for three hours.
Finally cornered him in a ravine.
He smelled me, started comin' closer.
The son of a bitch got confident, thought I was scared.
Reared up on me, puffed up his chest and let out a roar.
I blasted him right in the gut.
Bled out, looking up at me right in the eyes, almost like he couldn't believe it.
You'll be judged by what you succeed at, boy, not by what you attempt.
Nucky:
Last night, four fine young boys were murdered by men claiming to represent the race of white American Christians.
Woman:
Christians?
!
I will not speak the name of that so-called organization within this house of god.
- Congregation:
That's right.
Yeah.
- Amen.
But I can assure you, as treasurer of Atlantic county, and more personally as someone who has always regarded the members of our colored community as his friends and equals, that neither I, sheriff Thompson, or any of his men
will rest until these hooded cowards are brought to justice, and the message is sent loud and clear... that no one need fear
For their safety, or the safety of their wives, children, or property in the face of the obstreperous negro.
- Man #1:
That's right.
- Man #2:
Yes sir.
These coloreds need to learn a lesson, and we are going to teach it with, dare I say in these sacred confines, an iron fist?
I just come from St. Mark's!
Herman Dacus just died from his neck wound.
- ( murmuring )
- It happened.
Eli, find Chalky and place him under arrest-- for his own safety.
Friends, please please.
Remain calm!
- Good afternoon, welcome to preston's.
- How do you do?
Are we celebrating a special occasion?
Our 13th wedding anniversary.
Well, that's lucky.
How so?
Lucky 13.
Are we ready to order?
The lady will have the mutton chops.
- And for the gentlemen?
- Steak.
Turtle soup to start.
And will we be imbibing, sir?
I beg your pardon?
Something to drink perhaps?
For the occasion.
We can accommodate most requests.
The lady will have coffee.
I'll have a glass of cold buttermilk.
Ma'am.
Nelson, he was offering alcohol.
- I realize that, dear.
- Well, aren't you going to arrest him?
- We're here to eat dinner.
- Of course...
But...
Pardon me, dear.
I need to wash up--
Public spaces.
Woman:
Yes, she told me.
Yes, I know.
I'm so sorry.
It was just so awful.
I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
I'm so glad you came here.
Mrs. Dacus, I am so sorry for your loss.
Thank you, Nucky.
He was a pillar of the community and will be sorely missed.
Thank you, Nucky.
Thank you.
Would you excuse us?
What are you doing here?
I came to pay my respects.
Politics is my department.
He was one of my high school teachers.
So?
- So what?
- Yesterday morning
- At Chalky's.
- I was gone.
It happened after we left.
You saw nothing that aroused your suspicion?
Let me go do this.
It's an awful waste of a lot of good tablecloths.
The laundry bills alone.
- So how's Chalky?
- Alive, which is the main thing.
So you run off and get married like a thief in the night?
- You sound like my mother.
- What happened?
You used to ask my advice on things.
My own kid is practically shaving, Nuck.
He like the new place?
I took him shooting.
Fishing too.
Oyster creek,
- like we used to.
- When I was sheriff.
I used to love that.
Standing there for hours, not saying a word.
Is there anything now?
That you want to say?
What do you mean?
Your father is a very duplicitous man.
You've been told.
I told my mother I'd be over for dinner.
Would you care for some butterscotch pudding?
I'm afraid I'm too full.
- I got you something.
- Nelson.
I thought you didn't believe in gifts.
I saw it and I thought of you.
Oh, it's lovely.
Thank you.
- Sir?
- How may I help you?
You mentioned earlier about this being a special occasion.
Indeed.
Have you any champagne?
Whiskey perhaps?
- We do, sir.
- Nelson!
It's all right, dear.
Everybody stay seated.
This is a raid!
All staff members kneel on the floor, hands interlocked atop your heads.
- Agent Clarkson.
- Yes sir?
Van alden:
Secure the contents of the cash drawer.
I want the money counted and documented with an official forfeiture receipt.
Agent Sawicki, break down that door.
Woman:
Oh my god.
Van Alden:
This establishment is being shuttered for violation of the Volstead Act.
It is loaded, sir.
There is over 200 cases of brandy, wine and champagne.
Tag it, catalog it and destroy it.
- What's your name?
- Carl Switzer.
Mr. Switzer, you are hereby under arrest for violation of the Volstead Act.
Agent Sawicki?
( thumping, squeaking )
Right here, this section.
The springs are broken.
- No wonder you're not sleeping.
- Mmm.
We could go to your rooming house.
Men only, dear.
I'm afraid it's not nearly as luxurious.
- I'm very proud of you, Nelson.
- Hmm.
The way you handled those men.
( nervous chuckle )
It's what I'm paid for, dear.
It was thrilling, actually.
I'm not embarrassed to say it.
( moaning )
- Uh-- - huh?
Oh.
( moaning continues )
You're being awfully quiet.
- I saw Jimmy.
- Oh?
And how are the newlyweds getting along?
Fine, I suppose.
He was alone.
We need to send them something.
I already took care of it.
What is it?
He's holding something back.
When he was a kid, he confided in me-- everything.
- Where was his father?
- He was here.
Disinterested.
The commodore needs to be in control.
10-year-old boy?
There's no controlling that.
Now of course, he's around.
- You're jealous.
- I'm angry.
He's got something up his sleeve.
I was father and mother to that kid, with Gillian out all hours?
I nursed him through malaria, took him camping, gave him the run of that goddamn boardwalk.
There is another boy down the hall.
He was playing with matches.
- Matches.
- I saw the sister.
She told me.
- Did you speak to him?
- He offered no explanation.
I'm afraid he's developed a fascination with fire.
What's that all about?
- P.A.:
Now boarding all points west...
- Woman:
Come on, dear.
- Did you have a nice time?
- I did.
Although I suppose I've been kidding myself to think I could live here.
Sodom by the sea.
I miss you, Nelson.
Until next month.
Thank you for a lovely weekend.
Travel safely and with God.
- Man:
Porter, porter!
-P.A.:
Nowboardingforallpoints north:
New York, Mount Vernon, White Plains and Pleasantville.
- Just in time.
- I could smell it from upstairs.
It smells good.
Who was on the telephone?
My father.
He and my mother are gonna take Tommy to the carousel.
What's this?
Oh, from Nucky.
A wedding gift.
Should we open it?
- Is there any coffee?
- It's on the boil.
Thank you.
The coloreds, they won't give us any trouble?
The earlier we get there, the quieter it will be.
You don't have to feel embarrassed to eat in front of us, Richard.
Why don't you take some biscuits for later?
How's that coffee, Ange?
How does it feel to have everything?
Hey, kiddo.
- What are you up to in here?
- Playing soldier.
I'd like to talk to you.
Yes sir.
What are you doing?
Getting ready for the belt.
No no, Teddy, I'm not going to beat you.
You need to mind your mother.
And the sisters at school.
Yes sir.
And no more misbehaving, playing with matches.
Run along now-- the sweetshop.
- And be a good boy.
- Thank you.

What time is it?
Nearly 4:00 p.m.
I fell asleep.
I have your money.
For the last two weeks, right?
Come lay with me, daddy.
You need to sleep in your own room.
Doyle:
And there you have that.
So tell me-- should I be concerned
That there's blood on some of these crates?
Not unless it's your own.
( giggles )
( phone ringing )
Hello?
Eddie:
Nucky, there is a man here from the state's attorney.
He says he must see you.
- What does he want?
- I don't know.
Put him on the line.
He says you must come immediately,
- That it is urgent.
- For god's sake.
Everything all right?
Yes, fine.
I told Teddy we'd all go to the pictures.
The Chaplin film is at the Royal.
- Very well.
- I need to stop by the office first.
I won't be long.
You go, I'll meet you over there.

Enoch Thompson?
- What the hell going on?
- My name is Solomon Bishop.
I'm a deputy with the state's attorney's office.
Mr. Thompson, you're under arrest for election fraud.
- ( music playing ) - ( cops muttering )
( movie projector whirring )
( audience laughing )
( music playing )
In less than two hours, liquor will be declared illegal by decree of our nation's congress.
To those beautiful, ignorant bastards.
You're placing Enoch Thompson at the head of a criminal organization controlling Atlantic county.
Arnold Rothstein and Charlie Luciano.
I have a load coming in tomorrow.
500 crates Canadian Club.
You use your own men for the pickup.
- Jimmy Darmody.
- Al Capone.
- Drop your weapon.
- Get 'em up.
Jimmy left me holding the bag.
Is this the way you do business?
My husband, he has a weakness for the dice games.
This should see you through winter.
Give me that money.
I'm investigating Saturday night's shootings.
We can all rest now that the architect of that slaughter has been killed himself.
You're out, Mickey.
Out of the business.
Chalky White's taking over.
What am I supposed to tell my partners?
- He drives a packard you said.
- But it wasn't Chalky.
You hung a fella that works for him.
Let's go.
You're under arrest.
These here are my daddy tools.
- What are you gonna do with them?
- It wasn't the klan.
The roads to Atlantic City are rivers of mud.
We need paved highways so cars can come and go.
- Mrs. Schroeder is here.
- Who's Mrs. Schroeder?
Don't move!
- You're sure these are the guys who held you up?
- Absolutely.
D'Alessio brothers.
They're being backed by Rothstein and Luciano.
They shot my brother, Mickey.
They shot at me.
You are consorting with the man who killed the father of your children.
Run somebody else for mayor.
- What do I do about Eli?
- Replace him too.
I'm dying.
There's no time to be sentimental.
Accept Jesus as your savior.
This morning I found this hidden in his rubbish pail.
You gonna arrest her or not, sheriff?
He's not.
Go far away.
- What's your name, handsome?
- Nelson.
You know I'm about to be indicted for fixing the world series.
I need a man with your political reach to quash the indictment.
- That could be arranged.
- In exchange for what?
The times with you and the children,
I've never been happier.
You made me pregnant.
- You have to trust me, Eli.
- What does that mean?
That blood is thicker than water.
You're my flesh and blood, boy.
- So?
So you're gonna take back Atlantic City for the both of us.
2x01 - 21 -
Here you go, boss.
Coming your way.
- Come on, let's go!
- All right, I got it, I got it.
I got one.
- Come on, guys.
Come on.
- Here you go.
Come on, fellas.

There.
Orville, go let him in.
I don't pay to play.
Keep your mouths shut and them crates moving.
- Yes sir.
- Here you go.
- Mama!
- The casing's jammed!
Come on.
- Come on!
- It's jammed.
Go on, get in there.
- Just pop that out.
- Hand me that.
- Holy jesus!
- Shut up, shut up!
Purity, sobriety,
And the white Christian's Jesus.
- My arm!
- Get up.
Let's get out of here, come on.
My fucking arm.
Get him up here.
Get him up here, Charlie.
- Get him up here.
- Come on!
- Oh, my arm!
- Get up, get up.
- One of them shot me in the arm, God damn it.
- Go go.
- Go go!
- Come on, move it!
I don't want to go.
I am not in the mood for this, Teddy.
Come out.
- I don't want to!
I will count to three:
One, two, three.
- Teddy.
- I don't want to.
I am warning you, do not turn your back on me, young man.
Come here.
- Mama.
- Come out from there.
You're upsetting your sister.
No!
- You're home.
- Be it ever so humble.
What's the problem?
Why is he under there?
He doesn't want to go to school.
You want to grow up to be a fishmonger?
- Yes!
- No, you don't.
You want to be a doctor or something, remember?
- Like Dr. Surran.
- Sister Bernice--
He was misbehaving apparently and she took the ruler to him.
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.
- Well, nuns don't just go around hitting people.
- She pulled my hair.
A nun hit me when I was your age, I'd get another whipping from my dad.
Go with Katy, dear.
Wash up.
- You too.
- This way, sweethearts.
Come on.
It's nearly 8:00 a.m.
Considering the night I had,
I'm amazed I'm home before 9:00.
I'm sure.
But you do look ravishing.
And ravishable.
Time for school.
Come on.
- I'm not going!
- Yes, you are going.
- Come on.
- I don't want to!
- Let's get your coat.
- Mama!
I'm not going!
I told you.
- Where are you going?
- To the office to get some sleep.
- Do you want your mommy upset?
- No, I told you!
- Mama!
- Teddy!
These eggs taste funny.
Maybe someone made the chicken laugh.
- Oh, there's my handsome man.
- Hey, pal.
Daddy!
- Nucky called?
Was he supposed to?
I'll take some ham and some eggs.
Oh, well, I know how he likes them, dear.
- You want to go shoot some gulls?
- Yeah.
- Jimmy.
- What?
- He's too young.
- No, I'm not.
I was his age, I used to go all the time.
Younger, with your father.
Actually it was with Nucky mostly.
- I don't think it's safe.
- Please!
- Please please.
- Come on.
He's a big boy.
Relax, Ange.
You worry too much.
- Please!
- Make sure he dresses warmly.
- All right, come on, let's go.
- Your plaid pants.
- Got it.
- You got it?
And be careful.
Are we gonna shoot some real seagulls with real guns?
Yes, we are.
- I really wish you wouldn't do that.
- Do what, dear?
- Undercut me.
- Oh, sweetie,
I would never.
You're his wife.
Yes, and I'm Tommy's mother.
No problem.
I was only trying to help, dear-- as your husband's mother.
Boys will be boys, after all.
You know, when Jimmy was a baby and I would change his diaper...
I used to kiss his little winkie.
What is the meaning of this?
!
Move this furniture back into place!
Sir, we weren't expecting you, sir.
Mrs. Van Alden wanted to see the office.
The field reports, we were just about to hop to it.
I take almost no comfort in "about to," agent Clarkson.
- Yes sir.
- Gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce my wife.
Dear, these are agents Sawicki and Clarkson.
- Ma'am.
- How do you do?
Agent Sawicki is of polish stock.
He joins us from Mt.
Olivet.
Outside Pittsburgh.
Yes, they have a large Christian community.
Mrs. Van Alden is visiting for the weekend.
Well, there's no shortage of wholesome entertainment.
I picked up this tourist guide
Yesterday.
Oh.
- Does it list the churches?
- I assume so.
- I haven't read it yet.
- Oh.
Consider it a gift.
Thank you.
If I'm needed, we're staying at the hotel Metropole.
Though I anticipate we'll be out mostly, taking in the sights.
Save the roughhouse for your own time, gentlemen.
Yes sir.
That's a fine how-do-you-do.
It's so hot.
I could just come down on the weekend.
- It's just gonna be another minute.
- What's hurting him now?
He's got an earache.
Mr. Torrio's a man beset by convenient maladies.
- What's that mean?
- Nothing cures him faster than someone else doing his laundry.
I ain't his washerwoman.
Don't take it personally, kid.
What do you think George Remus spent five years doing?
- Come again?
- I said what do you think
George Remus was doing for him?
Ain't you George Remus?
Who'd you think I was?
You just said it like it was someone else.
This shyster-- had him on a $500 retainer, keep me out of the hoosegow.
Cheaper lawyer, more time in jail.
Why the fuck you move to Cincinnati?
Well, John, draw a circle 300 miles around, know what you get?
300 miles of cowshit.
And 80% of the bonded whiskey being stored in this country.
- How much's in your pocket?
- Enough to float your speaks, plus a whole lot more.
We're looking to keep business steady-- no heartburn,
No blood on the floor.
Buy from George Remus, there won't be any.
Remus owns the distilleries and the pharmacies they're allowed to sell to.
Even better, Remus owns the trucks that hijack his own liquor.
- That's a neat trick.
- No trick, my boy.
Remus read the Volstead Act very closely.
We oughta be in business with him.
The fuck you talking about?
He's Remus.
I know.
I'm just- 4,000 cases a month.
- You're good for eight easy.
Let's see how it goes.
Buying from Canada, john?
Makes sense.
But you never know what can happen on that lake.
As for Atlantic City, Cincinnati's a lot closer.
And who really likes Nucky Thompson anyway?
I take it Remus doesn't.
A man lays out two grand for a weekend on the shore, he doesn't expect an altercation over the telephone bill.
Well, it's all on the house here, Georgie.
Go say hello to Odette.
We'll work out the details later.
Hi.
- When you go to Atlantic City-- - when am I doing that?
Next month, before you head to Brooklyn.
Johnny, I got this thing for my father.
So leave a day early.
Go see Nucky, tell him things have changed.
That's it?
You'll think of something.
Yeah, your fucking laundry.
Straight through Gloucester county, all you can get.
Me and the boys here are gobbling it all up.
- It's pennies an acre.
- Because it's worthless land.
- Not for long.
- The road appropriations come through, we steer the planning commissioners right where we want them.
With the old golden handshake?
- Well, how does anything get done, Ernie?
Once that's settled, we sell the land back to the great state of New Jersey.
- At a tenfold profit.
- So how does a fella get a piece?
- Quickly, my boy, quickly.
- The blue plots are all taken.
Jesus, you fellas own all that?
Not all, but most.
Land barons of barren land.
And it gets even better.
Once the roads are approved, they're gonna need to be built, right?
It just so happens I have a very close friend in the construction business.
Edward Bader, master builder.
Yeah, with his own two hands.
And you, my friend, are hereby notified we are currently accepting bids to supply the gravel.
- For 40 miles of road?
- You can do the math yourself.
I will.
But in the meantime, let this pave the way in my direction.
Well, it's a fine start.
Perfect, Ernie.
- We're all set for McGarrigle?
- My house Monday night.
- You're a credit to the cause, Nucky.
- Always happy to help.
Nucky, we have an emergency.
There's a reporter calling.
He claims Chalky White has shot a klansman.
- Get my brother--
- I have already called him.
Right here on the Atlantic City boardwalk,
- for over 40 years...
- Five more minutes?
They have a hotel shaped like an elephant.
It's in Margate-- six stories.
It's quite something.
The tusks are genuine ivory apparently.
Beg your pardon?
The elephant.
We can take a drive.
Oh no.
Thank you.
Who was that?
No one of any consequence.
If you're hungry, there's a soda fountain.
They sell potato cakes called kor-nishes.
- What's wrong?
This guide--
It lists the taverns, the houses of ill-repute.
- "If Jesus came to Atlantic City..."
- The places he wouldn't go.
The author's attempt at cynicism.
I'm sorry you had to see that, dear.
Maybe it's better we don't have children.
This world, Nelson.
Are you sure I can't offer you gentlemen luncheon?
Oh, thank you, Lenore, no.
We need some privacy, dear.
Lester baby?
- It's very nice, Lester.
- Talented.
- Thank you, sir.
- Lester will be attending Morehouse in two years.
The college.
Jesus Christ, what the fuck happened?
It don't matter now, does it?
I took care of it my own self.
You shot a white man in the throat.
Which I had to hear about from some fucking reporter.
Hermanacus, he's a schoolteacher.
The other one lost his arm.
I've got four boys dead in that warehouse.
Half a dozen wounded-- including a woman.
- You know I'll take care of it.
- How I know that?
We're supposed to be protected from these ofays.
- Look, I can't control--
- No, you look!
I'm done with this shit.
- Just like that, huh?
- I got my family and I got my people.
Your people?
The 10,000 black folk who make this city hum.
Busboys, trash collectors, porters.
Meaning what exactly?
Meaning... you go school these crackers,
Lest you all find out.
You do understand
I'm the only thing keeping you from a lynch mob?
Are you ready for what happens here
I turn up on the end of a rope?
Things go that way, your people have a lot more to lose than I do.
You gonna arrest me or not?
I can handle this for now.
Stay in the fucking house.
You can see yourselves out.
This klan shit, Eli, I thought you had it under control.
That is one uppity shine.
Sister Bernice?
I'm Margaret Schroeder, Teddy's mother.
I stopped by the convent.
They told me I could find you here.
Much quieter this time of day.
Ben Franklin...
Apparently he discovered lightning.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you no.
- My son.
- Mm-hmm.
He came home yesterday with bruises.
Where I struck him with a ruler.
Did he tell you why he was punished?
No, not specifically.
What did he tell you?
That he did nothing wrong.
Then you're raising a liar, Mrs. Schroeder.
He was playing with matches... in a coat closet in a school full of children.
I-
- I don't know what to say.
You're a widow,
Is that right?
- I am.
- And you live with Teddy's uncle?
Is my son to be expelled?
No.
Father Brennan intervened.
Apparently he's close with your Mr. Thompson.
Thank you for seeing me.
We agreed we were gonna put him out of business, but this-- it's fucking madness.
They had to shoot a woman?
Did you mollycoddle the enemy in France, Jimmy?
He cut off a man's finger.
They were champing at a bit.
10,000 coloreds up in arms now.
The klan boys are in our corner.
There's a lot more than 10,000 of them.
What am I supposed to tell Nucky?
Nucky Thompson was weaned on my teat!
I know him backwards and forwards.
Governor Edwards, he hates the bastard more than I do.
They're ready, him and his people?
Will you stop worrying, for god's sake?
- I need to know what's going on, Lou!
- The less you know the better.
Well, that's just peachy, isn't it?
Worry about yourself, Eli.
I'll handle Nucky.
I gotta go.
Some men, I'll tell you.
You give 'em a badge and a gun, a county treasurership, they think they have power.
Soon you'll see what real power is.
- How soon?
- I want you to start laying some groundwork--
Meet the governor, cultivate relationships;
New York, Philly;
alcohol's the key.
What about here?
Chalky's out of the game, that's a pretty good start.
Got that whole warehouse that's there for the taking.
Jimmy.
Don't worry about Nucky.
I'm not.
Hmm.
Look around, boy.
These animals?
Beasts.
Any one of 'em could've torn me to pieces.
But they didn't.
This fucker, he was a giant.
600lbs, over seven feet tall.
I tracked him for three hours.
Finally cornered him in a ravine.
He smelled me, started comin' closer.
The son of a bitch got confident, thought I was scared.
Reared up on me, puffed up his chest and let out a roar.
I blasted him right in the gut.
Bled out, looking up at me right in the eyes, almost like he couldn't believe it.
You'll be judged by what you succeed at, boy, not by what you attempt.
Last night, four fine young boys were murdered by men claiming to represent the race of white American Christians.
Christians?
!
I will not speak the name of that so-called organization within this house of god.
That's right.
Yeah.
- Amen.
But I can assure you, as treasurer of Atlantic county, and more personally as someone who has always regarded the members of our colored community as his friends and equals, that neither I, sheriff Thompson, or any of his men
will rest until these hooded cowards are brought to justice, and the message is sent loud and clear... that no one need fear
For their safety, or the safety of their wives, children, or property in the face of the obstreperous negro.
- That's right.
- Yes sir.
These coloreds need to learn a lesson, and we are going to teach it with, dare I say in these sacred confines, an iron fist?
I just come from St. Mark's!
Herman Dacus just died from his neck wound.
- It happened.
Eli, find Chalky and place him under arrest-- for his own safety.
Friends, please please.
Remain calm!
- Good afternoon, welcome to preston's.
- How do you do?
Are we celebrating a special occasion?
Our 13th wedding anniversary.
Well, that's lucky.
How so?
Lucky 13.
Are we ready to order?
The lady will have the mutton chops.
- And for the gentlemen?
- Steak.
Turtle soup to start.
And will we be imbibing, sir?
I beg your pardon?
Something to drink perhaps?
For the occasion.
We can accommodate most requests.
The lady will have coffee.
I'll have a glass of cold buttermilk.
Ma'am.
Nelson, he was offering alcohol.
- I realize that, dear.
- Well, aren't you going to arrest him?
- We're here to eat dinner.
- Of course...
But...
Pardon me, dear.
I need to wash up--
Public spaces.
Yes, she told me.
Yes, I know.
I'm so sorry.
It was just so awful.
I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
I'm so glad you came here.
Mrs. Dacus, I am so sorry for your loss.
Thank you, Nucky.
He was a pillar of the community and will be sorely missed.
Thank you, Nucky.
Thank you.
Would you excuse us?
What are you doing here?
I came to pay my respects.
Politics is my department.
He was one of my high school teachers.
So?
- So what?
- Yesterday morning
- At Chalky's.
- I was gone.
It happened after we left.
You saw nothing that aroused your suspicion?
Let me go do this.
It's an awful waste of a lot of good tablecloths.
The laundry bills alone.
- So how's Chalky?
- Alive, which is the main thing.
So you run off and get married like a thief in the night?
- You sound like my mother.
- What happened?
You used to ask my advice on things.
My own kid is practically shaving, Nuck.
He like the new place?
I took him shooting.
Fishing too.
Oyster creek,
- like we used to.
- When I was sheriff.
I used to love that.
Standing there for hours, not saying a word.
Is there anything now?
That you want to say?
What do you mean?
Your father is a very duplicitous man.
You've been told.
I told my mother I'd be over for dinner.
Would you care for some butterscotch pudding?
I'm afraid I'm too full.
- I got you something.
- Nelson.
I thought you didn't believe in gifts.
I saw it and I thought of you.
Oh, it's lovely.
Thank you.
- Sir?
- How may I help you?
You mentioned earlier about this being a special occasion.
Indeed.
Have you any champagne?
Whiskey perhaps?
- We do, sir.
- Nelson!
It's all right, dear.
Everybody stay seated.
This is a raid!
All staff members kneel on the floor, hands interlocked atop your heads.
- Agent Clarkson.
- Yes sir?
Secure the contents of the cash drawer.
I want the money counted and documented with an official forfeiture receipt.
Agent Sawicki, break down that door.
Oh my god.
This establishment is being shuttered for violation of the Volstead Act.
It is loaded, sir.
There is over 200 cases of brandy, wine and champagne.
Tag it, catalog it and destroy it.
- What's your name?
- Carl Switzer.
Mr. Switzer, you are hereby under arrest for violation of the Volstead Act.
Agent Sawicki?
Right here, this section.
The springs are broken.
- No wonder you're not sleeping.
- Mmm.
We could go to your rooming house.
Men only, dear.
I'm afraid it's not nearly as luxurious.
- I'm very proud of you, Nelson.
- Hmm.
The way you handled those men.
It's what I'm paid for, dear.
It was thrilling, actually.
I'm not embarrassed to say it.
- Uh-- - huh?
Oh.
You're being awfully quiet.
- I saw Jimmy.
- Oh?
And how are the newlyweds getting along?
Fine, I suppose.
He was alone.
We need to send them something.
I already took care of it.
What is it?
He's holding something back.
When he was a kid, he confided in me-- everything.
- Where was his father?
- He was here.
Disinterested.
The commodore needs to be in control.
10-year-old boy?
There's no controlling that.
Now of course, he's around.
- You're jealous.
- I'm angry.
He's got something up his sleeve.
I was father and mother to that kid, with Gillian out all hours?
I nursed him through malaria, took him camping, gave him the run of that goddamn boardwalk.
There is another boy down the hall.
He was playing with matches.
- Matches.
- I saw the sister.
She told me.
- Did you speak to him?
- He offered no explanation.
I'm afraid he's developed a fascination with fire.
What's that all about?
- Now boarding all points west...
- Come on, dear.
- Did you have a nice time?
- I did.
Although I suppose I've been kidding myself to think I could live here.
Sodom by the sea.
I miss you, Nelson.
Until next month.
Thank you for a lovely weekend.
Travel safely and with God.
- Porter, porter!
- Now boarding for all points north:
New York, Mount Vernon, White Plains and Pleasantville.
- Just in time.
- I could smell it from upstairs.
It smells good.
Who was on the telephone?
My father.
He and my mother are gonna take Tommy to the carousel.
What's this?
Oh, from Nucky.
A wedding gift.
Should we open it?
- Is there any coffee?
- It's on the boil.
Thank you.
The coloreds, they won't give us any trouble?
The earlier we get there, the quieter it will be.
You don't have to feel embarrassed to eat in front of us, Richard.
Why don't you take some biscuits for later?
How's that coffee, Ange?
How does it feel to have everything?
Hey, kiddo.
- What are you up to in here?
- Playing soldier.
I'd like to talk to you.
Yes sir.
What are you doing?
Getting ready for the belt.
No no, Teddy, I'm not going to beat you.
You need to mind your mother.
And the sisters at school.
Yes sir.
And no more misbehaving, playing with matches.
Run along now-- the sweetshop.
- And be a good boy.
- Thank you.

Nearly 4:00 p.m.
I fell asleep.
I have your money.
For the last two weeks, right?
Come lay with me, daddy.
You need to sleep in your own room.
And there you have that.
So tell me-- should I be concerned
That there's blood on some of these crates?
Not unless it's your own.
Hello?
Nucky, there is a man here from the state's attorney.
He says he must see you.
- What does he want?
- I don't know.
Put him on the line.
He says you must come immediately,
- That it is urgent.
- For god's sake.
Everything all right?
Yes, fine.
I told Teddy we'd all go to the pictures.
The Chaplin film is at the Royal.
- Very well.

Enoch Thompson?
- What the hell going on?
- My name is Solomon Bishop.
I'm a deputy with the state's attorney's office.
Mr. Thompson, you're under arrest for election fraud.
In less than two hours, liquor will be declared illegal by decree of our nation's congress.
To those beautiful, ignorant bastards.
You're placing Enoch Thompson at the head of a criminal organization controlling Atlantic county.
Arnold Rothstein and Charlie Luciano.
I have a load coming in tomorrow.
500 crates Canadian Club.
You use your own men for the pickup.
- Jimmy Darmody.
- Al Capone.
- Drop your weapon.
- Get 'em up.
Jimmy left me holding the bag.
Is this the way you do business?
My husband, he has a weakness for the dice games.
This should see you through winter.
Give me that money.
I'm investigating Saturday night's shootings.
We can all rest now that the architect of that slaughter has been killed himself.
You're out, Mickey.
Out of the business.
Chalky White's taking over.
What am I supposed to tell my partners?
- He drives a packard you said.
- But it wasn't Chalky.
You hung a fella that works for him.
Let's go.
You're under arrest.
These here are my daddy tools.
- What are you gonna do with them?
- It wasn't the Klan.
The roads to Atlantic City are rivers of mud.
We need paved highways so cars can come and go.
- Mrs. Schroeder is here.
- Who's Mrs. Schroeder?
Don't move!
- You're sure these are the guys who held you up?
- Absolutely.
D'Alessio brothers.
They're being backed by Rothstein and Luciano.
They shot my brother, Mickey.
They shot at me.
You are consorting with the man who killed the father of your children.
Run somebody else for mayor.
- What do I do about Eli?
- Replace him too.
I'm dying.
There's no time to be sentimental.
Accept Jesus as your savior.
This morning I found this hidden in his rubbish pail.
You gonna arrest her or not, Sheriff?
He's not.
Go far away.
- What's your name, handsome?
- Nelson.
You know I'm about to be indicted for fixing the World Series.
I need a man with your political reach to quash the indictment.
- That could be arranged.
- In exchange for what?
The times with you and the children,
I've never been happier.
You made me pregnant.
- You have to trust me, Eli.
- What does that mean?
That blood is thicker than water.
- You're my flesh and blood, boy.
- So?
So you're gonna take back Atlantic City for the both of us.
Here you go, boss.
Coming your way.
- Come on, let's go!
- All right, I got it, I got it.
I got one.
- Come on, guys.
Come on.
- Here you go.
Come on, fellas.

There.
Orville, go let him in.
I don't pay to play.
Keep your mouths shut and them crates moving.
- Yes sir.
- Here you go.
Mama!
The casing's jammed!
Come on.
- Come on!
- It's jammed.
Go on, get in there.
- Just pop that out.
- Hand me that.
- Holy Jesus!
- Shut up, shut up!
Purity, sobriety,
And the white Christian's Jesus.
- My arm!
- Get up.
Let's get out of here, come on.
My fucking arm.
Get him up here.
Get him up here, Charlie.
- Get him up here.
- Come on!
- Oh, my arm!
- Get up, get up.
- One of them shot me in the arm, God damn it.
- Go go.
- Go go!
- Come on, move it!
- I don't want to go.
- I am not in the mood for this, Teddy.
Come out.
I don't want to!
I will count to three:
One, two, three.
- Teddy.
- I don't want to.
I am warning you, do not turn your back on me, young man.
Come here.
- Mama.
- Come out from there.
You're upsetting your sister.
No!
- You're home.
- Be it ever so humble.
What's the problem?
Why is he under there?
He doesn't want to go to school.
You want to grow up to be a fishmonger?
- Yes!
- No, you don't.
You want to be a doctor or something, remember?
- Like Dr. Surran.
- Sister Bernice--
He was misbehaving apparently and she took the ruler to him.
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.
- Well, nuns don't just go around hitting people.
- She pulled my hair.
A nun hit me when I was your age, I'd get another whipping from my dad.
Go with Katy, dear.
Wash up.
- You too.
- This way, sweethearts.
Come on.
It's nearly 8:00 a.m.
Considering the night I had,
I'm amazed I'm home before 9:00.
I'm sure.
But you do look ravishing.
And ravishable.
Time for school.
Come on.
- I'm not going!
- Yes, you are going.
- Come on.
- I don't want to!
- Let's get your coat.
- Mama!
I'm not going!
I told you.
- Where are you going?
- To the office to get some sleep.
- Do you want your mommy upset?
- No, I told you!
- Mama!
- Teddy!
These eggs taste funny.
Maybe someone made the chicken laugh.
- Oh, there's my handsome man.
- Hey, pal.
Daddy!
Nucky called?
Was he supposed to?
I'll take some ham and some eggs.
Oh, well, I know how he likes them, dear.
- You want to go shoot some gulls?
- Yeah.
- Jimmy.
- What?
- He's too young.
- No, I'm not.
I was his age, I used to go all the time.
Younger, with your father.
Actually it was with Nucky mostly.
- I don't think it's safe.
- Please!
- Please please.
- Come on.
He's a big boy.
Relax, Ange.
You worry too much.
- Please!
- Make sure he dresses warmly.
- All right, come on, let's go.
- Your plaid pants.
- Got it.
- You got it?
And be careful.
Are we gonna shoot some real seagulls with real guns?
Yes, we are.
- I really wish you wouldn't do that.
- Do what, dear?
- Undercut me.
- Oh, sweetie,
I would never.
You're his wife.
Yes, and I'm Tommy's mother.
No problem.
I was only trying to help, dear-- as your husband's mother.
Boys will be boys, after all.
You know, when Jimmy was a baby and I would change his diaper...
I used to kiss his little winkie.
What is the meaning of this?
!
Move this furniture back into place!
Sir, we weren't expecting you, sir.
Mrs. Van Alden wanted to see the office.
The field reports, we were just about to hop to it.
I take almost no comfort in "about to," Agent Clarkson.
- Yes sir.
- Gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce my wife.
Dear, these are agents Sawicki and Clarkson.
- Ma'am.
- How do you do?
Agent Sawicki is of polish stock.
He joins us from Mt.
Olivet.
Outside Pittsburgh.
Yes, they have a large Christian community.
Mrs. Van Alden is visiting for the weekend.
Well, there's no shortage of wholesome entertainment.
I picked up this tourist guide... yesterday.
Oh.
- Does it list the churches?
- I assume so.
- I haven't read it yet.
- Oh.
Consider it a gift.
Thank you.
If I'm needed, we're staying at the Hotel Metropole.
Though I anticipate we'll be out mostly, taking in the sights.
Save the roughhouse for your own time, gentlemen.
Yes sir.
That's a fine how-do-you-do.
It's so hot.
I could just come down on the weekend.
- It's just gonna be another minute.
- What's hurting him now?
He's got an earache.
Mr. Torrio's a man beset by convenient maladies.
- What's that mean?
- Nothing cures him faster than someone else doing his laundry.
I ain't his washerwoman.
Don't take it personally, kid.
What do you think George Remus spent five years doing?
- Come again?
- I said what do you think
George Remus was doing for him?
Ain't you George Remus?
Who'd you think I was?
You just said it like it was someone else.
This shyster-- had him on a $500 retainer, keep me out of the hoosegow.
Cheaper lawyer, more time in jail.
Why the fuck you move to Cincinnati?
Well, John, draw a circle 300 miles around, know what you get?
300 miles of cowshit.
And 80% of the bonded whiskey being stored in this country.
- How much's in your pocket?
- Enough to float your speaks, plus a whole lot more.
We're looking to keep business steady-- no heartburn,
No blood on the floor.
Buy from George Remus, there won't be any.
Remus owns the distilleries and the pharmacies they're allowed to sell to.
Even better, Remus owns the trucks that hijack his own liquor.
- That's a neat trick.
- No trick, my boy.
Remus read the Volstead Act very closely.
We oughta be in business with him.
The fuck you talking about?
He's Remus.
I know.
I'm just- 4,000 cases a month.
- You're good for eight easy.
Let's see how it goes.
Buying from Canada, John?
Makes sense.
But you never know what can happen on that lake.
As for Atlantic City, Cincinnati's a lot closer.
And who really likes Nucky Thompson anyway?
I take it Remus doesn't.
A man lays out two grand for a weekend on the shore, he doesn't expect an altercation over the telephone bill.
Well, it's all on the house here, Georgie.
Go say hello to Odette.
We'll work out the details later.
Hi.
- When you go to Atlantic City--
- When am I doing that?
Next month, before you head to Brooklyn.
Johnny, I got this thing for my father.
So leave a day early.
Go see Nucky, tell him things have changed.
That's it?
You'll think of something.
Yeah, your fucking laundry.
Straight through Gloucester county, all you can get.
Me and the boys here are gobbling it all up.
- It's pennies an acre.
- Because it's worthless land.
- Not for long.
- The road appropriations come through, we steer the planning commissioners right where we want them.
With the old golden handshake?
Well, how does anything get done, Ernie?
Once that's settled, we sell the land back to the great state of New Jersey.
- At a tenfold profit.
- So how does a fella get a piece?
- Quickly, my boy, quickly.
- The blue plots are all taken.
Jesus, you fellas own all that?
Not all, but most.
Land barons of barren land.
And it gets even better.
Once the roads are approved, they're gonna need to be built, right?
It just so happens I have a very close friend in the construction business.
Edward Bader, master builder.
Yeah, with his own two hands.
And you, my friend, are hereby notified we are currently accepting bids to supply the gravel.
- For 40 miles of road?
- You can do the math yourself.
I will.
But in the meantime, let this pave the way in my direction.
Well, it's a fine start.
Perfect, Ernie.
- We're all set for McGarrigle?
- My house Monday night.
- You're a credit to the cause, Nucky.
- Always happy to help.
Nucky, we have an emergency.
There's a reporter calling.
He claims Chalky White has shot a Klansman.
- Get my brother--
- I have already called him.
Right here on the Atlantic City boardwalk,
- for over 40 years...
- Five more minutes?
They have a hotel shaped like an elephant.
It's in Margate-- six stories.
It's quite something.
The tusks are genuine ivory apparently.
Beg your pardon?
The elephant.
We can take a drive.
Oh no.
Thank you.
Who was that?
No one of any consequence.
If you're hungry, there's a soda fountain.
They sell potato cakes called kor-nishes.
What's wrong?
This guide--
It lists the taverns, the houses of ill-repute.
- "If Jesus came to Atlantic City..."
- The places he wouldn't go.
The author's attempt at cynicism.
I'm sorry you had to see that, dear.
Maybe it's better we don't have children.
This world, Nelson.
Are you sure I can't offer you gentlemen luncheon?
Oh, thank you, Lenore, no.
We need some privacy, dear.
Lester baby?
- It's very nice, Lester.
- Talented.
- Thank you, sir.
- Lester will be attending Morehouse in two years.
The college.
Jesus Christ, what the fuck happened?
It don't matter now, does it?
I took care of it my own self.
You shot a white man in the throat.
Which I had to hear about from some fucking reporter.
Hermanacus, he's a schoolteacher.
The other one lost his arm.
I've got four boys dead in that warehouse.
Half a dozen wounded-- including a woman.
- You know I'll take care of it.
- How I know that?
We're supposed to be protected from these ofays.
- Look, I can't control--
- No, you look!
I'm done with this shit.
- Just like that, huh?
- I got my family and I got my people.
Your people?
The 10,000 black folk who make this city hum.
Busboys, trash collectors, porters.
Meaning what exactly?
Meaning... you go school these crackers, lest you all find out.
You do understand
I'm the only thing keeping you from a lynch mob?
Are you ready for what happens here
I turn up on the end of a rope?
Things go that way, your people have a lot more to lose than I do.
You gonna arrest me or not?
I can handle this for now.
Stay in the fucking house.
You can see yourselves out.
This Klan shit, Eli, I thought you had it under control.
That is one uppity shine.
Sister Bernice?
I'm Margaret Schroeder, Teddy's mother.
I stopped by the convent.
They told me I could find you here.
Much quieter this time of day.
Ben Franklin...
Apparently he discovered lightning.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you no.
- My son.
- Mm-hmm.
He came home yesterday with bruises.
Where I struck him with a ruler.
Did he tell you why he was punished?
No, not specifically.
What did he tell you?
That he did nothing wrong.
Then you're raising a liar, Mrs. Schroeder.
He was playing with matches... in a coat closet in a school full of children.
I-
- I don't know what to say.
You're a widow.
Is that right?
- I am.
- And you live with Teddy's uncle?
Is my son to be expelled?
No.
Father Brennan intervened.
Apparently he's close with your Mr. Thompson.
Thank you for seeing me.
We agreed we were gonna put him out of business, but this-- it's fucking madness.
They had to shoot a woman?
Did you mollycoddle the enemy in France, Jimmy?
He cut off a man's finger.
They were champing at a bit.
10,000 coloreds up in arms now.
The Klan boys are in our corner.
There's a lot more than 10,000 of them.
What am I supposed to tell Nucky?
Nucky Thompson was weaned on my teat!
I know him backwards and forwards.
Governor Edwards, he hates the bastard more than I do.
They're ready, him and his people?
Will you stop worrying, for god's sake?
- I need to know what's going on, Lou!
- The less you know the better.
Well, that's just peachy, isn't it?
Worry about yourself, Eli.
I'll handle Nucky.
I gotta go.
Some men, I'll tell you.
You give 'em a badge and a gun, a county treasurership, they think they have power.
Soon you'll see what real power is.
- How soon?
- I want you to start laying some groundwork--
Meet the governor, cultivate relationships;
New York, Philly;
alcohol's the key.
What about here?
Chalky's out of the game, that's a pretty good start.
Got that whole warehouse that's there for the taking.
Jimmy.
Don't worry about Nucky.
I'm not.
Hmm.
Look around, boy.
These animals?
Beasts.
Any one of 'em could've torn me to pieces.
But they didn't.
This fucker, he was a giant.
600 lbs, over seven feet tall.
I tracked him for three hours.
Finally cornered him in a ravine.
He smelled me, started comin' closer.
The son of a bitch got confident, thought I was scared.
Reared up on me, puffed up his chest and let out a roar.
I blasted him right in the gut.
Bled out, looking up at me right in the eyes, almost like he couldn't believe it.
You'll be judged by what you succeed at, boy, not by what you attempt.
Last night, four fine young boys were murdered by men claiming to represent the race of white American Christians.
Christians?
!
I will not speak the name of that so-called organization within this house of god.
- That's right.
Yeah.
- Amen.
But I can assure you, as treasurer of Atlantic county, and more personally as someone who has always regarded the members of our colored community as his friends and equals, that neither I, Sheriff Thompson, or any of his men
will rest until these hooded cowards are brought to justice, and the message is sent loud and clear... that no one need fear for their safety, or the safety of their wives, children, or property in the face of the obstreperous negro.
- That's right.
- Yes sir.
These coloreds need to learn a lesson, and we are going to teach it with, dare I say in these sacred confines, an iron fist?
I just come from St. Mark's!
Herman Dacus just died from his neck wound.
It happened.
Eli, find Chalky and place him under arrest-- for his own safety.
Friends, please please.
Remain calm!
- Good afternoon, welcome to Preston's.
- How do you do?
Are we celebrating a special occasion?
Our 13th wedding anniversary.
Well, that's lucky.
How so?
Lucky 13.
Are we ready to order?
The lady will have the mutton chops.
- And for the gentlemen?
- Steak.
Turtle soup to start.
And will we be imbibing, sir?
I beg your pardon?
Something to drink perhaps?
For the occasion.
We can accommodate most requests.
The lady will have coffee.
I'll have a glass of cold buttermilk.
Ma'am.
Nelson, he was offering alcohol.
- I realize that, dear.
- Well, aren't you going to arrest him?
- We're here to eat dinner.
- Of course...
But...
Pardon me, dear.
I need to wash up--
Public spaces.
Yes, she told me.
Yes, I know.
I'm so sorry.
It was just so awful.
I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
I'm so glad you came here.
Mrs. Dacus, I am so sorry for your loss.
Thank you, Nucky.
He was a pillar of the community and will be sorely missed.
Thank you, Nucky.
Thank you.
Would you excuse us?
What are you doing here?
I came to pay my respects.
Politics is my department.
He was one of my high school teachers.
So?
- So what?
- Yesterday morning...
- at Chalky's.
- I was gone.
It happened after we left.
You saw nothing that aroused your suspicion?
Let me go do this.
It's an awful waste of a lot of good tablecloths.
The laundry bills alone.
- So how's Chalky?
- Alive, which is the main thing.
So you run off and get married like a thief in the night?
- You sound like my mother.
- What happened?
You used to ask my advice on things.
My own kid is practically shaving, Nuck.
He like the new place?
I took him shooting.
Fishing too.
Oyster creek,
- like we used to.
- When I was Sheriff.
I used to love that.
Standing there for hours, not saying a word.
Is there anything now?
That you want to say?
What do you mean?
Your father is a very duplicitous man.
You've been told.
I told my mother I'd be over for dinner.
Would you care for some butterscotch pudding?
I'm afraid I'm too full.
- I got you something.
- Nelson.
I thought you didn't believe in gifts.
I saw it and I thought of you.
Oh, it's lovely.
Thank you.
- Sir?
- How may I help you?
You mentioned earlier about this being a special occasion.
Indeed.
Have you any champagne?
Whiskey perhaps?
- We do, sir.
- Nelson!
It's all right, dear.
Everybody stay seated.
This is a raid!
All staff members kneel on the floor, hands interlocked atop your heads.
- Agent Clarkson.
- Yes sir?
Secure the contents of the cash drawer.
I want the money counted and documented with an official forfeiture receipt.
Agent Sawicki, break down that door.
Oh my god.
This establishment is being shuttered for violation of the Volstead Act.
It is loaded, sir.
There is over 200 cases of brandy, wine and champagne.
Tag it, catalog it and destroy it.
- What's your name?
- Carl Switzer.
Mr. Switzer, you are hereby under arrest for violation of the Volstead Act.
Agent Sawicki?
Right here, this section.
The springs are broken.
- No wonder you're not sleeping.
- Mmm.
We could go to your rooming house.
Men only, dear.
I'm afraid it's not nearly as luxurious.
- I'm very proud of you, Nelson.
- Hmm.
The way you handled those men.
It's what I'm paid for, dear.
It was thrilling, actually.
I'm not embarrassed to say it.
- Uh--
- Huh?
Oh.
You're being awfully quiet.
- I saw Jimmy.
- Oh?
And how are the newlyweds getting along?
Fine, I suppose.
He was alone.
We need to send them something.
I already took care of it.
What is it?
He's holding something back.
When he was a kid, he confided in me-- everything.
- Where was his father?
- He was here.
Disinterested.
The commodore needs to be in control.
10-year-old boy?
There's no controlling that.
Now of course, he's around.
- You're jealous.
- I'm angry.
He's got something up his sleeve.
I was father and mother to that kid, with Gillian out all hours?
I nursed him through malaria, took him camping, gave him the run of that goddamn boardwalk.
There is another boy down the hall.
He was playing with matches.
- Matches.
- I saw the sister.
She told me.
- Did you speak to him?
- He offered no explanation.
I'm afraid he's developed a fascination with fire.
What's that all about?
- Now boarding all points west...
- Come on, dear.
- Did you have a nice time?
- I did.
Although I suppose I've been kidding myself to think I could live here.
Sodom by the sea.
I miss you, Nelson.
Until next month.
Thank you for a lovely weekend.
Travel safely and with God.
- Porter, porter!
- Now boarding for all points north:
New York, Mount Vernon, White Plains and Pleasantville.
- Just in time.
- I could smell it from upstairs.
It smells good.
Who was on the telephone?
My father.
He and my mother are gonna take Tommy to the carousel.
What's this?
Oh, from Nucky.
A wedding gift.
Should we open it?
- Is there any coffee?
- It's on the boil.
Thank you.
The coloreds, they won't give us any trouble?
The earlier we get there, the quieter it will be.
You don't have to feel embarrassed to eat in front of us, Richard.
Why don't you take some biscuits for later?
How's that coffee, Ange?
How does it feel to have everything?
Hey, kiddo.
- What are you up to in here?
- Playing soldier.
I'd like to talk to you.
Yes sir.
What are you doing?
Getting ready for the belt.
No no, Teddy, I'm not going to beat you.
You need to mind your mother.
And the sisters at school.
Yes sir.
And no more misbehaving, playing with matches.
Run along now-- the sweetshop.
- And be a good boy.
- Thank you.

Nearly 4:00 p.m.
I fell asleep.
I have your money.
For the last two weeks, right?
Come lay with me, daddy.
You need to sleep in your own room.
And there you have that.
So tell me-- should I be concerned that there's blood on some of these crates?
Not unless it's your own.
Hello?
Nucky, there is a man here from the state's attorney.
He says he must see you.
- What does he want?
- I don't know.
Put him on the line.
He says you must come immediately.
- That it is urgent.
- For god's sake.
Everything all right?
Yes, fine.
I told Teddy we'd all go to the pictures.
The Chaplin film is at the Royal.
- Very well.
- I need to stop by the office first.

Enoch Thompson?
- What the hell going on?
- My name is Solomon Bishop.
I'm a deputy with the state's attorney's office.
Mr. Thompson, you're under arrest for election fraud.
In less than two hours, liquor will be declared illegal by decree of our nation's congress.
To those beautiful, ignorant bastards.
You're placing Enoch Thompson at the head of a criminal organization controlling Atlantic county.
Arnold Rothstein and Charlie Luciano.
I have a load coming in tomorrow.
500 crates Canadian Club.
You use your own men for the pickup.
- Jimmy Darmody.
- Al Capone.
- Drop your weapon.
- Get 'em up.
Jimmy left me holding the bag.
Is this the way you do business?
My husband, he has a weakness for the dice games.
This should see you through winter.
Give me that money.
I'm investigating Saturday night's shootings.
We can all rest now that the architect of that slaughter has been killed himself.
You're out, Mickey.
Out of the business.
Chalky White's taking over.
What am I supposed to tell my partners?
- He drives a packard you said.
- But it wasn't Chalky.
You hung a fella that works for him.
Let's go.
You're under arrest.
These here are my daddy tools.
- What are you gonna do with them?
- It wasn't the klan.
The roads to Atlantic City are rivers of mud.
We need paved highways so cars can come and go.
- Mrs. Schroeder is here.
- Who's Mrs. Schroeder?
Don't move!
- You're sure these are the guys who held you up?
- Absolutely.
D'Alessio brothers.
They're being backed by Rothstein and Luciano.
They shot my brother, Mickey.
They shot at me.
You are consorting with the man who killed the father of your children.
Run somebody else for mayor.
- What do I do about Eli?
- Replace him too.
I'm dying.
There's no time to be sentimental.
Accept Jesus as your savior.
This morning I found this hidden in his rubbish pail.
You gonna arrest her or not, sheriff?
He's not.
Go far away.
- What's your name, handsome?
- Nelson.
You know I'm about to be indicted for fixing the world series.
I need a man with your political reach to quash the indictment.
- That could be arranged.
- In exchange for what?
The times with you and the children,
I've never been happier.
You made me pregnant.
- You have to trust me, Eli.
- What does that mean?
That blood is thicker than water.
You're my flesh and blood, boy.
- So?
So you're gonna take back Atlantic City for the both of us.
Here you go, boss.
Coming your way.
- Come on, let's go!
- All right, I got it, I got it.
I got one.
- Come on, guys.
Come on.
- Here you go.
Come on, fellas.

There.
Orville, go let him in.
I don't pay to play.
Keep your mouths shut and them crates moving.
- Yes sir.
- Here you go.
- Mama!
- The casing's jammed!
Come on.
- Come on!
- It's jammed.
Go on, get in there.
- Just pop that out.
- Hand me that.
- Holy jesus!
- Shut up, shut up!
Purity, sobriety,
And the white Christian's Jesus.
- My arm!
- Get up.
Let's get out of here, come on.
My fucking arm.
Get him up here.
Get him up here, Charlie.
- Get him up here.
- Come on!
- Oh, my arm!
- Get up, get up.
- One of them shot me in the arm, God damn it.
- Go go.
- Go go!
- Come on, move it!
I don't want to go.
I am not in the mood for this, Teddy.
Come out.
- I don't want to!
I will count to three:
One, two, three.
- Teddy.
- I don't want to.
I am warning you, do not turn your back on me, young man.
Come here.
- Mama.
- Come out from there.
You're upsetting your sister.
No!
- You're home.
- Be it ever so humble.
What's the problem?
Why is he under there?
He doesn't want to go to school.
You want to grow up to be a fishmonger?
- Yes!
- No, you don't.
You want to be a doctor or something, remember?
- Like Dr. Surran.
- Sister Bernice--
He was misbehaving apparently and she took the ruler to him.
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.
- Well, nuns don't just go around hitting people.
- She pulled my hair.
A nun hit me when I was your age, I'd get another whipping from my dad.
Go with Katy, dear.
Wash up.
- You too.
- This way, sweethearts.
Come on.
It's nearly 8:00 a.m.
Considering the night I had,
I'm amazed I'm home before 9:00.
I'm sure.
But you do look ravishing.
And ravishable.
Time for school.
Come on.
- I'm not going!
- Yes, you are going.
- Come on.
- I don't want to!
- Let's get your coat.
- Mama!
I'm not going!
I told you.
- Where are you going?
- To the office to get some sleep.
- Do you want your mommy upset?
- No, I told you!
- Mama!
- Teddy!
These eggs taste funny.
Maybe someone made the chicken laugh.
- Oh, there's my handsome man.
- Hey, pal.
Daddy!
- Nucky called?
Was he supposed to?
I'll take some ham and some eggs.
Oh, well, I know how he likes them, dear.
- You want to go shoot some gulls?
- Yeah.
- Jimmy.
- What?
- He's too young.
- No, I'm not.
I was his age, I used to go all the time.
Younger, with your father.
Actually it was with Nucky mostly.
- I don't think it's safe.
- Please!
- Please please.
- Come on.
He's a big boy.
Relax, Ange.
You worry too much.
- Please!
- Make sure he dresses warmly.
- All right, come on, let's go.
- Your plaid pants.
- Got it.
- You got it?
And be careful.
Are we gonna shoot some real seagulls with real guns?
Yes, we are.
- I really wish you wouldn't do that.
- Do what, dear?
- Undercut me.
- Oh, sweetie,
I would never.
You're his wife.
Yes, and I'm Tommy's mother.
No problem.
I was only trying to help, dear-- as your husband's mother.
Boys will be boys, after all.
You know, when Jimmy was a baby and I would change his diaper...
I used to kiss his little winkie.
What is the meaning of this?
!
Move this furniture back into place!
Sir, we weren't expecting you, sir.
Mrs. Van Alden wanted to see the office.
The field reports, we were just about to hop to it.
I take almost no comfort in "about to," agent Clarkson.
- Yes sir.
- Gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce my wife.
Dear, these are agents Sawicki and Clarkson.
- Ma'am.
- How do you do?
Agent Sawicki is of polish stock.
He joins us from Mt.
Olivet.
Outside Pittsburgh.
Yes, they have a large Christian community.
Mrs. Van Alden is visiting for the weekend.
Well, there's no shortage of wholesome entertainment.
I picked up this tourist guide
Yesterday.
Oh.
- Does it list the churches?
- I assume so.
- I haven't read it yet.
- Oh.
Consider it a gift.
Thank you.
If I'm needed, we're staying at the hotel Metropole.
Though I anticipate we'll be out mostly, taking in the sights.
Save the roughhouse for your own time, gentlemen.
Yes sir.
That's a fine how-do-you-do.
It's so hot.
I could just come down on the weekend.
- It's just gonna be another minute.
- What's hurting him now?
He's got an earache.
Mr. Torrio's a man beset by convenient maladies.
- What's that mean?
- Nothing cures him faster than someone else doing his laundry.
I ain't his washerwoman.
Don't take it personally, kid.
What do you think George Remus spent five years doing?
- Come again?
- I said what do you think
George Remus was doing for him?
Ain't you George Remus?
Who'd you think I was?
You just said it like it was someone else.
This shyster-- had him on a $500 retainer, keep me out of the hoosegow.
Cheaper lawyer, more time in jail.
Why the fuck you move to Cincinnati?
Well, John, draw a circle 300 miles around, know what you get?
300 miles of cowshit.
And 80% of the bonded whiskey being stored in this country.
- How much's in your pocket?
- Enough to float your speaks, plus a whole lot more.
We're looking to keep business steady-- no heartburn,
No blood on the floor.
Buy from George Remus, there won't be any.
Remus owns the distilleries and the pharmacies they're allowed to sell to.
Even better, Remus owns the trucks that hijack his own liquor.
- That's a neat trick.
- No trick, my boy.
Remus read the Volstead Act very closely.
We oughta be in business with him.
The fuck you talking about?
He's Remus.
I know.
I'm just- 4,000 cases a month.
- You're good for eight easy.
Let's see how it goes.
Buying from Canada, john?
Makes sense.
But you never know what can happen on that lake.
As for Atlantic City, Cincinnati's a lot closer.
And who really likes Nucky Thompson anyway?
I take it Remus doesn't.
A man lays out two grand for a weekend on the shore, he doesn't expect an altercation over the telephone bill.
Well, it's all on the house here, Georgie.
Go say hello to Odette.
We'll work out the details later.
Hi.
- When you go to Atlantic City-- - when am I doing that?
Next month, before you head to Brooklyn.
Johnny, I got this thing for my father.
So leave a day early.
Go see Nucky, tell him things have changed.
That's it?
You'll think of something.
Yeah, your fucking laundry.
Straight through Gloucester county, all you can get.
Me and the boys here are gobbling it all up.
- It's pennies an acre.
- Because it's worthless land.
- Not for long.
- The road appropriations come through, we steer the planning commissioners right where we want them.
With the old golden handshake?
- Well, how does anything get done, Ernie?
Once that's settled, we sell the land back to the great state of New Jersey.
- At a tenfold profit.
- So how does a fella get a piece?
- Quickly, my boy, quickly.
- The blue plots are all taken.
Jesus, you fellas own all that?
Not all, but most.
Land barons of barren land.
And it gets even better.
Once the roads are approved, they're gonna need to be built, right?
It just so happens I have a very close friend in the construction business.
Edward Bader, master builder.
Yeah, with his own two hands.
And you, my friend, are hereby notified we are currently accepting bids to supply the gravel.
- For 40 miles of road?
- You can do the math yourself.
I will.
But in the meantime, let this pave the way in my direction.
Well, it's a fine start.
Perfect, Ernie.
- We're all set for McGarrigle?
- My house Monday night.
- You're a credit to the cause, Nucky.
- Always happy to help.
Nucky, we have an emergency.
There's a reporter calling.
He claims Chalky White has shot a klansman.
- Get my brother--
- I have already called him.
Right here on the Atlantic City boardwalk,
- for over 40 years...
- Five more minutes?
They have a hotel shaped like an elephant.
It's in Margate-- six stories.
It's quite something.
The tusks are genuine ivory apparently.
Beg your pardon?
The elephant.
We can take a drive.
Oh no.
Thank you.
Who was that?
No one of any consequence.
If you're hungry, there's a soda fountain.
They sell potato cakes called kor-nishes.
- What's wrong?
This guide--
It lists the taverns, the houses of ill-repute.
- "If Jesus came to Atlantic City..."
- The places he wouldn't go.
The author's attempt at cynicism.
I'm sorry you had to see that, dear.
Maybe it's better we don't have children.
This world, Nelson.
Are you sure I can't offer you gentlemen luncheon?
Oh, thank you, Lenore, no.
We need some privacy, dear.
Lester baby?
- It's very nice, Lester.
- Talented.
- Thank you, sir.
- Lester will be attending Morehouse in two years.
The college.
Jesus Christ, what the fuck happened?
It don't matter now, does it?
I took care of it my own self.
You shot a white man in the throat.
Which I had to hear about from some fucking reporter.
Hermanacus, he's a schoolteacher.
The other one lost his arm.
I've got four boys dead in that warehouse.
Half a dozen wounded-- including a woman.
- You know I'll take care of it.
- How I know that?
We're supposed to be protected from these ofays.
- Look, I can't control--
- No, you look!
I'm done with this shit.
- Just like that, huh?
- I got my family and I got my people.
Your people?
The 10,000 black folk who make this city hum.
Busboys, trash collectors, porters.
Meaning what exactly?
Meaning... you go school these crackers,
Lest you all find out.
You do understand
I'm the only thing keeping you from a lynch mob?
Are you ready for what happens here
I turn up on the end of a rope?
Things go that way, your people have a lot more to lose than I do.
You gonna arrest me or not?
I can handle this for now.
Stay in the fucking house.
You can see yourselves out.
This klan shit, Eli, I thought you had it under control.
That is one uppity shine.
Sister Bernice?
I'm Margaret Schroeder, Teddy's mother.
I stopped by the convent.
They told me I could find you here.
Much quieter this time of day.
Ben Franklin...
Apparently he discovered lightning.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you no.
- My son.
- Mm-hmm.
He came home yesterday with bruises.
Where I struck him with a ruler.
Did he tell you why he was punished?
No, not specifically.
What did he tell you?
That he did nothing wrong.
Then you're raising a liar, Mrs. Schroeder.
He was playing with matches... in a coat closet in a school full of children.
I-
- I don't know what to say.
You're a widow,
Is that right?
- I am.
- And you live with Teddy's uncle?
Is my son to be expelled?
No.
Father Brennan intervened.
Apparently he's close with your Mr. Thompson.
Thank you for seeing me.
We agreed we were gonna put him out of business, but this-- it's fucking madness.
They had to shoot a woman?
Did you mollycoddle the enemy in France, Jimmy?
He cut off a man's finger.
They were champing at a bit.
10,000 coloreds up in arms now.
The klan boys are in our corner.
There's a lot more than 10,000 of them.
What am I supposed to tell Nucky?
Nucky Thompson was weaned on my teat!
I know him backwards and forwards.
Governor Edwards, he hates the bastard more than I do.
They're ready, him and his people?
Will you stop worrying, for god's sake?
- I need to know what's going on, Lou!
- The less you know the better.
Well, that's just peachy, isn't it?
Worry about yourself, Eli.
I'll handle Nucky.
I gotta go.
Some men, I'll tell you.
You give 'em a badge and a gun, a county treasurership, they think they have power.
Soon you'll see what real power is.
- How soon?
- I want you to start laying some groundwork--
Meet the governor, cultivate relationships;
New York, Philly;
alcohol's the key.
What about here?
Chalky's out of the game, that's a pretty good start.
Got that whole warehouse that's there for the taking.
Jimmy.
Don't worry about Nucky.
I'm not.
Hmm.
Look around, boy.
These animals?
Beasts.
Any one of 'em could've torn me to pieces.
But they didn't.
This fucker, he was a giant.
600lbs, over seven feet tall.
I tracked him for three hours.
Finally cornered him in a ravine.
He smelled me, started comin' closer.
The son of a bitch got confident, thought I was scared.
Reared up on me, puffed up his chest and let out a roar.
I blasted him right in the gut.
Bled out, looking up at me right in the eyes, almost like he couldn't believe it.
You'll be judged by what you succeed at, boy, not by what you attempt.
Last night, four fine young boys were murdered by men claiming to represent the race of white American Christians.
Christians?
!
I will not speak the name of that so-called organization within this house of god.
That's right.
Yeah.
- Amen.
But I can assure you, as treasurer of Atlantic county, and more personally as someone who has always regarded the members of our colored community as his friends and equals, that neither I, sheriff Thompson, or any of his men
will rest until these hooded cowards are brought to justice, and the message is sent loud and clear... that no one need fear
For their safety, or the safety of their wives, children, or property in the face of the obstreperous negro.
- That's right.
- Yes sir.
These coloreds need to learn a lesson, and we are going to teach it with, dare I say in these sacred confines, an iron fist?
I just come from St. Mark's!
Herman Dacus just died from his neck wound.
- It happened.
Eli, find Chalky and place him under arrest-- for his own safety.
Friends, please please.
Remain calm!
- Good afternoon, welcome to preston's.
- How do you do?
Are we celebrating a special occasion?
Our 13th wedding anniversary.
Well, that's lucky.
How so?
Lucky 13.
Are we ready to order?
The lady will have the mutton chops.
- And for the gentlemen?
- Steak.
Turtle soup to start.
And will we be imbibing, sir?
I beg your pardon?
Something to drink perhaps?
For the occasion.
We can accommodate most requests.
The lady will have coffee.
I'll have a glass of cold buttermilk.
Ma'am.
Nelson, he was offering alcohol.
- I realize that, dear.
- Well, aren't you going to arrest him?
- We're here to eat dinner.
- Of course...
But...
Pardon me, dear.
I need to wash up--
Public spaces.
Yes, she told me.
Yes, I know.
I'm so sorry.
It was just so awful.
I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
I'm so glad you came here.
Mrs. Dacus, I am so sorry for your loss.
Thank you, Nucky.
He was a pillar of the community and will be sorely missed.
Thank you, Nucky.
Thank you.
Would you excuse us?
What are you doing here?
I came to pay my respects.
Politics is my department.
He was one of my high school teachers.
So?
- So what?
- Yesterday morning
- At Chalky's.
- I was gone.
It happened after we left.
You saw nothing that aroused your suspicion?
Let me go do this.
It's an awful waste of a lot of good tablecloths.
The laundry bills alone.
- So how's Chalky?
- Alive, which is the main thing.
So you run off and get married like a thief in the night?
- You sound like my mother.
- What happened?
You used to ask my advice on things.
My own kid is practically shaving, Nuck.
He like the new place?
I took him shooting.
Fishing too.
Oyster creek,
- like we used to.
- When I was sheriff.
I used to love that.
Standing there for hours, not saying a word.
Is there anything now?
That you want to say?
What do you mean?
Your father is a very duplicitous man.
You've been told.
I told my mother I'd be over for dinner.
Would you care for some butterscotch pudding?
I'm afraid I'm too full.
- I got you something.
- Nelson.
I thought you didn't believe in gifts.
I saw it and I thought of you.
Oh, it's lovely.
Thank you.
- Sir?
- How may I help you?
You mentioned earlier about this being a special occasion.
Indeed.
Have you any champagne?
Whiskey perhaps?
- We do, sir.
- Nelson!
It's all right, dear.
Everybody stay seated.
This is a raid!
All staff members kneel on the floor, hands interlocked atop your heads.
- Agent Clarkson.
- Yes sir?
Secure the contents of the cash drawer.
I want the money counted and documented with an official forfeiture receipt.
Agent Sawicki, break down that door.
Oh my god.
This establishment is being shuttered for violation of the Volstead Act.
It is loaded, sir.
There is over 200 cases of brandy, wine and champagne.
Tag it, catalog it and destroy it.
- What's your name?
- Carl Switzer.
Mr. Switzer, you are hereby under arrest for violation of the Volstead Act.
Agent Sawicki?
Right here, this section.
The springs are broken.
- No wonder you're not sleeping.
- Mmm.
We could go to your rooming house.
Men only, dear.
I'm afraid it's not nearly as luxurious.
- I'm very proud of you, Nelson.
- Hmm.
The way you handled those men.
It's what I'm paid for, dear.
It was thrilling, actually.
I'm not embarrassed to say it.
- Uh-- - huh?
Oh.
You're being awfully quiet.
- I saw Jimmy.
- Oh?
And how are the newlyweds getting along?
Fine, I suppose.
He was alone.
We need to send them something.
I already took care of it.
What is it?
He's holding something back.
When he was a kid, he confided in me-- everything.
- Where was his father?
- He was here.
Disinterested.
The commodore needs to be in control.
10-year-old boy?
There's no controlling that.
Now of course, he's around.
- You're jealous.
- I'm angry.
He's got something up his sleeve.
I was father and mother to that kid, with Gillian out all hours?
I nursed him through malaria, took him camping, gave him the run of that goddamn boardwalk.
There is another boy down the hall.
He was playing with matches.
- Matches.
- I saw the sister.
She told me.
- Did you speak to him?
- He offered no explanation.
I'm afraid he's developed a fascination with fire.
What's that all about?
- Now boarding all points west...
- Come on, dear.
- Did you have a nice time?
- I did.
Although I suppose I've been kidding myself to think I could live here.
Sodom by the sea.
I miss you, Nelson.
Until next month.
Thank you for a lovely weekend.
Travel safely and with God.
- Porter, porter!
- Now boarding for all points north:
New York, Mount Vernon, White Plains and Pleasantville.
- Just in time.
- I could smell it from upstairs.
It smells good.
Who was on the telephone?
My father.
He and my mother are gonna take Tommy to the carousel.
What's this?
Oh, from Nucky.
A wedding gift.
Should we open it?
- Is there any coffee?
- It's on the boil.
Thank you.
The coloreds, they won't give us any trouble?
The earlier we get there, the quieter it will be.
You don't have to feel embarrassed to eat in front of us, Richard.
Why don't you take some biscuits for later?
How's that coffee, Ange?
How does it feel to have everything?
Hey, kiddo.
- What are you up to in here?
- Playing soldier.
I'd like to talk to you.
Yes sir.
What are you doing?
Getting ready for the belt.
No no, Teddy, I'm not going to beat you.
You need to mind your mother.
And the sisters at school.
Yes sir.
And no more misbehaving, playing with matches.
Run along now-- the sweetshop.
- And be a good boy.
- Thank you.

Nearly 4:00 p.m.
I fell asleep.
I have your money.
For the last two weeks, right?
Come lay with me, daddy.
You need to sleep in your own room.
And there you have that.
So tell me-- should I be concerned
That there's blood on some of these crates?
Not unless it's your own.
Hello?
Nucky, there is a man here from the state's attorney.
He says he must see you.
- What does he want?
- I don't know.
Put him on the line.
He says you must come immediately,
- That it is urgent.
- For god's sake.
Everything all right?
Yes, fine.
I told Teddy we'd all go to the pictures.
The Chaplin film is at the Royal.
- Very well.

Enoch Thompson?
- What the hell going on?
- My name is Solomon Bishop.
I'm a deputy with the state's attorney's office.
Mr. Thompson, you're under arrest for election fraud.
I got one!
Here you go.
Two for you!
Load that away.
I don't pay to play.
Keep your mouth shut and the crates moving.
Mama!
- The casing is jammed,
- Come on!
Come on!
It's jammed.
Go on!
Get in there.
- Just pop them out!
- Hand me that.
- Holy Jesus!
- Shut up!
Purity, sobriety and the white Christian's Jesus.
- Oh, my God!
- Get out!
Come on!
Get him up here!
Get him up here!
- Come on, guys, get him!
Gel him up here!
- Come on!
My arm!
He shot me in my arm, God damn it!
Go!
Go!
Come on, go, go!
Come on, move it!
I don't want to go!
I am not in the mood for this, Teddy.
Come out!
- I don't want to
- I'll count to three.
One.
Two.
Three!
- Teddy.
- I don't want to!
I am warning you!
Do not turn your back on me, young man!
Come here.
- Mama!
- Come out from there.
- You're upsetting your sister,
- No!
- You're home.
- Be it ever so humble.
- What's the problem?
Why is he under there?
- He doesn't want to go to school.
Want to grow up to be a fishmonger?
Yes.
No, you don't.
You want to be a doctor or something Remember?
Like Dr. Surran,
Sister Bernice.
He was misbehaving apparently and she took the ruler to him.
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything!
Well, nuns don't just go around hitting people.
She pulled my hair.
Nun hit me when I was your age, I get another whooping from my dad,
Go with Katie, dear.
Wash up.
You, too.
This way, sweethearts.
Come on.
It's nearly 8:00 a.m.
Considering the night I had, I'm amazed I'm home before 9:00.
I'm sure.
But you do look ravishing,
And ravishable.
Time for school, come on.
- I'm not going!
- Yes, you are going.
Come on.
- I don't want to!
- Let's get your coat.
- Mama!
Mama!
- I'm not going!
- I told you, I'm not going!
- It's okay.
- Where are you going?
- To the office to get some sleep,
- I'm not going!
- Do you want your mommy upset with you?
No!
I told you...
- Mama!
- It's okay.
Teddy!
These eggs taste funny,
Maybe someone made the chicken laugh,
Oh, there's my handsome man.
- Hey, pal!
- Daddy.
Nucky call?
Was he supposed to?
I'll take some ham and some eggs.
Well, I know how he likes them, dear.
- You wanna go shoot some gulls?
- Yeah.
- Jimmy.
- What?
He's too young,
- No, I'm not.
- I was his age, I used to go all the time.
- Younger.
With your father.
- Actually it was with Nucky mostly.
- I don't think it's safe,
- Please?
Please?
- Please?
- Come on, he's a big boy,
- Relax, Ange.
- You worry too much.
- Please?
- Make sure he dresses warmly.
- All right, come on, let's get it done.
- Your plaid pants.
- Got it!
- You got it.
And be careful.
Are we gonna shoot some real seagulls with real guns?
Yes, we are.
- I really wish you wouldn't do that.
- Do what, dear?
Undercut me.
Oh, sweetie, I would never.
- You're his wife.
- Yes, and I'm Tommy's mother.
I was only trying to help, dear.
As your husbands mother.
Boys will be boys after all,
You know, when Jimmy was a baby and I would change his diaper,
I used to kiss his little winkie
What is the meaning of this?
Move this furniture back into place!
- Sir.
- We weren't expecting you, sir.
Mrs. Van Alden wanted to see the office.
The field reports.
We were just about to hop to it.
I take almost no comfort in "about to," Agent Clarkson.
- Yes, sir.
- Gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce my wife.
Dear, these are Agents Sawicki and Clarkson.
- Ma'am.
- How do you do?
Agent Sawicki is of Polish stock.
He joins us from Mount Olivet.
Outside Pittsburgh.
Yes, they have a large Christian community.
Mrs. Van Alden is visiting for the weekend,
Well, there's no shortage of wholesome entertainment.
I picked up this tourist guide yesterday.
Oh.
- Does it list the churches?
- I assume so.
I haven't read it yet.
Consider it a gift.
Thank you.
If I'm needed, we're staying at the Hotel Metropole.
Though I anticipate we'll be out mostly taking in the sights.
Save the roughhouse for your own time, gentlemen.
- Yes, sir,
- Yes, sir.
Just gonna be another minute.
- What's hurting him now?
- Got an earache.
Mr. Torrio is a man beset by convenient maladies.
What's that mean?
Nothing cures him faster than someone else doing his laundry.
I ain't his washing woman,
Don'!
take it personally, kid.
What do you think George Remus spent five years doing?
Come again?
I said, what do you think George Remus was doing for him?
Ain't you George Remus?
Who did you think I was?
You just said it like it was someone else.
This shyster?
Had him on a $500-retainer to keep me out of the hoosegow.
Cheaper lawyer, more time in jail.
Why the fuck you move to Cincinnati?
Well, John, draw a circle 300 miles around, know what you get?
300 miles of cow shit.
You get 80% of the bonded whiskey being stored in this country.
- How much is in your pocket?
- Enough to ﬂoat your speaks.
Plus a whole lot more.
We're looking to keep business steady.
No heartburn.
No blood on the ﬂoor.
Buy from George Remus, there won't be any.
Remus owns the distilleries and the pharmacies they're allowed to sell to.
Even better, Remus owns the trucks that hijack his own liquor.
- That's a neat trick.
- No trick, my boy.
Remus read the Volstead Act very closely.
We ought to be in business with him.
What the fuck you talking about?
He's Remus.
I know.
I'm just.
Four thousand cases a month.
You're good for eight, easy.
Let's see how it goes.
Buying from Canada, John?
Makes sense.
But you never know what can happen on that lake.
As for Atlantic City,
Cincinnati's a lot closer.
And who really likes Nucky Thompson anyway?
I take it Remus doesn't.
Man lays out 2 grand for a weekend on the shore.
he doesn't expect an altercation over the telephone bill.
Well, it's all on the house here, Georgie.
Go say hello to Odette.
We'll work out the details later,
Hi.
- When you go to Atlantic City...
- When am I doing that?
Next month, before you head to Brooklyn.
Johnny, I got this thing for my father.
So?
Leave a day early.
Go see Nucky, tell him things have changed.
That's it?
You'll think of something.
Do your fucking laundry.
The idea is to buy here, straight through Gloucester County, all you can get.
Me and the boys here are gobbling it all up.
- It's pennies an acre.
- Because it's worthless land
- No!
for long.
- The road appropriations come through, we steer the planning commissioners right where we want them.
With the old golden handshake?
Well, how does anything get done, Ernie?
Once that's settled, we sell the land back to the great state of New Jersey.
At a 10-fold profit.
- So how does a fellow get a piece?
- Quickly, my boy, quickly.
The blue plots are all taken.
- Jesus, you fellows own all that?
- Not all, but most.
Land barons of barren land.
Yeah, and it gets even better.
Once the roads are approved, they're going to need to be built, right?
It just so happens, I have a very close friend in the construction business.
- Edward Bader, master builder.
- Yeah, with his own two hands.
And you, my friend, are hereby notified we are currently accepting bids to supply the gravel.
For 40 miles of road?
You can do the math yourself.
I will.
But in the meantime, let this pave the way in my direction.
Well, it's a fine start.
Perfect, Ernie.
- We're all set for McGarrigle?
- My house, Monday night.
- You're a credit to the cause, Nucky.
- Always happy to help.
Nucky, we have an emergency.
There's a reporter calling.
He claims Chalky White has shot a Klansman.
- Get my brother...
- I have already called him.
Right here, on the Atlantic City Boardwalk, for over 40 years...
They have a hotel shaped like an elephant.
It's in Margate, six stories.
It's quite something.
The tusks are genuine ivory apparently.
- Beg your pardon?
- The elephant, we could take a drive.
Oh, no.
Thank you.
Who was that?
No one of any consequence.
If you're hungry, there's a soda fountain.
They sell potato cakes called cornishes.
- What's wrong?
- This guide.
It lists the taverns, the houses of ill repute.
"if Jesus came to Atlantic City..."
The places he wouldn't go.
The author's attempt at cynicism,
I'm sorry you had to see that, dear.
Maybe it's better we don't have children.
This world, Nelson.
Are you sure I can't offer you gentlemen luncheon?
Thank you, Lenore, no.
We need some privacy, dear.
Lester, baby,
It's very nice, Lester.
- Talented.
- Thank you, sir.
Lester will be attending Morehouse in two years.
The college.
Jesus Christ, what the fuck happened?
It don'!
matter now, does it?
I took care of it all myself.
You shot a white man in the throat.
Which I had to hear about from some fucking reporter.
Herman Dachus, he's a school teacher.
The other one lost his arm.
I got four boys dead in that warehouse.
Half a dozen wounded, including a woman.
You know I'll take care of it.
How I know that?
We're supposed to be protected from these affairs.
- Look, I can't...,
- No, you look.
I'm done with this shit.
Just like that, huh?
I got my family and I got my people.
Your people?
The 10,000 black folk who make this city hum.
Bus boys, trash collectors, porters.
Meaning what exactly?
Meaning, you go school these crackers, lest you all find out.
You do understand, I'm the only thing keeping you from a lynch mob.
You ready for what happens here, I turn up on the end of a rope?
If things go that way, your people have a lot more to lose than I do.
You gonna arrest me or not?
I can handle this, for now.
Stay in the fucking house.
You can see yourselves out.
This Klan shit, Eli, I thought you had it under control.
That is one uppity shine.
Sister Bernice?
I'm Margaret Schroeder, Teddy's mother.
I stopped by the convent.
They told me I could find you here.
Much quieter this time of day.
Ben Franklin, apparently he discovered lightning.
Have a seat.
Thank you, no.
My son, he came home yesterday with bruises.
Where I struck him with a ruler?
Did he tell you why he was punished?
No.
Not specifically.
What did he tell you?
That he did nothing wrong,
Then you're raising a liar, Mrs. Schroeder.
He was playing with matches, in a coat closet, in a school full of children.
I...
I don't know what to say,
You're a widow, is that right?
- I am.
- And you live with Teddy's uncle?
Is my son to be expelled?
No.
Father Brennan intervened,
Apparently, he's close with your Mr. Thompson.
Thank you for seeing me,
We agreed we were gonna put him out of business.
but this, it's fucking madness!
You had to shoot a woman?
Would you mollycoddle the enemy in France, Jimmy?
He cutoff a man's finger.
Would have had him champing at the bit.
Ten thousand colored up in arms now.
The Klan boys are in our corner, There's a lot more than 10,000 of them.
What am I supposed to tell Nucky?
Nucky Thompson was weaned on my teat.
I know him backwards and forwards.
But Governor Edwards, he hates the bastard more than I do.
They're ready?
Him and his people?
Could you stop worrying, for God's sake?
- I need to know what's going on, Lou.
- The less you know the better.
Well, that's just peachy, isn't it?
Worry about yourself, Eli.
I'll handle Nucky.
I gotta go.
Some men, I tell you!
You give them a badge and a gun, a County treasurership.
they think they have power.
Soon, you'll see what real power is.
- How soon?
- I want you to start laying some groundwork.
Meet the Governor, cultivate relationships.
New York, Philly.
Alcohol's the key,
What about here?
Well, Chalky's out of the game.
That's a pretty good start.
Got that whole warehouse, it's there for the taking.
Jimmy, don't worry about Nucky.
I'm not
Look around, boy.
These animals, beasts, any one of them could have torn me to pieces.
But they didn't.
This fucker was a giant.
600 pounds, over 7 feet tall.
Tracked him for three hours, finally cornered him in a ravine.
He smelled me, started coming closer
Son of a bitch got confident, thought I was scared.
Reared up on me, puffed up his chest and let out a roar.
Blasted him right in the gut.
Bled out, looking up at me, right in the eyes.
Almost like he couldn't believe it.
You'll be judged by what you succeed at, boy.
Not by what you attempt.
Last night, four fine young boys were murdered by men claiming to represent the race of white American Christians.
Christians?
I will not speak the name of that so-called organization within this house of God.
- That's right.
- Yeah.
Well, I can assure you, as Treasurer of Atlantic County, and more personally, as someone who has always regarded the members of our colored community as his friends and equals,
that neither I, Sheriff Thompson or any of his men, will rest until these hooded cowards are brought to justice.
And the message is sent loud and clear that no one need fear for their safety or the safety of their wives, children or property, in the face of the obstreperous negro.
These coloreds need to leam a lesson, and we are going to teach it with, dare I say in these sacred confines an iron fist.
I've just come from St. Mark's.
Herman Dachus just died from his neck wound.
You happy?
Eli, find Chalky and place him under arrest, for his own safety.
Friends, please!
Please, remain calm!
- Good afternoon.
Welcome to Preston's.
- How do you do?
- Are we celebrating a special occasion?
- Our thirteenth wedding anniversary.
Well, that's lucky,
How so?
Lucky 13.
Are we ready to order?
- The lady will have the mutton chops,
- And for the gentleman?
Steak.
Turtle soup to start.
And will we be imbibing, sir?
I beg your pardon,
Something to drink, perhaps?
For the occasion.
We can accommodate most requests,
The lady will have coffee.
I'll have a glass of cold butter milk.
Nelson, he was offering alcohol.
- I realize that, dear.
- Well, aren't you going to arrest him?
- We're here to eat dinner.
- Of course.
But?
Pardon me, dear.
I need to wash up, Public spaces.
Yes, I told him.
He doesn't know.
I'm so sorry.
- It was just so awful.
- I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
- Mrs. Dachus, I am so sorry for your loss.
- Thanks, Nucky.
- He was a pillar of the community
- Yes.
- He will be sorely missed,
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- What are you doing here?
- I came to pay my respects.
Politics is my department.
He was one of my high school teachers.
So?
- So what?
- Yesterday morning, Chalky's.
I was gone.
It happened after we left
You saw nothing that aroused your suspicion?
Let me go do this.
It's an awful waste of a lot of good table cloths.
The laundry bills alone.
So, how's Chalky?
Alive, which is the main thing.
So, you run off and get married like a thief in the night.
- You sound like my mother,
- What happened?
You used to ask for my advice on things.
My own kid's practically shaving, Nuck.
He like the new place?
I took him shooting, fishing, too, Oyster Creek, like we used to,
When I was sheriff.
I used to love that.
Standing there for hours, not saying a word.
Is there anything now?
That you want to say?
What do you mean?
Your father is a very duplicitous man.
You've been told.
Hold my mother I'd be over for dinner.
Would you care for some butterscotch pudding?
I'm afraid I'm too full.
I got you something.
Nelson, I thought you didn't believe in gifts?
I saw it and I thought of you.
Oh, it's lovely.
Thank you.
- Sir.
- How many I help you?
You mentioned earlier about this being a special occasion.
Indeed.
Have you any champagne?
Whiskey, perhaps?
- We do, sir.
- Nelson.
It's all right, dear.
Everybody stay seated!
This is a raid!
All staff members kneel on the ﬂoor, hands inter-lapped at the top of your heads!
- Agent Clarkson!
- Yes, sir!
- Secure the contents of the cash drawer!
- Please, don't move.
I want the money counted and documented with an official forfeiture receipt.
Agent Sawicki, break down that door!
This establishment is being shuttered for violation of the Volstead Act.
It is loaded, sir!
There's over 200 cases of brandy, wine and champagne.
Tag it, catalog it and destroy it.
- What's your name?
- Carl Switzer.
Mr. Switzer, you are hereby under arrest for violation of the Volstead Act.
Agent Sawicki.
Right here, this section.
The springs are broken.
No wonder you're not sleeping.
- We could go to your rooming house?
- Men only, dear.
I'm afraid it's not nearly as luxurious.
I'm very proud of you, Nelson,
The way you handled those men.
It's what I'm paid for, dear.
It was thrilling, actually.
I'm not embarrassed to say it.
You're being awfully quiet.
- I saw Jimmy.
- Oh.
And how are the newlyweds getting along?
Fine, I suppose.
He was alone.
- We need to send them something.
- I already took care of it.
What is it?
He's holding something back.
When he was a kid, he confided in me.
Everything.
- Where was his father?
- He was here, disinterested.
The Commodore needs to be in control.
A 10-year-old boy, there's no controlling that.
Now, of course, he's around.
You're jealous.
I'm angry, He's got something up his sleeve.
I was father and mother to that kid.
Gillian out all hours.
I nursed him through malaria, took him camping, gave him the run of that goddamn boardwalk.
There is another boy down the hall.
He was playing with matches.
- Matches?
- I saw the sister' She told me.
- Did you speak to him?
- He offered no explanation.
I'm afraid he's developed a fascination with fire.
What's that all about?
Thanks for coming,
We're not going to be able to make that one.
- Did you have a nice time?
- I did.
Although, I suppose, I've been kidding myself to think I could live here.
Sodom by the sea.
I miss you, Nelson,
Yeah!
Yeah, over here!
Until next month,
Thank you for a lovely weekend,
Travel safely and with God.
Porter!
Porter!
Now boarding for all trains to the North.
New York, Mount Vernon, White Plains and Pleasanlville.
- Just in time.
- I could smell it from upstairs
Smells good.
Who was on the telephone?
My father.
You and my mother are gonna take Tommy to the carousel.
What's this?
Oh, from Nucky, a wedding gift.
Should we open it?
- Is there any coffee?
- On the boil.
Thank you.
The coloreds, they won't give us any trouble?
The earlier we get there, the quieter it will be.
You don't have to feel embarrassed to eat in front of us, Richard.
Why don't you take some biscuits for later?
How is that coffee, Ange?
How does it feel to have everything?
Hey, kiddo.
- What you up to in here?
- Playing soldier.
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Yes, sir.
What are you doing?
Getting ready for the belt.
Oh, no, Teddy.
I'm not going to beat you.
You need to mind your mother and the sisters at school.
Yes, sir.
No more misbehaving, playing with matches.
Run along now to the sweet shop.
- And be a good boy.
- Thank you.
What time is it?
Nearly 4:00 p.m.
I fell asleep.
I have your money.
For the last two weeks, right?
- Come lay with me, Daddy.
- You need to sleep in your own room.
And there you have that.
All right.
Do you want this one right here?
So, tell me, should I be concerned that there's blood on some of these crates?
Not unless it's your own.
- See you.
- Yeah.
I got it.
Hello.
Nucky, there's a man here from the State's Attorney.
He says he must see you.
- What does he want?
- I don't know.
Put him on the line.
He says you must come immediately.
That it is urgent.
For God's sake!
Everything all right?
Yes, fine.
I told Teddy we'd all go to the pictures.
The Chaplin film is at the Royal.
Very well.
I need to stop by the office first.
I won't be long.
You go.
I'll meet you over there.
Can I help you?
Enoch Thompson?
What the hell is going on?
My name is Solomon Bishop.
I'm a deputy with the State's Attorney's Office.
Mr. Thompson, you're under arrest for election fraud.
In less than two hours, liquor will be declared illegal by decree of our nation's congress.
To those beautiful, ignorant bastards.
You're placing Enoch Thompson at the head of a criminal organization controlling Atlantic county.
Arnold Rothstein and Charlie Luciano.
I have a load coming in tomorrow.
500 crates Canadian Club.
You use your own men for the pickup.
- Jimmy Darmody.
- Al Capone.
- Drop your weapon.
- Get 'em up.
Jimmy left me holding the bag.
Is this the way you do business?
My husband, he has a weakness for the dice games.
This should see you through winter.
Give me that money.
I'm investigating Saturday night's shootings.
We can all rest now that the architect of that slaughter has been killed himself.
You're out, Mickey.
Out of the business.
Chalky White's taking over.
What am I supposed to tell my partners?
- He drives a packard you said.
- But it wasn't Chalky.
You hung a fella that works for him.
Let's go.
You're under arrest.
These here are my daddy tools.
- What are you gonna do with them?
- It wasn't the klan.
The roads to Atlantic City are rivers of mud.
We need paved highways so cars can come and go.
- Mrs. Schroeder is here.
- Who's Mrs. Schroeder?
Don't move!
- You're sure these are the guys who held you up?
- Absolutely.
D'Alessio brothers.
They're being backed by Rothstein and Luciano.
They shot my brother, Mickey.
They shot at me.
You are consorting with the man who killed the father of your children.
Run somebody else for mayor.
- What do I do about Eli?
- Replace him too.
I'm dying.
There's no time to be sentimental.
Accept Jesus as your savior.
This morning I found this hidden in his rubbish pail.
You gonna arrest her or not, sheriff?
He's not.
Go far away.
- What's your name, handsome?
- Nelson.
You know I'm about to be indicted for fixing the world series.
I need a man with your political reach to quash the indictment.
- That could be arranged.
- In exchange for what?
The times with you and the children,
I've never been happier.
You made me pregnant.
- You have to trust me, Eli.
- What does that mean?
That blood is thicker than water.
You're my flesh and blood, boy.
- So?
So you're gonna take back Atlantic City for the both of us.
Here you go, boss.
Coming your way.
- Come on, let's go!
- All right, I got it, I got it.
I got one.
- Come on, guys.
Come on.
- Here you go.
Come on, fellas.
Watch your back.
#listento me , honey dear # # something's wrong with you, I fear # # it's getting harder to please you # # harder and harder each year...# - here you go, two for you.
# I don't wanna make you blue # # but you need a talking to # # like a lot of people I know # # here's what's wrong with you # # after you get what you want #
# you don't want it # # if I gave you the moon # # you'd grow tired of it soon # # you're like a baby # # you want what you want when you want it #
# but after you are presented # # with what you want, you're discontented # # you're always wishing and wanting # # for something # # when you get what you want # # you don't want what you get #

There.
Orville, go let him in.
I don't pay to play.
Keep your mouths shut and them crates moving.
- Yes sir.
- Here you go.
- Mama!
- The casing's jammed!
Come on.
- Come on!
- It's jammed.
Go on, get in there.
- Just pop that out.
- Hand me that.
- Holy jesus!
- Shut up, shut up!
Purity, sobriety,
And the white Christians Jesus.
- My arm!
- Get up.
Let's get out of here, come on.
My fucking arm.
Get him up here.
Get him up here, Charlie.
- Get him up here.
- Come on!
- Oh, my arm!
- Get up, get up.
- One of them shot me in the arm, God damn it.
- Go go.
- Go go!
- Come on, move it!
I don't want to go.
I am not in the mood for this, Teddy.
Come out.
- I don't want to!
I will count to three:
One, two, three.
- Teddy.
- I don't want to.
I am warning you, do not turn your back on me, young man.
Come here.
- Mama.
- Come out from there.
You're upsetting your sister.
No!
- You're home.
- Be it ever so humble.
What's the problem?
Why is he under there?
He doesn't want to go to school.
You want to grow up to be a fishmonger?
- Yes!
- No, you don't.
You want to be a doctor or something, remember?
- Like Dr. Surran.
- Sister Bernice--
He was misbehaving apparently and she took the ruler to him.
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.
- Well, nuns don't just go around hitting people.
- She pulled my hair.
A nun hit me when I was your age, I'd get another whipping from my dad.
Go with Katy, dear.
Wash up.
- You too.
- This way, sweethearts.
Come on.
It's nearly 8:00 a.m.
Considering the night I had,
I'm amazed I'm home before 9:00.
I'm sure.
But you do look ravishing.
And ravishable.
Time for school.
Come on.
- I'm not going!
- Yes, you are going.
- Come on.
- I don't want to!
- Let's get your coat.
- Mama!
I'm not going!
I told you.
- Where are you going?
- To the office to get some sleep.
- Do you want your mommy upset?
- No, I told you!
- Mama!
- Teddy!
These eggs taste funny.
Maybe someone made the chicken laugh.
- Oh, there's my handsome man.
- Hey, pal.
Daddy!
- Nucky called?
Was he supposed to?
I'll take some ham and some eggs.
Oh, well, I know how he likes them, dear.
- You want to go shoot some gulls?
- Yeah.
- Jimmy.
- What?
- He's too young.
- No, I'm not.
I was his age, I used to go all the time.
Younger, with your father.
Actually it was with Nucky mostly.
- I don't think it's safe.
- Please!
- Please please.
- Come on.
He's a big boy.
Relax, Ange.
You worry too much.
- Please!
- Make sure he dresses warmly.
- All right, come on, let's go.
- Your plaid pants.
- Got it.
- You got it?
And be careful.
Are we gonna shoot some real seagulls with real guns?
Yes, we are.
- I really wish you wouldn't do that.
- Do what, dear?
- Undercut me.
- Oh, sweetie,
I would never.
You're his wife.
Yes, and I'm Tommy's mother.
No problem.
I was only trying to help, dear-- as your husband's mother.
Boys will be boys, after all.
You know, when Jimmy was a baby and I would change his diaper...
I used to kiss his little winkie.
What is the meaning of this?
!
Move this furniture back into place!
Sir, we weren't expecting you, sir.
Mrs. Van Alden wanted to see the office.
The field reports, we were just about to hop to it.
I take almost no comfort in "about to," agent Clarkson.
- Yes sir.
- Gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce my wife.
Dear, these are agents Sawicki and Clarkson.
- Ma'am.
- How do you do?
Agent Sawicki is of polish stock.
He joins us from Mt.
Olivet.
Outside Pittsburgh.
Yes, they have a large Christian community.
Mrs. Van Alden is visiting for the weekend.
Well, there's no shortage of wholesome entertainment.
I picked up this tourist guide
Yesterday.
Oh.
- Does it list the churches?
- I assume so.
- I haven't read it yet.
- Oh.
Consider it a gift.
Thank you.
If I'm needed, we're staying at the hotel Metropole.
Though I anticipate we'll be out mostly, taking in the sights.
Save the roughhouse for your own time, gentlemen.
Yes sir.
That's a fine how-do-you-do.
It's so hot.
I could just come down on the weekend.
- It's just gonna be another minute.
- What's hurting him now?
He's got an earache.
Mr. Torrio's a man beset by convenient maladies.
- What's that mean?
- Nothing cures him faster than someone else doing his laundry.
I ain't his washerwoman.
Don't take it personally, kid.
What do you think George Remus spent five years doing?
- Come again?
- I said what do you think
George Remus was doing for him?
Ain't you George Remus?
Who'd you think I was?
You just said it like it was someone else.
This shyster-- had him on a $500 retainer, keep me out of the hoosegow.
Cheaper lawyer, more time in jail.
Why the fuck you move to Cincinnati?
Well, John, draw a circle 300 miles around, know what you get?
300 miles of cowshit.
And 80% of the bonded whiskey being stored in this country.
- How much's in your pocket?
- Enough to float your speaks, plus a whole lot more.
We're looking to keep business steady-- no heartburn,
No blood on the floor.
Buy from George Remus, there won't be any.
Remus owns the distilleries and the pharmacies they're allowed to sell to.
Even better, Remus owns the trucks that hijack his own liquor.
- That's a neat trick.
- No trick, my boy.
Remus read the Volstead Act very closely.
We oughta be in business with him.
The fuck you talking about?
He's Remus.
I know.
I'm just- 4,000 cases a month.
- You're good for eight easy.
Let's see how it goes.
Buying from Canada, john?
Makes sense.
But you never know what can happen on that lake.
As for Atlantic City, Cincinnati's a lot closer.
And who really likes Nucky Thompson anyway?
I take it Remus doesn't.
A man lays out two grand for a weekend on the shore, he doesn't expect an altercation over the telephone bill.
Well, it's all on the house here, Georgie.
Go say hello to Odette.
We'll work out the details later.
Hi.
- When you go to Atlantic City-- - when am I doing that?
Next month, before you head to Brooklyn.
Johnny, I got this thing for my father.
So leave a day early.
Go see Nucky, tell him things have changed.
That's it?
You'll think of something.
Yeah, your fucking laundry.
Straight through Gloucester county, all you can get.
Me and the boys here are gobbling it all up.
- It's pennies an acre.
- Because it's worthless land.
- Not for long.
- The road appropriations come through, we steer the planning commissioners right where we want them.
With the old golden handshake?
- Well, how does anything get done, Ernie?
Once that's settled, we sell the land back to the great state of New Jersey.
- At a tenfold profit.
- So how does a fella get a piece?
- Quickly, my boy, quickly.
- The blue plots are all taken.
Jesus, you fellas own all that?
Not all, but most.
Land barons of barren land.
And it gets even better.
Once the roads are approved, they're gonna need to be built, right?
It just so happens I have a very close friend in the construction business.
Edward Bader, master builder.
Yeah, with his own two hands.
And you, my friend, are hereby notified we are currently accepting bids to supply the gravel.
- For 40 miles of road?
- You can do the math yourself.
I will.
But in the meantime, let this pave the way in my direction.
Well, it's a fine start.
Perfect, Ernie.
- We're all set for McGarrigle?
- My house Monday night.
- You're a credit to the cause, Nucky.
- Always happy to help.
Nucky, we have an emergency.
There's a reporter calling.
He claims Chalky White has shot a klansman.
- Get my brother--
- I have already called him.
Right here on the Atlantic City boardwalk,
- for over 40 years...
- Five more minutes?
They have a hotel shaped like an elephant.
It's in Margate-- six stories.
It's quite something.
The tusks are genuine ivory apparently.
Beg your pardon?
The elephant.
We can take a drive.
Oh no.
Thank you.
Who was that?
No one of any consequence.
If you're hungry, there's a soda fountain.
They sell potato cakes called kor-nishes.
- What's wrong?
This guide--
It lists the taverns, the houses of ill-repute.
- "If Jesus came to Atlantic City..."
- The places he wouldn't go.
The author's attempt at cynicism.
I'm sorry you had to see that, dear.
Maybe it's better we don't have children.
This world, Nelson.
Are you sure I can't offer you gentlemen luncheon?
Oh, thank you, Lenore, no.
We need some privacy, dear.
Lester baby?
- It's very nice, Lester.
- Talented.
- Thank you, sir.
- Lester will be attending Morehouse in two years.
The college.
Jesus Christ, what the fuck happened?
It don't matter now, does it?
I took care of it my own self.
You shot a white man in the throat.
Which I had to hear about from some fucking reporter.
Hermanacus, he's a schoolteacher.
The other one lost his arm.
I've got four boys dead in that warehouse.
Half a dozen wounded-- including a woman.
- You know I'll take care of it.
- How I know that?
We're supposed to be protected from these ofays.
- Look, I can't control--
- No, you look!
I'm done with this shit.
- Just like that, huh?
- I got my family and I got my people.
Your people?
The 10,000 black folk who make this city hum.
Busboys, trash collectors, porters.
Meaning what exactly?
Meaning... you go school these crackers,
Lest you all find out.
You do understand
I'm the only thing keeping you from a lynch mob?
Are you ready for what happens here
I turn up on the end of a rope?
Things go that way, your people have a lot more to lose than I do.
You gonna arrest me or not?
I can handle this for now.
Stay in the fucking house.
You can see yourselves out.
This klan shit, Eli, I thought you had it under control.
That is one uppity shine.
Sister Bernice?
I'm Margaret Schroeder, Teddy's mother.
I stopped by the convent.
They told me I could find you here.
Much quieter this time of day.
Ben Franklin...
Apparently he discovered lightning.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you no.
- My son.
- Mm-hmm.
He came home yesterday with bruises.
Where I struck him with a ruler.
Did he tell you why he was punished?
No, not specifically.
What did he tell you?
That he did nothing wrong.
Then you're raising a liar, Mrs. Schroeder.
He was playing with matches... in a coat closet in a school full of children.
I-
- I don't know what to say.
You're a widow,
Is that right?
- I am.
- And you live with Teddy's uncle?
Is my son to be expelled?
No.
Father Brennan intervened.
Apparently he's close with your Mr. Thompson.
Thank you for seeing me.
We agreed we were gonna put him out of business, but this-- it's fucking madness.
They had to shoot a woman?
Did you mollycoddle the enemy in France, Jimmy?
He cut off a man's finger.
They were champing at a bit.
10,000 coloreds up in arms now.
The klan boys are in our corner.
There's a lot more than 10,000 of them.
What am I supposed to tell Nucky?
Nucky Thompson was weaned on my teat!
I know him backwards and forwards.
Governor Edwards, he hates the bastard more than I do.
They're ready, him and his people?
Will you stop worrying, for god's sake?
- I need to know what's going on, Lou!
- The less you know the better.
Well, that's just peachy, isn't it?
Worry about yourself, Eli.
I'll handle Nucky.
I gotta go.
Some men, I'll tell you.
You give 'em a badge and a gun, a county treasurership, they think they have power.
Soon you'll see what real power is.
- How soon?
- I want you to start laying some groundwork--
Meet the governor, cultivate relationships;
New York, Philly;
alcohol's the key.
What about here?
Chalky's out of the game, that's a pretty good start.
Got that whole warehouse that's there for the taking.
Jimmy.
Don't worry about Nucky.
I'm not.
Hmm.
Look around, boy.
These animals?
Beasts.
Any one of 'em could've torn me to pieces.
But they didn't.
This fucker, he was a giant.
600lbs, over seven feet tall.
I tracked him for three hours.
Finally cornered him in a ravine.
He smelled me, started comin' closer.
The son of a bitch got confident, thought I was scared.
Reared up on me, puffed up his chest and let out a roar.
I blasted him right in the gut.
Bled out, looking up at me right in the eyes, almost like he couldn't believe it.
You'll be judged by what you succeed at, boy, not by what you attempt.
Last night, four fine young boys were murdered by men claiming to represent the race of white American Christians.
Christians?
!
I will not speak the name of that so-called organization within this house of god.
That's right.
Yeah.
- Amen.
But I can assure you, as treasurer of Atlantic county, and more personally as someone who has always regarded the members of our colored community as his friends and equals, that neither I, sheriff Thompson, or any of his men
will rest until these hooded cowards are brought to justice, and the message is sent loud and clear... that no one need fear
For their safety, or the safety of their wives, children, or property in the face of the obstreperous negro.
- That's right.
- Yes sir.
These coloreds need to learn a lesson, and we are going to teach it with, dare I say in these sacred confines, an iron fist?
I just come from St. Mark's!
Herman Dacus just died from his neck wound.
- It happened.
Eli, find Chalky and place him under arrest-- for his own safety.
Friends, please please.
Remain calm!
- Good afternoon, welcome to preston's.
- How do you do?
Are we celebrating a special occasion?
Our 13th wedding anniversary.
Well, that's lucky.
How so?
Lucky 13.
Are we ready to order?
The lady will have the mutton chops.
- And for the gentlemen?
- Steak.
Turtle soup to start.
And will we be imbibing, sir?
I beg your pardon?
Something to drink perhaps?
For the occasion.
We can accommodate most requests.
The lady will have coffee.
I'll have a glass of cold buttermilk.
Ma'am.
Nelson, he was offering alcohol.
- I realize that, dear.
- Well, aren't you going to arrest him?
- We're here to eat dinner.
- Of course...
But...
Pardon me, dear.
I need to wash up--
Public spaces.
Yes, she told me.
Yes, I know.
I'm so sorry.
It was just so awful.
I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
I'm so glad you came here.
Mrs. Dacus, I am so sorry for your loss.
Thank you, Nucky.
He was a pillar of the community and will be sorely missed.
Thank you, Nucky.
Thank you.
Would you excuse us?
What are you doing here?
I came to pay my respects.
Politics is my department.
He was one of my high school teachers.
So?
- So what?
- Yesterday morning
- At Chalky's.
- I was gone.
It happened after we left.
You saw nothing that aroused your suspicion?
Let me go do this.
It's an awful waste of a lot of good tablecloths.
The laundry bills alone.
- So how's Chalky?
- Alive, which is the main thing.
So you run off and get married like a thief in the night?
- You sound like my mother.
- What happened?
You used to ask my advice on things.
My own kid is practically shaving, Nuck.
He like the new place?
I took him shooting.
Fishing too.
Oyster creek,
- like we used to.
- When I was sheriff.
I used to love that.
Standing there for hours, not saying a word.
Is there anything now?
That you want to say?
What do you mean?
Your father is a very duplicitous man.
You've been told.
I told my mother I'd be over for dinner.
Would you care for some butterscotch pudding?
I'm afraid I'm too full.
- I got you something.
- Nelson.
I thought you didn't believe in gifts.
I saw it and I thought of you.
Oh, it's lovely.
Thank you.
- Sir?
- How may I help you?
You mentioned earlier about this being a special occasion.
Indeed.
Have you any champagne?
Whiskey perhaps?
- We do, sir.
- Nelson!
It's all right, dear.
Everybody stay seated.
This is a raid!
All staff members kneel on the floor, hands interlocked atop your heads.
- Agent Clarkson.
- Yes sir?
Secure the contents of the cash drawer.
I want the money counted and documented with an official forfeiture receipt.
Agent Sawicki, break down that door.
Oh my god.
This establishment is being shuttered for violation of the Volstead Act.
It is loaded, sir.
There is over 200 cases of brandy, wine and champagne.
Tag it, catalog it and destroy it.
- What's your name?
- Carl Switzer.
Mr. Switzer, you are hereby under arrest for violation of the Volstead Act.
Agent Sawicki?
Right here, this section.
The springs are broken.
- No wonder you're not sleeping.
- Mmm.
We could go to your rooming house.
Men only, dear.
I'm afraid it's not nearly as luxurious.
- I'm very proud of you, Nelson.
- Hmm.
The way you handled those men.
It's what I'm paid for, dear.
It was thrilling, actually.
I'm not embarrassed to say it.
- Uh-- - huh?
Oh.
You're being awfully quiet.
- I saw Jimmy.
- Oh?
And how are the newlyweds getting along?
Fine, I suppose.
He was alone.
We need to send them something.
I already took care of it.
What is it?
He's holding something back.
When he was a kid, he confided in me-- everything.
- Where was his father?
- He was here.
Disinterested.
The commodore needs to be in control.
10-year-old boy?
There's no controlling that.
Now of course, he's around.
- You're jealous.
- I'm angry.
He's got something up his sleeve.
I was father and mother to that kid, with Gillian out all hours?
I nursed him through malaria, took him camping, gave him the run of that goddamn boardwalk.
There is another boy down the hall.
He was playing with matches.
- Matches.
- I saw the sister.
She told me.
- Did you speak to him?
- He offered no explanation.
I'm afraid he's developed a fascination with fire.
What's that all about?
- Now boarding all points west...
- Come on, dear.
- Did you have a nice time?
- I did.
Although I suppose I've been kidding myself to think I could live here.
Sodom by the sea.
I miss you, Nelson.
Until next month.
Thank you for a lovely weekend.
Travel safely and with God.
- Porter, porter!
- Now boarding for all points north:
New York, Mount Vernon, White Plains and Pleasantville.
- Just in time.
- I could smell it from upstairs.
It smells good.
Who was on the telephone?
My father.
He and my mother are gonna take Tommy to the carousel.
What's this?
Oh, from Nucky.
A wedding gift.
Should we open it?
- Is there any coffee?
- It's on the boil.
Thank you.
The coloreds, they won't give us any trouble?
The earlier we get there, the quieter it will be.
You don't have to feel embarrassed to eat in front of us, Richard.
Why don't you take some biscuits for later?
How's that coffee, Ange?
How does it feel to have everything?
Hey, kiddo.
- What are you up to in here?
- Playing soldier.
I'd like to talk to you.
Yes sir.
What are you doing?
Getting ready for the belt.
No no, Teddy, I'm not going to beat you.
You need to mind your mother.
And the sisters at school.
Yes sir.
And no more misbehaving, playing with matches.
Run along now-- the sweetshop.
- And be a good boy.
- Thank you.
# every night they say a little prayer for me # # down where the swanee river flows... #
What time is it?
Nearly 4:00 p.m.
I fell asleep.
I have your money.
For the last two weeks, right?
Come lay with me, daddy.
You need to sleep in your own room.
And there you have that.
So tell me-- should I be concerned
That there's blood on some of these crates?
Not unless it's your own.
Hello?
Nucky, there is a man here from the state's attorney.
He says he must see you.
- What does he want?
- I don't know.
Put him on the line.
He says you must come immediately,
- That it is urgent.
- For god's sake.
Everything all right?
Yes, fine.
I told Teddy we'd all go to the pictures.
The Chaplin film is at the Royal.
- Very well.
- I need to stop by the office first.
I won't be long.
You go, I'll meet you over there.
# hello there, long distance # # please don't make me wait in vain #
# I asked you to connect me # # with a homestead down in maine #
# I hate to hold the wire # # don't get mad if I complain #
# I long to hear my sweetheart's voice again # # oh hello, dear, yes, this is me #
# I'm many miles away #
# I'm lonesome and I just called up to say # # is there still room for me # # 'neath the old apple tree # # where there once was a bench for two?
# # oh, that bench wasn't long # # and you know it wasn't strong # # when I sat there with you #
# I've got fare back to maine # # and I'll jump on a train # # if your heart beats as fond and as true # # is there still room for me # # 'neath the old apple tree?
# # if there is I'll come back to you. #
Can I help you?
Enoch Thompson?
- What the hell going on?
- My name is Solomon Bishop.
I'm a deputy with the state's attorney's office.
Mr. Thompson, you're under arrest for election fraud.
I watched Signs again last night.
It keeps getting better every time I see it.
It's funny.
The first time you watch it, it's hard to understand what it's about.
It just sort of meanders.
And then, everything comes together in this one perfect moment at the end.
And when you watch it a second or a third or a fourth time, you start to see that all of this randomness
is leading towards a perfect moment.
My favorite character is the little girl.
Everyone thinks she's so strange because she can't finish a glass of water.
She's convinced they're contaminated.
So, by the end of the film, there are glasses of water littered around this house.
And then, it's the water that saves them.
And that was fate.
I can't help but wonder about my fate.
About my destiny.
Renewal.
Vitality.
Energy.
Are you tired of feeling sluggish?
Do you feel like life is passing you by?
Then we've got the solution for you.
It's called "The Most Incredible Vitamin In The World"
and there's a reason you're watching this right now.
Just pick up the phone and start the new chapter to your life.
Call now.
Not available in stores.
Made in Germany.
Beware of imitators.
Call 1-800...
Hello?
Yo, Kevin.
No, this is Jeff.
Where Kevin at?
I don't know.
Oh, man, look, don't be fucking around!
Where the fuck is Kevin?
Kevin doesn't live here.
There's always some motherfucker trying to tell me there ain't no Kevin!
Let me put this word in your fucking peanut brain, Kevin!
K-E-V-I-N!
Kevin.
What are you doing?
Doing this.
Some strawbs, hand-sliced.
A white rose of whipped cream.
Bam!
Bon appétit.
What's the special occasion?
This is one of those "just because" breakfasts, you know?
It sounds corny, but relationships are like flowers and flowers need water to bloom.
Consider this sprinkling from a watering can.
Well, thanks.
- That's nice.
- You're welcome.
Enjoy.
Oh, my gosh.
I got some good news, actually.
Yeah?
I got a phone call from Randy.
Is he the guy that we talked to at that barbecue?
Oh, no, that's a different Randy.
- But that guy's name was Randy, right?
- Yes.
I liked his wife.
Different Randy.
- We should have them over.
- Yeah.
This is Randy at Millennium Porsche.
Can I tell you something?
With no money down, this thing is practically free.
Pat!
No!
Whoa, whoa.
Don't start with no.
- That's what this is.
- Don't start with no.
You're just, like, in this mindset.
And you're not even...
It's not a mindset.
We don't have the money.
Yeah.
That's the mindset I'm talking about.
Honey, look, I'm trying to be really careful, and I've cut back on some things.
And, like, we promised we were going to get a house this year...
I'm just trying to be a grown-up about this.
Surprise.
We got it.
This is happening.
Look...
Everything you just said about the house, you know, our future, you're exactly right.
And I'm so lucky to have you looking out for us in that way.
But I'm looking out for us in another way.
I'm looking out for...
That intangible thing that every couple needs.
It's a little bit of magic, and a little bit of danger, frankly.
This is gonna solve a lot of our problems.
This tension right now.
As soon as you get in that thing and you feel the energy and you feel it rumble in your gut.
If you don't get turned on, you're made of stone.
Where is it?
It's in the driveway.
Are you...
Is this...
Oh, come on.
Okay, okay...
That's...
Hello?
- Mom?
- Jeff.
Hi.
You know, you're supposed to say "hello" when you pick up the phone.
Yeah, I know.
I thought that maybe you were somebody else, but you're not.
What do you do in the basement?
You're not cleaning it.
You really want to know?
You didn't like it last time we had this conversation.
Okay, no.
You know what?
You're right.
I don't.
Did you get the wood glue?
What are you talking about?
I left you a note on the kitchen counter.
I haven't been upstairs.
One of the shutters on the pantry is broken and I need you to fix it.
You know what, I'm kind of busy right now, so...
All I want for my birthday is for you to get your ass off that couch, and you get on the bus
- and you go to the Home Depot.
- I'm not on the couch.
You come home and fix the shutter before I get home, or you're gonna find someplace else to live.
- Fine.
- Fine.
Good.
You got it?
Do you understand?
Yes, Mom!
Okay!
Love you!
Goodbye.
Did you hang up on me?
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.
Stop the bus.
Can you please stop the bus?
Sorry.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Can I help you, sir?
No.
What?
Pass the ball!
Go, go, go!
Shit, you a'ight?
Get your big ass up, man.
You bleeding and shit?
- He out, man.
- We need another person.
We need one!
You got next.
Who, him?
He gonna be a ref?
That's all we got.
That's all we got.
Let's see what he got.
Let's go, dawg.
Get out here.
Oh, he's passing now.
Right there, dawg.
What's your problem?
That's your man.
Why don't you play some D, man?
Right, right, right.
Hell, no!
You working on this?
Come on, man.
Go, go, go, go.
I'm Jeff.
Kevin.
Ke...
Kevin.
Is your name Kevin Kevin?
No.
So, that's your first name on your jersey?
Yeah, that's my name.
Yeah.
Do you live around here?
Yeah, I don't live far from here.
You obviously don't live around here, though.
No, I was just strolling around today.
It was a nice day, so I thought I'd walk around.
Were you following me, or...
No.
I mean, no.
I saw you on the bus.
Let me explain.
Have you ever seen the movie Signs?
With Mel Gibson and Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin?
Nah, I don't think I have.
I got a phone call this morning.
Someone was asking for Kevin.
But there's no Kevin who lives with me.
It's kind of a common name.
Yeah.
I guess that's true.
I mean, you never got a call, like someone called the wrong house phone?
What if there's no wrong numbers?
Maybe it's always the right house phone.
Everything happens for a reason, right?
Exactly.
No, that's exactly it.
Hey, man, I'm about to go put something in the air real quick.
I don't know if you want to come.
I don't...
I'm sorry...
I don't know what that means.
Smoke weed?
You want to smoke weed with me?
Yeah, man.
I like weed.
Yeah, I can see that.
Wow.
It's nice in here.
- That's nice.
- Yeah.
Oh, shit.
That's a treat.
Check his pockets!
Sorry, Jeff.
Marriage is a compromise.
She got what she wanted, I'm living here in Baton Rouge.
So I get a little somethin'-somethin'.
- Right?
- Sure.
Yeah.
Thank you.
You know what's up.
I got to take this...
It's a business call.
Sweetheart, can I get another Bud Light.
Do you want more wings?
Whatever.
Fine.
I will get glue and fix your shutter.
No.
It is Jeff's responsibility.
That is the point.
He has to do it, not you.
Jeff has to do it.
Okay.
What are you...
Why are you calling me?
Maybe you could get him moving a little bit.
Do you understand?
He's stuck, honey.
He's stuck.
He's 30!
He had a difficult adolescent period.
You of all people would know neither of us had a very easy adolescent period.
- You were older.
- What does that have to do with it?
When you're an adult, you take responsibility for your life.
Okay?
But you're brothers.
You love each other, don't you?
You know, fake it for a little bit just to get...
You know.
Maybe he'll grow on you.
We don't do that, Mom.
We don't spend time together.
Well, Pat, could you at least try?
It's my birthday.
I gotta call you back.
- No, no, no, Pat...
- Bye.
Damn it.
Asshole.
Jeff!
Pat?
What the hell are you doing here?
Kevin beat me up.
I walked.
Who's Kevin?
Some kid I was following.
Well, if he's a kid, how come you didn't kick his ass?
Because I don't believe in fighting, Pat.
And you know that.
Right.
I forgot.
You're a pussy.
Look, Mom called and she's really pissed.
Was Gandhi a pussy?
Yeah, Gandhi was a pussy.
And once again, I have to pick up your slack.
Well, it's not your problem.
Well, it becomes my problem when Mom calls me in the middle of a business meeting.
Yeah?
You're having a business meeting at Hooters?
Yeah.
Yes.
That's very classy.
Right.
Well, business is business.
So, come on.
Get in the car.
Hey!
You don't need to grab onto me.
I'm a little bit conflicted right now, that's all.
About what?
You're just gonna make fun of me, man.
Let's go.
Try me.
I want to learn how you think because I want to free my mind.
Let me try to explain it to you maybe in terms that you would understand.
- Okay.
- This morning
I was meant to have a business meeting with the Kevins.
And destiny.
And now you're here at this weird Hooters thing...
And so now I'm just trying to figure out how to proceed.
What you just said sounded like Yoda took acid and stumbled into a business meeting.
You can make all the fun of Yoda that you want,
Yoda would be fucking killer in a business meeting.
Whatever, man.
Come on!
Let's go.
Get in the Porsche.
Shit!
Hey, I think your Porsche got a ticket, Pat.
Shut up, Jeff.
Just get in the car.
This Porsche is tiny.
The Porsche is normal-sized.
You're a sasquatch.
Are those workout gloves?
I don't think so.
They came with the car so...
Check this out.
You see where those cars are stopping up ahead?
Yeah.
I should probably stop pretty soon, right?
Pat, slow down.
What?
I can't hear you!
Bose surround sound!
Hey, stop it, dude.
This is not funny.
- Count to three and I'll stop.
- Pat, please stop.
Count of three!
One!
Two!
- Pat, look out!
- Three!
Curb!
Curb!
Shit!
Yes!
Will you please stop the car?
It handles better at high speeds!
- Stop the car!
- Shut up!
Tree!
Tree!
Pat?
Fuck!
Wow.
Yeah, that's real bad.
Oh, shit.
What the fuck?
He looks mad.
Are you on drugs?
How many beers have you had?
Shut up, Jeff.
Shut up.
Did you not see that damn tree?
Whatever you do, don't say a word.
Stay in the fucking car.
I am fine, yes.
Thank you for asking.
Burt, should we call an ambulance?
Hi.
There was a pedestrian child in the street and in order to avoid killing it,
I had to swerve and maneuver onto your sidewalk, at which point I lost control of my vehicle and I've hit your tree here.
We can see that.
Do you think we're blind?
No.
Of course not.
I just would like to apologize.
Is he okay?
Yeah, he's fine.
Just a little stunned.
I think that one's hurt.
Maybe we should call the police.
He's fine.
He's okay.
That child's not moving.
Ma'am, he's okay.
Jeff, will you get out of the car?
Yeah.
Get out of the car.
Show her that you're fine.
See?
Live and limber.
- Baby, are you sure you're all right?
- Look at that.
- I am fine, thank you.
- Look at that.
Good as new.
You remind me of my grandson.
Is his name Kevin, by any chance?
Brian, why?
No reason, ma'am.
Do you think there's any way that you and I can take care of this ourselves?
I really don't want to hang out here all afternoon with the cops.
I don't know...
There's some bark off that tree.
It might have ruined the tree, baby.
Whoa.
Is that Linda?
Give me 500 bucks, and we'll call it even.
Excuse me?
No "excuse me," man.
Look at my tree here.
That's a 200-year-old tree.
Might have to do some landscaping.
I'll probably have to bring a tractor in here and a backhoe and dig all this stuff up.
It's a tree!
Have you been drinking?
No.
Why don't we just let the police decide that.
Call 911.
- $100.
- Times five.
- $150.
- Plus $350.
- Fine.
Call the police.
- Call 911.
God damn it!
You take a check?
Yeah.
No problem.
Oh, good.
Boy, he's got some nerve, don't he?
Trying to negotiate with you about our tree.
He come in my yard, hit my tree.
You look at that tree and he don't think he owes me.
Who's that guy she's with?
Get in the car, Jeff.
It was very, very quick and it could have been somebody...
She was wearing a peach dress that she wore this morning, okay?
And they got into our car!
Man, something really big is happening here.
Yeah, no shit, Jeff!
My wife is having an affair!
We don't know that yet.
Let's follow this and see where this leads.
Well, I'm trying to, but I can't see dick so it's kind of hard.
Go!
Go!
Go, go!
Hang on.
- I see them!
- Where?
They're just up here to the left!
There they are!
Pat.
What the fuck are you doing?
You told me to hurry!
Tell me before you swerve so I don't fall off the fucking car!
Okay.
Whatever, just focus on the road!
Where are they going?
They're turning up there!
What street?
South Clark!
South Clark!
They're going to Cochon!
Damn it!
Let me tell you about Cochon.
It's full of A-holes who look down on everybody that's not, like, part of the cool-guy club.
It's so lame.
Look at this, no parking.
I can wait with the car.
No.
I got it.
Pat, there's a fire hydrant!
There's a fire hydrant right here.
I got it.
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
Come on.
Let's go.
Okay, what we got here is a friendly lunch.
It could be a coworker.
It could be a long-lost cousin.
She hates her coworkers and I know her whole family.
We got to hear what they're saying.
Well, body language can tell you a lot, man.
- You're going in there.
- What, me?
Yeah.
I'm not really dressed properly, Pat.
Why don't you just go in there and talk to her?
This could all be a huge misunderstanding.
If I talk to her, she's just gonna deny it.
Why wouldn't she tell you the truth?
Oh, my God.
You have no idea how adult relationships work, do you?
You haven't had a girlfriend since high school.
- So?
So?
- So?
So...
I need to find out exactly what's going on so I'll have the upper hand later.
Do you still love Linda?
There's an empty booth next to them.
Okay?
Just sneak in with my phone.
Here's a little grease money.
Okay.
Get in there, do what you got to do.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- How do you do?
Lovely.
- Fine, thank you.
Can I help you?
Table for one, please.
- Right this way.
- Great.
Thank you.
- Oh, miss?
- Yes?
Could I sit there?
Those tables are saved for two patrons.
- Right.
- Right this way.
Miss?
You know what?
Excuse me.
There are going to be two patrons.
There will be two patrons.
You said table of one.
I meant that more like in the bistro sense, like one plus another one?
Well, just in case, I think this table back here would be quite lovely for you guys.
What if I grease you?
I'm sorry?
I have money.
There's two fives, some ones.
There's a 20.
If I could just sit at that table.
I can't explain.
But it's really important.
I mean, I honestly don't even feel like he really likes me.
Well, that's his problem.
I mean...
From where I stand, there's plenty to like.
Thank you, Steve.
You're a really good listener.
Thank you.
It's such a treat.
I'm just being myself.
Don't say anything.
She might recognize your voice.
If you can hear me, give me a thumbs-up.
Okay, now take the talking part of the phone and hold it, but keep it low, don't let them see.
I really don't think that you want to hear this.
Jeff, just do it!
Okay?
Stop talking so I can hear what's going on.
I can't.
Honestly, I lost a lot of friends because of Pat.
'Cause my friends just don't like him.
I think a little bit's my fault, 'cause I would complain a lot to them and...
For a really long time, I've felt like he and I are...
I don't know...
We got, like, weirdly competitive with each other.
We just never communicate.
He just never listens, ever.
Gosh.
I shouldn't even be talking about this but we haven't had sex in...
I mean, over two months.
That's a long time.
And I think, kind of, what's worse than that is that it's so awkward.
Well, having sex is one thing but making love is something else, right?
What does that even mean?
Thank you, Steve.
I'm not used to being able to talk so openly with someone and have them listen, and care what I'm saying and...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Wait!
Pat, what do you want me to do now, huh?
Hello, my name is Rob.
Can I start you out with something to drink?
Some water.
Excuse me?
- I'll have water.
- I'm sorry?
I'll take some fuckin' water, Rob.
Absolutely.
Jeff?
Whoa!
Hey.
- Wow!
- Hi.
What are you doing here?
I'm just...
Lunching it up, you know?
Getting a little bistro action.
I...
Have you ever met my friend, Steve?
This is my brother-in-law, Jeff.
- This is Steve.
- Hey, Jeff, nice to meet you, man.
- My friend Steve.
- Steve.
We were just gonna leave.
Did you still want me to drop you off at your car?
Yep.
Yeah.
So, I'm going to take him to his car, and I'll see you later.
Hope so.
Nice meeting you, Jeff.
Pat, they're coming out...
What the fuck?
Jeff!
They went that way!
Pat!
Well, then, let's go get the car!
- No car!
- What?
No car!
Help me get a cab!
What are you talkin' about?
What happened to the car?
Nothing!
It got towed.
- That's not funny!
- I'm not...
- I know.
I know it's not.
- It's so not funny!
Help me get a cab!
- There's no way to know where they are.
- Great.
What do we do?
I think we should just sit down right here.
And?
And wait.
- For what?
- For a sign.
I'm not gonna sit here and wait for a fucking sign!
Okay, well, then let's walk!
A school bus just drove by!
It's a sign!
What does it mean?
Do we go to a school?
Is my wife fucking some guy in a janitor closet?
I don't think that's it.
I don't think that's it.
- That's not it.
- Good guess.
Now what?
What are you doing?
I'm looking for a credit card slip.
I don't see why.
If I find the slip, I get his last name and then we can look up where he lives and go beat him up.
No, I get it.
I just don't think they throw those things away.
Just shut up and help.
Find it yet?
- How about now?
- That's not helping!
I think we've gotten off track somewhere.
Like I've gotten off track.
Something feels wrong.
Fine.
I'll do it myself, if it'll make you stop talking.
- Is that it?
- No.
It's not.
Oh, God.
What is that?
No, don't do it, Pat.
You don't have to smell it.
Pat.
Okay.
- Hey.
- Hey, Carol.
That was yummy.
What're you doing?
Don't tell anybody else.
What?
Somebody's messing with me.
- Really?
- Yeah, in this office.
- No.
- Yeah.
I got hit by a plane.
- What?
- A little paper plane came into my...
And all these messages were coming to me on my computer.
Kind of...
- Flirty stuff.
- Flirty?
I know someone's playin' some kind of a joke and I think it's those guys that are in the back over there that did the fantasy football.
Oh, my God, those guys are so hot.
That would be so good.
They're young, too.
Do you think it's Henry?
- Henry?
- Yeah.
He's kind of...
Interesting.
He's married, isn't he?
Okay, let's just say it is somebody here.
What does the message say?
Like what are the details?
Well, somethin' about, you know...
What?
That they're a secret admirer.
They said they were...
I think that's kind of hot.
No, it's not.
It's ridiculous.
And I don't like being the butt of a joke.
How do you know it's a joke?
I mean, how many times do we get to get juiced up like this?
This is awesome.
I'm not getting juiced up over a joke.
You're getting attention.
I am super-jelly.
I want attention.
You're impossible.
When was the last time you had a relationship?
Well, my husband, of course.
No way.
Well, I mean, I went out on dates.
Come on.
I've been to the movies.
- It's no wonder you're so cranky.
- I've been bowling...
- I'm not...
- Yeah, you need to get busy.
- You need to get your pipes cleaned.
- You think I'm...
You need to get f...
Yeah.
Well, I won't tell anyone.
Pinky swear.
What else?
What else?
I did hear her say that she felt neglected.
Sounds like they're banging already.
It's possible.
Don't ever get married, dude.
It fucking sucks.
Really?
I think it would be kind of awesome.
Well, it's not.
Okay.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Okay.
I'm sick of walking.
Okay.
Is that what I think it is?
You know, I've been havin' this really weird dream about Dad lately.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He's a teacher.
And...
We're in this classroom with a whole bunch of kids, and we all sit down.
And Dad asks everyone,
"What's the greatest day in the history of the world?"
And one kid is like, "Christmas."
And Dad's like, "No."
And whenever they get the answer wrong, they have to leave the room.
And eventually it's just me and Dad.
And he looks at me and says,
"Pat, what's the greatest day in the history of the world?"
And I don't know, 'cause I'm nervous.
And I'm like, "Dad, I don't know."
And he just looks at me and he smiles and he says...
He says, "Today." He says, "Today."
How'd you know that?
He says, "Today is the greatest day in the history of the world."
Yeah.
I have that dream, Pat.
Except in mine, it's me, you and Dad in his car.
Okay.
I guess it's just something he said to us when we were kids or somethin'.
It's like floating' around in both of our brains.
What is wrong with you?
- Pat.
- What?
What?
What is wrong with you?
Why do you want to be like this?
- What are you talking about?
- We had...
We were havin'...
We're having the same dream!
What the fuck are you talking about?
Why do you want to live like this?
You're drifting through this life with no awareness of how special this is.
You want to talk about what's happening right now, right here?
What's happening right now is that I'm getting lectured by my pothead brother who lives in our mom's basement at 30 years old about how I don't understand the universe!
Hey, here's some understanding for you.
A job and a car and a wife and an apartment!
I got to go.
What?
- I have to go, Pat.
- Where are you going?
You know what?
You wouldn't...
You would laugh at me again.
Jesus Christ.
You see a fucking truck with the word "Kevin" on it and you have to run after it?
Yeah.
I do.
I wish I was that stupid!
You're a dick!
You know what?
I have an asshole for a brother.
It breaks my heart.
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!
- You call me an asshole?
- Yeah, you are an asshole!
You fucking piece of shit!
You drive a fucking Boxster!
Fuck you!
Don't do this, Pat!
Fuck you!
You get down.
Get down on the fucking ground!
Fucking idiot!
You and Mom will never understand me.
And you're all I have left!
Another Jack and Coke?
Nope.
Got to get home.
Old lady, huh?
No, she's boning another dude.
Right on.
Stop the car.
Stop.
Please, stop?
- Hi.
- Hello.
Hey, so, my sister and her husband just got here a little while ago in that red Camry out there.
And...
I need to...
I'm meeting them.
So...
- Okay...
- Actually, it's an emergency.
I have to get her medication, like, right now, so what's her room number?
We have a privacy policy, sir.
I'm sorry, I can't give you her number.
I know it's like policy and everything, but this is a family emergency, so maybe you could just give me the room number...
It'll take me a second to call.
I lied.
It's not an emergency.
It's not a health emergency.
It is a financial emergency.
Their home is about to be foreclosed on and I need to make a payment.
- Just stop.
- Okay.
- You're embarrassing yourself.
- Right.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me?
No, just thank you so much.
Pat!
Pat!
Oh, my God.
Jeff.
- Oh, my God, Pat.
- What the fuck?
I was on the truck.
The truck came here and now you're here.
- This shit is aligned!
- Shut the fuck up.
- What?
- Linda is here, in this hotel somewhere.
- With the guy?
- Yeah, probably with the guy.
Sorry.
How the fuck did you find me?
It was the candy man.
Oh, shit.
He's right there.
Okay, what should we do?
Duck in there.
I'm gigantic!
Come on, let's go.
What do you want to do?
Should we stay?
Should we wait?
Do we just wait, or...
We could wait.
I don't know.
I don't...
Should I call her?
Maybe I call her cell phone right now.
And then, like, act innocent and be like, "What's going on?"
You could try that.
You know, you're not fucking helping at all.
You're just like, "Do you want to do that?"
Do you want to know what I think you should do?
Yeah.
I think you should take a few deep breaths, close your eyes, and focus.
That is like stupid fucking Jeff mumbo-jumbo.
If you have any other idea, even one,
I'll be happy to try it without making fun of you.
Okay, all right.
Okay.
Close your eyes.
What do you see?
I just can't stop picturing what's going on.
What if she's, like, giving him a hand job?
You know, I think they're adults.
It's probably unlikely she's giving him a hand job.
I'm gonna break down the door.
No.
Pat.
I'm gonna break it down.
Listen.
Wait, hold on.
That's a terrible idea.
I've seen you try to do things physically.
I'll do it.
Do you think you can do that?
I wish I could get some sort of running start.
You totally can.
There's, like, hallways.
You run and turn.
Parallel isn't gonna help me.
You could run and turn right at the last second.
I wouldn't...
No.
That's not gonna work.
All right.
One, two, three!
Fuck!
- Run!
- What was that?
- Are you okay?
- Fuck!
Get up!
- Linda!
- Pat!
What are you...
- Pat, don't...
Pat, stop!
- What's going on?
- Steve, let him go!
- Either you're gonna calm down...
- Let him go!
Jeff!
- Don't fucking move!
- What are you doing?
- What the hell is going on?
- We just got here!
- Who are you people?
You, shut up!
Who the fuck is this guy?
He's just a friend, okay?
Calm down.
- There's wine!
- Yeah!
There's a bottle of wine on ice, and a...
What is this?
- That's a...
A sex board?
No, you bring it with the...
Pat!
And your face is flushed, which means you're horny.
- No!
- What the fuck is going on?
Stop yelling and I'll answer all of your questions.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
I'm ready to go home.
Linda, I think you should come with me.
Excuse me!
You should shut the fuck up!
I think that you should go and I'll call you later.
You're not calling this fucking guy.
Linda, do you want me to stay?
- I think you should go.
- You should go!
You need to go!
I'm gonna stay and talk to Pat, okay?
Time for you to go, man.
- Get out, bro!
- All right, Pat.
Get out!
Okay.
Start talking.
Is there anyone else in here?
Well, I'm a little upset, actually,
- and I think that it's understandable!
- I understand that.
Look, what I need to know...
I just need to know one thing, okay?
- Okay.
What?
- Okay.
Are you mad because you came in here and you found me with another man?
Yes.
- Yes.
- Or...
Or are you mad because you're afraid that you might lose me?
What?
There's like a part B now?
Please, don't do that.
It's just semantic bullshit!
- No, it isn't!
It isn't!
- Yeah, it is!
- You really don't know the difference.
- You know what?
Because if you don't understand the difference...
Linda!
Linda.
I'm gonna try to listen to you blabber about whatever this is.
And I'm gonna try to understand your incoherent babble.
Go.
- Why do you always do that?
- What?
- I'm listening.
- No, you're not.
Yeah, I'm trying.
You always just make me feel so stupid!
I'm sorry it's stupid!
I catch you trying to cheat on me and...
You make fun of everything I say.
I'm really just trying to have a conversation with you right now.
This is why our relationship is so fucked.
Because you know what?
When I asked you if you would take me to Cochon you laughed at me.
Who care...
I'm sorry.
That's...
But when I asked Steve, he just, you know, said, let's go.
Yeah, 'cause he wanted to get in your pants!
Well, maybe, but at least he's trying to put in some time and effort!
Let me tell you something about Cochon.
- Cochon is full of assholes...
- You're not even and snobs in fucking turquoise tailored shirts and pink ties, like that asshole!
You want to ask me to take you there?
Fine.
I'll take you to fucking Cochon.
We'll...
- Yeah.
- God, you're not even listening to me.
No, I'm hearing you loud and clear.
You're not!
It's not about the restaurant.
I just want you to, like, care that I want to go there!
And do you think it's about this guy?
Because I really don't even fucking care about him!
He's nice.
- He listens to me.
- I'm nice.
But you and I, we are petty, we are passive-aggressive with each other, we don't even fight!
I mean, this is a miracle right now!
And what I think, honestly, is that we have no house, we have no kids, thank God!
It would be really fucking easy for us to just walk away!
It'd be super simple.
And that is what I think that we should do.
Hang on, hang on.
You know, let's just not, like, let's just not...
Can we not talk about this anymore?
Let's just go home and sleep on it, and, like...
And like...
Forget it.
I'm gonna go stay at my mom's.
Bye, Jeff.
Jeffrey, where are you?
I asked you to call me after you got the wood glue.
I'm at the office.
Let me know what's going on.
Thanks.
Bye.
Oh, please.
It sure is a noisy little thing.
Yeah.
- Eight glasses a day, my doctor says.
- Really?
You're kidding me.
Blow out my biceps trying to lift these cups that many times.
- I'm Barry.
- Sharon.
Nice to meet you.
Same here.
What am I saying?
I know you're Sharon.
I've seen you around.
I really do like flowers.
Yeah?
Like, metaphorically, too.
Symbolically.
All kinds.
Gardenias are my favorite.
I'm not following you.
Excuse me.
It was nice meeting you.
Just stupid.
Sharon?
What's going on?
I think it's over.
What happened?
What?
This is not the way I imagined my life was gonna be.
How did you imagine it?
I was gonna be in the Peace Corps and all that crap, you know, with some guy in an exotic place, all worldly and giving and shit,
and living in a little hut, and taking care of cute little kids
and kissing under waterfalls and stuff, you know.
You can still kiss under waterfalls and stuff like that.
It's like, how many good years do I have left?
I hate my kids right now.
I don't know when that happened.
They were so cute.
I look at the pictures of them, and our family...
Don't cry.
Have some more tissue.
- Don't explain.
Oh, God.
- No.
I just...
Oh, Carol, I'm sorry.
It'll just make it worse.
Don't explain.
But it's not what you think!
Yeah, it is.
I wish that I could
see the world like you.
Really?
I don't know.
You have this, like, belief in this cosmic order.
I really envy that.
You don't want to be like me.
I'm not happy at all.
You know, since Dad died, I've had this...
Had this feeling that it had to be for a reason.
I keep thinking that the signs are all about me, but maybe...
Maybe they're about you and your marriage.
My marriage is not good.
It is a
disaster.
I just want to feel like I love Linda.
And I want to feel like she loves me.
And we both want to, like, be in love.
I miss it and I want it so bad.
I think you should just say that.
To her.
It's not that simple, Jeff.
I don't know.
I think it could be that simple.
I mean, wouldn't you be psyched if Linda walked in here right now and sat down in this tub next to you and said,
"Pat, I want to be in love with you again"?
That would be awesome.
Dude, you need to say that to her.
You need to tell her that right now.
- River Parish.
- I am so sorry.
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
Don't apologize, seriously.
- But I want to.
- It's okay.
No, I just...
It was so weird and didn't come out the way I...
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
It's just that I'm not gay.
But that's okay.
I'm not gay, either.
But you like women.
So?
Well, I like men.
I like men, too.
And to me, it's like, at this point in my life, whether it's a man or a woman, it doesn't matter.
I want someone who gets me.
I feel like I deserve that.
And I think you do, too.
Well, it's important, yes.
But it doesn't mean
I want to sleep with everybody that understands me.
That's all.
No, no, no.
That's not my intention.
Isn't the most important thing finding someone who sees you exactly as you are?
Who gets the Peace Corps and the kissing under waterfalls?
Yeah.
So?
Carol?
Are you there?
Hello?
Shit.
Okay, sorry, everybody.
Just head for the exits!
Single file!
Keep it orderly!
Please!
Close your eyes.
It's clear.
Come on.
There's my car, right here.
Where are we going?
We're all wet.
- I don't know.
What do you think?
- I'm sorry, I don't know.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Let's go to the mall and get drinks with the little umbrellas in them.
Bigger.
Wilder.
I haven't been to New Orleans in 20 years.
How about that?
It's perfect.
Okay, let's go.
Come on out, everybody!
Just come right out.
Shit.
What is this?
It looks like really bad traffic.
Well, I mean in your, you know...
- You mean, like, is it a sign?
- I don't know.
It could be.
- It definitely could be.
- How do I know what to do?
That's the big question, yeah.
It's a constant struggle.
I think you got to go with your gut.
Well, I'm not going to stop now.
Right?
Hey, Pat?
If we don't get a chance to reconnect today,
I'm, like, super proud of you.
Linda!
Sorry.
- Second thoughts?
- Well, I just...
It's okay.
Pat?
Pat!
- I think that's my son.
- Sharon?
What now, my man?
I guess I'll go back.
We'll have to wait for all this traffic to clear.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just...
You ever feel like you're waiting forever to figure out what your destiny is, and then when you do it's not really that exciting?
Linda!
Pat?
Pat!
Linda!
What are you doing here?
I want to be in love again.
What?
Things have gotten way off track.
And weird and shitty.
And I'm a big part of that, and I'm really sorry for it.
- Pat!
- What?
Honey, what's happening?
What's the matter?
- Why are you running down...
- Mom?
What's going...
Oh, hi.
- Wait, what are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
How did you get here?
In Carol's...
This is Carol.
Hi.
I'm Linda.
Nice to meet you.
Jeff...
Jeff's here?
Whoa, hey!
Did you see that?
Is he okay?
Is he okay?
Yeah, we're here.
A car just went off the bridge.
There's people inside of it.
Somebody jumped in!
Wait!
Our dad's still down there!
Fuck.
Come on.
Help!
Help us!
Dad!
Help!
Come on, girls!
Come on.
Swim hard!
Come on, honey!
Give me your hand.
That a girl.
Come on.
- Get back there.
- Dad?
Hey, the car's going down!
The car's sinking!
Dad!
Jeff!
Dad!
Come on, Dad!
We need some help over here.
Pat?
Over here!
Over here!
Pat!
- Jeff!
- Jeff!
Help!
Help!
Man in the water!
Help!
Two survivors in sight.
Five feet off the first cleat.
Coming into the dive deck.
Hurry!
Get a hold of him!
One, two, three!
Jeff!
We have an unresponsive person!
He's not moving!
Call the command center!
Have an ambulance meet us at the pier!
- Jeff!
- Sir, we got to help him.
We got him.
Do something!
Jesus!
Sir, sir.
Jeff!
- He's not moving!
- Starting CPR!
Get off me!
Leave me alone!
You need to sit down!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
Jeff, wake up!
- Jeff!
- Still not responding.
Can you hear me?
Hey, hey, you okay?
Hey.
Sir?
- Are you okay?
- Oh, God.
Let's get blankets!
Sir, stay still.
Let me sit up.
What happened?
Everything.
I'm hungry.
And coming up next, the story of two girls, their father, and the man who was in the right place at the right time.
The car that was behind us crashed into the back of us and then we went over the bridge.
And then this man, he just came and broke our window...
And he almost died doing it.
If we had lost our dad, you know, I just really can't even imagine it.
We're just really thankful he was there.
We'll be right back with that rescue tale of local councilman Kevin Landry and his two little girls.
All that and more when we come back.
I watched Signs again last night.
It keeps getting better every time I see it.
It's funny.
The first time you watch it, it's hard to understand what it's about.
It just sort of meanders.
And then, everything comes together in this one perfect moment at the end.
And when you watch it a second or a third or a fourth time, you start to see that all of this randomness
is leading towards a perfect moment.
My favorite character is the little girl.
Everyone thinks she's so strange because she can't finish a glass of water.
She's convinced they're contaminated.
So, by the end of the film, there are glasses of water littered around this house.
And then, it's the water that saves them.
And that was fate.
I can't help but wonder about my fate.
About my destiny.
Renewal.
Vitality.
Energy-
Are you tired of feeling sluggish?
Do you feel like life is passing you by?
Then we've got the solution for you.
It's called "The Most Incredible Vitamin In The World"

Beware of imitators.
Call 1-800...
Hello?
Yo, Kevin.
No, this is Jeff.
Where Kevin at?
I don't know.
Oh, man, look, don't be fucking around!
Where the fuck is Kevin?
Kevin doesn't live here.
There's always some motherfucker trying to tell me there ain't no Kevin!
Let me put this word in your fucking peanut brain, Kevin!
K-E
- V-I-N!
Kevin.
What are you doing?
Doing this.
Some strawbs, hand-sliced.
A white rose of whipped cream.
Bam!
Bon appétit.
What's the special occasion?
This is one of those "just because" breakfasts, you know?
It sounds corny, but relationships are like flowers and flowers need water to bloom.
Consider this sprinkling from a watering can.
Well, thanks.
- That's nice.
- You're welcome.
Enjoy.
Oh, my gosh.
I got some good news, actually.
Yeah?
I got a phone call from Randy.
Is he the guy that we talked to at that barbecue?
Oh, no, that's a different Randy.
- But that guy's name was Randy, right?
- Yes.
I liked his wife.
Different Randy.
- We should have them over.
- Yeah.
This is Randy at Millennium Porsche.
Can I tell you something?
With no money down, this thing is practically free.
Pat!
No!
Whoa, whoa.
Don't start with no.
- That's what this is.
- Don't start with no.
You're just, like, in this mindset.
And you're not even...
It's not a mindset.
We don't have the money.
Yeah.
That's the mindset I'm talking about.
Honey, look, I'm trying to be really careful, and I've cut back on some things.
And, like, we promised we were going to get a house this year...
I'm just trying to be a grown-up about this.
Surprise.
We got it.
This is happening.
Look...
Everything you just said about the house, you know, our future, you're exactly right.
And I'm so lucky to have you looking out for us in that way.
But I'm looking out for us in another way.
I'm looking out for...
That intangible thing that every couple needs.
It's a little bit of magic, and a little bit of danger, frankly.
This is gonna solve a lot of our problems.
This tension right now.
As soon as you get in that thing and you feel the energy and you feel it rumble in your gut.
If you don't get turned on, you're made of stone.
Where is it?
It's in the driveway.
Are you...
Is this...
Oh, come on.
Okay, okay...
That's...
Hello?
- Mom?
- Jeff.
Hi.
You know, you're supposed to say "hello" when you pick up the phone.
Yeah, I know.
I thought that maybe you were somebody else, but you're not.
What do you do in the basement?
You're not cleaning it.
You really want to know?
You didn't like it last time we had this conversation.
Okay, no.
You know what?
You're right.
I don't.
Did you get the wood glue?
What are you talking about?
I left you a note on the kitchen counter.
I haven't been upstairs.
One of the shutters on the pantry is broken and I need you to fix it.
You know what, I'm kind of busy right now, so...
All I want for my birthday is for you to get your ass off that couch, and you get on the bus
-and you go to the Home Depot.
- I'm not on the couch.
You come home and fix the shutter before I get home, or you're gonna find someplace else to live.
- Fine.
- Fine.
Good.
You got it?
Do you understand?
Yes, Mom!
Okay!
Love you!
Goodbye.
Did you hang up on me?
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.
Stop the bus.
Can you please stop the bus?
Sorry.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Can I help you, sir?
No.
What?
Pass the ball!
Go, go, go!
Shit, you a'ight?
Get your big ass up, man.
You bleeding and shit?
- He out, man.
- We need another person.
We need one!
You got next.
Who, him?
He gonna be a ref?
That's all we got.
That's all we got.
Let's see what he got.
Let's go, dawg.
Get out here.
Oh, he's passing now.
Right there, dawg.
What's your problem?
That's your man.
Why don't you play some D, man?
Right, right, right.
Hell, no!
You working on this?
Come on, man.
Go, go, go, go.
I'm Jeff.
Kevin.
E...
Kevin.
Is your name Kevin Kevin?
No.
So, that's your first name on your jersey?
Yeah, that's my name.
Yeah.
Do you live around here?
Yeah, I don't live far from here.
You obviously don't live around here, though.
No, I was just strolling around today.
It was a nice day, so I thought I'd walk around.
Were you following me, or...
No.
I mean, no.
I saw you on the bus.
Let me explain.
Have you ever seen the movie Signs?
With Mel Gibson and Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin?
Nah, I don't think I have.
I got a phone call this morning.
Someone was asking for Kevin.
But there's no Kevin who lives with me.
It's kind of a common name.
Yeah.
I guess that's true.
I mean, you never got a call, like someone called the wrong house phone?
What if there's no wrong numbers?
Maybe it's always the right house phone.
Everything happens for a reason, right?
Exactly.
No, that's exactly it.
Hey, man, I'm about to go put something in the air real quick.
I don't know if you want to come.
I don't...
I'm sorry...
I don't know what that means.
Smoke weed?
You want to smoke weed with me?
Yeah, man.
I like weed.
Yeah, I can see that.
Wow.
It's nice in here.
- That's nice.
- Yeah.
Oh, shit.
That's a treat.
Check his pockets!
Sorry, Jeff.
Marriage is a compromise.
She got what she wanted, I'm living here in Baton Rouge.
So I get a little somethin'-somethin'.
- Right?
- Sure.
Yeah.
Thank you.
You know what's up.
I got to take this...
It's a business call.
Sweetheart, can I get another Bud Light.
Do you want more wings?
Whatever.
Fine.
I will get glue and fix your shutter.
No.
It is Jeff's responsibility.
That is the point.
He has to do it, not you.
Jeff has to do it.
Okay.
What are you...
Why are you calling me?
Maybe you could get him moving a little bit.
Do you understand?
He's stuck, honey.
He's stuck.
He's 30!
He had a difficult adolescent period.
You of all people would know neither of us had a very easy adolescent period.
- You were older.
- What does that have to do with it?
When you're an adult, you take responsibility for your life.
Okay?
But you're brothers.
You love each other, don't you?
You know, fake it for a little bit just to get...
You know.
Maybe he'll grow on you.
We don't do that, Mom.
We don't spend time together.
Well, Pat, could you at least try?
It's my birthday.
I gotta call you back.
- No, no, no, Pat...
- Bye.
Damn it.
Asshole.
Jeff!
Pat?
What the hell are you doing here?
Kevin beat me up.
I walked.
Who's Kevin?
Some kid I was following.
Well, if he's a kid, how come you didn't kick his ass?
Because I don't believe in fighting, Pat.
And you know that.
Right.
I forgot.
You're a pussy.
Look, Mom called and she's really pissed.
Was Gandhi a pussy?
Yeah, Gandhi was a pussy.
And once again, I have to pick up your slack.
Well, it's not your problem.
Well, it becomes my problem when Mom calls me in the middle of a business meeting.
Yeah?
You're having a business meeting at Hooters?
Yeah.
Yes.
That's very classy.
Right.
Well, business is business.
So, come on.
Get in the car.
Hey!
You don't need to grab onto me.
I'm a little bit conflicted right now, that's all.
About what?
You're just gonna make fun of me, man.
Let's go.
Try me.
I want to learn how you think because I want to free my mind.
Let me try to explain it to you maybe in terms that you would understand.
- Okay.
- This morning
I was meant to have a business meeting with the Kevins.
And destiny.
And now you're here at this weird Hooters thing...
And so now I'm just trying to figure out how to proceed.
What you just said sounded like Yoda took acid and stumbled into a business meeting.
You can make all the fun of Yoda that you want,
Yoda would be fucking killer in a business meeting.
Whatever, man.
Come on!
Let's go.
Get in the Porsche.
Shit!
Hey, I think your Porsche got a ticket, Pat.
Shut up, Jeff.
Just get in the car.
This Porsche is tiny.
The Porsche is normal-sized.
You're a sasquatch.
Are those workout gloves?
I don't think so.
They came with the car so...
Check this out.
You see where those cars are stopping up ahead?
Yeah.
I should probably stop pretty soon, right?
Pat, slow down.
What?
I can't hear you!
Bose surround sound!
Hey, stop it, dude.
This is not funny.
- Count to three and I'll stop.
- Pat, please stop.
Count of three!
One!
Two!
- Pat, look out!
- Three!
Curb!
Curb!
Shit!
Yes!
Will you please stop the car?
It handles better at high speeds!
- Stop the car!
- Shut up!
Tree!
Tree!
Pat?
Fuck!
Wow.
Yeah, that's real bad.
Oh, shit.
What the fuck?
He looks mad.
Are you on drugs?
How many beers have you had?
Shut up, Jeff.
Shut up.
Did you not see that damn tree?
Whatever you do, don't say a word.
Stay in the fucking car.
I am fine, yes.
Thank you for asking.
Burt, should we call an ambulance?
Hi.
There was a pedestrian child in the street and in order to avoid killing it,
I had to swerve and maneuver onto your sidewalk, at which point I lost control of my vehicle and I've hit your tree here.
We can see that.
Do you think we're blind?
No.
Of course not.
I just would like to apologize.
Is he okay?
Yeah, he's fine.
Just a little stunned.
I think that one's hurt.
Maybe we should call the police.
He's fine.
He's okay.
That child's not moving.
Ma'am, he's okay.
Jeff, will you get out of the car?
Yeah.
Get out of the car.
Show her that you're fine.
See?
Live and limber.
- Baby, are you sure you're all right?
- Look at that.
- I am fine, thank you.
- Look at that.
Good as new.
You remind me of my grandson.
Is his name Kevin, by any chance?
Brian, why?
No reason, ma'am.
I really don't want to hang out here all afternoon with the cops.
I don't know...
There's some bark off that tree.
It might have ruined the tree, baby.
Whoa.
Is that Linda?
Give me 500 bucks, and we'll call it even.
Excuse me?
No "excuse me," man.
Look at my tree here.
That's a 200-year-old tree.
Might have to do some landscaping.
I'll probably have to bring a tractor in here and a backhoe and dig all this stuff up.
It's a tree!
Have you been drinking?
No.
Why don't we just let the police decide that.
Call 911.
-$100.
- Times five.
-$150.
- Plus $350.
- Fine.
Call the police.
- Call 911.
God damn it!
You take a check?
Yeah.
No problem.
Oh, good.
Boy, he's got some nerve, don't he?
Trying to negotiate with you about our tree.
He come in my yard, hit my tree.
You look at that tree and he don't think he owes me.
Who's that guy she's with?
Get in the car, Jeff.
It was very, very quick and it could have been somebody...
She was wearing a peach dress that she wore this morning, okay?
And they got into our car!
Man, something really big is happening here.
Yeah, no shit, Jeff!
My wife is having an affair!
We don't know that yet.
Let's follow this and see where this leads.
Well, I'm trying to, but I can't see dick so it's kind of hard.
Go!
Go!
Go, go!
Hang on.
- I see them!
- Where?
They're just up here to the left!
There they are!
Pat.
What the fuck are you doing?
You told me to hurry!
Tell me before you swerve so I don't fall off the fucking car!
Okay.
Whatever, just focus on the road!
Where are they going?
They're turning up there!
What street?
South Clark!
South Clark!
They're going to Cochon!
Damn it!
Let me tell you about Cochon.
It's full of A-holes who look down on everybody that's not, like, part of the cool-guy club.
It's so lame.
Look at this, no parking.
I can wait with the car.
No.
I got it.
Pat, there's a fire hydrant!
There's a fire hydrant right here.
I got it.
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
Come on.
Let's go.
Okay, what we got here is a friendly lunch.
It could be a coworker.
It could be a long-lost cousin.
She hates her coworkers and I know her whole family.
We got to hear what they're saying.
Well, body language can tell you a lot, man.
- You're going in there.
- What, me?
Yeah.
I'm not really dressed properly, Pat.
Why don't you just go in there and talk to her?
This could all be a huge misunderstanding.
If I talk to her, she's just gonna deny it.
Why wouldn't she tell you the truth?
Oh, my God.
You have no idea how adult relationships work, do you?
You haven't had a girlfriend since high school.
- So?
So?
- So?
So...
I need to find out exactly what's going on so I'll have the upper hand later.
Do you still love Linda?
There's an empty booth next to them.
Okay?
Just sneak in with my phone.
Here's a little grease money.
Okay.
Get in there, do what you got to do.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- How do you do?
Lovely.
- Fine, thank you.
Can I help you?
Table for one, please.
- Right this way.
- Great.
Thank you.
- Oh, miss?
- Yes?
Could I sit there?
- Right.
- Right this way.
Miss?
You know what?
Excuse me.
There are going to be two patrons.
There will be two patrons.
You said table of one.
I meant that more like in the bistro sense, like one plus another one?
Well, just in case, I think this table back here would be quite lovely for you guys.
What if I grease you?
I'm sorry?
I have money.
There's two fives, some ones.
There's a 20.
If I could just sit at that table.
I can't explain.
But it's really important.
I mean, I honestly don't even feel like he really likes me.
Well, that's his problem.
I mean...
From where I stand, there's plenty to like.
Thank you, Steve.
You're a really good listener.
Thank you.
It's such a treat.
I'm just being myself.
Don't say anything.
She might recognize your voice.
If you can hear me, give me a thumbs-up.
Okay, now take the talking part of the phone and hold it, but keep it low, don't let them see.
I really don't think that you want to hear this.
Jeff, just do it!
Okay?
Stop talking so I can hear what's going on.
I can't.
Honestly, I lost a lot of friends because of Pat.
'Cause my friends just don't like him.
I think a little bit's my fault, 'cause I would complain a lot to them and...
For a really long time, I've felt like he and I are...
I don't know...
We got, like, weirdly competitive with each other.
We just never communicate.
He just never listens, ever.
Gosh.
I shouldn't even be talking about this but we haven't had sex in...
I mean, over two months.
That's a long time.
And I think, kind of, what's worse than that is that it's so awkward.
Well, having sex is one thing but making love is something else, right?
What does that even mean?
Thank you, Steve.
I'm not used to being able to talk so openly with someone and have them listen, and care what I'm saying and...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Wail!
Pat, what do you want me to do now, huh?
Hello, my name is Rob.
Can I start you out with something to drink?
Some water.
Excuse me?
- I'll have water.
- I'm sorry?
I'll take some fuckin' water, Rob.
Absolutely.
J eff?
Whoa!
Hey.
- Wow!
- Hi.
What are you doing here?
I'm just...
Lunching it up, you know?
Getting a little bistro action.
'Pp-
Have you ever met my friend, Steve?
This is my brother-in-law, Jeff.
- This is Steve.
- Hey, Jeff, nice to meet you, man.
- My friend Steve.
- Steve.
We were just gonna leave.
Did you still want me to drop you off at your car?
Yep.
Yeah.
So, I'm going to take him to his car, and I'll see you later.
Hope so.
Nice meeting you, Jeff.
Pat, they're coming out...
What the fuck?
Jeff!
They went that way!
Pat!
Well, then, let's go get the car!
- No car!
- What?
No car!
Help me get a cab!
What are you talkin' about?
What happened to the car?
Nothing!
It got towed.
- That's not funny!
- I'm not...
- I know.
I know it's not.
- It's so not funny!
Help me get a cab!
- There's no way to know where they are.
- Great.
What do we do?
I think we should just sit down right here.
- And?
- And wait.
I'm not gonna sit here and wait for a fucking sign!
Okay, well, then let's walk!
A school bus just drove by!
It's a sign!
What does it mean?
Do we go to a school?
Is my wife fucking some guy in a janitor closet?
I don't think that's it.
I don't think that's it.
- That's not it.
- Good guess.
Now what?
What are you doing?
I'm looking for a credit card slip.
I don't see why.
If I find the slip, I get his last name and then we can look up where he lives and go beat him up.
No, I get it.
I just don't think they throw those things away.
Just shut up and help.
Find it yet?
- How about now?
- That's not helping!
I think we've gotten off track somewhere.
Like I've gotten off track.
Something feels wrong.
Fine.
I'll do it myself, if it'll make you stop talking.
- Is that it?
- No.
It's not.
Oh, God.
What is that?
No, don't do it, Pat.
You don't have to smell it.
Pat.
Okay.
- Hey.
- Hey, Carol.
That was yummy.
What're you doing?
Don't tell anybody else.
What?
Somebody's messing with me.
- Really?
- Yeah, in this office.
- No.
- Yeah.
I got hit by a plane.
- What?
- A little paper plane came into my...
And all these messages were coming to me on my computer.
Kind of...
- Flirty stuff.
- Flirty?
I know someone's playin' some kind of a joke and I think it's those guys that are in the back over there that did the fantasy football.
Oh, my God, those guys are so hot.
That would be so good.
They're young, too.
Do you think it's Henry?
- Henry?
- Yeah.
He's kind of...
Interesting.
He's married, isn't he?
Okay, let's just say it is somebody here.
What does the message say?
Like what are the details?
Well, somethin' about, you know...
What?
That they're a secret admirer.
They said they were...
I think that's kind of hot.
No, it's not.
It's ridiculous.
And I don't like being the butt of a joke.
How do you know it's a joke?
I mean, how many times do we get to get juiced up like this?
This is awesome.
I'm not getting juiced up over a joke.
You're getting attention.
I am super-jelly.
I want attention.
You're impossible.
When was the last time you had a relationship?
Well, my husband, of course.
No way.
Well, I mean, I went out on dates.
Come on.
I've been to the movies.
- It's no wonder you're so cranky.
- I've been bowling...
- I'm not...
- Yeah, you need to get busy.
- You need to get your pipes cleaned.
- You think I'm...
You need to get f...
Yeah.
Well, I won't tell anyone.
Pinky swear.
What else?
What else?
I did hear her say that she felt neglected.
Sounds like they're banging already.
It's possible.
Don't ever get married, dude.
It fucking sucks.
Really?
I think it would be kind of awesome.
Well, it's not.
Okay.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Okay.
I'm sick of walking.
Okay.
Is that what I think it is?
You know, I've been havin' this really weird dream about Dad lately.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He's a teacher.
And...
We're in this classroom with a whole bunch of kids, and we all sit down.
And Dad asks everyone,
"What's the greatest day in the history of the world?"
And Dad's like, "No."
And whenever they get the answer wrong, they have to leave the room.
And eventually it's just me and Dad.
And he looks at me and says,
"Pat, what's the greatest day in the history of the world?"
And I don't know, 'cause I'm nervous.
And I'm like, "Dad, I don't know."
And he just looks at me and he smiles and he says...
He says, "Today." He says, "Today."
How'd you know that?
He says, "Today is the greatest day in the history of the world."
Yeah.
I have that dream, Pat.
Except in mine, it's me, you and Dad in his car.
Okay.
I guess it's just something he said to us when we were kids or somethin.
It's like floating' around in both of our brains.
What is wrong with you?
- Pat.
- What?
What?
What is wrong with you?
Why do you want to be like this?
- What are you talking about?
- We had...
We were havin'...
We're having the same dream!
What the fuck are you talking about?
Why do you want to live like this?
You're drifting through this life with no awareness of how special this is.
You want to talk about what's happening right now, right here?
What's happening right now is that I'm getting lectured by my pothead brother who lives in our mom's basement at 30 years old about how I don't understand the universe!
Hey, here's some understanding for you.
A job and a car and a wife and an apartment!
L got to 90-
What?
- I have to go, Pat.
- Where are you going?
You know what?
You wouldn't...
You would laugh at me again.
Jesus Christ.
You see a fucking truck with the word "Kevin" on it and you have to run after it?
Yeah.
I do.
I wish I was that stupid!
You're a dick!
You know what?
I have an asshole for a brother.
It breaks my heart.
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!
- You call me an asshole?
- Yeah, you are an asshole!
You fucking piece of shit!
You drive a fucking Boxster!
Fuck you!
Don't do this, Pat!
Fuck you!
You get down.
Get down on the fucking ground!
Fucking idiot!
You and Mom will never understand me.
And you're all I have left!
Another Jack and Coke?
Nope.
Got to get home.
Old lady, huh?
No, she's boning another dude.
Right on.
Stop the car.
Stop.
Please, stop?
- Hi.
- Hello.
Hey, so, my sister and her husband just got here a little while ago in that red Camry out there.
And...
I need to...
I'm meeting them.
So...
- Okay...
- Actually, it's an emergency.
I have to get her medication, like, right now, so what's her room number?
We have a privacy policy, sir.
I'm sorry, I can't give you her number.
I know it's like policy and everything, but this is a family emergency, so maybe you could just give me the room number...
It'll take me a second to call.
I lied.
It's not an emergency.
It's not a health emergency.
It is a financial emergency.
Their home is about to be foreclosed on and I need to make a payment.
- Just stop.
- Okay.
- You're embarrassing yourself.
- Right.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me?
No, just thank you so much.
Pat!
Pat!
Oh, my God.
Jeff.
- Oh, my God, Pat.
- What the fuck?
I was on the truck.
The truck came here and now you're here.
- This shit is aligned!
- Shut the fuck up.
- What?
- Linda is here, in this hotel somewhere.
- With the guy?
- Yeah, probably with the guy.
Sorry-
How the fuck did you find me?
It was the candy man.
Oh, shit.
He's right there.
Okay, what should we do?
Duck in there.
I'm gigantic!
Come on, let's go.
What do you want to do? Should we stay?
Should we wait?
Do we just wait, or...
We could wait.
I don't know.
I don't...
Should I call her?
Maybe I call her cell phone right now.
And then, like, act innocent and be like, "What's going on?"
You could try that.
You know, you're not fucking helping at all.
You're just like, "Do you want to do that?"
Do you want to know what I think you should do?
Yeah.
I think you should take a few deep breaths, close your eyes, and focus.
That is like stupid fucking Jeff mumbo-jumbo.
If you have any other idea, even one,
I'll be happy to try it without making fun of you.
Okay, all right.
Okay.
Close your eyes.
What do you see?
I just can't stop picturing what's going on.
What if she's, like, giving him a hand job?
You know, I think they're adults.
It's probably unlikely she's giving him a hand job.
I'm gonna break down the door.
No.
Pat.
I'm gonna break it down.
Listen.
Wait, hold on.
That's a terrible idea.
I've seen you try to do things physically.
I'll do it.
Do you think you can do that?
I wish I could get some sort of running start.
You totally can.
There's, like, hallways.
You run and turn.
Parallel isn't gonna help me.
You could run and turn right at the last second.
I wouldn't...
No.
That's not gonna work.
All right.
One, two , three!
Fuck!
- Run!
- What was that?
- Are you okay?
- Fuck!
Get up!
- Linda!
- Pat!
What are you...
- Pat, don't...
Pat, stop!
- What's going on?
- Steve, let him go!
- Either you're gonna calm down...
- Let him go!
Jeff!
- Don't fucking move!
- What are you doing?
- What the hell is going on?
- We just got here!
- Who are you people?
You, shut up!
Who the fuck is this guy?
He's just a friend, okay?
Calm down.
- There's wine!
- Yeah!
There's a bottle of wine on ice, and a...
What is this?
- That's a...
- A sex board?
No, you bring it with the...
Pat!
And your face is flushed, which means you're horny.
- No!
- What the fuck is going on?
Stop yelling and I'll answer all of your questions.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
I'm ready to go home.
Linda, I think you should come with me.
Excuse me!
You should shut the fuck up!
I think that you should go and I'll call you later.
You're not calling this fucking guy.
Linda, do you want me to stay?
- I think you should go.
- You should go!
You need to go!
I'm gonna stay and talk to Pat, okay?
Time for you to go, man.
- Get out, bro!
- All right, Pat.
Get out!
Okay.
Start talking.
ls there anyone else in here?
Well, I'm a little upset, actually,
-and I think that it's understandable!
- I understand that.
Look, what I need to know...
I just need to know one thing, okay?
- Okay.
What?
- Okay.
Are you mad because you came in here and you found me with another man?
Yes.
- Yes.
- Or...
Or are you mad because you're afraid that you might lose me?
What?
There's like a part B now?
Please, don't do that.
It's just semantic bullshit!
- No, it isn't!
It isn't!
- Yeah, it is!
- You really don't know the difference.
- You know what?
Linda!
Linda.
I'm gonna try to listen to you blabber about whatever this is.
And I'm gonna try to understand your incoherent babble.
Go.
- Why do you always do that?
- What?
- I'm listening.
- No, you're not.
Yeah, I'm trying.
You always just make me feel so stupid!
I'm sorry it's stupid!
I catch you trying to cheat on me and...
You make fun of everything I say.
I'm really just trying to have a conversation with you right now.
This is why our relationship is so fucked.
Because you know what?
When I asked you if you would take me to Cochon you laughed at me.
Who care...
I'm sorry.
That's...
But when I asked Steve, he just, you know, said, let's go.
Yeah, 'cause he wanted to get in your pants!
Well, maybe, but at least he's trying to put in some time and effort!
Let me tell you something about Cochon.
- Cochon is full of assholes...
- You're not even and snobs in fucking turquoise tailored shirts and pink ties, like that asshole!
You want to ask me to take you there?
Fine.
I'll take you to fucking Cochon.
We'll...
- Yeah.
- God, you're not even listening to me.
No, I'm hearing you loud and clear.
You're not!
It's not about the restaurant.
I just want you to, like, care that I want to go there!
And do you think it's about this guy?
Because I really don't even fucking care about him!
He's nice.
- He listens to me.
- I'm nice.
But you and I, we are petty, we are passive-aggressive with each other, we don't even fight!
I mean, this is a miracle right now!
And what I think, honestly, is that we have no house, we have no kids, thank God!
It would be really fucking easy for us to just walk away!
It'd be super simple.
And that is what I think that we should do.
Hang on, hang on.
You know, let's just not, like, let's just not...
Can we not talk about this anymore?
Let's just go home and sleep on it, and, like...
And like...
Forget it.
I'm gonna go stay at my mom's.
Bye, Jeff.
Jeffrey, where are you?
I asked you to call me after you got the wood glue.
I'm at the office.
Let me know what's going on.
Thanks.
Bye.
Oh, please.
It sure is a noisy little thing.
Yeah.
- Eight glasses a day, my doctor says.
- Really?
You're kidding me.
Blow out my biceps trying to lift these cups that many times.
- I'm Barry.
- Sharon.
Nice to meet you.
Same here.
What am I saying?
I know you're Sharon.
I've seen you around.
I really do like flowers.
Yeah?
Like.
Metaphorically, too.
Symbolically.
All kinds.
Gardenias are my favorite.
I'm not following you.
Excuse me.
It was nice meeting you.
Just stupid.
Sharon?
What's going on?
I think it's over.
What happened?
What?
This is not the way I imagined my life was gonna be.
How did you imagine it?
I was gonna be in the Peace Corps and all that crap, you know, with some guy in an exotic place, all worldly and giving and shit,
and living in a little hut, and taking care of cute little kids
and kissing under waterfalls and stuff, you know.
You can still kiss under waterfalls and stuff like that.
It's like, how many good years do I have left?
I hate my kids right now.
I don't know when that happened.
They were so cute.
I look at the pictures of them, and our family...
Don't cry.
Have some more tissue.
- Don't explain.
Oh, God.
- No.
I just...
Oh, Carol, I'm sorry.
It'll just make it worse.
Don't explain.
But it's not what you think!
Yeah, it is.
I wish that I could
see the world like you.
Really?
I don't know.
You have this, like, belief in this cosmic order.
I really envy that.
You don't want to be like me.
I'm not happy at all.
You know, since Dad died, I've had this...
Had this feeling that it had to be for a reason.
I keep thinking that the signs are all about me, but maybe...
Maybe they're about you and your marriage.
My marriage is not good.
It is a disaster.
I just want to feel like I love Linda.
And I want to feel like she loves me.
And we both want to, like, be in love.
I miss it and I want it so bad.
I think you should just say that.
To her.
It's not that simple, Jeff.
I don't know.
I think it could be that simple.
I mean, wouldn't you be psyched if Linda walked in here right now and sat down in this tub next to you and said,
"Pat, I want to be in love with you again"?
That would be awesome.
Dude, you need to say that to her.
You need to tell her that right now.
- River Parish.
- I am so sorry.
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
Don't apologize, seriously.
- But!
want to.
- It's okay.
No, I just...
It was so weird and didn't come out the way I...
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
It's just that I'm not gay.
But that's okay.
I'm not gay, either.
But you like women.
So?
Well, I like men.
I like men, too.
And to me, it's like, at this point in my life, whether it's a man or a woman, it doesn't matter.
I want someone who gets me.
I fee!
like I deserve that.
And!
think you do, too.
Well, it's important, yes.
But it doesn't mean
I want to sleep with everybody that understands me.
That's all.
No, no, no.
That's not my intention.
Isn't the most important thing finding someone who sees you exactly as you are?
Who gets the Peace Corps and the kissing under waterfalls?
Yeah.
So?
Carol?
Are you there?
Hello?
Shit.
Okay, sorry, everybody.
Just head for the exits!
Single file!
Keep it orderly!
Please!
Close your eyes.
It's clear.
Come on.
There's my car, right here.
Where are we going?
We're all wet.
- I don't know.
What do you think?
- I'm sorry, I don't know.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Let's go to the mall and get drinks with the little umbrellas in them.
Bigger.
Wilder.
I haven't been to New Orleans in 20 years.
How about that?
It's perfect.
Okay, let's go.
Come on out, everybody!
Just come right out.
Shit.
What is this?
It looks like really bad traffic.
Well, I mean in your, you know...
- You mean, like, is it a sign?
- I don't know.
It could be.
- It definitely could be.
- How do I know what to do?
That's the big question, yeah.
It's a constant struggle.
I think you got to go with your gut.
Well, I'm not going to stop now.
Right?
Hey.
Pat?
If we don't get a chance to reconnect today,
I'm, like, super proud of you.
Linda!
Linda!
Sorry.
- Second thoughts?
- Well, I just...
It's okay.
Pat?
Pat!
- I think that's my son.
- Sharon?
What now, my man?
I guess I'll go back.
We'll have to wait for all this traffic to clear.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just...
You ever feel like you're waiting forever to figure out what your destiny is, and then when you do it's not really that exciting?
Linda!
Pat?
Pat!
Linda!
What are you doing here?
I want to be in love again.
What?
Things have gotten way off track.
And weird and shitty.
And I'm a big part of that, and I'm really sorry for it.
- Pat!
- What?
Honey, what's happening?
What's the matter?
- Why are you running down...
- Mom?
What's going...
Oh, hi.
- Wait, what are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
How did you get here?
In Carol's...
This is Carol.
Hi.
I'm Linda.
Nice to meet you.
Jeff...
Jeff's here?
Whoa, hey!
Did you see that?
Is he okay?
Is he okay?
Yeah, we're here.
A car just went off the bridge.
There's people inside of it.
Somebody jumped in!
Wait!
Our dad's still down there!
Fuck.
Come on.
Help!
Help us!
Dad!
Help!
Come on, girls!
Come on.
Swim hard!
Come on, honey!
Give me your hand.
That a girl.
Come on.
- Get back there.
- Dad?
Hey, the car's going down!
The car's sinking!
Dad!
Dad!
Jeff!
Jeff!
Dad!
Come on, Dad!
We need some help over here.
Pat?
Over here!
Over here!
Pat!
Pat!
- Jeff!
- Jeff!
Help!
Help!
Man in the water!
Two survivors in sight.
Five feet off the first cleat.
Coming into the dive deck.
Hurry!
Get a hold of him!
One, two, three!
Jeff!
We have an unresponsive person!
He's not moving!
Call the command center!
Have an ambulance meet us at the pier!
- Jeff!
- Sir, we got to help him.
We got him.
Do something!
Jesus!
Sir, sir.
Jeff!
- He's not moving!
- Starting CPR!
Get off me!
Leave me alone!
You need to sit down!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
Jeff, wake up!
- Jeff!
- Still not responding.
Can you hear me?
HEY. hey, you okay?
Hey.
Sir?
- Are you okay?
- Oh, God.
Let's get blankets!
Sir, stay still.
Let me sit up.
What happened?
Everything-
I'm hungry-
And coming up next, the story of two girls, their father, and the man who was in the right place at the right time.
The car that was behind us crashed into the back of us and then we went over the bridge.
And then this man, he just came and broke our window...
And he almost died doing it.
If we had lost our dad, you know, I just really can't even imagine it.
We're just really thankful he was there.
We'll be right back with that rescue tale of local councilman Kevin Landry and his two little girls.
All that and more when we come back.
I watched Signs again last night.
It keeps getting better every time I see it.
It's funny.
The first time you watch it, it's hard to understand what it's about.
It just sort of meanders.
And then, everything comes together in this one perfect moment at the end.
And when you watch it a second or a third or a fourth time, you start to see that all of this randomness
is leading towards a perfect moment.
My favorite character is the little girl.
Everyone thinks she's so strange because she can't finish a glass of water.
She's convinced they're contaminated.
So, by the end of the film, there are glasses of water littered around this house.
And then, it's the water that saves them.
And that was fate.
I can't help but wonder about my fate.
About my destiny.
Renewal.
Vitality.
Energy.
Are you tired of feeling sluggish?
Do you feel like life is passing you by?
Then we've got the solution for you.
It's called "The Most Incredible Vitamin In The World"
and there's a reason you're watching this right now.
Just pick up the phone and start the new chapter to your life.
Call now.
Not available in stores.
Made in Germany.
Beware of imitators.
Call 1-800...
Hello?
Yo, Kevin.
No, this is Jeff.
Where Kevin at?
I don't know.
Oh, man, look, don't be fucking around!
Where the fuck is Kevin?
Kevin doesn't live here.
There's always some motherfucker trying to tell me there ain't no Kevin!
Let me put this word in your fucking peanut brain, Kevin!
K-E-V-I-N!
Kevin.
What are you doing?
Doing this.
Some strawbs, hand-sliced.
A white rose of whipped cream.
Bam!
Bon appétit.
What's the special occasion?
This is one of those "just because" breakfasts, you know?
It sounds corny, but relationships are like flowers and flowers need water to bloom.
Consider this sprinkling from a watering can.
Well, thanks.
-That's nice.
-You're welcome.
Enjoy.
Oh, my gosh.
I got some good news, actually.
Yeah?
I got a phone call from Randy.
Is he the guy that we talked to at that barbecue?
Oh, no, that's a different Randy.
-But that guy's name was Randy, right?
-Yes.
I liked his wife.
Different Randy.
-We should have them over.
-Yeah.
This is Randy at Millennium Porsche.
Can I tell you something?
With no money down, this thing is practically free.
Pat!
No!
Whoa, whoa.
Don't start with no.
-That's what this is.
-Don't start with no.
You're just, like, in this mindset.
And you're not even...
It's not a mindset.
We don't have the money.
Yeah.
That's the mindset I'm talking about.
Honey, look, I'm trying to be really careful, and I've cut back on some things.
And, like, we promised we were going to get a house this year...
I'm just trying to be a grown-up about this.
Surprise.
We got it.
This is happening.
Look...
Everything you just said about the house, you know, our future, you're exactly right.
And I'm so lucky to have you looking out for us in that way.
But I'm looking out for us in another way.
I'm looking out for...
That intangible thing that every couple needs.
It's a little bit of magic, and a little bit of danger, frankly.
This is gonna solve a lot of our problems.
This tension right now.
As soon as you get in that thing and you feel the energy and you feel it rumble in your gut.
If you don't get turned on, you're made of stone.
Where is it?
It's in the driveway.
Are you...
Is this...
Oh, come on.
Okay, okay...
That's...
Hello?
-Mom?
-Jeff.
Hi.
You know, you're supposed to say "hello" when you pick up the phone.
Yeah, I know.
I thought that maybe you were somebody else, but you're not.
What do you do in the basement?
You're not cleaning it.
You really want to know?
You didn't like it last time we had this conversation.
Okay, no.
You know what?
You're right.
I don't.
Did you get the wood glue?
What are you talking about?
I left you a note on the kitchen counter.
I haven't been upstairs.
One of the shutters on the pantry is broken and I need you to fix it.
You know what, I'm kind of busy right now, so...
All I want for my birthday is for you to get your ass off that couch, and you get on the bus
-and you go to the Home Depot.
-I'm not on the couch.
You come home and fix the shutter before I get home, or you're gonna find someplace else to live.
-Fine.
-Fine.
Good.
You got it?
Do you understand?
Yes, Mom!
Okay!
Love you!
Goodbye.
Did you hang up on me?
-Oh, thank you.
-You're welcome.
Stop the bus.
Can you please stop the bus?
Sorry.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Can I help you, sir?
No.
What?
Pass the ball!
Go, go, go!
Shit, you a'ight?
Get your big ass up, man.
You bleeding and shit?
-He out, man.
-We need another person.
We need one!
You got next.
Who, him?
He gonna be a ref?
That's all we got.
That's all we got.
Let's see what he got.
Let's go, dawg.
Get out here.
Oh, he's passing now.
Right there, dawg.
What's your problem?
That's your man.
Why don't you play some D, man?
Right, right, right.
Hell, no!
You working on this?
Come on, man.
Go, go, go, go.
I'm Jeff.
Kevin.
Ke...
Kevin.
Is your name Kevin Kevin?
No.
So, that's your first name on your jersey?
Yeah, that's my name.
Yeah.
Do you live around here?
Yeah, I don't live far from here.
You obviously don't live around here, though.
No, I was just strolling around today.
It was a nice day, so I thought I'd walk around.
Were you following me, or...
No.
I mean, no.
I saw you on the bus.
Let me explain.
Have you ever seen the movie Signs?
With Mel Gibson and Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin?
Nah, I don't think I have.
I got a phone call this morning.
Someone was asking for Kevin.
But there's no Kevin who lives with me.
It's kind of a common name.
Yeah.
I guess that's true.
I mean, you never got a call, like someone called the wrong house phone?
What if there's no wrong numbers?
Maybe it's always the right house phone.
Everything happens for a reason, right?
Exactly.
No, that's exactly it.
Hey, man, I'm about to go put something in the air real quick.
I don't know if you want to come.
I don't...
I'm sorry...
I don't know what that means.
Smoke weed?
You want to smoke weed with me?
Yeah, man.
I like weed.
Yeah, I can see that.
Wow.
It's nice in here.
-That's nice.
-Yeah.
Oh, shit.
That's a treat.
Check his pockets!
Sorry, Jeff.
Marriage is a compromise.
She got what she wanted, I'm living here in Baton Rouge.
So I get a little somethin'-somethin'.
-Right?
-Sure.
Yeah.
Thank you.
You know what's up.
I got to take this...
It's a business call.
Sweetheart, can I get another Bud Light.
Do you want more wings?
Whatever.
Fine.
I will get glue and fix your shutter.
No.
It is Jeff's responsibility.
That is the point.
He has to do it, not you.
Jeff has to do it.
Okay.
What are you...
Why are you calling me?
Maybe you could get him moving a little bit.
Do you understand?
He's stuck, honey.
He's stuck.
He's 30!
He had a difficult adolescent period.
You of all people would know neither of us had a very easy adolescent period.
-You were older.
-What does that have to do with it?
When you're an adult, you take responsibility for your life.
Okay?
But you're brothers.
You love each other, don't you?
You know, fake it for a little bit just to get...
You know.
Maybe he'll grow on you.
We don't do that, Mom.
We don't spend time together.
Well, Pat, could you at least try?
It's my birthday.
I gotta call you back.
-No, no, no, Pat...
-Bye.
Damn it.
Asshole.
Jeff!
Pat?
What the hell are you doing here?
Kevin beat me up.
I walked.
Who's Kevin?
Some kid I was following.
Well, if he's a kid, how come you didn't kick his ass?
Because I don't believe in fighting, Pat.
And you know that.
Right.
I forgot.
You're a pussy.
Look, Mom called and she's really pissed.
Was Gandhi a pussy?
Yeah, Gandhi was a pussy.
And once again, I have to pick up your slack.
Well, it's not your problem.
Well, it becomes my problem when Mom calls me in the middle of a business meeting.
Yeah?
You're having a business meeting at Hooters?
Yeah.
Yes.
That's very classy.
Right.
Well, business is business.
So, come on.
Get in the car.
Hey!
You don't need to grab onto me.
I'm a little bit conflicted right now, that's all.
About what?
You're just gonna make fun of me, man.
Let's go.
Try me.
I want to learn how you think because I want to free my mind.
Let me try to explain it to you maybe in terms that you would understand.
-Okay.
-This morning
I was meant to have a business meeting with the Kevins.
And destiny.
And now you're here at this weird Hooters thing...
And so now I'm just trying to figure out how to proceed.
What you just said sounded like Yoda took acid and stumbled into a business meeting.
You can make all the fun of Yoda that you want,
Yoda would be fucking killer in a business meeting.
Whatever, man.
Come on!
Let's go.
Get in the Porsche.
Shit!
Hey, I think your Porsche got a ticket, Pat.
Shut up, Jeff.
Just get in the car.
This Porsche is tiny.
The Porsche is normal-sized.
You're a sasquatch.
Are those workout gloves?
I don't think so.
They came with the car so...
Check this out.
You see where those cars are stopping up ahead?
Yeah.
I should probably stop pretty soon, right?
Pat, slow down.
What?
I can't hear you!
Bose surround sound!
Hey, stop it, dude.
This is not funny.
-Count to three and I'll stop.
-Pat, please stop.
Count of three!
One!
Two!
-Pat, look out!
-Three!
Curb!
Curb!
Shit!
Yes!
Will you please stop the car?
It handles better at high speeds!
-Stop the car!
-Shut up!
Tree!
Tree!
Pat?
Fuck!
Wow.
Yeah, that's real bad.
Oh, shit.
What the fuck?
He looks mad.
Are you on drugs?
How many beers have you had?
Shut up, Jeff.
Shut up.
Did you not see that damn tree?
Whatever you do, don't say a word.
Stay in the fucking car.
I am fine, yes.
Thank you for asking.
Burt, should we call an ambulance?
Hi.
There was a pedestrian child in the street and in order to avoid killing it,
I had to swerve and maneuver onto your sidewalk, at which point I lost control of my vehicle and I've hit your tree here.
We can see that.
Do you think we're blind?
No.
Of course not.
I just would like to apologize.
Is he okay?
Yeah, he's fine.
Just a little stunned.
I think that one's hurt.
Maybe we should call the police.
He's fine.
He's okay.
That child's not moving.
Ma'am, he's okay.
Jeff, will you get out of the car?
Yeah.
Get out of the car.
Show her that you're fine.
See?
Live and limber.
-Baby, are you sure you're all right?
-Look at that.
-I am fine, thank you.
-Look at that.
Good as new.
You remind me of my grandson.
Is his name Kevin, by any chance?
Brian, why?
No reason, ma'am.
Do you think there's any way that you and I can take care of this ourselves?
I really don't want to hang out here all afternoon with the cops.
I don't know...
There's some bark off that tree.
It might have ruined the tree, baby.
Whoa.
Is that Linda?
Give me 500 bucks, and we'll call it even.
Excuse me?
No "excuse me," man.
Look at my tree here.
That's a 200-year-old tree.
Might have to do some landscaping.
I'll probably have to bring a tractor in here and a backhoe and dig all this stuff up.
It's a tree!
Have you been drinking?
No.
Why don't we just let the police decide that.
Call 911.
-$100.
-Times five.
-$150.
-Plus $350.
-Fine.
Call the police.
-Call 911.
God damn it!
You take a check?
Yeah.
No problem.
Oh, good.
Boy, he's got some nerve, don't he?
Trying to negotiate with you about our tree.
He come in my yard, hit my tree.
You look at that tree and he don't think he owes me.
Who's that guy she's with?
Get in the car, Jeff.
It was very, very quick and it could have been somebody...
She was wearing a peach dress that she wore this morning, okay?
And they got into our car!
Man, something really big is happening here.
Yeah, no shit, Jeff!
My wife is having an affair!
We don't know that yet.
Let's follow this and see where this leads.
Well, I'm trying to, but I can't see dick so it's kind of hard.
Go!
Go!
Go, go!
Hang on.
-I see them!
-Where?
They're just up here to the left!
There they are!
Pat.
What the fuck are you doing?
You told me to hurry!
Tell me before you swerve so I don't fall off the fucking car!
Okay.
Whatever, just focus on the road!
Where are they going?
They're turning up there!
What street?
South Clark!
South Clark!
They're going to Cochon!
Damn it!
Let me tell you about Cochon.
It's full of A-holes who look down on everybody that's not, like, part of the cool-guy club.
It's so lame.
Look at this, no parking.
I can wait with the car.
No.
I got it.
Pat, there's a fire hydrant!
There's a fire hydrant right here.
I got it.
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
Come on.
Let's go.
Okay, what we got here is a friendly lunch.
It could be a coworker.
It could be a long-lost cousin.
She hates her coworkers and I know her whole family.
We got to hear what they're saying.
Well, body language can tell you a lot, man.
-You're going in there.
-What, me?
Yeah.
I'm not really dressed properly, Pat.
Why don't you just go in there and talk to her?
This could all be a huge misunderstanding.
If I talk to her, she's just gonna deny it.
Why wouldn't she tell you the truth?
Oh, my God.
You have no idea how adult relationships work, do you?
You haven't had a girlfriend since high school.
-So?
So?
-So?
So...
I need to find out exactly what's going on so I'll have the upper hand later.
Do you still love Linda?
There's an empty booth next to them.
Okay?
Just sneak in with my phone.
Here's a little grease money.
Okay.
Get in there, do what you got to do.
-Hello.
-Hi.
-How do you do?
Lovely.
-Fine, thank you.
Can I help you?
Table for one, please.
-Right this way.
-Great.
Thank you.
-Oh, miss?
-Yes?
Could I sit there?
Those tables are saved for two patrons.
-Right.
-Right this way.
Miss?
You know what?
Excuse me.
There are going to be two patrons.
There will be two patrons.
You said table of one.
I meant that more like in the bistro sense, like one plus another one?
Well, just in case, I think this table back here would be quite lovely for you guys.
What if I grease you?
I'm sorry?
I have money.
There's two fives, some ones.
There's a 20.
If I could just sit at that table.
I can't explain.
But it's really important.
I mean, I honestly don't even feel like he really likes me.
Well, that's his problem.
I mean...
From where I stand, there's plenty to like.
Thank you, Steve.
You're a really good listener.
Thank you.
It's such a treat.
I'm just being myself.
Don't say anything.
She might recognize your voice.
If you can hear me, give me a thumbs-up.
Okay, now take the talking part of the phone and hold it, but keep it low, don't let them see.
I really don't think that you want to hear this.
Jeff, just do it!
Okay?
Stop talking so I can hear what's going on.
I can't.
Honestly, I lost a lot of friends because of Pat.
'Cause my friends just don't like him.
I think a little bit's my fault, 'cause I would complain a lot to them and...
For a really long time, I've felt like he and I are...
I don't know...
We got, like, weirdly competitive with each other.
We just never communicate.
He just never listens, ever.
Gosh.
I shouldn't even be talking about this but we haven't had sex in...
I mean, over two months.
That's a long time.
And I think, kind of, what's worse than that is that it's so awkward.
Well, having sex is one thing but making love is something else, right?
What does that even mean?
Thank you, Steve.
I'm not used to being able to talk so openly with someone and have them listen, and care what I'm saying and...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Wait!
Pat, what do you want me to do now, huh?
Hello, my name is Rob.
Can I start you out with something to drink?
Some water.
Excuse me?
-I'll have water.
-I'm sorry?
I'll take some fuckin' water, Rob.
Absolutely.
Jeff?
Whoa!
Hey.
-Wow!
-Hi.
What are you doing here?
I'm just...
Lunching it up, you know?
Getting a little bistro action.
I...
Have you ever met my friend, Steve?
This is my brother-in-law, Jeff.
-This is Steve.
-Hey, Jeff, nice to meet you, man.
-My friend Steve.
-Steve.
We were just gonna leave.
Did you still want me to drop you off at your car?
Yep.
Yeah.
So, I'm going to take him to his car, and I'll see you later.
Hope so.
Nice meeting you, Jeff.
Pat, they're coming out...
What the fuck?
Jeff!
They went that way!
Pat!
Well, then, let's go get the car!
-No car!
-What?
No car!
Help me get a cab!
What are you talkin' about?
What happened to the car?
Nothing!
It got towed.
-That's not funny!
-I'm not...
-I know.
I know it's not.
-It's so not funny!
Help me get a cab!
-There's no way to know where they are.
-Great.
What do we do?
I think we should just sit down right here.
And?
And wait.
-For what?
-For a sign.
I'm not gonna sit here and wait for a fucking sign!
Okay, well, then let's walk!
A school bus just drove by!
It's a sign!
What does it mean?
Do we go to a school?
Is my wife fucking some guy in a janitor closet?
I don't think that's it.
I don't think that's it.
-That's not it.
-Good guess.
Now what?
What are you doing?
I'm looking for a credit card slip.
I don't see why.
If I find the slip, I get his last name and then we can look up where he lives and go beat him up.
No, I get it.
I just don't think they throw those things away.
Just shut up and help.
Find it yet?
-How about now?
-That's not helping!
I think we've gotten off track somewhere.
Like I've gotten off track.
Something feels wrong.
Fine.
I'll do it myself, if it'll make you stop talking.
-Is that it?
-No.
It's not.
Oh, God.
What is that?
No, don't do it, Pat.
You don't have to smell it.
Pat.
Okay.
-Hey.
-Hey, Carol.
That was yummy.
What're you doing?
Don't tell anybody else.
What?
Somebody's messing with me.
-Really?
-Yeah, in this office.
-No.
-Yeah.
I got hit by a plane.
-What?
-A little paper plane came into my...
And all these messages were coming to me on my computer.
Kind of...
-Flirty stuff.
-Flirty?
I know someone's playin' some kind of a joke and I think it's those guys that are in the back over there that did the fantasy football.
Oh, my God, those guys are so hot.
That would be so good.
They're young, too.
Do you think it's Henry?
-Henry?
-Yeah.
He's kind of...
Interesting.
He's married, isn't he?
Okay, let's just say it is somebody here.
What does the message say?
Like what are the details?
Well, somethin' about, you know...
What?
That they're a secret admirer.
They said they were...
I think that's kind of hot.
No, it's not.
It's ridiculous.
And I don't like being the butt of a joke.
How do you know it's a joke?
I mean, how many times do we get to get juiced up like this?
This is awesome.
I'm not getting juiced up over a joke.
You're getting attention.
I am super-jelly.
I want attention.
You're impossible.
When was the last time you had a relationship?
Well, my husband, of course.
No way.
Well, I mean, I went out on dates.
Come on.
I've been to the movies.
-It's no wonder you're so cranky.
-I've been bowling...
-I'm not...
-Yeah, you need to get busy.
-You need to get your pipes cleaned.
-You think I'm...
You need to get f...
Yeah.
Well, I won't tell anyone.
Pinky swear.
What else?
What else?
I did hear her say that she felt neglected.
Sounds like they're banging already.
It's possible.
Don't ever get married, dude.
It fucking sucks.
Really?
I think it would be kind of awesome.
Well, it's not.
Okay.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Okay.
I'm sick of walking.
Okay.
Is that what I think it is?
You know, I've been havin' this really weird dream about Dad lately.
-Really?
-Yeah.
He's a teacher.
And...
We're in this classroom with a whole bunch of kids, and we all sit down.
And Dad asks everyone,
"What's the greatest day in the history of the world?"
And one kid is like, "Christmas."
And Dad's like, "No."
And whenever they get the answer wrong, they have to leave the room.
And eventually it's just me and Dad.
And he looks at me and says,
"Pat, what's the greatest day in the history of the world?"
And I don't know, 'cause I'm nervous.
And I'm like, "Dad, I don't know."
And he just looks at me and he smiles and he says...
He says, "Today." He says, "Today."
How'd you know that?
He says, "Today is the greatest day in the history of the world."
Yeah.
I have that dream, Pat.
Except in mine, it's me, you and Dad in his car.
Okay.
I guess it's just something he said to us when we were kids or somethin'.
It's like floating' around in both of our brains.
What is wrong with you?
-Pat.
-What?
What?
What is wrong with you?
Why do you want to be like this?
-What are you talking about?
-We had...
We were havin'...
We're having the same dream!
What the fuck are you talking about?
Why do you want to live like this?
You're drifting through this life with no awareness of how special this is.
You want to talk about what's happening right now, right here?
What's happening right now is that I'm getting lectured by my pothead brother who lives in our mom's basement at 30 years old about how I don't understand the universe!
Hey, here's some understanding for you.
A job and a car and a wife and an apartment!
I got to go.
What?
-I have to go, Pat.
-Where are you going?
You know what?
You wouldn't...
You would laugh at me again.
Jesus Christ.
You see a fucking truck with the word "Kevin" on it and you have to run after it?
Yeah.
I do.
I wish I was that stupid!
You're a dick!
You know what?
I have an asshole for a brother.
It breaks my heart.
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you!
-You call me an asshole?
-Yeah, you are an asshole!
You fucking piece of shit!
You drive a fucking Boxster!
Fuck you!
Don't do this, Pat!
Fuck you!
You get down.
Get down on the fucking ground!
Fucking idiot!
You and Mom will never understand me.
And you're all I have left!
Another Jack and Coke?
Nope.
Got to get home.
Old lady, huh?
No, she's boning another dude.
Right on.
Stop the car.
Stop.
Please, stop?
-Hi.
-Hello.
Hey, so, my sister and her husband just got here a little while ago in that red Camry out there.
And...
I need to...
I'm meeting them.
So...
-Okay...
-Actually, it's an emergency.
I have to get her medication, like, right now, so what's her room number?
We have a privacy policy, sir.
I'm sorry, I can't give you her number.
I know it's like policy and everything, but this is a family emergency, so maybe you could just give me the room number...
It'll take me a second to call.
I lied.
It's not an emergency.
It's not a health emergency.
It is a financial emergency.
Their home is about to be foreclosed on and I need to make a payment.
-Just stop.
-Okay.
-You're embarrassing yourself.
-Right.
-Thank you.
-Excuse me?
No, just thank you so much.
Pat!
Pat!
Oh, my God.
Jeff.
-Oh, my God, Pat.
-What the fuck?
I was on the truck.
The truck came here and now you're here.
-This shit is aligned!
-Shut the fuck up.
-What?
-Linda is here, in this hotel somewhere.
-With the guy?
-Yeah, probably with the guy.
Sorry.
How the fuck did you find me?
It was the candy man.
Oh, shit.
He's right there.
Okay, what should we do?
Duck in there.
I'm gigantic!
Come on, let's go.
What do you want to do?
Should we stay?
Should we wait?
Do we just wait, or...
We could wait.
I don't know.
I don't...
Should I call her?
Maybe I call her cell phone right now.
And then, like, act innocent and be like, "What's going on?"
You could try that.
You know, you're not fucking helping at all.
You're just like, "Do you want to do that?"
Do you want to know what I think you should do?
Yeah.
I think you should take a few deep breaths, close your eyes, and focus.
That is like stupid fucking Jeff mumbo-jumbo.
If you have any other idea, even one,
I'll be happy to try it without making fun of you.
Okay, all right.
Okay.
Close your eyes.
What do you see?
I just can't stop picturing what's going on.
What if she's, like, giving him a hand job?
You know, I think they're adults.
It's probably unlikely she's giving him a hand job.
I'm gonna break down the door.
No.
Pat.
I'm gonna break it down.
Listen.
Wait, hold on.
That's a terrible idea.
I've seen you try to do things physically.
I'll do it.
Do you think you can do that?
I wish I could get some sort of running start.
You totally can.
There's, like, hallways.
You run and turn.
Parallel isn't gonna help me.
You could run and turn right at the last second.
I wouldn't...
No.
That's not gonna work.
All right.
One, two, three!
Fuck!
-Run!
-What was that?
-Are you okay?
-Fuck!
Get up!
-Linda!
-Pat!
What are you...
-Pat, don't...
Pat, stop!
-What's going on?
-Steve, let him go!
-Either you're gonna calm down...
-Let him go!
Jeff!
-Don't fucking move!
-What are you doing?
-What the hell is going on?
-We just got here!
-Who are you people?
You, shut up!
Who the fuck is this guy?
He's just a friend, okay?
Calm down.
-There's wine!
-Yeah!
There's a bottle of wine on ice, and a...
What is this?
-That's a...
A sex board?
No, you bring it with the...
Pat!
And your face is flushed, which means you're horny.
-No!
-What the fuck is going on?
Stop yelling and I'll answer all of your questions.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
I'm ready to go home.
Linda, I think you should come with me.
Excuse me!
You should shut the fuck up!
I think that you should go and I'll call you later.
You're not calling this fucking guy.
Linda, do you want me to stay?
-I think you should go.
-You should go!
You need to go!
I'm gonna stay and talk to Pat, okay?
Time for you to go, man.
-Get out, bro!
-All right, Pat.
Get out!
Okay.
Start talking.
Is there anyone else in here?
Well, I'm a little upset, actually,
-and I think that it's understandable!
-I understand that.
Look, what I need to know...
I just need to know one thing, okay?
-Okay.
What?
-Okay.
Are you mad because you came in here and you found me with another man?
Yes.
-Yes.
-Or...
Or are you mad because you're afraid that you might lose me?
What?
There's like a part B now?
Please, don't do that.
It's just semantic bullshit!
-No, it isn't!
It isn't!
-Yeah, it is!
-You really don't know the difference.
-You know what?
Because if you don't understand the difference...
Linda!
Linda.
I'm gonna try to listen to you blabber about whatever this is.
And I'm gonna try to understand your incoherent babble.
Go.
-Why do you always do that?
-What?
-I'm listening.
-No, you're not.
Yeah, I'm trying.
You always just make me feel so stupid!
I'm sorry it's stupid!
I catch you trying to cheat on me and...
You make fun of everything I say.
I'm really just trying to have a conversation with you right now.
This is why our relationship is so fucked.
Because you know what?
When I asked you if you would take me to Cochon you laughed at me.
Who care...
I'm sorry.
That's...
But when I asked Steve, he just, you know, said, let's go.
Yeah, 'cause he wanted to get in your pants!
Well, maybe, but at least he's trying to put in some time and effort!
Let me tell you something about Cochon.
-Cochon is full of assholes...
-You're not even and snobs in fucking turquoise tailored shirts and pink ties, like that asshole!
You want to ask me to take you there?
Fine.
I'll take you to fucking Cochon.
We'll...
-Yeah.
-God, you're not even listening to me.
No, I'm hearing you loud and clear.
You're not!
It's not about the restaurant.
I just want you to, like, care that I want to go there!
And do you think it's about this guy?
Because I really don't even fucking care about him!
He's nice.
-He listens to me.
-I'm nice.
But you and I, we are petty, we are passive-aggressive with each other, we don't even fight!
I mean, this is a miracle right now!
And what I think, honestly, is that we have no house, we have no kids, thank God!
It would be really fucking easy for us to just walk away!
It'd be super simple.
And that is what I think that we should do.
Hang on, hang on.
You know, let's just not, like, let's just not...
Can we not talk about this anymore?
Let's just go home and sleep on it, and, like...
And like...
Forget it.
I'm gonna go stay at my mom's.
Bye, Jeff.
Jeffrey, where are you?
I asked you to call me after you got the wood glue.
I'm at the office.
Let me know what's going on.
Thanks.
Bye.
Oh, please.
It sure is a noisy little thing.
Yeah.
-Eight glasses a day, my doctor says.
-Really?
You're kidding me.
Blow out my biceps trying to lift these cups that many times.
-I'm Barry.
-Sharon.
Nice to meet you.
Same here.
What am I saying?
I know you're Sharon.
I've seen you around.
I really do like flowers.
Yeah?
Like, metaphorically, too.
Symbolically.
All kinds.
Gardenias are my favorite.
I'm not following you.
Excuse me.
It was nice meeting you.
Just stupid.
Sharon?
What's going on?
I think it's over.
What happened?
What?
This is not the way I imagined my life was gonna be.
How did you imagine it?
I was gonna be in the Peace Corps and all that crap, you know, with some guy in an exotic place, all worldly and giving and shit,
and living in a little hut, and taking care of cute little kids
and kissing under waterfalls and stuff, you know.
You can still kiss under waterfalls and stuff like that.
It's like, how many good years do I have left?
I hate my kids right now.
I don't know when that happened.
They were so cute.
I look at the pictures of them, and our family...
Don't cry.
Have some more tissue.
-Don't explain.
Oh, God.
-No.
I just...
Oh, Carol, I'm sorry.
It'll just make it worse.
Don't explain.
But it's not what you think!
Yeah, it is.
I wish that I could
see the world like you.
Really?
I don't know.
You have this, like, belief in this cosmic order.
I really envy that.
You don't want to be like me.
I'm not happy at all.
You know, since Dad died, I've had this...
Had this feeling that it had to be for a reason.
I keep thinking that the signs are all about me, but maybe...
Maybe they're about you and your marriage.
My marriage is not good.
It is a
disaster.
I just want to feel like I love Linda.
And I want to feel like she loves me.
And we both want to, like, be in love.
I miss it and I want it so bad.
I think you should just say that.
To her.
It's not that simple, Jeff.
I don't know.
I think it could be that simple.
I mean, wouldn't you be psyched if Linda walked in here right now and sat down in this tub next to you and said,
"Pat, I want to be in love with you again"?
That would be awesome.
Dude, you need to say that to her.
You need to tell her that right now.
-River Parish.
-I am so sorry.
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
Don't apologize, seriously.
-But I want to.
-It's okay.
No, I just...
It was so weird and didn't come out the way I...
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
It's just that I'm not gay.
But that's okay.
I'm not gay, either.
But you like women.
So?
Well, I like men.
I like men, too.
And to me, it's like, at this point in my life, whether it's a man or a woman, it doesn't matter.
I want someone who gets me.
I feel like I deserve that.
And I think you do, too.
Well, it's important, yes.
But it doesn't mean
I want to sleep with everybody that understands me.
That's all.
No, no, no.
That's not my intention.
lsn't the most important thing finding someone who sees you exactly as you are?
Who gets the Peace Corps and the kissing under waterfalls?
Yeah.
So?
Carol?
Are you there?
Hello?
Shit.
Okay, sorry, everybody.
Just head for the exits!
Single file!
Keep it orderly!
Please!
Close your eyes.
It's clear.
Come on.
There's my car, right here.
Where are we going?
We're all wet.
-I don't know.
What do you think?
-I'm sorry, I don't know.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Let's go to the mall and get drinks with the little umbrellas in them.
Bigger.
Wilder.
I haven't been to New Orleans in 20 years.
How about that?
It's perfect.
Okay, let's go.
Come on out, everybody!
Just come right out.
Shit.
What is this?
It looks like really bad traffic.
Well, I mean in your, you know...
-You mean, like, is it a sign?
-I don't know.
It could be.
-It definitely could be.
-How do I know what to do?
That's the big question, yeah.
It's a constant struggle.
I think you got to go with your gut.
Well, I'm not going to stop now.
Right?
Hey, Pat?
If we don't get a chance to reconnect today,
I'm, like, super proud of you.
Linda!
Sorry.
-Second thoughts?
-Well, I just...
It's okay.
Pat?
Pat!
-I think that's my son.
-Sharon?
What now, my man?
I guess I'll go back.
We'll have to wait for all this traffic to clear.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just...
You ever feel like you're waiting forever to figure out what your destiny is, and then when you do it's not really that exciting?
Linda!
Pat?
Pat!
Linda!
What are you doing here?
I want to be in love again.
What?
Things have gotten way off track.
And weird and shitty.
And I'm a big part of that, and I'm really sorry for it.
-Pat!
-What?
Honey, what's happening?
What's the matter?
-Why are you running down...
-Mom?
What's going...
Oh, hi.
-Wait, what are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?
How did you get here?
In Carol's...
This is Carol.
Hi.
I'm Linda.
Nice to meet you.
Jeff...
Jeff's here?
Whoa, hey!
Did you see that?
Is he okay?
Is he okay?
Yeah, we're here.
A car just went off the bridge.
There's people inside of it.
Somebody jumped in!
Wait!
Our dad's still down there!
Fuck.
Come on.
Help!
Help us!
Dad!
Help!
Come on, girls!
Come on.
Swim hard!
Come on, honey!
Give me your hand.
That a girl.
Come on.
-Get back there.
-Dad?
Hey, the car's going down!
The car's sinking!
Dad!
Jeff!
Dad!
Come on, Dad!
We need some help over here.
Pat?
Over here!
Over here!
Pat!
-Jeff!
-Jeff!
Help!
Help!
Man in the water!
Help!
Two survivors in sight.
Five feet off the first cleat.
Coming into the dive deck.
Hurry!
Get a hold of him!
One, two, three!
Jeff!
We have an unresponsive person!
He's not moving!
Call the command center!
Have an ambulance meet us at the pier!
-Jeff!
-Sir, we got to help him.
We got him.
Do something!
Jesus!
Sir, sir.
Jeff!
-He's not moving!
-Starting CPR!
Get off me!
Leave me alone!
You need to sit down!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
Jeff, wake up!
-Jeff!
-Still not responding.
Can you hear me?
Hey, hey, you okay?
Hey.
Sir?
-Are you okay?
-Oh, God.
Let's get blankets!
Sir, stay still.
Let me sit up.
What happened?
Everything.
I'm hungry.
And coming up next, the story of two girls, their father, and the man who was in the right place at the right time.
The car that was behind us crashed into the back of us and then we went over the bridge.
And then this man, he just came and broke our window...
And he almost died doing it.
If we had lost our dad, you know, I just really can't even imagine it.
We're just really thankful he was there.
We'll be right back with that rescue tale of local councilman Kevin Landry and his two little girls.
All that and more when we come back.
I watched Signs again last night.
It keeps getting better every time I see it.
It's funny.
The first time you watch it, it's hard to understand what it's about.
It just sort of meanders.
And then, everything comes together in this one perfect moment at the end.
And when you watch it a second or a third or a fourth time, you start to see that all of this randomness
is leading towards a perfect moment.
My favorite character is the little girl.
Everyone thinks she's so strange because she can't finish a glass of water.
She's convinced they're contaminated.
So, by the end of the film, there are glasses of water littered around this house.
And then, it's the water that saves them.
And that was fate.
I can't help but wonder about my fate.
About my destiny.
Renewal.
Vitality.

Hello?
Yo, Kevin.
No, this is Jeff.
Where Kevin at?
I don't know.
Oh, man, look, don't be fucking around!
Where the fuck is Kevin?
Kevin doesn't live here.
There's always some motherfucker trying to tell me there ain't no Kevin!
Let me put this word in your fucking peanut brain, Kevin!
K-E
- V-I-N!
Kevin.
What are you doing?
Doing this.
Some strawbs, hand-sliced.
A white rose of whipped cream.
Bam!
Bon appétit.
What's the special occasion?
This is one of those "just because" breakfasts, you know?
It sounds corny, but relationships are like flowers and flowers need water to bloom.
Consider this sprinkling from a watering can.
Well, thanks.
- That's nice.
- You're welcome.
Enjoy.
Oh, my gosh.
I got some good news, actually.
Yeah?
I got a phone call from Randy.
Is he the guy that we talked to at that barbecue?
Oh, no, that's a different Randy.
- But that guy's name was Randy, right?
- Yes.
I liked his wife.
Different Randy.
- We should have them over.
- Yeah.
This is Randy at Millennium Porsche.
Can I tell you something?
With no money down, this thing is practically free.
Pat!
No!
Whoa, whoa.
Don't start with no.
- That's what this is.
- Don't start with no.
You're just, like, in this mindset.
And you're not even...
It's not a mindset.
We don't have the money.
Yeah.
That's the mindset I'm talking about.
Honey, look, I'm trying to be really careful, and I've cut back on some things.
And, like, we promised we were going to get a house this year...
I'm just trying to be a grown-up about this.
Surprise.
We got it.
This is happening.
Look...
Everything you just said about the house, you know, our future, you're exactly right.
And I'm so lucky to have you looking out for us in that way.
But I'm looking out for us in another way.
I'm looking out for...
That intangible thing that every couple needs.
It's a little bit of magic, and a little bit of danger, frankly.
This is gonna solve a lot of our problems.
This tension right now.
As soon as you get in that thing and you feel the energy and you feel it rumble in your gut.
If you don't get turned on, you're made of stone.
Where is it?
It's in the driveway.
Are you...
Is this...
Oh, come on.
Okay, okay...
That's...
Hello?
- Mom?
- Jeff.
Hi.
You know, you're supposed to say "hello" when you pick up the phone.
Yeah, I know.
I thought that maybe you were somebody else, but you're not.
What do you do in the basement?
You're not cleaning it.
You really want to know?
You didn't like it last time we had this conversation.
Okay, no.
You know what?
You're right.
I don't.
Did you get the wood glue?
What are you talking about?
I left you a note on the kitchen counter.
I haven't been upstairs.
One of the shutters on the pantry is broken and I need you to fix it.
You know what, I'm kind of busy right now, so...
All I want for my birthday is for you to get your ass off that couch, and you get on the bus
-and you go to the Home Depot.
- I'm not on the couch.
You come home and fix the shutter before I get home, or you're gonna find someplace else to live.
- Fine.
- Fine.
Good.
You got it?
Do you understand?
Yes, Mom!
Okay!
Love you!
Goodbye.
Did you hang up on me?
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.
Stop the bus.
Can you please stop the bus?
Sorry.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Can I help you, sir?
No.
What?
Pass the ball!
Go, go, go!
Shit, you a'ight?
Get your big ass up, man.
You bleeding and shit?
- He out, man.
- We need another person.
We need one!
You got next.
Who, him?
He gonna be a ref?
That's all we got.
That's all we got.
Let's see what he got.
Let's go, dawg.
Get out here.
Oh, he's passing now.
Right there, dawg.
What's your problem?
That's your man.
Why don't you play some D, man?
Right, right, right.
Hell, no!
You working on this?
Come on, man.
Go, go, go, go.
I'm Jeff.
Kevin.
Ke...
Kevin.
Is your name Kevin Kevin?
No.
So, that's your first name on your jersey?
Yeah, that's my name.
Yeah.
Do you live around here?
Yeah, I don't live far from here.
You obviously don't live around here, though.
No, I was just strolling around today.
It was a nice day, so I thought I'd walk around.
Were you following me, or...
No.
I mean, no.
I saw you on the bus.
Let me explain.
Have you ever seen the movie Signs?
With Mel Gibson and Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin?
Nah, I don't think I have.
I got a phone call this morning.
Someone was asking for Kevin.
But there's no Kevin who lives with me.
It's kind of a common name.
Yeah.
I guess that's true.
I mean, you never got a call, like someone called the wrong house phone?
What if there's no wrong numbers?
Maybe it's always the right house phone.
Everything happens for a reason, right?
Exactly.
No, that's exactly it.
Hey, man, I'm about to go put something in the air real quick.
I don't know if you want to come.
I don't...
I'm sorry...
I don't know what that means.
Smoke weed?
You want to smoke weed with me?
Yeah, man.
I like weed.
Yeah, I can see that.
Wow.
It's nice in here.
- That's nice.
- Yeah.
Oh, shit.
That's a treat.
Check his pockets!
Sorry, Jeff.
Marriage is a compromise.
She got what she wanted, I'm living here in Baton Rouge.
So I get a little somethin'-somethin'.
- Right?
- Sure.
Yeah.
Thank you.
You know what's up.
I got to take this...
It's a business call.
Sweetheart, can I get another Bud Light.
Do you want more wings?
Whatever.
Fine.
I will get glue and fix your shutter.
No.
It is Jeff's responsibility.
That is the point.
He has to do it, not you.
Jeff has to do it.
Okay.
What are you...
Why are you calling me?
Maybe you could get him moving a little bit.
Do you understand?
He's stuck, honey.
He's stuck.
He's 30!
He had a difficult adolescent period.
You of all people would know neither of us had a very easy adolescent period.
- You were older.
- What does that have to do with it?
When you're an adult, you take responsibility for your life.
Okay?
But you're brothers.
You love each other, don't you?
You know, fake it for a little bit just to get...
You know.
Maybe he'll grow on you.
We don't do that, Mom.
We don't spend time together.
Well, Pat, could you at least try?
It's my birthday.
I gotta call you back.
- No, no, no, Pat...
- Bye.
Damn it.
Asshole.
Jeff!
Pat?
What the hell are you doing here?
Kevin beat me up.
I walked.
Who's Kevin?
Some kid I was following.
Well, if he's a kid, how come you didn't kick his ass?
Because I don't believe in fighting, Pat.
And you know that.
Right.
I forgot.
You're a pussy.
Look, Mom called and she's really pissed.
Was Gandhi a pussy?
Yeah, Gandhi was a pussy.
And once again, I have to pick up your slack.
Well, it's not your problem.
Well, it becomes my problem when Mom calls me in the middle of a business meeting.
Yeah?
You're having a business meeting at Hooters?
Yeah.
Yes.
That's very classy.
Right.
Well, business is business.
So, come on.
Get in the car.
Hey!
You don't need to grab onto me.
I'm a little bit conflicted right now, that's all.
About what?
You're just gonna make fun of me, man.
Let's go.
Try me.
I want to learn how you think because I want to free my mind.
Let me try to explain it to you maybe in terms that you would understand.
- Okay.
- This morning
I was meant to have a business meeting with the Kevins.
And destiny.
And now you're here at this weird Hooters thing...
And so now I'm just trying to figure out how to proceed.
What you just said sounded like Yoda took acid and stumbled into a business meeting.
You can make all the fun of Yoda that you want,
Yoda would be fucking killer in a business meeting.
Whatever, man.
Come on!
Let's go.
Get in the Porsche.
Shit!
Hey, I think your Porsche got a ticket, Pat.
Shut up, Jeff.
Just get in the car.
This Porsche is tiny.
The Porsche is normal-sized.
You're a sasquatch.
Are those workout gloves?
I don't think so.
They came with the car so...
Check this out.
You see where those cars are stopping up ahead?
Yeah.
I should probably stop pretty soon, right?
Pat, slow down.
What?
I can't hear you!
Bose surround sound!
Hey, stop it, dude.
This is not funny.
- Count to three and I'll stop.
- Pat, please stop.
Count of three!
One!
Two!
- Pat, look out!
- Three!
Curb!
Curb!
Shit!
Yes!
Will you please stop the car?
It handles better at high speeds!
- Stop the car!
- Shut up!
Tree!
Tree!
Pat?
Fuck!
Wow.
Yeah, that's real bad.
Oh, shit.
What the fuck?
He looks mad.
Are you on drugs?
How many beers have you had?
Shut up, Jeff.
Shut up.
Did you not see that damn tree?
Whatever you do, don't say a word.
Stay in the fucking car.
I am fine, yes.
Thank you for asking.
Burt, should we call an ambulance?
Hi.
There was a pedestrian child in the street and in order to avoid killing it,
I had to swerve and maneuver onto your sidewalk, at which point I lost control of my vehicle and I've hit your tree here.
We can see that.
Do you think we're blind?
No.
Of course not.
I just would like to apologize.
Is he okay?
Yeah, he's fine.
Just a little stunned.
I think that one's hurt.
Maybe we should call the police.
He's fine.
He's okay.
That child's not moving.
Ma'am, he's okay.
Jeff, will you get out of the car?
Yeah.
Get out of the car.
Show her that you're fine.
See?
Live and limber.
- Baby, are you sure you're all right?
- Look at that.
- I am fine, thank you.
- Look at that.
Good as new.
You remind me of my grandson.
Is his name Kevin, by any chance?
Brian, why?
No reason, ma'am.
Do you think there's any way that you and I can take care of this ourselves?
I really don't want to hang out here all afternoon with the cops.
I don't know...
There's some bark off that tree.
It might have ruined the tree, baby.
Whoa.
Is that Linda?
Give me 500 bucks, and we'll call it even.
Excuse me?
No "excuse me," man.
Look at my tree here.
That's a 200-year-old tree.
Might have to do some landscaping.
I'll probably have to bring a tractor in here and a backhoe and dig all this stuff up.
It's a tree!
Have you been drinking?
No.
Why don't we just let the police decide that.
Call 911.
-$100.
- Times five.
-$150.
- Plus $350.
- Fine.
Call the police.
- Call 911.
God damn it!
You take a check?
Yeah.
No problem.
Oh, good.
Boy, he's got some nerve, don't he?
Trying to negotiate with you about our tree.
He come in my yard, hit my tree.
You look at that tree and he don't think he owes me.
Who's that guy she's with?
Get in the car, Jeff.
It was very, very quick and it could have been somebody...
She was wearing a peach dress that she wore this morning, okay?
And they got into our car!
Man, something really big is happening here.
Yeah, no shit, Jeff!
My wife is having an affair!
We don't know that yet.
Let's follow this and see where this leads.
Well, I'm trying to, but I can't see dick so it's kind of hard.
Go!
Go!
Go, go!
Hang on.
- I see them!
- Where?
They're just up here to the left!
There they are!
Pat.
What the fuck are you doing?
You told me to hurry!
Tell me before you swerve so I don't fall off the fucking car!
Okay.
Whatever, just focus on the road!
Where are they going?
They're turning up there!
What street?
South Clark!
South Clark!
They're going to Cochon!
Damn it!
Let me tell you about Cochon.
It's full of A-holes who look down on everybody that's not, like, part of the cool-guy club.
It's so lame.
Look at this, no parking.
I can wait with the car.
No.
I got it.
Pat, there's a fire hydrant!
There's a fire hydrant right here.
I got it.
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
Come on.
Let's go.
Okay, what we got here is a friendly lunch.
It could be a coworker.
It could be a long-lost cousin.
She hates her coworkers and I know her whole family.
We got to hear what they're saying.
Well, body language can tell you a lot, man.
- You're going in there.
- What, me?
Yeah.
I'm not really dressed properly, Pat.
Why don't you just go in there and talk to her?
This could all be a huge misunderstanding.
If I talk to her, she's just gonna deny it.
Why wouldn't she tell you the truth?
Oh, my God.
You have no idea how adult relationships work, do you?
You haven't had a girlfriend since high school.
- So?
So?
- So?
So...
I need to find out exactly what's going on so I'll have the upper hand later.
Do you still love Linda?
There's an empty booth next to them.
Okay?
Just sneak in with my phone.
Here's a little grease money.
Okay.
Get in there, do what you got to do.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- How do you do?
Lovely.
- Fine, thank you.
Can I help you?
Table for one, please.
- Right this way.
- Great.
Thank you.
- Oh, miss?
- Yes?
Could I sit there?
Those tables are saved for two patrons.
- Right.
- Right this way.
Miss?
You know what?
Excuse me.
There are going to be two patrons.
There will be two patrons.
You said table of one.
I meant that more like in the bistro sense, like one plus another one?
Well, just in case, I think this table back here would be quite lovely for you guys.
What if I grease you?
I'm sorry?
I have money.
There's two fives, some ones.
There's a 20.
If I could just sit at that table.
I can't explain.
But it's really important.
I mean, I honestly don't even feel like he really likes me.
Well, that's his problem.
I mean...
From where I stand, there's plenty to like.
Thank you, Steve.
You're a really good listener.
Thank you.
It's such a treat.
I'm just being myself.
Don't say anything.
She might recognize your voice.
If you can hear me, give me a thumbs-up.
Okay, now take the talking part of the phone and hold it, but keep it low, don't let them see.
I really don't think that you want to hear this.
Jeff, just do it!
Okay?
Stop talking so I can hear what's going on.
I can't.
Honestly, I lost a lot of friends because of Pat.
'Cause my friends just don't like him.
I think a little bit's my fault, 'cause I would complain a lot to them and...
For a really long time, I've felt like he and I are...
I don't know...
We got, like, weirdly competitive with each other.
We just never communicate.
He just never listens, ever.
Gosh.
I shouldn't even be talking about this but we haven't had sex in...
I mean, over two months.
That's a long time.
And I think, kind of, what's worse than that is that it's so awkward.
Well, having sex is one thing but making love is something else, right?
What does that even mean?
Thank you, Steve.
I'm not used to being able to talk so openly with someone and have them listen, and care what I'm saying and...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Wail!
Pat, what do you want me to do now, huh?
Hello, my name is Rob.
Can I start you out with something to drink?
Some water.
Excuse me?
- I'll have water.
- I'm sorry?
I'll take some fuckin' water, Rob.
Absolutely.
Jeff?
Whoa!
Hey.
- Wow!
- Hi.
What are you doing here?
I'm just...
Lunching it up, you know?
Getting a little bistro action.
'Pp-
Have you ever met my friend, Steve?
This is my brother-in-law, Jeff.
- This is Steve.
- Hey, Jeff, nice to meet you, man.
- My friend Steve.
- Steve.
We were just gonna leave.
Did you still want me to drop you off at your car?
Yep.
Yeah.
So, I'm going to take him to his car, and I'll see you later.
Hope so.
Nice meeting you, Jeff.
Pat, they're coming out...
What the fuck?
Jeff!
They went that way!
Pat!
Well, then, let's go get the car!
- No car!
- What?
No car!
Help me get a cab!
What are you talkin' about?
What happened to the car?
Nothing!
It got towed.
- That's not funny!
- I'm not...
- I know.
I know it's not.
- It's so not funny!
Help me get a cab!
- There's no way to know where they are.
- Great.
What do we do?
I think we should just sit down right here.
- And?
- And wait.
- For what?
- For a sign.
I'm not gonna sit here and wait for a fucking sign!
Okay, well, then let's walk!
A school bus just drove by!
It's a sign!
What does it mean?
Do we go to a school?
Is my wife fucking some guy in a janitor closet?
I don't think that's it.
I don't think that's it.
- That's not it.
- Good guess.
Now what?
What are you doing?
I'm looking for a credit card slip.
I don't see why.
If I find the slip, I get his last name and then we can look up where he lives and go beat him up.
No, I get it.
I just don't think they throw those things away.
Just shut up and help.
Find it yet?
- How about now?
- That's not helping!
I think we've gotten off track somewhere.
Like I've gotten off track.
Something feels wrong.
Fine.
I'll do it myself, if it'll make you stop talking.
- Is that it?
- No.
It's not.
Oh, God.
What is that?
No, don't do it, Pat.
You don't have to smell it.
Pat.
Okay.
- Hey.
- Hey, Carol.
That was yummy.
What're you doing?
Don't tell anybody else.
What?
Somebody's messing with me.
- Really?
- Yeah, in this office.
- No.
- Yeah.
I got hit by a plane.
- What?
- A little paper plane came into my...
And all these messages were coming to me on my computer.
Kind of...
- Flirty stuff.
- Flirty?
I know someone's playin' some kind of a joke and I think it's those guys that are in the back over there that did the fantasy football.
Oh, my God, those guys are so hot.
That would be so good.
They're young, too.
Do you think it's Henry?
- Henry?
- Yeah.
He's kind of...
Interesting.
He's married, isn't he?
Okay, let's just say it is somebody here.
What does the message say?
Like what are the details?
Well, somethin' about, you know...
What?
That they're a secret admirer.
They said they were...
I think that's kind of hot.
No, it's not.
It's ridiculous.
And I don't like being the butt of a joke.
How do you know it's a joke?
I mean, how many times do we get to get juiced up like this?
This is awesome.
I'm not getting juiced up over a joke.
You're getting attention.
I am super-jelly.
I want attention.
You're impossible.
When was the last time you had a relationship?
Well, my husband, of course.
No way.
Well, I mean, I went out on dates.
Come on.
I've been to the movies.
- It's no wonder you're so cranky.
- I've been bowling...
- I'm not...
- Yeah, you need to get busy.
- You need to get your pipes cleaned.
- You think I'm...
You need to get f...
Yeah.
Well, I won't tell anyone.
Pinky swear.
What else?
What else?
I did hear her say that she felt neglected.
Sounds like they're banging already.
It's possible.
Don't ever get married, dude.
It fucking sucks.
Really?
I think it would be kind of awesome.
Well, it's not.
Okay.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Okay.
I'm sick of walking.
Okay.
Is that what I think it is?
You know, I've been havin' this really weird dream about Dad lately.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He's a teacher.
And...
We're in this classroom with a whole bunch of kids, and we all sit down.
And Dad asks everyone,
"What's the greatest day in the history of the world?"
And one kid is like, "Christmas."
And Dad's like, "No."
And whenever they get the answer wrong, they have to leave the room.
And eventually it's just me and Dad.
And he looks at me and says,
"Pat, what's the greatest day in the history of the world?"
And I don't know, 'cause I'm nervous.
And I'm like, "Dad, I don't know."
And he just looks at me and he smiles and he says...
He says, "Today." He says, "Today."
How'd you know that?
He says, "Today is the greatest day in the history of the world."
Yeah.
I have that dream, Pat.
Except in mine, it's me, you and Dad in his car.
Okay.
I guess it's just something he said to us when we were kids or somethin'.
It's like floating' around in both of our brains.
What is wrong with you?
- Pat.
- What?
What?
What is wrong with you?
Why do you want to be like this?
- What are you talking about?
- We had...
We were havin'...
We're having the same dream!
What the fuck are you talking about?
Why do you want to live like this?
You're drifting through this life with no awareness of how special this is.
You want to talk about what's happening right now, right here?
What's happening right now is that I'm getting lectured by my pothead brother who lives in our mom's basement at 30 years old about how I don't understand the universe!
Hey, here's some understanding for you.
A job and a car and a wife and an apartment!
I got to go.
What?
- I have to go, Pat.
- Where are you going?
You know what?
You wouldn't...
You would laugh at me again.
Jesus Christ.
You see a fucking truck with the word "Kevin" on it and you have to run after it?
Yeah.
I do.
I wish I was that stupid!
You're a dick!
You know what?
I have an asshole for a brother.
It breaks my heart.
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!
- You call me an asshole?
- Yeah, you are an asshole!
You fucking piece of shit!
You drive a fucking Boxster!
Fuck you!
Don't do this, Pat!
Fuck you!
You get down.
Get down on the fucking ground!
Fucking idiot!
You and Mom will never understand me.
And you're all I have left!
Another Jack and Coke?
Nope.
Got to get home.
Old lady, huh?
No, she's boning another dude.
Right on.
Stop the car.
Stop.
Please, stop?
- Hi.
- Hello.
Hey, so, my sister and her husband just got here a little while ago in that red Camry out there.
And...
I need to...
I'm meeting them.
So...
- Okay...
- Actually, it's an emergency.
I have to get her medication, like, right now, so what's her room number?
We have a privacy policy, sir.
I'm sorry, I can't give you her number.
I know it's like policy and everything, but this is a family emergency, so maybe you could just give me the room number...
It'll take me a second to call.
I lied.
It's not an emergency.
It's not a health emergency.
It is a financial emergency.
Their home is about to be foreclosed on and I need to make a payment.
- Just stop.
- Okay.
- You're embarrassing yourself.
- Right.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me?
No, just thank you so much.
Pat!
Pat!
Oh, my God.
Jeff.
- Oh, my God, Pat.
- What the fuck?
I was on the truck.
The truck came here and now you're here.
- This shit is aligned!
- Shut the fuck up.
- What?
- Linda is here, in this hotel somewhere.
- With the guy?
- Yeah, probably with the guy.
Sorry.
How the fuck did you find me?
It was the candy man.
Oh, shit.
He's right there.
Okay, what should we do?
Duck in there.
I'm gigantic!
Come on, let's go.
What do you want to do? Should we stay?
Should we wait?
Do we just wait, or...
We could wait.
I don't know.
I don't...
Should I call her?
Maybe I call her cell phone right now.
And then, like, act innocent and be like, "What's going on?"
You could try that.
You know, you're not fucking helping at all.
You're just like, "Do you want to do that?"
Do you want to know what I think you should do?
Yeah.
I think you should take a few deep breaths, close your eyes, and focus.
That is like stupid fucking Jeff mumbo-jumbo.
If you have any other idea, even one,
I'll be happy to try it without making fun of you.
Okay, all right.
Okay.
Close your eyes.
What do you see?
I just can't stop picturing what's going on.
What if she's, like, giving him a hand job?
You know, I think they're adults.
It's probably unlikely she's giving him a hand job.
I'm gonna break down the door.
No.
Pat.
I'm gonna break it down.
Listen.
Wait, hold on.
That's a terrible idea.
I've seen you try to do things physically.
I'll do it.
Do you think you can do that?
I wish I could get some sort of running start.
You totally can.
There's, like, hallways.
You run and turn.
Parallel isn't gonna help me.
You could run and turn right at the last second.
I wouldn't...
No.
That's not gonna work.
All right.
One, two, three!
Fuck!
- Run!
- What was that?
- Are you okay?
- Fuck!
Get up!
- Linda!
- Pat!
What are you...
- Pat, don't...
Pat, stop!
- What's going on?
- Steve, let him go!
- Either you're gonna calm down...
- Let him go!
Jeff!
- Don't fucking move!
- What are you doing?
- What the hell is going on?
- We just got here!
- Who are you people?
You, shut up!
Who the fuck is this guy?
He's just a friend, okay?
Calm down.
- There's wine!
- Yeah!
There's a bottle of wine on ice, and a...
What is this?
- That's a...
- A sex board?
No, you bring it with the...
Pat!
And your face is flushed, which means you're horny.
- No!
- What the fuck is going on?
Stop yelling and I'll answer all of your questions.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
I'm ready to go home.
Linda, I think you should come with me.
Excuse me!
You should shut the fuck up!
I think that you should go and I'll call you later.
You're not calling this fucking guy.
Linda, do you want me to stay?
- I think you should go.
- You should go!
You need to go!
I'm gonna stay and talk to Pat, okay?
Time for you to go, man.
- Get out, bro!
- All right, Pat.
Get out!
Okay.
Start talking.
ls there anyone else in here?
Well, I'm a little upset, actually,
-and I think that it's understandable!
- I understand that.
Look, what I need to know...
I just need to know one thing, okay?
- Okay.
What?
- Okay.
Are you mad because you came in here and you found me with another man?
Yes.
- Yes.
- Or...
Or are you mad because you're afraid that you might lose me?
What?
There's like a part B now?
Please, don't do that.
It's just semantic bullshit!
- No, it isn't!
It isn't!
- Yeah, it is!
- You really don't know the difference.
- You know what?
Because if you don't understand the difference...
Linda!
Linda.
I'm gonna try to listen to you blabber about whatever this is.
And I'm gonna try to understand your incoherent babble.
Go.
- Why do you always do that?
- What?
- I'm listening.
- No, you're not.
Yeah, I'm trying.
You always just make me feel so stupid!
I'm sorry it's stupid!
I catch you trying to cheat on me and...
You make fun of everything I say.
I'm really just trying to have a conversation with you right now.
This is why our relationship is so fucked.
Because you know what?
When I asked you if you would take me to Cochon you laughed at me.
Who care...
I'm sorry.
That's...
But when I asked Steve, he just, you know, said, let's go.
Yeah, 'cause he wanted to get in your pants!
Well, maybe, but at least he's trying to put in some time and effort!
Let me tell you something about Cochon.
- Cochon is full of assholes...
- You're not even and snobs in fucking turquoise tailored shirts and pink ties, like that asshole!
You want to ask me to take you there?
Fine.
I'll take you to fucking Cochon.
We'll...
- Yeah.
- God, you're not even listening to me.
No, I'm hearing you loud and clear.
You're not!
It's not about the restaurant.
I just want you to, like, care that I want to go there!
And do you think it's about this guy?
Because I really don't even fucking care about him!
He's nice.
- He listens to me.
- I'm nice.
But you and I, we are petty, we are passive-aggressive with each other, we don't even fight!
I mean, this is a miracle right now!
And what I think, honestly, is that we have no house, we have no kids, thank God!
It would be really fucking easy for us to just walk away!
It'd be super simple.
And that is what I think that we should do.
Hang on, hang on.
You know, let's just not, like, let's just not...
Can we not talk about this anymore?
Let's just go home and sleep on it, and, like...
And like...
Forget it.
I'm gonna go stay at my mom's.
Bye, Jeff.
Jeffrey, where are you?
I asked you to call me after you got the wood glue.
I'm at the office.
Let me know what's going on.
Thanks.
Bye.
Oh, please.
It sure is a noisy little thing.
Yeah.
- Eight glasses a day, my doctor says.
- Really?
You're kidding me.
Blow out my biceps trying to lift these cups that many times.
- I'm Barry.
- Sharon.
Nice to meet you.
Same here.
What am I saying?
I know you're Sharon.
I've seen you around.
I really do like flowers.
Yeah?
Like.
Metaphorically, too.
Symbolically.
All kinds.
Gardenias are my favorite.
I'm not following you.
Excuse me.
It was nice meeting you.
Just stupid.
Sharon?
What's going on?
I think it's over.
What happened?
What?
This is not the way I imagined my life was gonna be.
How did you imagine it?
I was gonna be in the Peace Corps and all that crap, you know, with some guy in an exotic place, all worldly and giving and shit,
and living in a little hut, and taking care of cute little kids
and kissing under waterfalls and stuff, you know.
You can still kiss under waterfalls and stuff like that.
It's like, how many good years do I have left?
I hate my kids right now.
I don't know when that happened.
They were so cute.
I look at the pictures of them, and our family...
Don't cry.
Have some more tissue.
- Don't explain.
Oh, God.
- No.
I just...
Oh, Carol, I'm sorry.
It'll just make it worse.
Don't explain.
But it's not what you think!
Yeah, it is.
I wish that I could
see the world like you.
Really?
I don't know.
You have this, like, belief in this cosmic order.
I really envy that.
You don't want to be like me.
I'm not happy at all.
You know, since Dad died, I've had this...
Had this feeling that it had to be for a reason.
I keep thinking that the signs are all about me, but maybe...
Maybe they're about you and your marriage.
My marriage is not good.
It is a
disaster.
I just want to feel like I love Linda.
And I want to feel like she loves me.
And we both want to, like, be in love.
I miss it and I want it so bad.
I think you should just say that.
To her.
It's not that simple, Jeff.
I don't know.
I think it could be that simple.
I mean, wouldn't you be psyched if Linda walked in here right now and sat down in this tub next to you and said,
"Pat, I want to be in love with you again"?
That would be awesome.
Dude, you need to say that to her.
You need to tell her that right now.
- River Parish.
- I am so sorry.
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
Don't apologize, seriously.
- But!
want to.
- It's okay.
No, I just...
It was so weird and didn't come out the way I...
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
It's just that I'm not gay.
But that's okay.
I'm not gay, either.
But you like women.
So?
Well, I like men.
I like men, too.
And to me, it's like, at this point in my life, whether it's a man or a woman, it doesn't matter.
I want someone who gets me.
I fee!
like I deserve that.
And!
think you do, too.
Well, it's important, yes.
But it doesn't mean
I want to sleep with everybody that understands me.
That's all.
No, no, no.
That's not my intention.
Isn't the most important thing finding someone who sees you exactly as you are?
Who gets the Peace Corps and the kissing under waterfalls?
Yeah.
So?
Carol?
Are you there?
Hello?
Shit.
Okay, sorry, everybody.
Just head for the exits!
Single file!
Keep it orderly!
Please!
Close your eyes.
It's clear.
Come on.
There's my car, right here.
Where are we going?
We're all wet.
- I don't know.
What do you think?
- I'm sorry, I don't know.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Let's go to the mall and get drinks with the little umbrellas in them.
Bigger.
Wilder.
I haven't been to New Orleans in 20 years.
How about that?
It's perfect.
Okay, let's go.
Come on out, everybody!
Just come right out.
Shit.
What is this?
It looks like really bad traffic.
Well, I mean in your, you know...
- You mean, like, is it a sign?
- I don't know.
It could be.
- It definitely could be.
- How do I know what to do?
That's the big question, yeah.
It's a constant struggle.
I think you got to go with your gut.
Well, I'm not going to stop now.
Right?
Hey.
Pat?
If we don't get a chance to reconnect today,
I'm, like, super proud of you.
Linda!
Linda!
Sorry.
- Second thoughts?
- Well, I just...
It's okay.
Pat?
Pat!
- I think that's my son.
- Sharon?
What now, my man?
I guess I'll go back.
We'll have to wait for all this traffic to clear.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just...
You ever feel like you're waiting forever to figure out what your destiny is, and then when you do it's not really that exciting?
Linda!
Pat?
Pat!
Linda!
What are you doing here?
I want to be in love again.
What?
Things have gotten way off track.
And weird and shitty.
And I'm a big part of that, and I'm really sorry for it.
- Pat!
- What?
Honey, what's happening?
What's the matter?
- Why are you running down...
- Mom?
What's going...
Oh, hi.
- Wait, what are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
How did you get here?
In Carol's...
This is Carol.
Hi.
I'm Linda.
Nice to meet you.
Jeff...
Jeff's here?
Whoa, hey!
Did you see that?
Is he okay?
Is he okay?
Yeah, we're here.
A car just went off the bridge.
There's people inside of it.
Somebody jumped in!
Wait!
Our dad's still down there!
Fuck.
Come on.
Help!
Help us!
Dad!
Help!
Come on, girls!
Come on.
Swim hard!
Come on, honey!
Give me your hand.
That a girl.
Come on.
- Get back there.
- Dad?
Hey, the car's going down!
The car's sinking!
Dad!
Dad!
Jeff!
Jeff!
Dad!
Come on, Dad!
We need some help over here.
Pat?
Over here!
Over here!
Pat!
Pat!
- Jeff!
- Jeff!
Help!
Help!
Man in the water!
Help!
Two survivors in sight.
Five feet off the first cleat.
Coming into the dive deck.
Hurry!
Get a hold of him!
One, two, three!
Jeff!
We have an unresponsive person!
He's not moving!
Call the command center!
Have an ambulance meet us at the pier!
- Jeff!
- Sir, we got to help him.
We got him.
Do something!
Jesus!
Sir, sir.
Jeff!
- He's not moving!
- Starting CPR!
Get off me!
Leave me alone!
You need to sit down!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
Jeff, wake up!
- Jeff!
- Still not responding.
Can you hear me?
HEY. hey, you okay?
Hey.
Sir?
- Are you okay?
- Oh, God.
Let's get blankets!
Sir, stay still.
Let me sit up.
What happened?
Everything-
I'm hungry-
And coming up next, the story of two girls, their father, and the man who was in the right place at the right time.
The car that was behind us crashed into the back of us and then we went over the bridge.
And then this man, he just came and broke our window...
And he almost died doing it.
If we had lost our dad, you know, I just really can't even imagine it.
We're just really thankful he was there.
We'll be right back with that rescue tale of local councilman Kevin Landry and his two little girls.
All that and more when we come back.
I watched Signs again last night.
It keeps getting better every time I see it.
It's funny.
The first time you watch it, it's hard to understand what it's about.
It just sort of meanders.
And then, everything comes together in this one perfect moment at the end.
And when you watch it a second or a third or a fourth time, you start to see that all of this randomness
is leading towards a perfect moment.
My favorite character is the little girl.
Everyone thinks she's so strange because she can't finish a glass of water.
She's convinced they're contaminated.
So, by the end of the film, there are glasses of water littered around this house.
And then, it's the water that saves them.
And that was fate.
I can't help but wonder about my fate.
About my destiny.
Renewal.
Vitality.
Energy.
Are you tired of feeling sluggish?
Do you feel like life is passing you by?
Then we've got the solution for you.
It's called "The Most Incredible Vitamin In The World"
and there's a reason you're watching this right now.
Just pick up the phone and start the new chapter to your life.
Call now.
Not available in stores.
Made in Germany.
Beware of imitators.
Call 1-800...
Hello?
Yo, Kevin.
No, this is Jeff.
Where Kevin at?
I don't know.
Oh, man, look, don't be fucking around!
Where the fuck is Kevin?
Kevin doesn't live here.
There's always some motherfucker trying to tell me there ain't no Kevin!
Let me put this word in your fucking peanut brain, Kevin!
K-E-V-I-N!
Kevin.
What are you doing?
Doing this.
Some strawbs, hand-sliced.
A white rose of whipped cream.
Bam!
Bon appétit.
What's the special occasion?
This is one of those "just because" breakfasts, you know?
It sounds corny, but relationships are like flowers and flowers need water to bloom.
Consider this sprinkling from a watering can.
Well, thanks.
- That's nice.
- You're welcome.
Enjoy.
Oh, my gosh.
I got some good news, actually.
Yeah?
I got a phone call from Randy.
Is he the guy that we talked to at that barbecue?
Oh, no, that's a different Randy.
- But that guy's name was Randy, right?
- Yes.
I liked his wife.
Different Randy.
- We should have them over.
- Yeah.
This is Randy at Millennium Porsche.
Can I tell you something?
With no money down, this thing is practically free.
Pat!
No!
Whoa, whoa.
Don't start with no.
- That's what this is.
- Don't start with no.
You're just, like, in this mindset.
And you're not even...
It's not a mindset.
We don't have the money.
Yeah.
That's the mindset I'm talking about.
Honey, look, I'm trying to be really careful, and I've cut back on some things.
And, like, we promised we were going to get a house this year...
I'm just trying to be a grown-up about this.
Surprise.
We got it.
This is happening.
Look...
Everything you just said about the house, you know, our future, you're exactly right.
And I'm so lucky to have you looking out for us in that way.
But I'm looking out for us in another way.
I'm looking out for...
That intangible thing that every couple needs.
It's a little bit of magic, and a little bit of danger, frankly.
This is gonna solve a lot of our problems.
This tension right now.
As soon as you get in that thing and you feel the energy and you feel it rumble in your gut.
If you don't get turned on, you're made of stone.
Where is it?
It's in the driveway.
Are you...
Is this...
Oh, come on.
Okay, okay...
That's...
Hello?
- Mom?
- Jeff.
Hi.
You know, you're supposed to say "hello" when you pick up the phone.
Yeah, I know.
I thought that maybe you were somebody else, but you're not.
What do you do in the basement?
You're not cleaning it.
You really want to know?
You didn't like it last time we had this conversation.
Okay, no.
You know what?
You're right.
I don't.
Did you get the wood glue?
What are you talking about?
I left you a note on the kitchen counter.
I haven't been upstairs.
One of the shutters on the pantry is broken and I need you to fix it.
You know what, I'm kind of busy right now, so...
All I want for my birthday is for you to get your ass off that couch, and you get on the bus
- and you go to the Home Depot.
- I'm not on the couch.
You come home and fix the shutter before I get home, or you're gonna find someplace else to live.
- Fine.
- Fine.
Good.
You got it?
Do you understand?
Yes, Mom!
Okay!
Love you!
Goodbye.
Did you hang up on me?
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.
Stop the bus.
Can you please stop the bus?
Sorry.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Can I help you, sir?
No.
What?
Pass the ball!
Go, go, go!
Shit, you a'ight?
Get your big ass up, man.
You bleeding and shit?
- He out, man.
- We need another person.
We need one!
You got next.
Who, him?
He gonna be a ref?
That's all we got.
That's all we got.
Let's see what he got.
Let's go, dawg.
Get out here.
Oh, he's passing now.
Right there, dawg.
What's your problem?
That's your man.
Why don't you play some D, man?
Right, right, right.
Hell, no!
You working on this?
Come on, man.
Go, go, go, go.
I'm Jeff.
Kevin.
Ke...
Kevin.
Is your name Kevin Kevin?
No.
So, that's your first name on your jersey?
Yeah, that's my name.
Yeah.
Do you live around here?
Yeah, I don't live far from here.
You obviously don't live around here, though.
No, I was just strolling around today.
It was a nice day, so I thought I'd walk around.
Were you following me, or...
No.
I mean, no.
I saw you on the bus.
Let me explain.
Have you ever seen the movie Signs?
With Mel Gibson and Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin?
Nah, I don't think I have.
I got a phone call this morning.
Someone was asking for Kevin.
But there's no Kevin who lives with me.
It's kind of a common name.
Yeah.
I guess that's true.
I mean, you never got a call, like someone called the wrong house phone?
What if there's no wrong numbers?
Maybe it's always the right house phone.
Everything happens for a reason, right?
Exactly.
No, that's exactly it.
Hey, man, I'm about to go put something in the air real quick.
I don't know if you want to come.
I don't...
I'm sorry...
I don't know what that means.
Smoke weed?
You want to smoke weed with me?
Yeah, man.
I like weed.
Yeah, I can see that.
Wow.
It's nice in here.
- That's nice.
- Yeah.
Oh, shit.
That's a treat.
Check his pockets!
Sorry, Jeff.
Marriage is a compromise.
She got what she wanted, I'm living here in Baton Rouge.
So I get a little somethin'-somethin'.
- Right?
- Sure.
Yeah.
Thank you.
You know what's up.
I got to take this...
It's a business call.
Sweetheart, can I get another Bud Light.
Do you want more wings?
Whatever.
Fine.
I will get glue and fix your shutter.
No.
It is Jeff's responsibility.
That is the point.
He has to do it, not you.
Jeff has to do it.
Okay.
What are you...
Why are you calling me?
Maybe you could get him moving a little bit.
Do you understand?
He's stuck, honey.
He's stuck.
He's 30!
He had a difficult adolescent period.
You of all people would know neither of us had a very easy adolescent period.
- You were older.
- What does that have to do with it?
When you're an adult, you take responsibility for your life.
Okay?
But you're brothers.
You love each other, don't you?
You know, fake it for a little bit just to get...
You know.
Maybe he'll grow on you.
We don't do that, Mom.
We don't spend time together.
Well, Pat, could you at least try?
It's my birthday.
I gotta call you back.
- No, no, no, Pat...
- Bye.
Damn it.
Asshole.
Jeff!
Pat?
What the hell are you doing here?
Kevin beat me up.
I walked.
Who's Kevin?
Some kid I was following.
Well, if he's a kid, how come you didn't kick his ass?
Because I don't believe in fighting, Pat.
And you know that.
Right.
I forgot.
You're a pussy.
Look, Mom called and she's really pissed.
Was Gandhi a pussy?
Yeah, Gandhi was a pussy.
And once again, I have to pick up your slack.
Well, it's not your problem.
Well, it becomes my problem when Mom calls me in the middle of a business meeting.
Yeah?
You're having a business meeting at Hooters?
Yeah.
Yes.
That's very classy.
Right.
Well, business is business.
So, come on.
Get in the car.
Hey!
You don't need to grab onto me.
I'm a little bit conflicted right now, that's all.
About what?
You're just gonna make fun of me, man.
Let's go.
Try me.
I want to learn how you think because I want to free my mind.
Let me try to explain it to you maybe in terms that you would understand.
- Okay.
- This morning
I was meant to have a business meeting with the Kevins.
And destiny.
And now you're here at this weird Hooters thing...
And so now I'm just trying to figure out how to proceed.
What you just said sounded like Yoda took acid and stumbled into a business meeting.
You can make all the fun of Yoda that you want,
Yoda would be fucking killer in a business meeting.
Whatever, man.
Come on!
Let's go.
Get in the Porsche.
Shit!
Hey, I think your Porsche got a ticket, Pat.
Shut up, Jeff.
Just get in the car.
This Porsche is tiny.
The Porsche is normal-sized.
You're a sasquatch.
Are those workout gloves?
I don't think so.
They came with the car so...
Check this out.
You see where those cars are stopping up ahead?
Yeah.
I should probably stop pretty soon, right?
Pat, slow down.
What?
I can't hear you!
Bose surround sound!
Hey, stop it, dude.
This is not funny.
- Count to three and I'll stop.
- Pat, please stop.
Count of three!
One!
Two!
- Pat, look out!
- Three!
Curb!
Curb!
Shit!
Yes!
Will you please stop the car?
It handles better at high speeds!
- Stop the car!
- Shut up!
Tree!
Tree!
Pat?
Fuck!
Wow.
Yeah, that's real bad.
Oh, shit.
What the fuck?
He looks mad.
Are you on drugs?
How many beers have you had?
Shut up, Jeff.
Shut up.
Did you not see that damn tree?
Whatever you do, don't say a word.
Stay in the fucking car.
I am fine, yes.
Thank you for asking.
Burt, should we call an ambulance?
Hi.
There was a pedestrian child in the street and in order to avoid killing it,
I had to swerve and maneuver onto your sidewalk, at which point I lost control of my vehicle and I've hit your tree here.
We can see that.
Do you think we're blind?
No.
Of course not.
I just would like to apologize.
Is he okay?
Yeah, he's fine.
Just a little stunned.
I think that one's hurt.
Maybe we should call the police.
He's fine.
He's okay.
That child's not moving.
Ma'am, he's okay.
Jeff, will you get out of the car?
Yeah.
Get out of the car.
Show her that you're fine.
See?
Live and limber.
- Baby, are you sure you're all right?
- Look at that.
- I am fine, thank you.
- Look at that.
Good as new.
You remind me of my grandson.
Is his name Kevin, by any chance?
Brian, why?
No reason, ma'am.
Do you think there's any way that you and I can take care of this ourselves?
I really don't want to hang out here all afternoon with the cops.
I don't know...
There's some bark off that tree.
It might have ruined the tree, baby.
Whoa.
Is that Linda?
Give me 500 bucks, and we'll call it even.
Excuse me?
No "excuse me," man.
Look at my tree here.
That's a 200-year-old tree.
Might have to do some landscaping.
I'll probably have to bring a tractor in here and a backhoe and dig all this stuff up.
It's a tree!
Have you been drinking?
No.
Why don't we just let the police decide that.
Call 911.
- $100.
- Times five.
- $150.
- Plus $350.
- Fine.
Call the police.
- Call 911.
God damn it!
You take a check?
Yeah.
No problem.
Oh, good.
Boy, he's got some nerve, don't he?
Trying to negotiate with you about our tree.
He come in my yard, hit my tree.
You look at that tree and he don't think he owes me.
Who's that guy she's with?
Get in the car, Jeff.
It was very, very quick and it could have been somebody...
She was wearing a peach dress that she wore this morning, okay?
And they got into our car!
Man, something really big is happening here.
Yeah, no shit, Jeff!
My wife is having an affair!
We don't know that yet.
Let's follow this and see where this leads.
Well, I'm trying to, but I can't see dick so it's kind of hard.
Go!
Go!
Go, go!
Hang on.
- I see them!
- Where?
They're just up here to the left!
There they are!
Pat.
What the fuck are you doing?
You told me to hurry!
Tell me before you swerve so I don't fall off the fucking car!
Okay.
Whatever, just focus on the road!
Where are they going?
They're turning up there!
What street?
South Clark!
South Clark!
They're going to Cochon!
Damn it!
Let me tell you about Cochon.
It's full of A-holes who look down on everybody that's not, like, part of the cool-guy club.
It's so lame.
Look at this, no parking.
I can wait with the car.
No.
I got it.
Pat, there's a fire hydrant!
There's a fire hydrant right here.
I got it.
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
Come on.
Let's go.
Okay, what we got here is a friendly lunch.
It could be a coworker.
It could be a long-lost cousin.
She hates her coworkers and I know her whole family.
We got to hear what they're saying.
Well, body language can tell you a lot, man.
- You're going in there.
- What, me?
Yeah.
I'm not really dressed properly, Pat.
Why don't you just go in there and talk to her?
This could all be a huge misunderstanding.
If I talk to her, she's just gonna deny it.
Why wouldn't she tell you the truth?
Oh, my God.
You have no idea how adult relationships work, do you?
You haven't had a girlfriend since high school.
- So?
So?
- So?
So...
I need to find out exactly what's going on so I'll have the upper hand later.
Do you still love Linda?
There's an empty booth next to them.
Okay?
Just sneak in with my phone.
Here's a little grease money.
Okay.
Get in there, do what you got to do.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- How do you do?
Lovely.
- Fine, thank you.
Can I help you?
Table for one, please.
- Right this way.
- Great.
Thank you.
- Oh, miss?
- Yes?
Could I sit there?
Those tables are saved for two patrons.
- Right.
- Right this way.
Miss?
You know what?
Excuse me.
There are going to be two patrons.
There will be two patrons.
You said table of one.
I meant that more like in the bistro sense, like one plus another one?
Well, just in case, I think this table back here would be quite lovely for you guys.
What if I grease you?
I'm sorry?
I have money.
There's two fives, some ones.
There's a 20.
If I could just sit at that table.
I can't explain.
But it's really important.
I mean, I honestly don't even feel like he really likes me.
Well, that's his problem.
I mean...
From where I stand, there's plenty to like.
Thank you, Steve.
You're a really good listener.
Thank you.
It's such a treat.
I'm just being myself.
Don't say anything.
She might recognize your voice.
If you can hear me, give me a thumbs-up.
Okay, now take the talking part of the phone and hold it, but keep it low, don't let them see.
I really don't think that you want to hear this.
Jeff, just do it!
Okay?
Stop talking so I can hear what's going on.
I can't.
Honestly, I lost a lot of friends because of Pat.
'Cause my friends just don't like him.
I think a little bit's my fault, 'cause I would complain a lot to them and...
For a really long time, I've felt like he and I are...
I don't know...
We got, like, weirdly competitive with each other.
We just never communicate.
He just never listens, ever.
Gosh.
I shouldn't even be talking about this but we haven't had sex in...
I mean, over two months.
That's a long time.
And I think, kind of, what's worse than that is that it's so awkward.
Well, having sex is one thing but making love is something else, right?
What does that even mean?
Thank you, Steve.
I'm not used to being able to talk so openly with someone and have them listen, and care what I'm saying and...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Wait!
Pat, what do you want me to do now, huh?
Hello, my name is Rob.
Can I start you out with something to drink?
Some water.
Excuse me?
- I'll have water.
- I'm sorry?
I'll take some fuckin' water, Rob.
Absolutely.
Jeff?
Whoa!
Hey.
- Wow!
- Hi.
What are you doing here?
I'm just...
Lunching it up, you know?
Getting a little bistro action.
I...
Have you ever met my friend, Steve?
This is my brother-in-law, Jeff.
- This is Steve.
- Hey, Jeff, nice to meet you, man.
- My friend Steve.
- Steve.
We were just gonna leave.
Did you still want me to drop you off at your car?
Yep.
Yeah.
So, I'm going to take him to his car, and I'll see you later.
Hope so.
Nice meeting you, Jeff.
Pat, they're coming out...
What the fuck?
Jeff!
They went that way!
Pat!
Well, then, let's go get the car!
- No car!
- What?
No car!
Help me get a cab!
What are you talkin' about?
What happened to the car?
Nothing!
It got towed.
- That's not funny!
- I'm not...
- I know.
I know it's not.
- It's so not funny!
Help me get a cab!
- There's no way to know where they are.
- Great.
What do we do?
I think we should just sit down right here.
And?
And wait.
- For what?
- For a sign.
I'm not gonna sit here and wait for a fucking sign!
Okay, well, then let's walk!
A school bus just drove by!
It's a sign!
What does it mean?
Do we go to a school?
Is my wife fucking some guy in a janitor closet?
I don't think that's it.
I don't think that's it.
- That's not it.
- Good guess.
Now what?
What are you doing?
I'm looking for a credit card slip.
I don't see why.
If I find the slip, I get his last name and then we can look up where he lives and go beat him up.
No, I get it.
I just don't think they throw those things away.
Just shut up and help.
Find it yet?
- How about now?
- That's not helping!
I think we've gotten off track somewhere.
Like I've gotten off track.
Something feels wrong.
Fine.
I'll do it myself, if it'll make you stop talking.
- Is that it?
- No.
It's not.
Oh, God.
What is that?
No, don't do it, Pat.
You don't have to smell it.
Pat.
Okay.
- Hey.
- Hey, Carol.
That was yummy.
What're you doing?
Don't tell anybody else.
What?
Somebody's messing with me.
- Really?
- Yeah, in this office.
- No.
- Yeah.
I got hit by a plane.
- What?
- A little paper plane came into my...
And all these messages were coming to me on my computer.
Kind of...
- Flirty stuff.
- Flirty?
I know someone's playin' some kind of a joke and I think it's those guys that are in the back over there that did the fantasy football.
Oh, my God, those guys are so hot.
That would be so good.
They're young, too.
Do you think it's Henry?
- Henry?
- Yeah.
He's kind of...
Interesting.
He's married, isn't he?
Okay, let's just say it is somebody here.
What does the message say?
Like what are the details?
Well, somethin' about, you know...
What?
That they're a secret admirer.
They said they were...
I think that's kind of hot.
No, it's not.
It's ridiculous.
And I don't like being the butt of a joke.
How do you know it's a joke?
I mean, how many times do we get to get juiced up like this?
This is awesome.
I'm not getting juiced up over a joke.
You're getting attention.
I am super-jelly.
I want attention.
You're impossible.
When was the last time you had a relationship?
Well, my husband, of course.
No way.
Well, I mean, I went out on dates.
Come on.
I've been to the movies.
- It's no wonder you're so cranky.
- I've been bowling...
- I'm not...
- Yeah, you need to get busy.
- You need to get your pipes cleaned.
- You think I'm...
You need to get f...
Yeah.
Well, I won't tell anyone.
Pinky swear.
What else?
What else?
I did hear her say that she felt neglected.
Sounds like they're banging already.
It's possible.
Don't ever get married, dude.
It fucking sucks.
Really?
I think it would be kind of awesome.
Well, it's not.
Okay.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Okay.
I'm sick of walking.
Okay.
Is that what I think it is?
You know, I've been havin' this really weird dream about Dad lately.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He's a teacher.
And...
We're in this classroom with a whole bunch of kids, and we all sit down.
And Dad asks everyone,
"What's the greatest day in the history of the world?"
And one kid is like, "Christmas."
And Dad's like, "No."
And whenever they get the answer wrong, they have to leave the room.
And eventually it's just me and Dad.
And he looks at me and says,
"Pat, what's the greatest day in the history of the world?"
And I don't know, 'cause I'm nervous.
And I'm like, "Dad, I don't know."
And he just looks at me and he smiles and he says...
He says, "Today." He says, "Today."
How'd you know that?
He says, "Today is the greatest day in the history of the world."
Yeah.
I have that dream, Pat.
Except in mine, it's me, you and Dad in his car.
Okay.
I guess it's just something he said to us when we were kids or somethin'.
It's like floating' around in both of our brains.
What is wrong with you?
- Pat.
- What?
What?
What is wrong with you?
Why do you want to be like this?
- What are you talking about?
- We had...
We were havin'...
We're having the same dream!
What the fuck are you talking about?
Why do you want to live like this?
You're drifting through this life with no awareness of how special this is.
You want to talk about what's happening right now, right here?
What's happening right now is that I'm getting lectured by my pothead brother who lives in our mom's basement at 30 years old about how I don't understand the universe!
Hey, here's some understanding for you.
A job and a car and a wife and an apartment!
I got to go.
What?
- I have to go, Pat.
- Where are you going?
You know what?
You wouldn't...
You would laugh at me again.
Jesus Christ.
You see a fucking truck with the word "Kevin" on it and you have to run after it?
Yeah.
I do.
I wish I was that stupid!
You're a dick!
You know what?
I have an asshole for a brother.
It breaks my heart.
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!
- You call me an asshole?
- Yeah, you are an asshole!
You fucking piece of shit!
You drive a fucking Boxster!
Fuck you!
Don't do this, Pat!
Fuck you!
You get down.
Get down on the fucking ground!
Fucking idiot!
You and Mom will never understand me.
And you're all I have left!
Another Jack and Coke?
Nope.
Got to get home.
Old lady, huh?
No, she's boning another dude.
Right on.
Stop the car.
Stop.
Please, stop?
- Hi.
- Hello.
Hey, so, my sister and her husband just got here a little while ago in that red Camry out there.
And...
I need to...
I'm meeting them.
So...
- Okay...
- Actually, it's an emergency.
I have to get her medication, like, right now, so what's her room number?
We have a privacy policy, sir.
I'm sorry, I can't give you her number.
I know it's like policy and everything, but this is a family emergency, so maybe you could just give me the room number...
It'll take me a second to call.
I lied.
It's not an emergency.
It's not a health emergency.
It is a financial emergency.
Their home is about to be foreclosed on and I need to make a payment.
- Just stop.
- Okay.
- You're embarrassing yourself.
- Right.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me?
No, just thank you so much.
Pat!
Pat!
Oh, my God.
Jeff.
- Oh, my God, Pat.
- What the fuck?
I was on the truck.
The truck came here and now you're here.
- This shit is aligned!
- Shut the fuck up.
- What?
- Linda is here, in this hotel somewhere.
- With the guy?
- Yeah, probably with the guy.
Sorry.
How the fuck did you find me?
It was the candy man.
Oh, shit.
He's right there.
Okay, what should we do?
Duck in there.
I'm gigantic!
Come on, let's go.
What do you want to do?
Should we stay?
Should we wait?
Do we just wait, or...
We could wait.
I don't know.
I don't...
Should I call her?
Maybe I call her cell phone right now.
And then, like, act innocent and be like, "What's going on?"
You could try that.
You know, you're not fucking helping at all.
You're just like, "Do you want to do that?"
Do you want to know what I think you should do?
Yeah.
I think you should take a few deep breaths, close your eyes, and focus.
That is like stupid fucking Jeff mumbo-jumbo.
If you have any other idea, even one,
I'll be happy to try it without making fun of you.
Okay, all right.
Okay.
Close your eyes.
What do you see?
I just can't stop picturing what's going on.
What if she's, like, giving him a hand job?
You know, I think they're adults.
It's probably unlikely she's giving him a hand job.
I'm gonna break down the door.
No.
Pat.
I'm gonna break it down.
Listen.
Wait, hold on.
That's a terrible idea.
I've seen you try to do things physically.
I'll do it.
Do you think you can do that?
I wish I could get some sort of running start.
You totally can.
There's, like, hallways.
You run and turn.
Parallel isn't gonna help me.
You could run and turn right at the last second.
I wouldn't...
No.
That's not gonna work.
All right.
One, two, three!
Fuck!
- Run!
- What was that?
- Are you okay?
- Fuck!
Get up!
- Linda!
- Pat!
What are you...
- Pat, don't...
Pat, stop!
- What's going on?
- Steve, let him go!
- Either you're gonna calm down...
- Let him go!
Jeff!
- Don't fucking move!
- What are you doing?
- What the hell is going on?
- We just got here!
- Who are you people?
You, shut up!
Who the fuck is this guy?
He's just a friend, okay?
Calm down.
- There's wine!
- Yeah!
There's a bottle of wine on ice, and a...
What is this?
- That's a...
A sex board?
No, you bring it with the...
Pat!
And your face is flushed, which means you're horny.
- No!
- What the fuck is going on?
Stop yelling and I'll answer all of your questions.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
I'm ready to go home.
Linda, I think you should come with me.
Excuse me!
You should shut the fuck up!
I think that you should go and I'll call you later.
You're not calling this fucking guy.
Linda, do you want me to stay?
- I think you should go.
- You should go!
You need to go!
I'm gonna stay and talk to Pat, okay?
Time for you to go, man.
- Get out, bro!
- All right, Pat.
Get out!
Okay.
Start talking.
Is there anyone else in here?
Well, I'm a little upset, actually,
- and I think that it's understandable!
- I understand that.
Look, what I need to know...
I just need to know one thing, okay?
- Okay.
What?
- Okay.
Are you mad because you came in here and you found me with another man?
Yes.
- Yes.
- Or...
Or are you mad because you're afraid that you might lose me?
What?
There's like a part B now?
Please, don't do that.
It's just semantic bullshit!
- No, it isn't!
It isn't!
- Yeah, it is!
- You really don't know the difference.
- You know what?
Because if you don't understand the difference...
Linda!
Linda.
I'm gonna try to listen to you blabber about whatever this is.
And I'm gonna try to understand your incoherent babble.
Go.
- Why do you always do that?
- What?
- I'm listening.
- No, you're not.
Yeah, I'm trying.
You always just make me feel so stupid!
I'm sorry it's stupid!
I catch you trying to cheat on me and...
You make fun of everything I say.
I'm really just trying to have a conversation with you right now.
This is why our relationship is so fucked.
Because you know what?
When I asked you if you would take me to Cochon you laughed at me.
Who care...
I'm sorry.
That's...
But when I asked Steve, he just, you know, said, let's go.
Yeah, 'cause he wanted to get in your pants!
Well, maybe, but at least he's trying to put in some time and effort!
Let me tell you something about Cochon.
- Cochon is full of assholes...
- You're not even and snobs in fucking turquoise tailored shirts and pink ties, like that asshole!
You want to ask me to take you there?
Fine.
I'll take you to fucking Cochon.
We'll...
- Yeah.
- God, you're not even listening to me.
No, I'm hearing you loud and clear.
You're not!
It's not about the restaurant.
I just want you to, like, care that I want to go there!
And do you think it's about this guy?
Because I really don't even fucking care about him!
He's nice.
- He listens to me.
- I'm nice.
But you and I, we are petty, we are passive-aggressive with each other, we don't even fight!
I mean, this is a miracle right now!
And what I think, honestly, is that we have no house, we have no kids, thank God!
It would be really fucking easy for us to just walk away!
It'd be super simple.
And that is what I think that we should do.
Hang on, hang on.
You know, let's just not, like, let's just not...
Can we not talk about this anymore?
Let's just go home and sleep on it, and, like...
And like...
Forget it.
I'm gonna go stay at my mom's.
Bye, Jeff.
Jeffrey, where are you?
I asked you to call me after you got the wood glue.
I'm at the office.
Let me know what's going on.
Thanks.
Bye.
Oh, please.
It sure is a noisy little thing.
Yeah.
- Eight glasses a day, my doctor says.
- Really?
You're kidding me.
Blow out my biceps trying to lift these cups that many times.
- I'm Barry.
- Sharon.
Nice to meet you.
Same here.
What am I saying?
I know you're Sharon.
I've seen you around.
I really do like flowers.
Yeah?
Like, metaphorically, too.
Symbolically.
All kinds.
Gardenias are my favorite.
I'm not following you.
Excuse me.
It was nice meeting you.
Just stupid.
Sharon?
What's going on?
I think it's over.
What happened?
What?
This is not the way I imagined my life was gonna be.
How did you imagine it?
I was gonna be in the Peace Corps and all that crap, you know, with some guy in an exotic place, all worldly and giving and shit,
and living in a little hut, and taking care of cute little kids
and kissing under waterfalls and stuff, you know.
You can still kiss under waterfalls and stuff like that.
It's like, how many good years do I have left?
I hate my kids right now.
I don't know when that happened.
They were so cute.
I look at the pictures of them, and our family...
Don't cry.
Have some more tissue.
- Don't explain.
Oh, God.
- No.
I just...
Oh, Carol, I'm sorry.
It'll just make it worse.
Don't explain.
But it's not what you think!
Yeah, it is.
I wish that I could
see the world like you.
Really?
I don't know.
You have this, like, belief in this cosmic order.
I really envy that.
You don't want to be like me.
I'm not happy at all.
You know, since Dad died, I've had this...
Had this feeling that it had to be for a reason.
I keep thinking that the signs are all about me, but maybe...
Maybe they're about you and your marriage.
My marriage is not good.
It is a
disaster.
I just want to feel like I love Linda.
And I want to feel like she loves me.
And we both want to, like, be in love.
I miss it and I want it so bad.
I think you should just say that.
To her.
It's not that simple, Jeff.
I don't know.
I think it could be that simple.
I mean, wouldn't you be psyched if Linda walked in here right now and sat down in this tub next to you and said,
"Pat, I want to be in love with you again"?
That would be awesome.
Dude, you need to say that to her.
You need to tell her that right now.
- River Parish.
- I am so sorry.
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
Don't apologize, seriously.
- But I want to.
- It's okay.
No, I just...
It was so weird and didn't come out the way I...
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
It's just that I'm not gay.
But that's okay.
I'm not gay, either.
But you like women.
So?
Well, I like men.
I like men, too.
And to me, it's like, at this point in my life, whether it's a man or a woman, it doesn't matter.
I want someone who gets me.
I feel like I deserve that.
And I think you do, too.
Well, it's important, yes.
But it doesn't mean
I want to sleep with everybody that understands me.
That's all.
No, no, no.
That's not my intention.
Isn't the most important thing finding someone who sees you exactly as you are?
Who gets the Peace Corps and the kissing under waterfalls?
Yeah.
So?
Carol?
Are you there?
Hello?
Shit.
Okay, sorry, everybody.
Just head for the exits!
Single file!
Keep it orderly!
Please!
Close your eyes.
It's clear.
Come on.
There's my car, right here.
Where are we going?
We're all wet.
- I don't know.
What do you think?
- I'm sorry, I don't know.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Let's go to the mall and get drinks with the little umbrellas in them.
Bigger.
Wilder.
I haven't been to New Orleans in 20 years.
How about that?
It's perfect.
Okay, let's go.
Come on out, everybody!
Just come right out.
Shit.
What is this?
It looks like really bad traffic.
Well, I mean in your, you know...
- You mean, like, is it a sign?
- I don't know.
It could be.
- It definitely could be.
- How do I know what to do?
That's the big question, yeah.
It's a constant struggle.
I think you got to go with your gut.
Well, I'm not going to stop now.
Right?
Hey, Pat?
If we don't get a chance to reconnect today,
I'm, like, super proud of you.
Linda!
Sorry.
- Second thoughts?
- Well, I just...
It's okay.
Pat?
Pat!
- I think that's my son.
- Sharon?
What now, my man?
I guess I'll go back.
We'll have to wait for all this traffic to clear.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just...
You ever feel like you're waiting forever to figure out what your destiny is, and then when you do it's not really that exciting?
Linda!
Pat?
Pat!
Linda!
What are you doing here?
I want to be in love again.
What?
Things have gotten way off track.
And weird and shitty.
And I'm a big part of that, and I'm really sorry for it.
- Pat!
- What?
Honey, what's happening?
What's the matter?
- Why are you running down...
- Mom?
What's going...
Oh, hi.
- Wait, what are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
How did you get here?
In Carol's...
This is Carol.
Hi.
I'm Linda.
Nice to meet you.
Jeff...
Jeff's here?
Whoa, hey!
Did you see that?
Is he okay?
Is he okay?
Yeah, we're here.
A car just went off the bridge.
There's people inside of it.
Somebody jumped in!
Wait!
Our dad's still down there!
Fuck.
Come on.
Help!
Help us!
Dad!
Help!
Come on, girls!
Come on.
Swim hard!
Come on, honey!
Give me your hand.
That a girl.
Come on.
- Get back there.
- Dad?
Hey, the car's going down!
The car's sinking!
Dad!
Jeff!
Dad!
Come on, Dad!
We need some help over here.
Pat?
Over here!
Over here!
Pat!
- Jeff!
- Jeff!
Help!
Help!
Man in the water!
Help!
Two survivors in sight.
Five feet off the first cleat.
Coming into the dive deck.
Hurry!
Get a hold of him!
One, two, three!
Jeff!
We have an unresponsive person!
He's not moving!
Call the command center!
Have an ambulance meet us at the pier!
- Jeff!
- Sir, we got to help him.
We got him.
Do something!
Jesus!
Sir, sir.
Jeff!
- He's not moving!
- Starting CPR!
Get off me!
Leave me alone!
You need to sit down!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
Jeff, wake up!
- Jeff!
- Still not responding.
Can you hear me?
Hey, hey, you okay?
Hey.
Sir?
- Are you okay?
- Oh, God.
Let's get blankets!
Sir, stay still.
Let me sit up.
What happened?
Everything.
I'm hungry.
And coming up next, the story of two girls, their father, and the man who was in the right place at the right time.
The car that was behind us crashed into the back of us and then we went over the bridge.
And then this man, he just came and broke our window...
And he almost died doing it.
If we had lost our dad, you know, I just really can't even imagine it.
We're just really thankful he was there.
We'll be right back with that rescue tale of local councilman Kevin Landry and his two little girls.
All that and more when we come back.
I watched Signs again last night.
It keeps getting better every time I see it.
It's funny.
The first time you watch it, it's hard to understand what it's about.
It just sort of meanders.
And then, everything comes together in this one perfect moment at the end.
And when you watch it a second or a third or a fourth time, you start to see that all of this randomness
is leading towards a perfect moment.
My favorite character is the little girl.
Everyone thinks she's so strange because she can't finish a glass of water.
She's convinced they're contaminated.
So, by the end of the film, there are glasses of water littered around this house.
And then, it's the water that saves them.
And that was fate.
I can't help but wonder about my fate.
About my destiny.
Renewal.
Vitality.
Energy.

Hello?
Yo, Kevin.
No, this is Jeff.
Where Kevin at?
I don't know.
Oh, man, look, don't be fucking around!
Where the fuck is Kevin?
Kevin doesn't live here.
There's always some motherfucker trying to tell me there ain't no Kevin!
Let me put this word in your fucking peanut brain, Kevin!
K-E-V-l-N!
Kevin.
What are you doing?
Doing this.
Some strawbs, hand-sliced.
A white rose of whipped cream.
Bam!
Bon appétit.
What's the special occasion?
This is one of those "just because" breakfasts, you know?
It sounds corny, but relationships are like flowers and flowers need water to bloom.
Consider this sprinkling from a watering can.
Well, thanks.
- That's nice.
- You're welcome.
Enjoy.
Oh, my gosh.
I got some good news, actually.
Yeah?
I got a phone call from Randy.
Is he the guy that we talked to at that barbecue?
Oh, no, that's a different Randy.
- But that guy's name was Randy, right?
- Yes.
I liked his wife.
Different Randy.
- We should have them over.
- Yeah.
This is Randy at Millennium Porsche.
Can I tell you something?
With no money down, this thing is practically free.
Pat!
No!
Whoa, whoa.
Don't start with no.
- That's what this is.
- Don't start with no.
You're just, like, in this mindset.
And you're not even...
It's not a mindset.
We don't have the money.
Yeah.
That's the mindset I'm talking about.
Honey, look, I'm trying to be really careful, and I've cut back on some things.
And, like, we promised we were going to get a house this year...
I'm just trying to be a grown-up about this.
Surprise.
We got it.
This is happening.
Look...
Everything you just said about the house, you know, our future, you're exactly right.
And I'm so lucky to have you looking out for us in that way.
But I'm looking out for us in another way.
I'm looking out for...
That intangible thing that every couple needs.
It's a little bit of magic, and a little bit of danger, frankly.
This is gonna solve a lot of our problems.
This tension right now.
As soon as you get in that thing and you feel the energy and you feel it rumble in your gut.
If you don't get turned on, you're made of stone.
Where is it?
It's in the driveway.
Are you...
Is this...
Oh, come on.
Okay, okay...
That's...
Hello?
- Mom?
- Jeff.
Hi.
You know, you're supposed to say "hello" when you pick up the phone.
Yeah, I know.
I thought that maybe you were somebody else, but you're not.
What do you do in the basement?
You're not cleaning it.
You really want to know?
You didn't like it last time we had this conversation.
Okay, no.
You know what?
You're right.
I don't.
Did you get the wood glue?
What are you talking about?
I left you a note on the kitchen counter.
I haven't been upstairs.
One of the shutters on the pantry is broken and I need you to fix it.
You know what, I'm kind of busy right now, so...
All I want for my birthday is for you to get your ass off that couch, and you get on the bus
- and you go to the Home Depot.
- I'm not on the couch.
You come home and fix the shutter before I get home, or you're gonna find someplace else to live.
- Fine.
- Fine.
Good.
You got it?
Do you understand?
Yes, Mom!
Okay!
Love you!
Goodbye.
Did you hang up on me?
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.
Stop the bus.
Can you please stop the bus?
Sorry.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Can I help you, sir?
No.
What?
Pass the ball!
Go, go, go!
Shit, you a'ight?
Get your big ass up, man.
You bleeding and shit?
- He out, man.
- We need another person.
We need one!
You got next.
Who, him?
He gonna be a ref?
That's all we got.
That's all we got.
Let's see what he got.
Let's go, dawg.
Get out here.
Oh, he's passing now.
Right there, dawg.
What's your problem?
That's your man.
Why don't you play some D, man?
Right, right, right.
Hell, no!
You working on this?
Come on, man.
Go, go, go, go.
I'm Jeff.
Kevin.
Ke...
Kevin.
Is your name Kevin Kevin?
No.
So, that's your first name on your jersey?
Yeah, that's my name.
Yeah.
Do you live around here?
Yeah, I don't live far from here.
You obviously don't live around here, though.
No, I was just strolling around today.
It was a nice day, so I thought I'd walk around.
Were you following me, or...
No.
I mean, no.
I saw you on the bus.
Let me explain.
Have you ever seen the movie Signs?
With Mel Gibson and Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin?
Nah, I don't think I have.
I got a phone call this morning.
Someone was asking for Kevin.
But there's no Kevin who lives with me.
It's kind of a common name.
Yeah.
I guess that's true.
I mean, you never got a call, like someone called the wrong house phone?
What if there's no wrong numbers?
Maybe it's always the right house phone.
Everything happens for a reason, right?
Exactly.
No, that's exactly it.
Hey, man, I'm about to go put something in the air real quick.
I don't know if you want to come.
I don't...
I'm sorry...
I don't know what that means.
Smoke weed?
You want to smoke weed with me?
Yeah, man.
I like weed.
Yeah, I can see that.
Wow.
It's nice in here.
- That's nice.
- Yeah.
Oh, shit.
That's a treat.
Check his pockets!
Sorry, Jeff.
Marriage is a compromise.
She got what she wanted, I'm living here in Baton Rouge.
So I get a little somethin'-somethin'.
- Right?
- Sure.
Yeah.
Thank you.
You know what's up.
I got to take this...
It's a business call.
Sweetheart, can I get another Bud Light.
Do you want more wings?
Whatever.
Fine.
I will get glue and fix your shutter.
No.
It is Jeff's responsibility.
That is the point.
He has to do it, not you.
Jeff has to do it.
Okay.
What are you...
Why are you calling me?
Maybe you could get him moving a little bit.
Do you understand?
He's stuck, honey.
He's stuck.
He's 30!
He had a difficult adolescent period.
You of all people would know neither of us had a very easy adolescent period.
- You were older.
- What does that have to do with it?
When you're an adult, you take responsibility for your life.
Okay?
But you're brothers.
You love each other, don't you?
You know, fake it for a little bit just to get...
You know.
Maybe he'll grow on you.
We don't do that, Mom.
We don't spend time together.
Well, Pat, could you at least try?
It's my birthday.
I gotta call you back.
- No, no, no, Pat...
- Bye.
Damn it.
Asshole.
Jeff!
Pat?
What the hell are you doing here?
Kevin beat me up.
I walked.
Who's Kevin?
Some kid I was following.
Well, if he's a kid, how come you didn't kick his ass?
Because I don't believe in fighting, Pat.
And you know that.
Right.
I forgot.
You're a pussy.
Look, Mom called and she's really pissed.
Was Gandhi a pussy?
Yeah, Gandhi was a pussy.
And once again, I have to pick up your slack.
Well, it's not your problem.
Well, it becomes my problem when Mom calls me in the middle of a business meeting.
Yeah?
You're having a business meeting at Hooters?
Yeah.
Yes.
That's very classy.
Right.
Well, business is business.
So, come on.
Get in the car.
Hey!
You don't need to grab onto me.
I'm a little bit conflicted right now, that's all.
About what?
You're just gonna make fun of me, man.
Let's go.
Try me.
I want to learn how you think because I want to free my mind.
Let me try to explain it to you maybe in terms that you would understand.
- Okay.
- This morning
I was meant to have a business meeting with the Kevins.
And destiny.
And now you're here at this weird Hooters thing...
And so now I'm just trying to figure out how to proceed.
What you just said sounded like Yoda took acid and stumbled into a business meeting.
You can make all the fun of Yoda that you want,
Yoda would be fucking killer in a business meeting.
Whatever, man.
Come on!
Let's go.
Get in the Porsche.
Shit!
Hey, I think your Porsche got a ticket, Pat.
Shut up, Jeff.
Just get in the car.
This Porsche is tiny.
The Porsche is normal-sized.
You're a sasquatch.
Are those workout gloves?
I don't think so.
They came with the car so...
Check this out.
You see where those cars are stopping up ahead?
Yeah.
I should probably stop pretty soon, right?
Pat, slow down.
What?
I can't hear you!
Bose surround sound!
Hey, stop it, dude.
This is not funny.
- Count to three and I'll stop.
- Pat, please stop.
Count of three!
One!
Two!
- Pat, look out!
- Three!
Curb!
Curb!
Shit!
Yes!
Will you please stop the car?
It handles better at high speeds!
- Stop the car!
- Shut up!
Tree!
Tree!
Pat?
Fuck!
Wow.
Yeah, that's real bad.
Oh, shit.
What the fuck?
He looks mad.
Are you on drugs?
How many beers have you had?
Shut up, Jeff.
Shut up.
Did you not see that damn tree?
Whatever you do, don't say a word.
Stay in the fucking car.
I am fine, yes.
Thank you for asking.
Burt, should we call an ambulance?
Hi.
There was a pedestrian child in the street and in order to avoid killing it,
I had to swerve and maneuver onto your sidewalk, at which point I lost control of my vehicle and I've hit your tree here.
We can see that.
Do you think we're blind?
No.
Of course not.
I just would like to apologize.
Is he okay?
Yeah, he's fine.
Just a little stunned.
I think that one's hurt.
Maybe we should call the police.
He's fine.
He's okay.
That child's not moving.
Ma'am, he's okay.
Jeff, will you get out of the car?
Yeah.
Get out of the car.
Show her that you're fine.
See?
Live and limber.
- Baby, are you sure you're all right?
- Look at that.
- I am fine, thank you.
- Look at that.
Good as new.
You remind me of my grandson.
Is his name Kevin, by any chance?
Brian, why?
No reason, ma'am.
Do you think there's any way that you and I can take care of this ourselves?
I really don't want to hang out here all afternoon with the cops.
I don't know...
There's some bark off that tree.
It might have ruined the tree, baby.
Whoa.
Is that Linda?
Give me 500 bucks, and we'll call it even.
Excuse me?
No "excuse me," man.
Look at my tree here.
That's a 200-year-old tree.
Might have to do some landscaping.
I'll probably have to bring a tractor in here and a backhoe and dig all this stuff up.
It's a tree!
Have you been drinking?
No.
Why don't we just let the police decide that.
Call 911.
- $100.
- Times five.
- $150.
- Plus $350.
- Fine.
Call the police.
- Call 911.
God damn it!
You take a check?
Yeah.
No problem.
Oh, good.
Boy, he's got some nerve, don't he?
Trying to negotiate with you about our tree.
He come in my yard, hit my tree.
You look at that tree and he don't think he owes me.
Who's that guy she's with?
Get in the car, Jeff.
It was very, very quick and it could have been somebody...
She was wearing a peach dress that she wore this morning, okay?
And they got into our car!
Man, something really big is happening here.
Yeah, no shit, Jeff!
My wife is having an affair!
We don't know that yet.
Let's follow this and see where this leads.
Well, I'm trying to, but I can't see dick so it's kind of hard.
Go!
Go!
Go, go!
Hang on.
- I see them!
- Where?
They're just up here to the left!
There they are!
Pat.
What the fuck are you doing?
You told me to hurry!
Tell me before you swerve so I don't fall off the fucking car!
Okay.
Whatever, just focus on the road!
Where are they going?
They're turning up there!
What street?
South Clark!
South Clark!
They're going to Cochon!
Damn it!
Let me tell you about Cochon.
It's full of A-holes who look down on everybody that's not, like, part of the cool-guy club.
It's so lame.
Look at this, no parking.
I can wait with the car.
No.
I got it.
Pat, there's a fire hydrant!
There's a fire hydrant right here.
I got it.
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
Come on.
Let's go.
Okay, what we got here is a friendly lunch.
It could be a coworker.
It could be a long-lost cousin.
She hates her coworkers and I know her whole family.
We got to hear what they're saying.
Well, body language can tell you a lot, man.
- You're going in there.
- What, me?
Yeah.
I'm not really dressed properly, Pat.
Why don't you just go in there and talk to her?
This could all be a huge misunderstanding.
If I talk to her, she's just gonna deny it.
Why wouldn't she tell you the truth?
Oh, my God.
You have no idea how adult relationships work, do you?
You haven't had a girlfriend since high school.
- So?
So?
- So?
So...
I need to find out exactly what's going on so I'll have the upper hand later.
Do you still love Linda?
There's an empty booth next to them.
Okay?
Just sneak in with my phone.
Here's a little grease money.
Okay.
Get in there, do what you got to do.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- How do you do?
Lovely.
- Fine, thank you.
Can I help you?
Table for one, please.
- Right this way.
- Great.
Thank you.
- Oh, miss?
- Yes?
Could I sit there?
Those tables are saved for two patrons.
- Right.
- Right this way.
Miss?
You know what?
Excuse me.
There are going to be two patrons.
There will be two patrons.
You said table of one.
I meant that more like in the bistro sense, like one plus another one?
Well, just in case, I think this table back here would be quite lovely for you guys.
What if I grease you?
I'm sorry?
I have money.
There's two fives, some ones.
There's a 20.
If I could just sit at that table.
I can't explain.
But it's really important.
I mean, I honestly don't even feel like he really likes me.
Well, that's his problem.
I mean...
From where I stand, there's plenty to like.
Thank you, Steve.
You're a really good listener.
Thank you.
It's such a treat.
I'm just being myself.
Don't say anything.
She might recognize your voice.
If you can hear me, give me a thumbs-up.
Okay, now take the talking part of the phone and hold it, but keep it low, don't let them see.
I really don't think that you want to hear this.
Jeff, just do it!
Okay?
Stop talking so I can hear what's going on.
I can't.
Honestly, I lost a lot of friends because of Pat.
'Cause my friends just don't like him.
I think a little bit's my fault, 'cause I would complain a lot to them and...
For a really long time, I've felt like he and I are...
I don't know...
We got, like, weirdly competitive with each other.
We just never communicate.
He just never listens, ever.
Gosh.
I shouldn't even be talking about this but we haven't had sex in...
I mean, over two months.
That's a long time.
And I think, kind of, what's worse than that is that it's so awkward.
Well, having sex is one thing but making love is something else, right?
What does that even mean?
Thank you, Steve.
I'm not used to being able to talk so openly with someone and have them listen, and care what I'm saying and...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Wait!
Pat, what do you want me to do now, huh?
Hello, my name is Rob.
Can I start you out with something to drink?
Some water.
Excuse me?
- I'll have water.
- I'm sorry?
I'll take some fuckin' water, Rob.
Absolutely.
Jeff?
Whoa!
Hey.
- Wow!
- Hi.
What are you doing here?
I'm just...
Lunching it up, you know?
Getting a little bistro action.
I...
Have you ever met my friend, Steve?
This is my brother-in-law, Jeff.
- This is Steve.
- Hey, Jeff, nice to meet you, man.
- My friend Steve.
- Steve.
We were just gonna leave.
Did you still want me to drop you off at your car?
Yep.
Yeah.
So, I'm going to take him to his car, and I'll see you later.
Hope so.
Nice meeting you, Jeff.
Pat, they're coming out...
What the fuck?
Jeff!
They went that way!
Pat!
Well, then, let's go get the car!
- No car!
- What?
No car!
Help me get a cab!
What are you talkin' about?
What happened to the car?
Nothing!
It got towed.
- That's not funny!
- I'm not...
- I know.
I know it's not.
- It's so not funny!
Help me get a cab!
- There's no way to know where they are.
- Great.
What do we do?
I think we should just sit down right here.
And?
And wait.
- For what?
- For a sign.
I'm not gonna sit here and wait for a fucking sign!
Okay, well, then let's walk!
A school bus just drove by!
It's a sign!
What does it mean?
Do we go to a school?
Is my wife fucking some guy in a janitor closet?
I don't think that's it.
I don't think that's it.
- That's not it.
- Good guess.
Now what?
What are you doing?
I'm looking for a credit card slip.
I don't see why.
If I find the slip, I get his last name and then we can look up where he lives and go beat him up.
No, I get it.
I just don't think they throw those things away.
Just shut up and help.
Find it yet?
- How about now?
- That's not helping!
I think we've gotten off track somewhere.
Like I've gotten off track.
Something feels wrong.
Fine.
I'll do it myself, if it'll make you stop talking.
- Is that it?
- No.
It's not.
Oh, God.
What is that?
No, don't do it, Pat.
You don't have to smell it.
Pat.
Okay.
- Hey.
- Hey, Carol.
That was yummy.
What're you doing?
Don't tell anybody else.
What?
Somebody's messing with me.
- Really?
- Yeah, in this office.
- No.
- Yeah.
I got hit by a plane.
- What?
- A little paper plane came into my...
And all these messages were coming to me on my computer.
Kind of...
- Flirty stuff.
- Flirty?
I know someone's playin' some kind of a joke and I think it's those guys that are in the back over there that did the fantasy football.
Oh, my God, those guys are so hot.
That would be so good.
They're young, too.
Do you think it's Henry?
- Henry?
- Yeah.
He's kind of...
Interesting.
He's married, isn't he?
Okay, let's just say it is somebody here.
What does the message say?
Like what are the details?
Well, somethin' about, you know...
What?
That they're a secret admirer.
They said they were...
I think that's kind of hot.
No, it's not.
It's ridiculous.
And I don't like being the butt of a joke.
How do you know it's a joke?
I mean, how many times do we get to get juiced up like this?
This is awesome.
I'm not getting juiced up over a joke.
You're getting attention.
I am super-jelly.
I want attention.
You're impossible.
When was the last time you had a relationship?
Well, my husband, of course.
No way.
Well, I mean, I went out on dates.
Come on.
I've been to the movies.
- It's no wonder you're so cranky.
- I've been bowling...
- I'm not...
- Yeah, you need to get busy.
- You need to get your pipes cleaned.
- You think I'm...
You need to get f...
Yeah.
Well, I won't tell anyone.
Pinky swear.
What else?
What else?
I did hear her say that she felt neglected.
Sounds like they're banging already.
It's possible.
Don't ever get married, dude.
It fucking sucks.
Really?
I think it would be kind of awesome.
Well, it's not.
Okay.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Okay.
I'm sick of walking.
Okay.
Is that what I think it is?
You know, I've been havin' this really weird dream about Dad lately.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He's a teacher.
And...
We're in this classroom with a whole bunch of kids, and we all sit down.
And Dad asks everyone,
"What's the greatest day in the history of the world?"
And one kid is like, "Christmas."
And Dad's like, "No."
And whenever they get the answer wrong, they have to leave the room.
And eventually it's just me and Dad.
And he looks at me and says,
"Pat, what's the greatest day in the history of the world?"
And I don't know, 'cause I'm nervous.
And I'm like, "Dad, I don't know."
And he just looks at me and he smiles and he says...
He says, "Today." He says, "Today."
How'd you know that?
He says, "Today is the greatest day in the history of the world."
Yeah.
I have that dream, Pat.
Except in mine, it's me, you and Dad in his car.
Okay.
I guess it's just something he said to us when we were kids or somethin'.
It's like floating' around in both of our brains.
What is wrong with you?
- Pat.
- What?
What?
What is wrong with you?
Why do you want to be like this?
- What are you talking about?
- We had...
We were havin'...
We're having the same dream!
What the fuck are you talking about?
Why do you want to live like this?
You're drifting through this life with no awareness of how special this is.
You want to talk about what's happening right now, right here?
What's happening right now is that I'm getting lectured by my pothead brother who lives in our mom's basement at 30 years old about how I don't understand the universe!
Hey, here's some understanding for you.
A job and a car and a wife and an apartment!
I got to go.
What?
- I have to go, Pat.
- Where are you going?
You know what?
You wouldn't...
You would laugh at me again.
Jesus Christ.
You see a fucking truck with the word "Kevin" on it and you have to run after it?
Yeah.
I do.
I wish I was that stupid!
You're a dick!
You know what?
I have an asshole for a brother.
It breaks my heart.
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!
- You call me an asshole?
- Yeah, you are an asshole!
You fucking piece of shit!
You drive a fucking Boxster!
Fuck you!
Don't do this, Pat!
Fuck you!
You get down.
Get down on the fucking ground!
Fucking idiot!
You and Mom will never understand me.
And you're all I have left!
Another Jack and Coke?
Nope.
Got to get home.
Old lady, huh?
No, she's boning another dude.
Right on.
Stop the car.
Stop.
Please, stop?
- Hi.
- Hello.
Hey, so, my sister and her husband just got here a little while ago in that red Camry out there.
And...
I need to...
I'm meeting them.
So...
- Okay...
- Actually, it's an emergency.
I have to get her medication, like, right now, so what's her room number?
We have a privacy policy, sir.
I'm sorry, I can't give you her number.
I know it's like policy and everything, but this is a family emergency, so maybe you could just give me the room number...
It'll take me a second to call.
I lied.
It's not an emergency.
It's not a health emergency.
It is a financial emergency.
Their home is about to be foreclosed on and I need to make a payment.
- Just stop.
- Okay.
- You're embarrassing yourself.
- Right.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me?
No, just thank you so much.
Pat!
Pat!
Oh, my God.
Jeff.
- Oh, my God, Pat.
- What the fuck?
I was on the truck.
The truck came here and now you're here.
- This shit is aligned!
- Shut the fuck up.
- What?
- Linda is here, in this hotel somewhere.
- With the guy?
- Yeah, probably with the guy.
Sorry.
How the fuck did you find me?
It was the candy man.
Oh, shit.
He's right there.
Okay, what should we do?
Duck in there.
I'm gigantic!
Come on, let's go.
What do you want to do?
Should we stay?
Should we wait?
Do we just wait, or...
We could wait.
I don't know.
I don't...
Should I call her?
Maybe I call her cell phone right now.
And then, like, act innocent and be like, "What's going on?"
You could try that.
You know, you're not fucking helping at all.
You're just like, "Do you want to do that?"
Do you want to know what I think you should do?
Yeah.
I think you should take a few deep breaths, close your eyes, and focus.
That is like stupid fucking Jeff mumbo-jumbo.
If you have any other idea, even one,
I'll be happy to try it without making fun of you.
Okay, all right.
Okay.
Close your eyes.
What do you see?
I just can't stop picturing what's going on.
What if she's, like, giving him a hand job?
You know, I think they're adults.
It's probably unlikely she's giving him a hand job.
I'm gonna break down the door.
No.
Pat.
I'm gonna break it down.
Listen.
Wait, hold on.
That's a terrible idea.
I've seen you try to do things physically.
I'll do it.
Do you think you can do that?
I wish I could get some sort of running start.
You totally can.
There's, like, hallways.
You run and turn.
Parallel isn't gonna help me.
You could run and turn right at the last second.
I wouldn't...
No.
That's not gonna work.
All right.
One, two, three!
Fuck!
- Run!
- What was that?
- Are you okay?
- Fuck!
Get up!
- Linda!
- Pat!
What are you...
- Pat, don't...
Pat, stop!
- What's going on?
- Steve, let him go!
- Either you're gonna calm down...
- Let him go!
Jeff!
- Don't fucking move!
- What are you doing?
- What the hell is going on?
- We just got here!
- Who are you people?
You, shut up!
Who the fuck is this guy?
He's just a friend, okay?
Calm down.
- There's wine!
- Yeah!
There's a bottle of wine on ice, and a...
What is this?
- That's a...
A sex board?
No, you bring it with the...
Pat!
And your face is flushed, which means you're horny.
- No!
- What the fuck is going on?
Stop yelling and I'll answer all of your questions.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
I'm ready to go home.
Linda, I think you should come with me.
Excuse me!
You should shut the fuck up!
I think that you should go and I'll call you later.
You're not calling this fucking guy.
Linda, do you want me to stay?
- I think you should go.
- You should go!
You need to go!
I'm gonna stay and talk to Pat, okay?
Time for you to go, man.
- Get out, bro!
- All right, Pat.
Get out!
Okay.
Start talking.
Is there anyone else in here?
Well, I'm a little upset, actually,
- and I think that it's understandable!
- I understand that.
Look, what I need to know...
I just need to know one thing, okay?
- Okay.
What?
- Okay.
Are you mad because you came in here and you found me with another man?
Yes.
- Yes.
- Or...
Or are you mad because you're afraid that you might lose me?
What?
There's like a part B now?
Please, don't do that.
It's just semantic bullshit!
- No, it isn't!
It isn't!
- Yeah, it is!
- You really don't know the difference.
- You know what?
Because if you don't understand the difference...
Linda!
Linda.
I'm gonna try to listen to you blabber about whatever this is.
And I'm gonna try to understand your incoherent babble.
Go.
- Why do you always do that?
- What?
- I'm listening.
- No, you're not.
Yeah, I'm trying.
You always just make me feel so stupid!
I'm sorry it's stupid!
I catch you trying to cheat on me and...
You make fun of everything I say.
I'm really just trying to have a conversation with you right now.
This is why our relationship is so fucked.
Because you know what?
When I asked you if you would take me to Cochon you laughed at me.
Who care...
I'm sorry.
That's...
But when I asked Steve, he just, you know, said, let's go.
Yeah, 'cause he wanted to get in your pants!
Well, maybe, but at least he's trying to put in some time and effort!
Let me tell you something about Cochon.
- Cochon is full of assholes...
- You're not even and snobs in fucking turquoise tailored shirts and pink ties, like that asshole!
You want to ask me to take you there?
Fine.
I'll take you to fucking Cochon.
We'll...
- Yeah.
- God, you're not even listening to me.
No, I'm hearing you loud and clear.
You're not!
It's not about the restaurant.
I just want you to, like, care that I want to go there!
And do you think it's about this guy?
Because I really don't even fucking care about him!
He's nice.
- He listens to me.
- I'm nice.
But you and I, we are petty, we are passive-aggressive with each other, we don't even fight!
I mean, this is a miracle right now!
And what I think, honestly, is that we have no house, we have no kids, thank God!
It would be really fucking easy for us to just walk away!
It'd be super simple.
And that is what I think that we should do.
Hang on, hang on.
You know, let's just not, like, let's just not...
Can we not talk about this anymore?
Let's just go home and sleep on it, and, like...
And like...
Forget it.
I'm gonna go stay at my mom's.
Bye, Jeff.
Jeffrey, where are you?
I asked you to call me after you got the wood glue.
I'm at the office.
Let me know what's going on.
Thanks.
Bye.
Oh, please.
It sure is a noisy little thing.
Yeah.
- Eight glasses a day, my doctor says.
- Really?
You're kidding me.
Blow out my biceps trying to lift these cups that many times.
- I'm Barry.
- Sharon.
Nice to meet you.
Same here.
What am I saying?
I know you're Sharon.
I've seen you around.
I really do like flowers.
Yeah?
Like, metaphorically, too.
Symbolically.
All kinds.
Gardenias are my favorite.
I'm not following you.
Excuse me.
It was nice meeting you.
Just stupid.
Sharon?
What's going on?
I think it's over.
What happened?
What?
This is not the way I imagined my life was gonna be.
How did you imagine it?
I was gonna be in the Peace Corps and all that crap, you know, with some guy in an exotic place, all worldly and giving and shit,
and living in a little hut, and taking care of cute little kids
and kissing under waterfalls and stuff, you know.
You can still kiss under waterfalls and stuff like that.
It's like, how many good years do I have left?
I hate my kids right now.
I don't know when that happened.
They were so cute.
I look at the pictures of them, and our family...
Don't cry.
Have some more tissue.
- Don't explain.
Oh, God.
- No.
I just...
Oh, Carol, I'm sorry.
It'll just make it worse.
Don't explain.
But it's not what you think!
Yeah, it is.
I wish that I could
see the world like you.
Really?
I don't know.
You have this, like, belief in this cosmic order.
I really envy that.
You don't want to be like me.
I'm not happy at all.
You know, since Dad died, I've had this...
Had this feeling that it had to be for a reason.
I keep thinking that the signs are all about me, but maybe...
Maybe they're about you and your marriage.
My marriage is not good.
It is a
disaster.
I just want to feel like I love Linda.
And I want to feel like she loves me.
And we both want to, like, be in love.
I miss it and I want it so bad.
I think you should just say that.
To her.
It's not that simple, Jeff.
I don't know.
I think it could be that simple.
I mean, wouldn't you be psyched if Linda walked in here right now and sat down in this tub next to you and said,
"Pat, I want to be in love with you again"?
That would be awesome.
Dude, you need to say that to her.
You need to tell her that right now.
- River Parish.
- I am so sorry.
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
Don't apologize, seriously.
- But I want to.
- It's okay.
No, I just...
It was so weird and didn't come out the way I...
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
It's just that I'm not gay.
But that's okay.
I'm not gay, either.
But you like women.
So?
Well, I like men.
I like men, too.
And to me, it's like, at this point in my life, whether it's a man or a woman, it doesn't matter.
I want someone who gets me.
I feel like I deserve that.
And I think you do, too.
Well, it's important, yes.
But it doesn't mean
I want to sleep with everybody that understands me.
That's all.
No, no, no.
That's not my intention.
Isn't the most important thing finding someone who sees you exactly as you are?
Who gets the Peace Corps and the kissing under waterfalls?
Yeah.
So?
Carol?
Are you there?
Hello?
Shit.
Okay, sorry, everybody.
Just head for the exits!
Single file!
Keep it orderly!
Please!
Close your eyes.
It's clear.
Come on.
There's my car, right here.
Where are we going?
We're all wet.
- I don't know.
What do you think?
- I'm sorry, I don't know.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Let's go to the mall and get drinks with the little umbrellas in them.
Bigger.
Wilder.
I haven't been to New Orleans in 20 years.
How about that?
It's perfect.
Okay, let's go.
Come on out, everybody!
Just come right out.
Shit.
What is this?
It looks like really bad traffic.
Well, I mean in your, you know...
- You mean, like, is it a sign?
- I don't know.
It could be.
- It definitely could be.
- How do I know what to do?
That's the big question, yeah.
It's a constant struggle.
I think you got to go with your gut.
Well, I'm not going to stop now.
Right?
Hey, Pat?
If we don't get a chance to reconnect today,
I'm, like, super proud of you.
Linda!
Sorry.
- Second thoughts?
- Well, I just...
It's okay.
Pat?
Pat!
- I think that's my son.
- Sharon?
What now, my man?
I guess I'll go back.
We'll have to wait for all this traffic to clear.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just...
You ever feel like you're waiting forever to figure out what your destiny is, and then when you do it's not really that exciting?
Linda!
Pat?
Pat!
Linda!
What are you doing here?
I want to be in love again.
What?
Things have gotten way off track.
And weird and shitty.
And I'm a big part of that, and I'm really sorry for it.
- Pat!
- What?
Honey, what's happening?
What's the matter?
- Why are you running down...
- Mom?
What's going...
Oh, hi.
- Wait, what are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
How did you get here?
In Carol's...
This is Carol.
Hi.
I'm Linda.
Nice to meet you.
Jeff...
Jeff's here?
Whoa, hey!
Did you see that?
Is he okay?
Is he okay?
Yeah, we're here.
A car just went off the bridge.
There's people inside of it.
Somebody jumped in!
Wait!
Our dad's still down there!
Fuck.
Come on.
Help!
Help us!
Dad!
Help!
Come on, girls!
Come on.
Swim hard!
Come on, honey!
Give me your hand.
That a girl.
Come on.
- Get back there.
- Dad?
Hey, the car's going down!
The car's sinking!
Dad!
Jeff!
Dad!
Come on, Dad!
We need some help over here.
Pat?
Over here!
Over here!
Pat!
- Jeff!
- Jeff!
Help!
Help!
Man in the water!
Help!
Two survivors in sight.
Five feet off the first cleat.
Coming into the dive deck.
Hurry!
Get a hold of him!
One, two, three!
Jeff!
We have an unresponsive person!
He's not moving!
Call the command center!
Have an ambulance meet us at the pier!
- Jeff!
- Sir, we got to help him.
We got him.
Do something!
Jesus!
Sir, sir.
Jeff!
- He's not moving!
- Starting CPR!
Get off me!
Leave me alone!
You need to sit down!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
Jeff, wake up!
- Jeff!
- Still not responding.
Can you hear me?
Hey, hey, you okay?
Hey.
Sir?
- Are you okay?
- Oh, God.
Let's get blankets!
Sir, stay still.
Let me sit up.
What happened?
Everything.
I'm hungry.
And coming up next, the story of two girls, their father, and the man who was in the right place at the right time.
The car that was behind us crashed into the back of us and then we went over the bridge.
And then this man, he just came and broke our window...
And he almost died doing it.
If we had lost our dad, you know, I just really can't even imagine it.
We're just really thankful he was there.
We'll be right back with that rescue tale of local councilman Kevin Landry and his two little girls.
All that and more when we come back.
I watched Signs again last night...
It keeps getting better every time I see it.
It's funny.
The first time you watch it, it's hard to understand what it's about.
It just sort of meanders.
And then, everything comes together in this one perfect moment at the end.
And when you watch it a second or a third or a fourth time, you start to see that all of this randomness
is leading towards a perfect moment.
My favorite character is the little girl.
Everyone thinks she's so strange because she can't finish a glass of water.
She's convinced they're contaminated.
So, by the end of the film, there are glasses of water littered around this house.
And then, it's the water that saves them.
And that was fate.
I can't help but wonder about my fate.
About my destiny.
Renewal.
Vitality.
Energy...
Are you tired of feeling sluggish?
Do you feel like life is passing you by?
Then we've got the solution for you.
It's called "The Most Incredible Vitamin In The World"
and there's a reason you're watching this right now.
Just pick up the phone and start the new chapter to your life.
Call now.
Not available in stores.
Made in Germany.
Beware of imitators.
Call 1-800...
Hello?
Yo, Kevin.
No, this is Jeff.
Where Kevin at?
I don't know.
Oh, man, look, don't be fucking around!
Where the fuck is Kevin?
Kevin doesn't live here.
There's always some motherfucker trying to tell me there ain't no Kevin!
Let me put this word in your fucking peanut brain, Kevin!
K-E-V-I-N!
Kevi n
What are you doing?
Doing this.
Some strawbs, hand-sliced.
A white rose of whipped cream.
Bam!
Bon appétit.
What's the special occasion?
This is one of those "just because" breakfasts, you know?
It sounds corny, but relationships are like flowers and flowers need water to bloom.
Consider this sprinkling from a watering can.
Well, thanks.
- That's nice.
- You're welcome.
Enjoy.
Oh, my gosh.
I got some good news, actually.
Yeah?
I got a phone call from Randy.
Is he the guy that we talked to at that barbecue?
Oh, no, that's a different Randy.
- But that guy's name was Randy, right?
- Yes.
I liked his wife.
Different Randy.
- We should have them over.
- Yeah.
This is Randy at Millennium Porsche.
Can I tell you something?
With no money down, this thing is practically free.
Pat!
No!
Whoa, whoa.
Don't start with no.
- That's what this is.
- Don't start with no.
You're just, like, in this mindset.
And you're not even...
It's not a mindset.
We don't have the money.
Yeah.
That's the mindset I'm talking about.
Honey, look, I'm trying to be really careful, and I've cut back on some things.
And, like, we promised we were going to get a house this year...
I'm just trying to be a grown-up about this.
Surprise.
We got it.
This is happening.
Look...
Everything you just said about the house, you know, our future, you're exactly right.
And I'm so lucky to have you looking out for us in that way.
But I'm looking out for us in another way.
I'm looking out for...
That intangible thing that every couple needs.
It's a little bit of magic, and a little bit of danger, frankly.
This is gonna solve a lot of our problems.
This tension right now.
As soon as you get in that thing and you feel the energy and you feel it rumble in your gut.
If you don't get turned on, you're made of stone.
Where is it?
It's in the driveway.
Are you...
ls this...
Oh, come on.
Okay, okay...
That's...
Hello?
- Mom?
- Jeff.
Hi.
You know, you're supposed to say "hello" when you pick up the phone.
Yeah, I know.
I thought that maybe you were somebody else, but you're not.
What do you do in the basement?
You're not cleaning it.
You really want to know?
You didn't like it last time we had this conversation.
Okay, no.
You know what?
You're right.
I don't.
Did you get the wood glue?
What are you talking about?
I left you a note on the kitchen counter.
I haven't been upstairs.
One of the shutters on the pantry is broken and I need you to fix it.
You know what, I'm kind of busy right now, so...
All I want for my birthday is for you to get your ass off that couch, and you get on the bus
- and you go to the Home Depot.
- I'm not on the couch.
You come home and fix the shutter before I get home, or you're gonna find someplace else to live.
- Fine.
- Fine.
Good.
You got it?
Do you understand?
Yes, Mom!
Okay!
Love you!
Goodbye.
Did you hang up on me?
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.
Stop the bus.
Can you please stop the bus?
Sorry.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Can I help you, sir?
No.
What?
Pass the ball!
Go, go, go!
Shit, you a'ight?
Get your big ass up, man.
You bleeding and shit?
- He out, man.
- We need another person.
We need one!
You got next.
Who, him?
He gonna be a ref?
That's all we got.
That's all we got.
Let's see what he got.
Let's go, dawg.
Get out here.
Oh, he's passing now.
Right there, dawg.
What's your problem?
That's your man.
Why don't you play some D, man?
Right, right, right.
Hell, no!
You working on this?
Come on, man.
[GO, go] go!
I'm Jeff.
Kevi n Ke...
Kevi n ls your name Kevin Kevin?
No.
So, that's your first name on your jersey?
Yeah, that's my name.
Yeah.
Do you live around here?
Yeah, I don't live far from here.
You obviously don't live around here, though.
No, I was just strolling around today.
It was a nice day, so I thought I'd walk around.
Were you following me, or...
No.
I mean, no.
I saw you on the bus.
Let me explain.
Have you ever seen the movie Signs?
With Mel Gibson and Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin?
Nah, I don't think I have.
I got a phone call this morning.
Someone was asking for Kevin.
But there's no Kevin who lives with me.
It's kind of a common name.
Yeah.
I guess that's true.
I mean, you never got a call, like someone called the wrong house phone?
What if there's no wrong numbers?
Maybe it's always the right house phone.
Everything happens for a reason, right?
Exactly.
No, that's exactly it.
Hey, man, I'm about to go put something in the air real quick.
I don't know if you want to come.
I don't...
I'm sorry...
I don't know what that means.
Smoke weed?
You want to smoke weed with me?
Yeah, man.
I like weed.
Yeah, I can see that.
Wow.
It's nice in here.
- That's nice.
- Yeah.
Oh, shit.
That's a treat.
Check his pockets!
Sorry, Jeff.
Marriage is a compromise.
She got what she wanted, I'm living here in Baton Rouge.
So I get a little somethin'-somethin'.
- Right?
- Sure.
Yeah.
Thank you.
You know what's up.
I got to take this...
It's a business call.
Sweetheart, can I get another Bud Light.
Do you want more wings?
Whatever.
Fine.
I will get glue and fix your shutter.
No.
It is Jeff's responsibility.
That is the point.
He has to do it, not you.
Jeff has to do it.
Okay.
What are you...
Why are you calling me?
Maybe you could get him moving a little bit.
Do you understand?
He's stuck, honey.
He's stuck.
He's 30!
He had a difficult adolescent period.
You of all people would know neither of us had a very easy adolescent period.
- You were older.
- What does that have to do with it?
When you're an adult, you take responsibility for your life.
Okay?
But you're brothers.
You love each other, don't you?
You know, fake it for a little bit just to get...
You know.
Maybe he'll grow on you.
We don't do that, Mom.
We don't spend time together.
Well, Pat, could you at least try?
It's my birthday.
I gotta call you back.
- No, no, no, Pat...
- Bye.
Damn it.
Asshole.
Jeff!
Pat?
What the hell are you doing here?
Kevin beat me up.
I walked.
Who's Kevin?
Some kid I was following.
Well, if he's a kid, how come you didn't kick his ass?
Because I don't believe in fighting, Pat.
And you know that.
Right.
I forgot.
You're a pussy.
Look, Mom called and she's really pissed.
Was Gandhi a pussy?
Yeah, Gandhi was a pussy.
And once again, I have to pick up your slack.
Well, it's not your problem.
Well, it becomes my problem when Mom calls me in the middle of a business meeting.
Yeah?
You're having a business meeting at Hooters?
Yeah.
Yes.
That's very classy.
Right.
Well, business is business.
So, come on.
Get in the car.
Hey!
You don't need to grab onto me.
I'm a little bit conflicted right now, that's all.
About what?
You're just gonna make fun of me, man.
Let's go.
Try me.
I want to learn how you think because I want to free my mind.
Let me try to explain it to you maybe in terms that you would understand.
- Okay.
- This morning
I was meant to have a business meeting with the Kevins.
And destiny.
And now you're here at this weird Hooters thing...
And so now I'm just trying to figure out how to proceed.
What you just said sounded like Yoda took acid and stumbled into a business meeting.
You can make all the fun of Yoda that you want,
Yoda would be fucking killer in a business meeting.
Whatever, man.
Come on!
Let's go.
Get in the Porsche.
Shit!
Hey, I think your Porsche got a ticket, Pat.
Shut up, Jeff.
Just get in the car.
This Porsche is tiny.
The Porsche is normal-sized.
You're a sasquatch.
Are those workout gloves?
I don't think so.
They came with the car so...
Check this out.
You see where those cars are stopping up ahead?
Yeah.
I should probably stop pretty soon, right?
Pat, slow down.
What?
I can't hear you!
Bose surround sound!
Hey, stop it, dude.
This is not funny.
- Count to three and I'll stop.
- Pat, please stop.
Count of three!
One!
Two!
- Pat, look out!
- Three!
Curb!
Curb!
Shit!
Yes!
Will you please stop the car?
It handles better at high speeds!
- Stop the car!
- Shut up!
Tree!
Tree!
Pat?
Fuck!
Wow.
Yeah, that's real bad.
Oh, shit.
What the fuck?
He looks mad.
Are you on drugs?
How many beers have you had?
Shut up, Jeff.
Shut up.
Did you not see that damn tree?
Whatever you do, don't say a word.
Stay in the fucking car.
I am fine, yes.
Thank you for asking.
Burt, should we call an ambulance?
Hi.
There was a pedestrian child in the street and in order to avoid killing it,
I had to swerve and maneuver onto your sidewalk, at which point I lost control of my vehicle and I've hit your tree here.
We can see that.
Do you think we're blind?
No.
Of course not.
I just would like to apologize.
Is he okay?
Yeah, he's fine.
Just a little stunned.
I think that one's hurt.
Maybe we should call the police.
He's fine.
He's okay.
That child's not moving.
Ma'am, he's okay.
Jeff, will you get out of the car?
Yeah.
Get out of the car.
Show her that you're fine.
See?
Live and limber.
- Baby, are you sure you're all right?
- Look at that.
- I am fine, thank you.
- Look at that.
Good as new.
You remind me of my grandson.
Is his name Kevin, by any chance?
Brian, why?
No reason, ma'am.
Do you think there's any way that you and I can take care of this ourselves?
I really don't want to hang out here all afternoon with the cops.
I don't know...
There's some bark off that tree.
It might have ruined the tree, baby.
Whoa.
Is that Linda?
Give me 500 bucks, and we'll call it even.
Excuse me?
No "excuse me," man.
Look at my tree here.
That's a 200-year-old tree.
Might have to do some landscaping.
I'll probably have to bring a tractor in here and a backhoe and dig all this stuff up.
It's a tree!
Have you been drinking?
No.
Why don't we just let the police decide that.
Call 911.
- $100.
- Times five.
- $150.
- Plus $350.
- Fine.
Call the police.
- Call 911.
God damn it!
You take a check?
Yeah.
No problem.
Oh, good.
Boy, he's got some nerve, don't he?
Trying to negotiate with you about our tree.
He come in my yard, hit my tree.
You look at that tree and he don't think he owes me.
Who's that guy she's with?
Get in the car, Jeff.
It was very, very quick and it could have been somebody...
She was wearing a peach dress that she wore this morning, okay?
And they got into our car!
Man, something really big is happening here.
Yeah, no shit, Jeff!
My wife is having an affair!
We don't know that yet.
Let's follow this and see where this leads.
Well, I'm trying to, but I can't see dick so it's kind of hard.
Go!
Go!
Go, go!
Hang on.
- I see them!
- Where?
They're just up here to the left!
There they are!
Pat.
What the fuck are you doing?
You told me to hurry!
Tell me before you swerve so I don't fall off the fucking car!
Okay.
Whatever, just focus on the road!
Where are they going?
They're turning up there!
What street?
South Clark!
South Clark!
They're going to Cochon!
Damn it!
Let me tell you about Cochon.
It's full of A-holes who look down on everybody that's not, like, part of the cool-guy club.
It's so lame.
Look at this, no parking.
I can wait with the car.
No.
I got it.
Pat, there's a fire hydrant!
There's a fire hydrant right here.
I got it.
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
Come on.
Let's go.
Okay, what we got here is a friendly lunch.
It could be a coworker.
It could be a long-lost cousin.
She hates her coworkers and I know her whole family.
We got to hear what they're saying.
Well, body language can tell you a lot, man.
- You're going in there.
- What, me?
Yeah.
I'm not really dressed properly, Pat.
Why don't you just go in there and talk to her?
This could all be a huge misunderstanding.
If I talk to her, she's just gonna deny it.
Why wouldn't she tell you the truth?
Oh, my God.
You have no idea how adult relationships work, do you?
You haven't had a girlfriend since high school.
- So?
So?
- So?
So...
I need to find out exactly what's going on so I'll have the upper hand later.
Do you still love Linda?
There's an empty booth next to them.
Okay?
Just sneak in with my phone.
Here's a little grease money.
Okay.
Get in there, do what you got to do.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- How do you do?
Lovely.
- Fine, thank you.
Can I help you?
Table for one, please.
- Right this way.
- Great.
Thank you.
- Oh, miss?
- Yes?
Could I sit there?
Those tables are saved for two patrons.
- Right.
- Right this way.
Miss?
You know what?
Excuse me.
There are going to be two patrons.
There will be two patrons.
You said table of one.
I meant that more like in the bistro sense, like one plus another one?
Well, just in case, I think this table back here would be quite lovely for you guys.
What if I grease you?
I'm sorry?
I have money.
There's two fives, some ones.
There's a 20.
If I could just sit at that table.
I can't explain.
But it's really important.
I mean, I honestly don't even feel like he really likes me.
Well, that's his problem.
I mean...
From where I stand, there's plenty to like.
Thank you, Steve.
You're a really good listener.
Thank you.
It's such a treat.
I'm just being myself.
Don't say anything.
She might recognize your voice.
If you can hear me, give me a thumbs-up.
Okay, now take the talking part of the phone and hold it, but keep it low, don't let them see.
I really don't think that you want to hear this.
Jeff, just do it!
Okay?
Stop talking so I can hear what's going on.
I can't.
Honestly, I lost a lot of friends because of Pat.
'Cause my friends just don't like him.
I think a little bit's my fault, 'cause I would complain a lot to them and...
For a really long time, I've felt like he and I are...
I don't know...
We got, like, weirdly competitive with each other.
We just never communicate.
He just never listens, ever.
Gosh.
I shouldn't even be talking about this but we haven't had sex in...
I mean, over two months.
That's a long time.
And I think, kind of, what's worse than that is that it's so awkward.
Well, having sex is one thing but making love is something else, right?
What does that even mean?
Thank you, Steve.
I'm not used to being able to talk so openly with someone and have them listen, and care what I'm saying and...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Wail!
Pat, what do you want me to do now, huh?
Hello, my name is Rob.
Can I start you out with something to drink?
Some water.
Excuse me?
- I'll have water.
- I'm sorry?
I'll take some fuckin' water, Rob.
Absolutely.
Jeff?
Whoa!
Hey.
- Wow!
- Hi.
What are you doing here?
I'm just...
Lunching it up, you know?
Getting a little bistro action.
I...
Have you ever met my friend, Steve?
This is my brother-in-law, Jeff.
- This is Steve.
- Hey, Jeff, nice to meet you, man.
- My friend Steve.
- Steve.
We were just gonna leave.
Did you still want me to drop you off at your car?
Yep.
Yeah.
So, I'm going to take him to his car, and I'll see you later.
Hope so.
Nice meeting you, Jeff.
Pat, they're coming out...
What the fuck?
Jeff!
They went that way!
Pat!
Well, then, let's go get the car!
- No car!
- What?
No car!
Help me get a cab!
What are you talkin' about?
What happened to the car?
Nothing!
It got towed.
- That's not funny!
- I'm not...
- I know.
I know it's not.
- It's so not funny!
Help me get a cab!
- There's no way to know where they are.
- Great.
What do we do?
I think we should just sit down right here.
- And?
- And wait.
- For what?
- For a sign.
I'm not gonna sit here and wait for a fucking sign!
Okay, well, then let's walk!
A school bus just drove by!
It's a sign!
What does it mean?
Do we go to a school?
Is my wife fucking some guy in a janitor closet?
I don't think that's it.
I don't think that's it.
- That's not it.
- Good guess.
Now what?
What are you doing?
I'm looking for a credit card slip.
I don't see why.
If I find the slip, I get his last name and then we can look up where he lives and go beat him up.
No, I get it.
I just don't think they throw those things away.
Just shut up and help.
Find it yet?
- How about now?
- That's not helping!
I think we've gotten off track somewhere.
Like I've gotten off track.
Something feels wrong.
Fine.
I'll do it myself, if it'll make you stop talking.
- Is that it?
- No.
It's not.
Oh, God.
What is that?
No, don't do it, Pat.
You don't have to smell it.
Pat.
Okay.
- Hey.
- Hey, Carol.
That was yummy.
What're you doing?
Don't tell anybody else.
What?
Somebody's messing with me.
- Really?
- Yeah, in this office.
- No.
- Yeah.
I got hit by a plane.
- What?
- A little paper plane came into my...
And all these messages were coming to me on my computer.
Kind of...
- Flirty stuff.
- Flirty?
I know someone's playin' some kind of a joke and I think it's those guys that are in the back over there that did the fantasy football.
Oh, my God, those guys are so hot.
That would be so good.
They're young, too.
Do you think it's Henry?
- Henry?
- Yeah.
He's kind of...
Interesting.
He's married, isn't he?
Okay, let's just say it is somebody here.
What does the message say?
Like what are the details?
Well, somethin' about, you know...
What?
That they're a secret admirer.
They said they were...
I think that's kind of hot.
No, it's not.
It's ridiculous.
And I don't like being the butt of a joke.
How do you know it's a joke?
I mean, how many times do we get to get juiced up like this?
This is awesome.
I'm not getting juiced up over a joke.
You're getting attention.
I am super-jelly.
I want attention.
You're impossible.
When was the last time you had a relationship?
Well, my husband, of course.
No way.
Well, I mean, I went out on dates.
Come on.
I've been to the movies.
- It's no wonder you're so cranky.
- I've been bowling...
- I'm not...
- Yeah, you need to get busy.
- You need to get your pipes cleaned.
- You think I'm...
You need to get f...
Yeah.
Well, I won't tell anyone.
Pinky swear.
What else?
What else?
I did hear her say that she felt neglected.
Sounds like they're banging already.
It's possible.
Don't ever get married, dude.
It fucking sucks.
Really?
I think it would be kind of awesome.
Well, it's not.
Okay.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Okay.
I'm sick of walking.
Okay.
Is that what I think it is?
You know, I've been havin' this really weird dream about Dad lately.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He's a teacher.
And...
We're in this classroom with a whole bunch of kids, and we all sit down.
And Dad asks everyone,
"What's the greatest day in the history of the world?"
And one kid is like, "Christmas."
And Dad's like, "No."
And whenever they get the answer wrong, they have to leave the room.
And eventually it's just me and Dad.
And he looks at me and says,
"Pat, what's the greatest day in the history of the world?"
And I don't know, 'cause I'm nervous.
And I'm like, "Dad, I don't know."
And he just looks at me and he smiles and he says...
He says, "Today." He says, "Today."
How'd you know that?
He says, "Today is the greatest day in the history of the world."
Yeah.
I have that dream, Pat.
Except in mine, it's me, you and Dad in his car.
Okay.
I guess it's just something he said to us when we were kids or somethin'.
It's like floating' around in both of our brains.
What is wrong with you?
- Pat.
- What?
What?
What is wrong with you?
Why do you want to be like this?
- What are you talking about?
- We had...
We were havin'...
We're having the same dream!
What the fuck are you talking about?
Why do you want to live like this?
You're drifting through this life with no awareness of how special this is.
You want to talk about what's happening right now, right here?
What's happening right now is that I'm getting lectured by my pothead brother who lives in our mom's basement at 30 years old about how I don't understand the universe!
Hey, here's some understanding for you.
A job and a car and a wife and an apartment!
L got to 90...
What?
- I have to go, Pat.
- Where are you going?
You know what?
You wouldn't...
You would laugh at me again.
Jesus Christ.
You see a fucking truck with the word "Kevin" on it and you have to run after it?
Yeah.
I do.
I wish I was that stupid!
You're a dick!
You know what?
I have an asshole for a brother.
It breaks my heart.
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!
- You call me an asshole?
- Yeah, you are an asshole!
You fucking piece of shit!
You drive a fucking Boxster!
Fuck you!
Don't do this, Pat!
Fuck you!
You get down.
Get down on the fucking ground!
Fucking idiot!
You and Mom will never understand me.
And you're all I have left!
Another Jack and Coke?
Nope.
Got to get home.
Old lady, huh?
No, she's boning another dude.
Right on.
Stop the car.
Stop.
Please, stop?
- Hi.
- Hello.
Hey, so, my sister and her husband just got here a little while ago in that red Camry out there.
And...
I need to...
I'm meeting them.
So...
- Okay...
- Actually, it's an emergency.
I have to get her medication, like, right now, so what's her room number?
We have a privacy policy, sir.
I'm sorry, I can't give you her number.
I know it's like policy and everything, but this is a family emergency, so maybe you could just give me the room number...
It'll take me a second to call.
I lied.
It's not an emergency.
It's not a health emergency.
It is a financial emergency.
Their home is about to be foreclosed on and I need to make a payment.
- Just stop.
- Okay.
- You're embarrassing yourself.
- Right.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me?
No, just thank you so much.
Pat!
Pat!
Oh, my God.
Jeff.
- Oh, my God, Pat.
- What the fuck?
I was on the truck.
The truck came here and now you're here.
- This shit is aligned!
- Shut the fuck up.
- What?
- Linda is here, in this hotel somewhere.
- With the guy?
- Yeah, probably with the guy.
$ofTY...
How the fuck did you find me?
It was the candy man.
Oh, shit.
He's right there.
Okay, what should we do?
Duck in there.
I'm gigantic!
Come on, let's go.
What do you want to do?
Should we stay?
Should we wait?
Do we just wait, or...
We could wait.
I don't know.
I don't...
Should I call her?
Maybe I call her cell phone right now.
And then, like, act innocent and be like, "What's going on?"
You could try that.
You know, you're not fucking helping at all.
You're just like, "Do you want to do that?"
Do you want to know what I think you should do?
Yeah.
I think you should take a few deep breaths, close your eyes, and focus.
That is like stupid fucking Jeff mumbo-jumbo.
If you have any other idea, even one,
I'll be happy to try it without making fun of you.
Okay, all right.
Okay.
Close your eyes.
What do you see?
I just can't stop picturing what's going on.
What if she's, like, giving him a hand job?
You know, I think they're adults.
It's probably unlikely she's giving him a hand job.
I'm gonna break down the door.
No.
Pat.
I'm gonna break it down.
Listen.
Wait, hold on.
That's a terrible idea.
I've seen you try to do things physically.
I'll do it.
Do you think you can do that?
I wish I could get some sort of running start.
You totally can.
There's, like, hallways.
You run and turn.
Parallel isn't gonna help me.
You could run and turn right at the last second.
I wouldn't...
No.
That's not gonna work.
All right.
One, two , three!
Fuck!
- Run!
- What was that?
- Are you okay?
- Fuck!
Get up!
- Linda!
- Pat!
What are you...
- Pat, don't...
Pat, stop!
- What's going on?
- Steve, let him go!
- Either you're gonna calm down...
- Let him go!
Jeff!
- Don't fucking move!
- What are you doing?
- What the hell is going on?
- We just got here!
- Who are you people?
You, shut up!
Who the fuck is this guy?
He's just a friend, okay?
Calm down.
- There's wine!
- Yeah!
There's a bottle of wine on ice, and a...
What is this?
- That's a...
- A sex board?
No, you bring it with the...
Pat!
And your face is flushed, which means you're horny.
- No!
- What the fuck is going on?
Stop yelling and I'll answer all of your questions.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
I'm ready to go home.
Linda, I think you should come with me.
Excuse me!
You should shut the fuck up!
I think that you should go and I'll call you later.
You're not calling this fucking guy.
Linda, do you want me to stay?
- I think you should go.
- You should go!
You need to go!
I'm gonna stay and talk to Pat, okay?
Time for you to go, man.
- Get out, bro!
- All right, Pat.
Get out!
Okay.
Start talking.
Is there anyone else in here?
Well, I'm a little upset, actually,
- and I think that it's understandable!
- I understand that.
Look, what I need to know...
I just need to know one thing, okay?
- Okay.
What?
- Okay.
Are you mad because you came in here and you found me with another man?
Yes.
- Yes.
- Or...
Or are you mad because you're afraid that you might lose me?
What?
There's like a part B now?
Please, don't do that.
It's just semantic bullshit!
- No, it isn't!
It isn't!
- Yeah, it is!
- You really don't know the difference.
- You know what?
Because if you don't understand the difference...
Linda!
Linda.
I'm gonna try to listen to you blabber about whatever this is.
And I'm gonna try to understand your incoherent babble.
Go.
- Why do you always do that?
- What?
- I'm listening.
- No, you're not.
Yeah, I'm trying.
You always just make me feel so stupid!
I'm sorry it's stupid!
I catch you trying to cheat on me and...
You make fun of everything I say.
I'm really just trying to have a conversation with you right now.
This is why our relationship is so fucked.
Because you know what?
When I asked you if you would take me to Cochon you laughed at me.
Who care...
I'm sorry.
That's...
But when I asked Steve, he just, you know, said, let's go.
Yeah, 'cause he wanted to get in your pants!
Well, maybe, but at least he's trying to put in some time and effort!
Let me tell you something about Cochon.
- Cochon is full of assholes...
- You're not even... and snobs in fucking turquoise tailored shirts and pink ties, like that asshole!
You want to ask me to take you there?
Fine.
I'll take you to fucking Cochon.
We'll...
- Yeah.
- God, you're not even listening to me.
No, I'm hearing you loud and clear.
You're not!
It's not about the restaurant.
I just want you to, like, care that I want to go there!
And do you think it's about this guy?
Because I really don't even fucking care about him!
He's nice.
- He listens to me.
- I'm nice.
But you and I, we are petty, we are passive-aggressive with each other, we don't even fight!
I mean, this is a miracle right now!
And what I think, honestly, is that we have no house, we have no kids, thank God!
It would be really fucking easy for us to just walk away!
It'd be super simple.
And that is what I think that we should do.
Hang on, hang on.
You know, let's just not, like, let's just not...
Can we not talk about this anymore?
Let's just go home and sleep on it, and, like...
And like...
Forget it.
I'm gonna go stay at my mom's.
Bye, Jeff.
Jeffrey, where are you?
I asked you to call me after you got the wood glue.
I'm at the office.
Let me know what's going on.
Thanks.
Bye.
Oh, please.
It sure is a noisy little thing.
Yeah.
- Eight glasses a day, my doctor says.
- Really?
You're kidding me.
Blow out my biceps trying to lift these cups that many times.
- I'm Barry.
- Sharon.
Nice to meet you.
Same here.
What am I saying?
I know you're Sharon.
I've seen you around.
I really do like flowers.
Yeah?
Like.
Metaphorically, too.
Symbolically.
All kinds.
Gardenias are my favorite.
I'm not following you.
Excuse me.
It was nice meeting you.
Just stupid.
Sharon?
What's going on?
I think it's over.
What happened?
What?
This is not the way I imagined my life was gonna be.
How did you imagine it?
I was gonna be in the Peace Corps and all that crap, you know, with some guy in an exotic place, all worldly and giving and shit,
and living in a little hut, and taking care of cute little kids
and kissing under waterfalls and stuff, you know.
You can still kiss under waterfalls and stuff like that.
It's like, how many good years do I have left?
I hate my kids right now.
I don't know when that happened.
They were so cute.
I look at the pictures of them, and our family...
Don't cry.
Have some more tissue.
- Don't explain.
Oh, God.
- No.
I just...
Oh, Carol, I'm sorry.
It'll just make it worse.
Don't explain.
But it's not what you think!
Yeah, it is.
I wish that I could
see the world like you.
Really?
I don't know.
You have this, like, belief in this cosmic order.
I really envy that.
You don't want to be like me.
I'm not happy at all.
You know, since Dad died, I've had this...
Had this feeling that it had to be for a reason.
I keep thinking that the signs are all about me, but maybe...
Maybe they're about you and your marriage.
My marriage is not good.
I'l isa
disaster.
I just want to feel like I love Linda.
And I want to feel like she loves me.
And we both want to, like, be in love.
I miss it and I want it so bad.
I think you should just say that.
To her.
It's not that simple, Jeff.
I don't know.
I think it could be that simple.
I mean, wouldn't you be psyched if Linda walked in here right now and sat down in this tub next to you and said,
"Pat, I want to be in love with you again"?
That would be awesome.
Dude, you need to say that to her.
You need to tell her that right now.
- River Parish.
- I am so sorry.
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
Don't apologize, seriously.
- But!
Want to.
- It's okay.
No, I just...
It was so weird and didn't come out the way I...
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
It's just that I'm not gay.
But that's okay.
I'm not gay, either.
But you like women.
So?
Well, I like men.
I like men, too.
And to me, it's like, at this point in my life, whether it's a man or a woman, it doesn't matter.
I want someone who gets me.
♪ feel' like ♪ deserve that.
And!
Think you do, too.
Well, it's important, yes.
But it doesn't mean
I want to sleep with everybody that understands me.
That's all.
No, no, no.
That's not my intention.
Isn't the most important thing finding someone who sees you exactly as you are?
Who gets the Peace Corps and the kissing under waterfalls?
Yeah.
So?
Carol?
Are you there?
Hello?
Shit.
Okay, sorry, everybody.
Just head for the exits!
Single file!
Keep it orderly!
Please!
Close your eyes.
It's clear.
Come on.
There's my car, right here.
Where are we going?
We're all wet.
- I don't know.
What do you think?
- I'm sorry, I don't know.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Let's go to the mall and get drinks with the little umbrellas in them.
Bigger.
Wilder.
I haven't been to New Orleans in 20 years.
How about that?
It's perfect.
Okay, let's go.
Come on out, everybody!
Just come right out.
Shit.
What is this?
It looks like really bad traffic.
Well, I mean in your, you know...
- You mean, like, is it a sign?
- I don't know.
It could be.
- It definitely could be.
- How do I know what to do?
That's the big question, yeah.
It's a constant struggle.
I think you got to go with your gut.
Well, I'm not going to stop now.
Right?
Hey.
Pat?
If we don't get a chance to reconnect today,
I'm, like, super proud of you.
Linda!
Linda!
$ofTY...
- Second thoughts?
- Well, I just...
It's okay.
Pat?
Pat!
- I think that's my son.
- Sharon?
What now, my man?
I guess I'll go back.
We'll have to wait for all this traffic to clear.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just...
You ever feel like you're waiting forever to figure out what your destiny is, and then when you do it's not really that exciting?
Linda!
Pat?
Pat!
Linda!
What are you doing here?
I want to be in love again.
What?
Things have gotten way off track.
And weird and shitty.
And I'm a big part of that, and I'm really sorry for it.
- Pat!
- What?
Honey, what's happening?
What's the matter?
- Why are you running down...
- Mom?
What's going...
Oh, hi.
- Wait, what are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
How did you get here?
In Carol's...
This is Carol.
Hi.
I'm Linda.
Nice to meet you.
Jeff...
Jeff's here?
Whoa, hey!
Did you see that?
Is he okay?
Is he okay?
Yeah, we're here.
A car just went off the bridge.
There's people inside of it.
Somebody jumped in!
Wait!
Our dad's still down there!
Fuck.
Come on.
Help!
Help us!
Dad!
Help!
Come on, girls!
Come on.
Swim hard!
Come on, honey!
Give me your hand.
That a girl.
Come on.
- Get back there.
- Dad?
Hey, the car's going down!
The car's sinking!
Dad!
Dad!
Jeff!
Jeff!
Dad!
Come on, Dad!
We need some help over here.
Pat?
Over here!
Over here!
Pat!
Pat!
- Jeff!
- Jeff!
Help!
Help!
Man in the water!
Help!
Two survivors in sight.
Five feet off the first cleat.
Coming into the dive deck.
Hurry!
Get a hold of him!
One, two, three!
Jeff!
We have an unresponsive person!
He's not moving!
Call the command center!
Have an ambulance meet us at the pier!
- Jeff!
- Sir, we got to help him.
We got him.
Do something!
Jesus!
Sir, sir.
Jeff!
- He's not moving!
- Starting CPR!
Get off me!
Leave me alone!
You need to sit down!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
Jeff, wake up!
- Jeff!
- Still not responding.
Can you hear me?
HEY.
Hey, you okay?
Hey.
Sir?
- Are you okay?
- Oh, God.
Let's get blankets!
Sir, stay still.
Let me sit up.
What happened?
Everything...
I'm hungry...
And coming up next, the story of two girls, their father, and the man who was in the right place at the right time.
The car that was behind us crashed into the back of us and then we went over the bridge.
And then this man, he just came and broke our window...
And he almost died doing it.
If we had lost our dad, you know, I just really can't even imagine it.
We're just really thankful he was there.
We'll be right back with that rescue tale of local councilman Kevin Landry and his two little girls.
Martin.
Come on, we're on.
How do you get by with so little sleep?
I don't know.
Ambition, good diet.
Constant self-medication.
Time you got a new bag?
I got this from a friend of the family.
- It used to be his.
- Oh, well, in that case...
I kinda like it.
You going to that thing for the new residents?
I don't know.
Carson's daughter's gonna be there.
- Who's Carson?
- Radiology.
Supposedly his daughter's a real peach.
Come on, Martin, time to start looking for that trophy wife.
Bring the bag.
Dr. Levy, 4152.
Dr. Levy, 4152.
How are you, Mr...
Sanchez?
No hablo ingles.
Oh.
- No hablo espanol.
- Doctor.
Excuse me one...
one moment.
Por favor, Doctor.
Dr. Page?
Do you speak Spanish?
No.
Can you cough?
Thank you.
Okay, you need a lot of rest.
Rest.
Sleep.
You need to rest.
Yes, that's what you need, okay?
The barium pictures were negative.
Why the D-xylose absorption series?
I felt I should rule out Zollinger-Ellison syndrome,
Whipple's disease, and celiac.
I say mild peptic ulcer.
I mean, possible chronic reflux.
Look, smokes, drinks, filed for divorce.
I didn't know about the divorce.
Did you talk to her?
Not about stuff like that.
We're not fishing for syndromes here, folks.
Communication is key.
- Dr. Waylans.
- Yes?
Ah, Martin Blake.
Things going okay?
Yeah.
I was wondering, you did the infectious diseases fellowship?
Yeah.
Well, I'm applying.
Do you have any advice?
You're only six days into residency.
You can't even apply till next year.
I just want to be prepared.
Oh.
Well, it's not much.
You know, a good candidate is just a good doctor.
Right.
You do know the secret to being a good doctor, don't you, Martin?
You act like one.
I do, I think.
Well, then, you're fine.
- Dr. Waylans?
- Yes, Martin?
Is it possible to get our ID picture retaken?
I have no idea.
Excuse me, what does that say?
Penicillin.
Excuse me, when will the doctor be here?
I am the doctor.
Okay, that's it for now.
Nurse?
I'll need labs drawn.
You're gonna have to do it yourself.
We're swamped.
You know how, right?
Yes.
Of course.
Thank you.
Is that okay?
Sorry.
A phlebotomist is supposed to do this.
- A what?
- It's who draws the blood.
Doctors aren't supposed to have to do this.
There you go.
Okay.
There you are.
I'm so sorry, I thought you were someone else.
Who did you think I was?
I see you've met my esteemed colleague.
I did.
For a minute, I thought he was you.
There's only one of me.
That's the rule.
This is Martin.
Martin, this is Christine.
- Hello.
- Dr. Carson's daughter.
So back to you being such a big nerd in high school.
- The biggest.
- Really?
Yup.
And then one day I realized
I was gonna die a virgin.
That thought can come as quite a shock to a young man.
Don't you have some other rooms to attend to?
Let's just be a couple dirty Mexicans and make it happen.
Make what happen?
How 'bout I just talk to you?
Let's make ourselves useful.
- Jimmy, come on.
- Yo.
Morning, Doc.
Hi.
How you feeling?
Bad.
What's wrong with me again?
Pyelonephritis.
It's a UTI of the upper tract and kidney.
Pie-lo-na-fry-tis.
Like that?
Pyelonephritis.
Mm-hmm.
Sit up.
Okay.
- Are you sore there?
- Yeah.
- Here?
- Yeah.
Pyelonephritis.
Can you die from that?
Maybe, if you never took care of it.
But that's what us doctors are here for.
I thought you guys just played golf.
I don't know how to play golf.
I thought all doctors played golf.
I'm gonna learn.
Oh, hello, doctor.
Doctor, nice to see you again.
How's she doing?
Good.
Responding to antibiotics.
I could've died, right?
I was just saying it can be serious.
But it's completely under control.
So you mean, like, if this were before hospitals, she'd be dead?
I didn't say that.
It's amazing knowing how to save people like that.
I bet you even know the name of this.
Philtrum.
See?
I told you he'd know it.
Hi.
- Oh, hi, Rich.
- Hey, Mrs. Nixon.
Val.
This is my doctor.
He said I could have died.
- Dr. Blake.
- Hey.
So how's it going?
Okay.
You able to walk or...
I'll look in again later on.
You got, like, some kind of infection?
This says penicillin, right?
- Yeah.
- Come with me, please.
Mr. Sanchez is allergic to penicillin.
Well, it didn't say so on the...
This isn't the original admit sheet.
Where's the original?
I don't know what you're talking about.
On the original sheet, it said NKA, no known allergies.
- Well, did you ask him?
- He doesn't speak English.
If you knew he was allergic, why'd you give him penicillin?
Because you're the doctor.
I only do what you say.
Okay, let's get a Benadryl line...
Already took care of it.
Thank you.
- Where are you going?
- To file an incident report.
A what?
Why?
This is an incident.
It's procedure.
And can you rewrite this legibly?
What are you doing?
I'm looking for the original admit sheet.
I'm sorry, Doctor, but whatever it is you're looking for, you're not gonna find it there.
Here you go, T. Little present for you.
Marty!
This seat taken?
Look, right, right, right.
Right here, look, look, look, look.
Hey, Nancy, you want to sit down, right here?
So that's a no?
Have a good weekend.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me a second.
- Yeah, no problem.
Dr. Waylans, could I talk to you for a second?
Sure.
I just wanted to ask you about incident reports.
Is this about the Sanchez thing?
I wouldn't worry about it.
But does it go on my record?
I mean, is it bad?
I don't think so.
I mean, it's not good.
Will it affect my application for the infectious diseases fellowship?
I can't undo it, if that's what you mean.
I haven't heard that before.
No, that's fine.
Perfect.
While you're at it, why don't you just go screw her and get it over with?
No.
Because I'm sick, and I'm in the hospital, if you haven't noticed.
Oh, please.
You're such an asshole!
Go to hell.
I'm getting better.
It looks that way.
Everything okay?
Do you remember Rich?
I should break up with him.
You think I should break up with him?
That's none of my business.
He is the most popular guy in school.
I wasn't the most popular guy in school.
And now I'm a doctor.
What do you think Rich is going to be?
I don't know.
An idiot.
It's hard to dump him, though.
We've been together for a while.
I mean, I don't know if we're in love or anything.
- Well, you know what they say.
- What?
If you love someone, set them free.
Who says that?
Sting.
- I think.
- Who?
Excuse me, Doctor.
I'm with a patient.
I can't do these orders until I can read them.
I can't do these orders...
Press door open.
Press door open!
Hello, Doctor.
Having a rough day, are we?
No.
Fine.
Don't worry, I got it, too.
Every goddamn day's a shit fight just to get out of bed in the morning.
Oh.
What's bugging you, Doc?
This is a hospital.
The staff is supposed to follow orders, right?
Isn't that how it's supposed to be?
Doctors get a little respect?
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe.
It's probably not what you think, though.
I just want things to be like they're supposed to be.
How long has Theresa been here?
Didn't you learn how to get rid of people like that in med school?
Just slip 'em something, then they're going along, and then bam!
Heart attack!
Too bad.
I'm kidding, Doc.
Just bet you were thinking about it.
Okay, I'm clocking out.
Hi.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Okay, I guess.
What was the deal with that nurse?
It was a misunderstanding.
It's okay.
Shouldn't she be fired or something for yelling at a doctor?
Probably.
I don't want to cause a fuss.
Am I cured?
Nearly.
No more hospital?
No.
No more helpful advice?
I'll tell Nurse Ratched you're a good doctor.
Maybe she'll leave you alone.
Thanks.
You're a good patient.
All right, Nixon.
Signs are okay.
No pain, no spikes.
She's outta here.
Just another day, to be sure?
I already signed her out.
Let's move on.
Mr. Sanchez.
Hi.
Are you Diane's doctor?
- Yes.
- I'm Diane's father.
Thank you for everything.
I was just coming to say good-bye.
My wife just took her down to the car.
Any last-minute advice?
Finish her pills.
She could relapse.
Okay, we'll do that.
Uh, I don't know how to say this, but my daughter took quite a shine to you.
She thought you two got on pretty well, and she wondered if I might ask you over for dinner on Friday.
Friday.
Yes.
That'd be nice.
- Great.
- Friday.
We'll count on it.
See you then.
8:00 Friday.
Hello, Diane.
You feeling better?
How are you feeling?
Mr. Nixon.
Mrs. Nixon.
- Is that the doctor?
- Uh, yeah.
Let him in, for God's sake.
- Hi.
Come on in.
- Hi.
Welcome to our home.
Oh, you remember Valerie, right?
Hi.
I love your jacket.
Thanks.
And this is our youngest, Donny.
- Hello.
- What's up?
- Not much.
- Please sit down.
- Where's Diane?
- Oh, she's out.
I told her to stay so that she didn't seem ungrateful, because we really are.
But she's having a talk with Rich.
So what's it like being a doctor?
A lot of work.
A lot of responsibility.
But I like it.
How many operations you do a week?
I'm in internal medicine.
What's that, like, intestines?
Donny, not at the table.
That'd be great.
Get in there and just dig around.
I don't do surgery.
I bet it pays pretty well, doesn't it, being a doctor?
Donny, don't pry.
It's actually less than you think, but it's a lot more than I'd make back home.
Bet he makes more than you do, Donny.
Besides, the money comes when you go into private practice, right?
You got a nice place?
It's okay.
The beach.
Oh, I love the beach.
You're so lucky.
I wish I lived by the beach and knew all this incredible knowledge about the human body.
- You know plenty.
- Donny, you pig!
- Stop...
- Valerie!
- Mom!
- He started it.
Moron, this was brand-new.
You're just gonna get sperm on it anyway.
Ow!
Let's not have that kind of language at the table there, guy.
Honestly, Donny.
I am so sorry, Doctor.
It's okay.
- Could I use your restroom?
- Certainly.
- It's down the hall on the right.
- Excuse me.
What, Mom?
He's a doctor.
It's not like he's never heard of sperm before.
- Hey!
- You are upsetting your father.
Where do you come up with this stuff?
- Oh!
- Sorry.
It's just something came up at the hospital, and I really have to go.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
Okay, that's it.
Have a good day, everyone.
Thanks.
I'll see you there.
Blake, can you stay for a second, please?
Sure.
Have a seat.
So how's it going?
Fine.
Oh, yeah?
Tired?
A little.
Happy?
Want some coffee?
No, thanks.
First year of residency can be tough, I know.
If this is about Mr. Sanchez...
I just wanted to chat about the big picture.
Tell me something, Martin, when did you first want to become a doctor?
- When?
- Yeah.
A long time ago, I guess.
Did you know why?
Why?
Because... a friend of my mother's was a doctor and he was respected, and I guess I just always thought, you know, to have that respect and to... and be helping people.
Yeah, people go into medicine for all kinds of reasons.
You know, sometimes they don't really think about it till they're here, face-to-face with it all.
And sometimes they realize the stress and the hours and the nature of the work aren't what they thought it would be.
I mean, it's not unusual for people to realize maybe this isn't what they wanted after all.
This is what I want.
I mean, I know I can do better.
It's just taking time for me to learn your system here.
I mean, I didn't have all the advantages, you know, growing up and school, and so sometimes
I just have to work harder, and I do.
Some of the nurses, I mean...
Maryanne's fine, but with Theresa...
I double-majored in chemistry and biology.
I went to school, I did all this work, and she just treats me like I'm some nobody.
It doesn't seem fair, but...
I do want this.
Hi, Martin, it's Valerie Nixon.
It was really nice to see you the other night.
I'm sorry you had to rush off.
My mom actually got you a gift basket, but we forgot to give it to you.
So I don't know if you wanted to arrange a time to come by and get it, or I could drop it by the hospital or your apartment, if you like.
So give us a call.
I'm home anytime but tonight.
Okay, bye.
Oh, Dr. Blake, come in.
Thank you.
Can I get you some coffee or anything?
No, thanks.
Valerie called.
She mentioned there was something for me to collect?
- Yeah.
- But I'm expected at the hospital.
Oh, of course.
Could I use your restroom?
Certainly.
- You remember where it was?
- Yeah.
- Oh, here you go.
- Thank you.
It's just a little something to say thanks.
Thanks again, Doctor.
Are there any special instructions for Diane?
Just finish her medicine.
I thought it was just malaise from hanging around the house so much.
I told you, it's pyelonephritis.
Ow.
I thought she was all better.
It did seem that way.
We'll run some tests to make sure.
But there are some resistant strains that are harder to treat.
Hey, Doc!
Hey, it's nice to have the little number back in 324, huh?
I don't think it's appropriate you talk about the patients in that manner.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hippocratic oath, right?
Yeah.
I need a cam profile.
- We need the ultrasound.
- Getting it.
- Here's one here.
- All right.
Who's the primary doctor?
Where's the chart?
What is this?
This doesn't make sense.
Another allergic reaction, Doctor?
No, this is something else.
See?
Vancomycin.
Not a penicillin reaction.
It wasn't my mistake.
Yeah, looks like red man syndrome.
Well, it can happen when...
When someone misadministers vancomycin.
Which doesn't surprise me because I never thought that Theresa, beyond her attitude, was all that sharp about these things.
Right, I'll look into it.
How's everything else?
I see the Nixon girl is back.
Yeah.
She said she took her oral meds.
But I'll do a resistance culture just to be sure.
All right.
Keep up the good work.
So, can't keep away.
It seems that way.
I'm sorry.
I'm not.
You don't want to go back to school?
Rich?
The medicine you're on now is much stronger.
You'll get better very soon.
Do I have to?
- Ooh!
- Oh, I'm really so sorry, Doctor.
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.
Maryanne, I'm really busy...
You know what?
They just let me go.
And before you hear it from anyone else,
I messed up Mr. Sanchez's vancomycin.
I switched the sheet and I just panicked.
I'm just sorry if I jeopardized a patient.
I thought it was Theresa.
No.
She didn't know anything about it.
Oh, so sorry to hold you up.
It's fine.
Excuse me.
Sorry, Doctor.
Good morning.
- How are you feeling?
- The same, I guess.
Your temperature's up a little.
Is that bad?
It's nothing serious, but you might have to stay an extra day or two.
Is that bad?
No.
That's fine.
Why don't you check in on me?
- Someone's coming.
- Shh, shh.
- Someone's coming.
- What are you talking about?
No one comes down here.
I promise you, baby.
- Ahem.
- Oh, hey, Doc.
- Uh...
- Get off me.
We were just talking.
Is this woman under sedation?
It's cool, man.
It's just a party, man.
Shit, it was her idea anyway.
Mandy, tell the doctor you're okay.
Doctor, I'm okay.
What are you doing down here, Doc?
Is there something I could help you with?
Just get her out of here.
All right, let's get you back to bed now, Mandy.
Mm-hmm.
Nice work, Doc.
Son of a bitch.
Is he paranoid?
Doc's all right.
He's just a little uptight.
Weren't you off at midnight?
Yes.
I just had some things to finish.
This patient's been a difficult case.
Everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.
Why don't you go home, Doctor?
My biggest concern would be an abscess or some kind of resistant bacterial strain.
An abscess is doubtful.
Keep your eye on the resistance culture.
We are seeing more resistance in these.
I was gonna start her on ceftazidime.
Well, if she doesn't start stabilizing, we're gonna have to move her to ICU.
And keep an eye out for sepsis.
How often are you checking signs?
- Two hours.
- Okay.
Good.
Let me know what the resistance culture says.
I will.
What does that mean?
Your infection might be a little tougher than we thought.
We're starting you on another antibiotic, and we need to make sure that you're not developing sepsis.
What's that?
An intravascular infection.
An intra what?
It's in the bloodstream.
- Is that serious?
- It can be.
I didn't think doctors had to do that.
I don't mind.
If I have an operation, will you operate on me?
I don't operate.
Hmm.
I don't want to cut into people.
That's why I went into internal medicine.
If I do my job right, we never have to go in at all.
I don't want to talk to him.
Well, don't... think about it too much.
You need rest.
I know.
Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm looking for Diane Nixon.
I'm afraid she can't take visitors.
Look, man, we had this big bust-up.
I just need to see her for two minutes.
It's not a good idea.
Just leave her alone for a little while.
She needs rest.
Give this to her.
Sure.
You should be sleeping.
I can't.
What did the expert say?
He said it's a difficult case, but we're gonna work together on it and everything's gonna be okay.
There's something I didn't tell you about before I came back to the hospital.
I don't know if it's what could have made me get sick again.
What's that?
I had sex with Rich before I finished my medication.
That can upset your urinary tract, right?
I don't think that's what did it.
I didn't think you two were going out anymore.
You know how sometimes you do things you know you shouldn't, but you just can't help it?
Yeah.
I'm not gonna die, am I?
No, of course not.
I always thought if I was gonna die,
I wanted to, like, get shot stopping a crime or something.
I know that's stupid.
Do you ever think about stuff like that?
When I was younger, maybe.
It's silly.
What did you imagine?
I would think about just walking into the ocean and just disappearing like I never existed.
And the world would just go on without me.
I love the ocean.
I'm not sure I've seen anything quite like this.
Yeah, it's been a tough case.
They had an Acinetobacter at South East General, but I've never seen one of these so resistant before.
You've been doing regular cultures to check against some other bug, maybe some nosocomial thing?
I considered that, but nothing's come up in cultures.
Martin's been very thorough.
He's done everything I would have done.
And she's been properly administered all along?
Yes.
Well, Martin, it looks like you've landed yourself a tricky one.
I drew up the protocol to treat the sepsis... shoot.
I must have left it in my car.
I'm due upstairs.
Would you mind?
No.
No, I was just about to grab lunch.
Silver Mercedes, Johns Hopkins stickers.
And it's in the back.
It's a tube that goes into your heart.
It doesn't hurt.
So you can look in any time you want?
Yeah.
If you had one, too, we could have a heart-to-heart.
Doctor, we're ready to proceed.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
Just kind of groggy.
They put pain medicine into your IV.
Any pain from the catheter?
No.
It's weird.
I feel kinda nice, actually.
Can I ask you a question?
Of course.
You're not married or don't have a girlfriend or anything.
What's the question?
Why not?
You know how people are in the world.
Yeah.
You know, for a while, I thought you liked my sister.
No.
Good, she's a slut.
You don't want a girl like that.
Doctor.
I know, I did it myself.
Where is she?
Excuse me.
Who?
Diane Nixon.
Oh, they took her for an MRI.
I just got a code four.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where is she?
!
- Epinephrine.
- Epinephrine in.
Start Lidocaine drip.
Get the defibrillator.
Set it to 102.
- Charge.
- Clear!
Start CPR.
Hold CPR.
- Clear!
- We're clear!
Yeah.
Yeah, that's it.
Call it.
Dr. Blake?
- Dr. Blake?
- Yes?
Sorry about yesterday, the Nixon girl.
She seemed nice.
She was.
Thank you.
- Dr. Blake?
- Yes?
Dr. Waylans would like to see you in conference room three.
You wanted to see me?
Yes, Martin.
Take a seat.
This the first time this has happened?
Yes.
I never meant it to happen.
It just... got out of control.
Well, this is Dr. Sayler.
She's a psychiatrist on staff here.
Hello, Martin.
It's always hard to lose a patient, especially the first time.
You always question yourself.
You wonder if you made mistakes, if you missed something, could you have been quicker?
These things happen.
Accepting that is part of being a doctor.
If there's anything you want to express, please don't hold back.
Can I ask you a question?
Okay.
Did you cry yesterday?
I did, yes.
Good.
That's good.
Oh, Mr. Nixon, I am so sorr...
Just want to talk to the doctor.
You killed my little girl.
Okay, Mr. Nixon, I am truly sorry for your loss, but you cannot come onto my ward and start accusing my doctors.
That bastard killed my daughter.
What is the problem, sir?
She was fine, then she came in here and you killed her.
Martin, let me handle this.
Sir, these infections can be very difficult to treat.
It was a rare, resistant strain.
Now, if she didn't take every one of her pills, that could strengthen the infection.
We don't know.
She took her pills.
She told me.
Don't blame Dr. Blake, sir.
I supervised him through the entire case.
He was exemplary in every way.
We did everything we could.
Everything, all of us.
Sir, can you come with me, please?
- Sir.
- Get your hands off me.
You bastards.
Is the situation under control, or do you need backup?
Everything's fine.
We're coming out.
I'm sorry, Martin.
You shouldn't have to deal with that.
It's a tough one.
Yeah.
Don't worry about it.
Waylans told me you're not really a doctor until you've lost a patient.
You got your scrubs.
Hey, hold up.
Going to x-ray, Mr. Granger?
There's no hearing aid.
Right, Mr. Granger, you crazy old fucker?
So it must be a relief to get onto that new rotation.
Sounds like that last one was pretty rough.
These things happen, unfortunately.
It's part of being a doctor, dealing with loss.
Oh.
So I guess you're a doctor now.
I suppose so.
You know what I always thought would be the best part about being a doctor?
It's the ladies.
The ladies love a doctor.
You find that to be true?
I suppose so, yes.
No.
What do you mean?
Meet me in the east tower basement, five minutes.
- Why?
- I think you know.
What is it?
Well, Doctor, I just wanted to ask you an ethical question about the relations between staff and patients.
That woman in the supply room?
Forget about it.
No, no, no, no, that's not my question.
See, I'm more interested in a situation like this.
All right, say a guy like me, you know, who likes to party, but otherwise is a regular guy, like an orderly, one day, he's taking this gurney to change it out... oh, and the previous tenant was this girl,
this sweet girl, she just passed away.
Anyway, this guy's taking out the mattress, and to his surprise, finds a little book under there.
And, well, there's some really shocking stuff in there about this one young doctor.
Seems they had kind of a little special relationship going on.
Now my question is this, do you think it's wrong, ethically, for this orderly to keep this book from his superiors?
Let's take a ride.
What do you want?
Another reason I wish I was a doctor is so I could prescribe myself a better time.
I party, and nobody sees this.
I can't do that.
Where there's a will, there's a way, right?
Ahem, Doctor?
Uh, I had a question about this order.
Is it my handwriting?
Uh, no, I can read it, it's just you prescribed oxycodone for Mr. Granger?
He's had some pain from the Hickman catheter, so, yeah.
Okay, sorry, I just wanted to check.
Do you need help?
No, thanks.
What's troubling you?
What?
That's for stomachs, and that stuff's more for, like, sniffling and sneezing.
I know.
I'm a doctor.
Okay, sorry.
Dude, four?
They're hard to get.
I hope this is a down payment.
Okay, fine.
What about the book?
- What about it?
- When do I get it back?
You never had it.
I'm not gonna do this indefinitely.
I don't think you have much of a choice, Doctor.
Time you switched to decaf?
Mmm.
Cheers.
Rotation wasn't so tough.
And they say the second half of the year, everything gets easier.
Martin.
I'm sorry to hear about your patient.
- Difficult case.
- Yes, it was.
I've been doing a study of these resistant bugs and was hoping you might be able to help me review this one if you kept your notes and charts together.
Dr. Waylans tells me you're thinking of applying for the ID fellowship.
Yes, I am.
I think that's a fine idea.
Fine idea.
Yo, Doc.
Is this the patient?
Yes.
- James?
- Yeah?
I'd like to talk to you when you get a chance.
Yeah, I get off in 30 minutes.
Great.
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hi.
Hey there, partner.
You got it?
Those are different.
They're more like morphine.
They're better.
I want the book.
Oh.
Maybe soon.
Really?
No, that's not gonna work for me.
You just keep 'em coming, you'll be all right.
Have fun.
You know I will.
What are you doing?
You can't take those here.
Why not?
I'm off duty.
You shouldn't drive on them.
I got a ride.
What's with you, man?
Dude, don't make a big deal out of this.
We're all human beings.
We all gotta get our kicks somehow.
What are you doing?
Don't follow me.
I'm just walking.
Get away from me.
You're making this more than it has to be, Doc.
- You want more?
- Yeah.
- You want more?
- Sure, yeah.
All right.
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
Some kind of seizure.
Call a code, he's gone into arrest!
All right, all right.
I got it.
Okay.
Okay, Jimmy!
Jimmy, can you hear me?
Jimmy?
Okay, okay, okay.
Jimmy, it's Dr. Waylans.
Jimmy!
Jimmy, stay with me.
Jimmy.
Stay with us.
- I got the elevator.
- All right, good.
- So was he sick or anything?
- I don't know.
He went into some kind of seizure.
I tried to help.
I wouldn't be surprised if it was some sort of drug overdose.
What makes you think that?
His very erratic behavior.
Some of the nursing staff, it occurred to them that he might be a drug abuser.
They had a mandatory test scheduled.
Perhaps you should go home.
Take a break.
Get back to the business of being a doctor on Monday.
You off tomorrow?
Yup.
Okay with you, Detective, if the good doctor here goes home?
Uh, yeah, I guess.
If we have any more questions, we'll be in touch, if you don't mind.
No, not at all.
I'm pretty sure Rich was there.
He kissed me right as I was leaving.
Went to the hospital today.
They want to keep me overnight.
Rich asked me to be his girlfriend.
The diagnosis isn't anything bad.
He said he loved me, but he doesn't act like it.
It looks like a UTI.
If you love someone, set them free.
I spent the night at Rich's.
They called a specialist.
He carried me into the bedroom and laid me down.
I can't believe he's hanging out with Jenny.
He looks at me like I'm some lab rat in a cage.
He's such a liar.
Having surgery tomorrow.
I have sepsis.
They put the tube in this morning.
It's an infection.
The anesthesia was great.
It's actually kinda nice.
Gave me the weirdest dreams.
Why is this happening to me?
It's so quiet.
I can't sleep.
I'm not getting any better.
Dr. Blake?
Yes.
Detective Krauss, from the hospital yesterday.
You said if we had any more questions...
I'm sorry to just drop by like this.
Right.
Fine, come in.
Can I get you anything?
No, thanks.
So it seems the, uh, the pills Mr. Vega took were spiked with potassium cyanide.
- You know about that?
- No.
Well, yeah, I mean, I know what it is.
Some people suspect that he abused drugs.
Looks like maybe he got a bad batch.
That's a shame.
I mean, I didn't know him that well.
That's why I'm not as upset as I would be if I knew him better.
I knew him to say hello to.
Did you ever see him taking drugs?
No.
I hardly knew him, like I said.
You have a pen I could borrow?
Thanks.
You knew this orderly?
Just slightly.
Not well.
Kind of.
I mean, he was not my kind of person.
Do you know where he got the drugs?
Could he have gotten them from the hospital?
Stolen them?
No, they're carefully monitored, so I don't know how an orderly could.
Only a doctor can prescribe.
Could a doctor have gotten them for him?
Theoretically a doctor could... fake a prescription or skim from a patient.
But that wouldn't be ethical, so they don't.
So a doctor could have gotten these?
No.
Did any doctors have any kind of a relationship with Mr. Vega?
What?
No, I...
I don't know.
I mean, like I said, I didn't care for him, so I didn't hang around him.
Were there any other doctors who may have disliked him, who could've tainted the pills with the, uh...
Potassium cyanide.
Look, uh...
I'm sorry if I seem distracted.
I understand.
It must be tough trying to get back to normal after seeing somebody die like that.
It has been... especially with her.
Who?
No one.
Just... a patient died.
It was a resistant strain of an infection.
They're rare, but increasingly common.
Antibiotics and cleansers are making germs tougher.
It was a difficult case, everyone agreed.
I know I must seem like I'm reacting differently now than with James' passing away, but he wasn't much of a person.
I mean, he'd make lewd comments at women patients.
I think he may have even fooled around with them, which, as a doctor, you can't.
Diane was a very nice girl.
We were close.
In a doctor-patient way, before she died.
But that's over now, and I'm back to the business of being a doctor.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Well, you know where I am, Detective, if you have any more questions.
Excuse me a moment.
- Doctor?
- Just a second.
Mind if I have a glass of water?
No, not at all.
Help yourself.
I'm sorry.
I need to collect some things.
I'm needed at the hospital.
Do you have any more questions?
I'm afraid I'm in a bit of a hurry.
Well, no.
I guess not.
I'll let you get ready, then.
Thanks for your help, Doctor.
My pleasure.
His HH are 12 and 36.
WBC 10.9 with a slight shift to the left.
He's on a broad-spectrum antibiotic.
I'm about to hang his third dose.
Let's do blood cultures now and times two for a temporary, then 101.
- Yeah.
- Is it gonna hurt?
A little, but don't worry.
I'm getting better all the time.
Make a fist.
- Doctor?
- Yes.
( woman speaking over P.A. )
( paper rustling )
( liquid pouring )
Martin.
Come on, we're on.
( woman speaking over P.A. )
How do you get by with so little sleep?
I don't know.
Ambition, good diet.
Constant self-medication.
Time you got a new bag?
I got this from a friend of the family.
- It used to be his.
- Oh, well, in that case...
I kinda like it.
You going to that thing for the new residents?
I don't know.
Carson's daughter's gonna be there.
- Who's Carson?
- Radiology.
Supposedly his daughter's a real peach.
Come on, Martin, time to start looking for that trophy wife.
Bring the bag.
Woman on P.A.:
Dr. Levy, 4152.
Dr. Levy, 4152.
How are you, Mr...
Sanchez?
No hablo ingles.
Oh.
- No hablo espanol.
- Doctor.
( speaking Spanish )
Excuse me one...
one moment.
Por favor, Doctor.
Dr. Page?
Do you speak Spanish?
No.
Can you cough?
( coughs )
- ( coughs )
- Thank you.
Okay, you need a lot of rest.
Rest.
Sleep.
- You need to rest.
- ( speaks Spanish )
Yes, that's what you need, okay?
The barium pictures were negative.
Why the D-xylose absorption series?
I felt I should rule out Zollinger-Ellison syndrome,
Whipple's disease, and celiac.
I say mild peptic ulcer.
I mean, possible chronic reflux.
Look, smokes, drinks, filed for divorce.
I didn't know about the divorce.
Did you talk to her?
Not about stuff like that.
We're not fishing for syndromes here, folks.
Communication is key.
- Dr. Waylans.
- Yes?
Ah, Martin Blake.
Things going okay?
Yeah.
I was wondering, you did the infectious diseases fellowship?
Yeah.
Well, I'm applying.
Do you have any advice?
You're only six days into residency.
You can't even apply till next year.
I just want to be prepared.
Oh.
Well, it's not much.
You know, a good candidate is just a good doctor.
Right.
You do know the secret to being a good doctor, don't you, Martin?
( whispers ) You act like one.
I do, I think.
Well, then, you're fine.
- Dr. Waylans?
- Yes, Martin?
Is it possible to get our id picture retaken?
I have no idea.
Excuse me, what does that say?
Penicillin.
Excuse me, when will the doctor be here?
I am the doctor.
Okay, that's it for now.
Nurse?
I'll need labs drawn.
You're gonna have to do it yourself.
We're swamped.
You know how, right?
Yes.
Of course.
Thank you.
Is that okay?
Sorry.
A phlebotomist is supposed to do this.
- A what?
- It's who draws the blood.
Doctors aren't supposed to have to do this.
There you go.
Okay.
( blows )
( seagulls calling )
- ( jazz music playing ) - ( people chatting )
There you are.
I'm so sorry, I thought you were someone else.
Who did you think I was?
I see you've met my esteemed colleague.
I did.
For a minute, I thought he was you.
There's only one of me.
That's the rule.
This is Martin.
Martin, this is Christine.
- Hello.
- Dr. Carson's daughter.
So back to you being such a big nerd in high school.
- The biggest.
- Really?
Yup.
And then one day I realized
I was gonna die a virgin.
That thought can come as quite a shock to a young man.
( trails off indistinctly )
( sighs )
Nurse:
Don't you have some other rooms to attend to?
Man:
Let's just be a couple dirty Mexicans and make it happen.
( sighs ) Make what happen?
How 'bout I just talk to you?
Let's make ourselves useful.
- Jimmy, come on.
- Yo.
- Morning, Doc.
- ( taps )
Hi.
How you feeling?
Bad.
What's wrong with me again?
Pyelonephritis.
It's a uti of the upper tract and kidney.
Pie-lo-na-fry-tis.
Like that?
Pyelonephritis.
Mm-hmm.
Sit up.
Okay.
- Are you sore there?
- Yeah.
- Here?
- Yeah.
Pyelonephritis.
Can you die from that?
Maybe, if you never took care of it.
But that's what us doctors are here for.
I thought you guys just played golf.
I don't know how to play golf.
I thought all doctors played golf.
I'm gonna learn.
Oh, hello, doctor.
Doctor, nice to see you again.
Mrs. Nixon:
How's she doing?
Good.
Responding to antibiotics.
I could've died, right?
I was just saying it can be serious.
But it's completely under control.
So you mean, like, if this were before hospitals, she'd be dead?
I didn't say that.
Val:
It's amazing knowing how to save people like that.
I bet you even know the name of this.
Philtrum.
See?
I told you he'd know it.
( chuckles )
( knocks on door )
Hi.
- Oh, hi, Rich.
- Hey, Mrs. Nixon.
Val.
This is my doctor.
He said I could have died.
- Dr. Blake.
- Hey.
So how's it going?
Okay.
Rich:
You able to walk or...
I'll look in again later on.
Rich:
You got, like, some kind of infection?
This says penicillin, right?
- Yeah.
- Come with me, please.
( labored breathing )
Mr. Sanchez is allergic to penicillin.
Well, it didn't say so on the...
This isn't the original admit sheet.
Where's the original?
I don't know what you're talking about.
On the original sheet, it said NKA, no known allergies.
- Well, did you ask him?
- He doesn't speak English.
If you knew he was allergic, why'd you give him penicillin?
Because you're the doctor.
I only do what you say.
Okay, let's get a Benadryl line...
Already took care of it.
Thank you.
- Where are you going?
- To file an incident report.
A what?
Why?
This is an incident.
It's procedure.
And can you rewrite this legibly?
What are you doing?
I'm looking for the original admit sheet.
I'm sorry, Doctor, but whatever it is you're looking for, you're not gonna find it there.
Here you go, T. Little present for you.
Marty!
This seat taken?
Look, right, right, right.
Right here, look, look, look, look.
Hey, Nancy, you want to sit down, right here?
So that's a no?
Have a good weekend.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me a second.
- Yeah, no problem.
Dr. Waylans, could I talk to you for a second?
Sure.
I just wanted to ask you about incident reports.
Is this about the Sanchez thing?
I wouldn't worry about it.
But does it go on my record?
I mean, is it bad?
I don't think so.
I mean, it's not good.
Will it affect my application for the infectious diseases fellowship?
I can't undo it, if that's what you mean.
( classical music playing )
( plays louder )
( microwave beeping )
( sighs )
( woman speaking over P.A. )
Diane:
I haven't heard that before.
No, that's fine.
Perfect.
While you're at it, why don't you just go screw her and get it over with?
No.
Because I'm sick, and I'm in the hospital, if you haven't noticed.
Oh, please.
You're such an asshole!
Go to hell.
I'm getting better.
It looks that way.
Everything okay?
Do you remember Rich?
I should break up with him.
You think I should break up with him?
That's none of my business.
He is the most popular guy in school.
I wasn't the most popular guy in school.
And now I'm a doctor.
What do you think Rich is going to be?
I don't know.
An idiot.
It's hard to dump him, though.
We've been together for a while.
I mean, I don't know if we're in love or anything.
- Well, you know what they say.
- What?
If you love someone, set them free.
Who says that?
- Sting.
- ( chuckles )
- I think.
- Who?
Excuse me, Doctor.
I'm with a patient.
I can't do these orders until I can read them.
( mocking ) I can't do these orders...
Press door open.
Press door open!
( grunts )
( with British accent ) Hello, Doctor.
Having a rough day, are we?
No.
Fine.
( normal voice ) Don't worry, I got it, too.
Every goddamn day's a shit fight just to get out of bed in the morning.
Oh.
What's bugging you, Doc?
This is a hospital.
The staff is supposed to follow orders, right?
Isn't that how it's supposed to be?
Doctors get a little respect?
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe.
It's probably not what you think, though.
I just want things to be like they're supposed to be.
How long has Theresa been here?
Didn't you learn how to get rid of people like that in med school?
Just slip 'em something, then they're going along, and then bam!
Heart attack!
Too bad.
( elevator bell dings )
I'm kidding, Doc.
Just bet you were thinking about it.
Nurse:
Okay, I'm clocking out.
( indistinct chatter )
Hi.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Okay, I guess.
What was the deal with that nurse?
It was a misunderstanding.
It's okay.
Shouldn't she be fired or something for yelling at a doctor?
Probably.
I don't want to cause a fuss.
Am I cured?
Nearly.
No more hospital?
No.
No more helpful advice?
I'll tell Nurse Ratched you're a good doctor.
Maybe she'll leave you alone.
Thanks.
You're a good patient.
( waves crashing )
( jet engine roaring )
All right, Nixon.
Signs are okay.
No pain, no spikes.
She's outta here.
Just another day, to be sure?
I already signed her out.
Let's move on.
Mr. Sanchez.
( indistinct chatter )
Hi.
Are you Diane's doctor?
- Yes.
- I'm Diane's father.
Thank you for everything.
I was just coming to say good-bye.
My wife just took her down to the car.
Any last-minute advice?
Finish her pills.
She could relapse.
Okay, we'll do that.
Uh, I don't know how to say this, but my daughter took quite a shine to you.
She thought you two got on pretty well, and she wondered if I might ask you over for dinner on Friday.
Friday.
Yes.
That'd be nice.
- Great.
- Friday.
We'll count on it.
See you then.
8:00 Friday.
Hello, Diane.
You feeling better?
How are you feeling?
Mr. Nixon.
Mrs. Nixon.
( doorbell rings )
- Mrs. Nixon:
Is that the doctor?
- Uh, yeah.
Let him in, for God's sake.
- Hi.
Come on in.
- Hi.
Mrs. Nixon:
Welcome to our home.
Oh, you remember Valerie, right?
Hi.
I love yourjacket.
Thanks.
And this is our youngest, Donny.
- Hello.
- What's up?
- Not much.
- Please sit down.
- Where's Diane?
- Oh, she's out.
I told her to stay so that she didn't seem ungrateful, because we really are.
But she's having a talk with Rich.
So what's it like being a doctor?
A lot of work.
A lot of responsibility.
But I like it.
How many operations you do a week?
I'm in internal medicine.
What's that, like, intestines?
Donny, not at the table.
That'd be great.
Get in there and just dig around.
- ( laughs )
- I don't do surgery.
Donny:
I bet it pays pretty well, doesn't it, being a doctor?
Donny, don't pry.
It's actually less than you think, but it's a lot more than I'd make back home.
Bet he makes more than you do, Donny.
Besides, the money comes when you go into private practice, right?
You got a nice place?
It's okay.
The beach.
Oh, I love the beach.
You're so lucky.
I wish I lived by the beach and knew all this incredible knowledge about the human body.
- You know plenty.
- Donny, you pig!
- Stop...
- Mrs. Nixon:
Valerie!
- Mom!
- He started it.
Moron, this was brand-new.
You're just gonna get sperm on it anyway.
Ow!
Let's not have that kind of language at the table there, guy.
Mrs. Nixon:
Honestly, Donny.
I am so sorry, Doctor.
It's okay.
( clears throat )
- Could I use your restroom?
- Certainly.
- It's down the hall on the right.
- Excuse me.
What, Mom?
He's a doctor.
It's not like he's never heard of sperm before.
- Hey!
- You are upsetting your father.
Mr. Nixon:
Where do you come up with this stuff?
- Oh!
- Sorry.
( water running )
( family chatting )
It's just something came up at the hospital, and I really have to go.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
( car alarm chirps )
Okay, that's it.
Have a good day, everyone.
Thanks.
I'll see you there.
Waylans:
Blake, can you stay for a second, please?
Sure.
Have a seat.
So how's it going?
Fine.
Oh, yeah?
Tired?
A little.
Happy?
Want some coffee?
No, thanks.
First year of residency can be tough, I know.
If this is about Mr. Sanchez...
I just wanted to chat about the big picture.
Tell me something, Martin, when did you first want to become a doctor?
- When?
- Yeah.
A long time ago, I guess.
Did you know why?
Why?
Because... a friend of my mother's was a doctor and he was respected, and I guess I just always thought, you know, to have that respect and to... and be helping people.
( slurps )
Yeah, people go into medicine for all kinds of reasons.
You know, sometimes they don't really think about it till they're here, face-to-face with it all.
And sometimes they realize the stress and the hours and the nature of the work aren't what they thought it would be.
I mean, it's not unusual for people to realize maybe this isn't what they wanted after all.
This is what I want.
I mean, I know I can do better.
It's just taking time for me to learn your system here.
I mean, I didn't have all the advantages, you know, growing up and school, and so sometimes
I just have to work harder, and I do.
Some of the nurses, I mean...
Maryanne's fine, but with Theresa...
I double-majored in chemistry and biology.
I went to school, I did all this work, and she just treats me like I'm some nobody.
It doesn't seem fair, but...
I do want this.
( people chatting )
( women laughing )
Hi, Martin, it's Valerie Nixon.
It was really nice to see you the other night.
I'm sorry you had to rush off.
My mom actually got you a gift basket, but we forgot to give it to you.
So I don't know if you wanted to arrange a time to come by and get it, or I could drop it by the hospital or your apartment, if you like.
So give us a call.
I'm home anytime but tonight.
- Okay, bye.
- ( beeps )
( water running )
( car alarm chirps )
Oh, Dr. Blake, come in.
Thank you.
Can I get you some coffee or anything?
No, thanks.
Valerie called.
She mentioned there was something for me to collect?
- Yeah.
- But I'm expected at the hospital.
Oh, of course.
Could I use your restroom?
Certainly.
- You remember where it was?
- Yeah.
( water running )
( blowing )
- Oh, here you go.
- Thank you.
It's just a little something to say thanks.
Thanks again, Doctor.
Are there any special instructions for Diane?
Just finish her medicine.
Mrs. Nixon:
I thought it was just malaise from hanging around the house so much.
I told you, it's pyelonephritis.
Ow.
I thought she was all better.
It did seem that way.
We'll run some tests to make sure.
But there are some resistant strains that are harder to treat.
Hey, Doc!
Hey, it's nice to have the little number back in 324, huh?
I don't think it's appropriate you talk about the patients in that manner.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hippocratic oath, right?
Yeah.
I need a cam profile.
- We need the ultrasound.
- Getting it.
- Here's one here.
- All right.
Who's the primary doctor?
Where's the chart?
What is this?
This doesn't make sense.
Another allergic reaction, Doctor?
No, this is something else.
See?
Vancomycin.
Not a penicillin reaction.
It wasn't my mistake.
Yeah, looks like red man syndrome.
Well, it can happen when...
When someone misadministers vancomycin.
Which doesn't surprise me because I never thought that Theresa, beyond her attitude, was all that sharp about these things.
Right, I'll look into it.
How's everything else?
I see the Nixon girl is back.
Yeah.
She said she took her oral meds.
But I'll do a resistance culture just to be sure.
All right.
Keep up the good work.
So, can't keep away.
It seems that way.
I'm sorry.
I'm not.
You don't want to go back to school?
Rich?
The medicine you're on now is much stronger.
You'll get better very soon.
Do I have to?
( chuckles )
( television playing )
( door slams )
- Ooh!
- Oh, I'm really so sorry, Doctor.
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.
Maryanne, I'm really busy...
You know what?
They just let me go.
And before you hear it from anyone else,
I messed up Mr. Sanchez's vancomycin.
I switched the sheet and I just panicked.
I'm just sorry if I jeopardized a patient.
I thought it was Theresa.
No.
She didn't know anything about it.
Oh, so sorry to hold you up.
It's fine.
Excuse me.
Sorry, Doctor.
Good morning.
- How are you feeling?
- The same, I guess.
Your temperature's up a little.
Is that bad?
It's nothing serious, but you might have to stay an extra day or two.
Is that bad?
No.
That's fine.
Why don't you check in on me?
( squeaking )
( whispering )
- Woman:
Someone's coming.
- Man:
Shh, shh.
- Someone's coming.
- What are you talking about?
No one comes down here.
I promise you, baby.
- Ahem.
- Oh, hey, Doc.
- Uh...
- Get off me.
We were just talking.
( both giggling )
Is this woman under sedation?
It's cool, man.
It's just a party, man.
Shit, it was her idea anyway.
Mandy, tell the doctor you're okay.
Doctor, I'm okay.
( laughing )
What are you doing down here, Doc?
Is there something I could help you with?
Just get her out of here.
All right, let's get you back to bed now, Mandy.
Mm-hmm.
Nice work, Doc.
( quietly ) Son of a bitch.
Mandy:
Is he paranoid?
Jimmy:
Doc's all right.
He's just a little uptight.
( softly ) Weren't you off at midnight?
Yes.
I just had some things to finish.
This patient's been a difficult case.
Everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.
Why don't you go home, Doctor?
( door chimes )
My biggest concern would be an abscess or some kind of resistant bacterial strain.
An abscess is doubtful.
Keep your eye on the resistance culture.
We are seeing more resistance in these.
I was gonna start her on ceftazidime.
Well, if she doesn't start stabilizing, we're gonna have to move her to icu.
And keep an eye out for sepsis.
How often are you checking signs?
- Two hours.
- Okay.
Good.
Let me know what the resistance culture says.
I will.
What does that mean?
Your infection might be a little tougher than we thought.
( winces )
We're starting you on another antibiotic, and we need to make sure that you're not developing sepsis.
What's that?
An intravascular infection.
An intra what?
It's in the bloodstream.
- Is that serious?
- It can be.
I didn't think doctors had to do that.
I don't mind.
If I have an operation, will you operate on me?
I don't operate.
Hmm.
I don't want to cut into people.
That's why I went into internal medicine.
If I do my job right, we never have to go in at all.
- ( water running ) - ( cell phone rings )
( turns off )
I don't want to talk to him.
Well, don't... think about it too much.
You need rest.
I know.
Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm looking for Diane Nixon.
I'm afraid she can't take visitors.
Look, man, we had this big bust-up.
I just need to see her for two minutes.
It's not a good idea.
Just leave her alone for a little while.
She needs rest.
Give this to her.
Sure.
( pops )
You should be sleeping.
I can't.
What did the expert say?
He said it's a difficult case, but we're gonna work together on it and everything's gonna be okay.
There's something I didn't tell you about before I came back to the hospital.
I don't know if it's what could have made me get sick again.
What's that?
I had sex with Rich before I finished my medication.
That can upset your urinary tract, right?
I don't think that's what did it.
I didn't think you two were going out anymore.
You know how sometimes you do things you know you shouldn't, but you just can't help it?
Yeah.
I'm not gonna die, am I?
No, of course not.
I always thought if I was gonna die,
I wanted to, like, get shot stopping a crime or something.
I know that's stupid.
Do you ever think about stuff like that?
When I was younger, maybe.
It's silly.
What did you imagine?
I would think about just walking into the ocean and just disappearing like I never existed.
And the world would just go on without me.
I love the ocean.
I'm not sure I've seen anything quite like this.
Yeah, it's been a tough case.
They had an Acinetobacter at South East General, but I've never seen one of these so resistant before.
You've been doing regular cultures to check against some other bug, maybe some nosocomial thing?
I considered that, but nothing's come up in cultures.
Martin's been very thorough.
He's done everything I would have done.
And she's been properly administered all along?
Yes.
Well, Martin, it looks like you've landed yourself a tricky one.
I drew up the protocol to treat the sepsis... shoot.
I must have left it in my car.
I'm due upstairs.
Would you mind?
No.
No, I was just about to grab lunch.
Silver Mercedes, Johns Hopkins stickers.
And it's in the back.
( door beeping )
( engine starts )
( seat belt warning beeps )
( classical music playing )
( turns off )
It's a tube that goes into your heart.
It doesn't hurt.
So you can look in any time you want?
Yeah.
If you had one, too, we could have a heart-to-heart.
Doctor, we're ready to proceed.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
Just kind of groggy.
They put pain medicine into your iv.
Any pain from the catheter?
No.
It's weird.
I feel kinda nice, actually.
Can I ask you a question?
Of course.
You're not married or don't have a girlfriend or anything.
What's the question?
Why not?
You know how people are in the world.
Yeah.
You know, for a while, I thought you liked my sister.
No.
Good, she's a slut.
You don't want a girl like that.
( softly ) Doctor.
( pager beeps )
I know, I did it myself.
Where is she?
Excuse me.
Who?
Diane Nixon.
Oh, they took her for an mri.
I just got a code four.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where is she?
!
- Doctor:
Epinephrine.
- Nurse:
Epinephrine in.
Start Lidocaine drip.
( flatlining )
Nurse:
Get the defibrillator.
Doctor:
Set it to 102.
- Charge.
- Clear!
( pulses )
( heart monitor beeping )
( flatlining )
Doctor:
Start CPR.
Hold CPR.
- Clear!
- We're clear!
( pulses )
Yeah.
Yeah, that's it.
Call it.
Theresa:
Dr. Blake?
- Dr. Blake?
- Yes?
Sorry about yesterday, the Nixon girl.
She seemed nice.
She was.
Thank you.
- Dr. Blake?
- Yes?
Dr. Waylans would like to see you in conference room three.
You wanted to see me?
Yes, Martin.
Take a seat.
This the first time this has happened?
Yes.
I never meant it to happen.
It just... got out of control.
Well, this is Dr. Sayler.
She's a psychiatrist on staff here.
Hello, Martin.
It's always hard to lose a patient, especially the first time.
You always question yourself.
You wonder if you made mistakes, if you missed something, could you have been quicker?
These things happen.
Accepting that is part of being a doctor.
If there's anything you want to express, please don't hold back.
Can I ask you a question?
Okay.
Did you cry yesterday?
I did, yes.
Good.
That's good.
Oh, Mr. Nixon, I am so sorr...
Just want to talk to the doctor.
You killed my little girl.
Okay, Mr. Nixon, I am truly sorry for your loss, but you cannot come onto my ward and start accusing my doctors.
That bastard killed my daughter.
What is the problem, sir?
She was fine, then she came in here and you killed her.
Martin, let me handle this.
Sir, these infections can be very difficult to treat.
It was a rare, resistant strain.
Now, if she didn't take every one of her pills, that could strengthen the infection.
We don't know.
She took her pills.
She told me.
Don't blame Dr. Blake, sir.
I supervised him through the entire case.
He was exemplary in every way.
We did everything we could.
Everything, all of us.
Sir, can you come with me, please?
- Sir.
- Get your hands off me.
You bastards.
( over radio ) Is the situation under control, or do you need backup?
Everything's fine.
We're coming out.
( sighs ) I'm sorry, Martin.
You shouldn't have to deal with that.
It's a tough one.
Yeah.
Don't worry about it.
Waylans told me you're not really a doctor until you've lost a patient.
( car alarm chirps )
( alarm beeping )
( clapping )
You got your scrubs.
Hey, hold up.
Going to x-ray, Mr. Granger?
There's no hearing aid.
Right, Mr. Granger, you crazy old fucker?
So it must be a relief to get onto that new rotation.
Sounds like that last one was pretty rough.
These things happen, unfortunately.
It's part of being a doctor, dealing with loss.
Oh.
So I guess you're a doctor now.
I suppose so.
You know what I always thought would be the best part about being a doctor?
It's the ladies.
The ladies love a doctor.
You find that to be true?
I suppose so, yes.
No.
What do you mean?
( elevator doors open )
Meet me in the east tower basement, five minutes.
- Why?
- I think you know.
( elevator doors open )
What is it?
Well, Doctor, I just wanted to ask you an ethical question about the relations between staff and patients.
That woman in the supply room?
Forget about it.
No, no, no, no, that's not my question.
See, I'm more interested in a situation like this.
All right, say a guy like me, you know, who likes to party, but otherwise is a regular guy, like an orderly, one day, he's taking this gurney to change it out... oh, and the previous tenant was this girl,
this sweet girl, she just passed away.
Anyway, this guy's taking out the mattress, and to his surprise, finds a little book under there.
And, well, there's some really shocking stuff in there about this one young doctor.
Seems they had kind of a little special relationship going on.
Now my question is this, do you think it's wrong, ethically, for this orderly to keep this book from his superiors?
Let's take a ride.
What do you want?
Another reason I wish I was a doctor is so I could prescribe myself a better time.
I party, and nobody sees this.
I can't do that.
Where there's a will, there's a way, right?
Nurse:
Ahem, Doctor?
Uh, I had a question about this order.
Is it my handwriting?
Uh, no, I can read it, it's just you prescribed oxycodone for Mr. Granger?
He's had some pain from the Hickman catheter, so, yeah.
Okay, sorry, I just wanted to check.
Do you need help?
No, thanks.
What's troubling you?
What?
That's for stomachs, and that stuff's more for, like, sniffling and sneezing.
I know.
I'm a doctor.
Okay, sorry.
Dude, four?
They're hard to get.
I hope this is a down payment.
Okay, fine.
What about the book?
- What about it?
- When do I get it back?
You never had it.
I'm not gonna do this indefinitely.
( plastic cup clatters )
I don't think you have much of a choice, Doctor.
Time you switched to decaf?
Mmm.
Cheers.
Rotation wasn't so tough.
And they say the second half of the year, everything gets easier.
Martin.
I'm sorry to hear about your patient.
- Difficult case.
- Yes, it was.
I've been doing a study of these resistant bugs and was hoping you might be able to help me review this one if you kept your notes and charts together.
Dr. Waylans tells me you're thinking of applying for the lD fellowship.
Yes, I am.
I think that's a fine idea.
Fine idea.
Yo, Doc.
Is this the patient?
Yes.
- James?
- Yeah?
I'd like to talk to you when you get a chance.
Yeah, I get off in 30 minutes.
Great.
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hi.
Hey there, partner.
You got it?
Those are different.
They're more like morphine.
They're better.
I want the book.
Oh.
Maybe soon.
Really?
No, that's not gonna work for me.
You just keep 'em coming, you'll be all right.
Have fun.
You know I will.
What are you doing?
You can't take those here.
Why not?
I'm off duty.
You shouldn't drive on them.
I got a ride.
What's with you, man?
Dude, don't make a big deal out of this.
We're all human beings.
We all gotta get our kicks somehow.
What are you doing?
Don't follow me.
I'm just walking.
Get away from me.
You're making this more than it has to be, Doc.
- You want more?
- Yeah.
- You want more?
- Sure, yeah.
All right.
( wheezes )
( coughing )
( grunts )
( groans )
( grunts )
( sputters )
( retches )
( retching continues )
( grunts )
( pounding on door )
( groans )
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
Some kind of seizure.
Call a code, he's gone into arrest!
All right, all right.
I got it.
Okay.
Okay, Jimmy!
Jimmy, can you hear me?
Jimmy?
- ( groans )
- Okay, okay, okay.
Jimmy, it's Dr. Waylans.
Jimmy!
- ( shivering )
- Jimmy, stay with me.
Jimmy.
Stay with us.
- I got the elevator.
- All right, good.
- So was he sick or anything?
- I don't know.
He went into some kind of seizure.
I tried to help.
I wouldn't be surprised if it was some sort of drug overdose.
What makes you think that?
His very erratic behavior.
Some of the nursing staff, it occurred to them that he might be a drug abuser.
They had a mandatory test scheduled.
Perhaps you should go home.
Take a break.
Get back to the business of being a doctor on Monday.
You off tomorrow?
Yup.
Okay with you, Detective, if the good doctor here goes home?
Uh, yeah, I guess.
If we have any more questions, we'll be in touch, if you don't mind.
No, not at all.
( Diane's voice overlapping ) I'm pretty sure Rich was there.
He kissed me right as I was leaving.
Went to the hospital today.
They want to keep me overnight.
Rich asked me to be his girlfriend.
The diagnosis isn't anything bad.
He said he loved me, but he doesn't act like it.
It looks like a uti.
If you love someone, set them free.
I spent the night at Rich's.
They called a specialist.
He carried me into the bedroom and laid me down.
I can't believe he's hanging out with Jenny.
He looks at me like I'm some lab rat in a cage.
He's such a liar.
Having surgery tomorrow.
I have sepsis.
They put the tube in this morning.
It's an infection.
The anesthesia was great.
It's actually kinda nice.
Gave me the weirdest dreams.
Why is this happening to me?
It's so quiet.
- ( knocking at door )
- I can't sleep.
I'm not getting any better.
( knocking continues )
( sighs )
( opens door )
Detective:
Dr. Blake?
Martin:
Yes.
Detective Krauss, from the hospital yesterday.
You said if we had any more questions...
I'm sorry to just drop by like this.
Martin:
Right.
Fine, come in.
( door closes )
Can I get you anything?
No, thanks.
So it seems the, uh, the pills Mr. Vega took were spiked with potassium cyanide.
- You know about that?
- No.
Well, yeah, I mean, I know what it is.
Some people suspect that he abused drugs.
Looks like maybe he got a bad batch.
That's a shame.
I mean, I didn't know him that well.
That's why I'm not as upset as I would be if I knew him better.
I knew him to say hello to.
Did you ever see him taking drugs?
No.
I hardly knew him, like I said.
( paper rustling )
( pen scratches )
You have a pen I could borrow?
Thanks.
You knew this orderly?
Just slightly.
Not well.
Kind of.
I mean, he was not my kind of person.
Do you know where he got the drugs?
Could he have gotten them from the hospital?
Stolen them?
No, they're carefully monitored, so I don't know how an orderly could.
Only a doctor can prescribe.
Could a doctor have gotten them for him?
Theoretically a doctor could... fake a prescription or skim from a patient.
But that wouldn't be ethical, so they don't.
So a doctor could have gotten these?
No.
Did any doctors have any kind of a relationship with Mr. Vega?
What?
No, I...
I don't know.
I mean, like I said, I didn't care for him, so I didn't hang around him.
Were there any other doctors who may have disliked him, who could've tainted the pills with the, uh...
Potassium cyanide.
( laughs ) Look, uh... ( clears throat ) I'm sorry if I seem distracted.
I understand.
It must be tough trying to get back to normal after seeing somebody die like that.
It has been... especially with her.
Who?
No one.
Just... a patient died.
It was a resistant strain of an infection.
They're rare, but increasingly common.
Antibiotics and cleansers are making germs tougher.
It was a difficult case, everyone agreed.
I know I must seem like I'm reacting differently now than with James' passing away, but he wasn't much of a person.
I mean, he'd make lewd comments at women patients.
I think he may have even fooled around with them, which, as a doctor, you can't.
Diane was a very nice girl.
We were close.
In a doctor-patient way, before she died.
But that's over now, and I'm back to the business of being a doctor.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Well, you know where I am, Detective, if you have any more questions.
( chuckles )
Excuse me a moment.
- Doctor?
- Just a second.
Mind if I have a glass of water?
No, not at all.
Help yourself.
( police radio chatter )
I'm sorry.
I need to collect some things.
I'm needed at the hospital.
Do you have any more questions?
I'm afraid I'm in a bit of a hurry.
Well, no.
I guess not.
I'll let you get ready, then.
Thanks for your help, Doctor.
My pleasure.
( door opens, closes )
His HH are 12 and 36.
WBC 10.9 with a slight shift to the left.
He's on a broad-spectrum antibiotic.
I'm about to hang his third dose.
Let's do blood cultures now and times two for a temporary, then 101.
- Yeah.
- Is it gonna hurt?
A little, but don't worry.
I'm getting better all the time.
Make a fist.
- Doctor?
- Yes.
( instrumental music playing )
Martin
We and touches us.
How come you fell asleep so fast?
Ambition, a good diet, concentration, good communication.
Got a new support?
I heard that is part of the family and used be his.
Well, in that case ...
As I like.
Are you going to that thing for the new residence?
I do not know.
- Carson's daughter will be there.
- Who is Carson?
Cardiology.
It is the best in that specialty.
Mark's time we start looking for that trophy wife.
Bring it back!
Dr.Leary,4152.
Doctor Leary, 4152.
As it is, sir ...
- Sanchez?
- I do not speak English.
- Do not speak Spanish.
- Doctor, mind you.
I s ent b in here in my chest.
I have a lot of pain, much, much pain here.
- I need medicine, I feel good.
- Please wait for me a moment.
- Please, Doctor!
- Doctor Pange, do you speak Spanish?
No.
Can you cough?
.
Right.
Ok, you need descanzar enough.
- Rest.
Sleep.
Resting.
- Rest.
So, is that you need ok?
The results are negative.
What proposals are for this case?
I thought we should discard it.
Ell has the syndrome are and is likely to have a slow death.
So, is something that can be a pain chronic.
- What are you talking about a divorce?
.
- Did you talk to her?
- No, not on things like that.
- We are talking about a syndrome.
Communication is the key to everything.
- Blake!
- Yes?
- Blake, things are going well?
- Yes
I was wondering, the infection is exposed to the disease?
- Yes
- Okay so I wanted to say.
Do you have any advice?
Missing 6 days for the residence, you can not apply until next year.
I just want to be prepared.
Oh well not much to do.
A great candidate is simply a good doctor.
Clear.
That means you're a good doctor.
Is not Martin?
It acts like one.
- I do, I do.
- Well then you're fine.
- Doctor Waylans!
- Yes, Martin?
Can I re-take the photo identification?
I have no idea!
- Excuse me, what does it say here?
- Penicillin.
Excuse me, when will the doctor?
I am the doctor.
Ok, that's all for now.
¿Nurse, doing this procedure?
You'll have to do it yourself.
Do you know how to do it?
Yeah, thanks.
Is that right?
Sorry, we assume that a nurse do this type of thing.
- A what?
- This will drain some blood.
Doctors do not do this.
Very good.
Ok.
There you are!
I'm so sorry, I thought you were someone else!
Who thought it was?
I already knew.
So, for a minute I thought it was you!
There is only one, that's my rule.
He is Martin, She is Christine Martin.
- Hello.
- She is the daughter of Dr. Carson.
Well, again you were a nerd Total high school.
That's right!
- Really?
- Yes!
One day I realized that he would die virgin.
With a couple of Mexicans we can make it all happen.
- Make it happen, why?
- What if you're just something useful?
Jimmy, come on.
Good morning, Doctor.
Hey.
- How do you feel?
- Mal
What do I have?
Pilonefritis, is a disease in the kidney.
Pilonefritis.
Like this?
Pilonefritis.
Sit back,
OK?
- Do you feel pain?
- Yes
- Here?
- Yes
Pilonefritis.
- Can you die from it?
- Maybe.
If ever you take care of that, but for that is that we the doctors here.
- I'm just playing golf.
- I do not know how to play Golf.
I thought all doctors playing golf.
Ended.
- Oh, hello doctor.
- Doctor is a pleasure to see again.
How are you?
- Very well, responding to antibiotics.
I could die!
Right?
Just saying that could be serious.
But this completely under control.
You say that if I had not come to hospital in time, be dead?
I did not say that.
It's amazing to know how to save people that way.
I bet you an even, know the name of this.
- Philtrum!
- I told you I knew it!
- Hello!
- Hey Rich.
Hello Mrs. Nixon.
He is my doctor said I could have died.
- Doctor Blank?
- Hey.
What is good?
- How's it going?
- Well.
- You can walk or ...
- Then come back later.
You say penicillin, right?
- Yes
- Come with me, please.
Mr. Sanchez is penisilina allergic to.
Do not say that?
This tab is not even original ...
I do not know what you mean.
The orginal tab says NKAA, analysis.
Well, Would you ask?
Speak English, why you give penicillin?
Because you're the doctor, and I do what you say.
- Ok, traigámosle a ...
- I took care of that.
- Thank you.
- Where are you going?
- To make an incident report.
- Why?
This is an incident, is the procedure.
And can write this legibly?
What do you do?
I am looking for the original tab.
Sorry doctor, whatever it is looking for is not going to find here.
Hello beautiful, here I leave you this gift.
Is this seat taken?
Look, look, look.
Hey Nancy, Will you sit here?
So always.
- Excuse me, excuse me a second.
- Yes, no problem.
Doctor Waylans, ¿I can speak a second?
Insurance.
I wanted to ask about incident reports.
Is this thing on Mr. Sanchez?
Do not worry about that.
But do not go on my record?
That's bad.
I think not, I say, not a good thing.
¿It would affect my application for scholarship studying infectious diseases?
I can not undo it, if that is what you mean.
Itlooksgood.
Perfect wanted to discuss it.
You know, because I'm sick and I'm in the hospital, if you have not noticed.
Oh, please, you're an idiot!
Go to hell.
I'm improving.
So it seems.
All right?
Do you remember Rich?
Should end with him.
- Do you have to end it?
- It's not my business.
This is the most popular in school.
I was never the kid more popular in school.
And now ...
I am a doctor.
- What will you do?
- Do not know.
He's an idiot.
It's hard to end it because we been together a while.
I mean, I do not know if I love or something.
You know what they say.
What?
If you love someone, set them free.
- Who says that?
- Sting.
- What are you laughing?
- Who?
Excuse me, doctor?
I'm with a patient.
I can not make these orders until they are reviewed.
Do not close the door.
Do not close the door.
Hello Doctor!
- Is having a rough day, right?
- No, I'm fine.
Do not worry, I feel the same.
Every day is a fight, only to out of bed in the morning.
What floor is, doctor?
This is a hospital, the staff is supposed to follow orders, right?
Do doctors do not receive a little respect?
I do not know, perhaps, probably not what you think.
I just want things to be as they are supposed to be.
How long have you been working here, Teresa?
Do not you taught to deal with people like in medical school?
Just ignore them and do not follow the current.
And then, bam!
A heart attack!
Too bad!
Just kidding, Doc.
I think I know what I was thinking.
- Hello.
- Hello.
How do you feel?
- Well I guess.
What about that nurse?
That was a misunderstanding, All is well.
Should not dismiss her, or something, by yelling at a doctor?
Probably.
But I mean no problems.
Am I cured?
Almost.
No more hospital?
No.
Will you give me some advice?
Everyone says you're a good doctor.
Maybe I should leave.
Thank you.
You're a good patient.
Let's see, next.
No pain, no stitches, she can go from here.
Only one more day, to be sure.
No, I gave him high.
Mr. Sanchez ...
- Hello, is Dr. Diane?
- Yes
I am the parent of D BC, thanks for everything.
- I just came to say goodbye.
- My wife has just brought the car.
Any last minute advice?
To take your pills and is like new.
Ok, we will.
My daughter took a shine with you.
Fairly well cared for and ...
I wanted you to invite dinner at home on Friday.
Friday?
- Yes, on Friday would be fine.
- Great.
You will have then.
See you there, at 8 o'clock on Friday.
Hi Diane, you feel better?
How do you feel?
Mr. Nixon, Mrs. Nixon.
- Is the doctor?
- Yes, hello.
Hello, happens!
Welcome to our home.
- Oh, recalls Valerie, right?
- Hello, I love your jacket.
- Thank you.
- He is our youngest son, Donny.
- Hello?
- What is it?
Not much!
Sit down please.
- Where is Diane?
- Left.
I told him to stay, so they do not seems spoiled.
For in truth, We are very grateful, but ...
He's talking to Rich.
How is being a doctor?
Lots of work, a lot of responsibility, but I like it.
- How many operations a week ago?
- I still hospitalized.
- What is that, as a test?
- Dony, not in the table.
Let's mom I can not say anything?
I do not think it is just that.
I bet they pay very good doctors.
Donny, please.
It's less than you think, but is much more than he earned at home.
In addition, he earns more than you, Donny.
Besides the money comes, when you enter to a private, right?
- Have a nice house?
- Yes, okay.
- On the beach.
- Oh, I love the beach.
You're so lucky!
I want to live ... on the beach, and know as much on the human body.
You seem like ...
Do not be stupid!
Valerie!
- Mom!
- He started it!
- Mom this was new!
- As he drops cum!
No!
Look you know what nenesito you do, right?
Honestly, Donny!
- I'm so sorry doctor!
- Okay.
¿I can use your bathroom?
Sure, it's down the hall in his right hand.
What mom?
it's not like a doctor had never heard sperm.
A thousand apologies.
Ok, that's all.
Release tables.
Blake, Can we talk a minute?
Clear.
Sit down, please.
Well, how's it going?
Very good.
Yes, all right?
A little.
Are you happy?
Want some coffee?
No, no thanks.
I think we can talk about your residence.
If this is about mr.
Sanchez ...
I just wanted to talk of something more general.
Tell me something Martin?
When was the first time you wanted to be doctor?
- When?
- Yes
Makes a long time ago, I guess.
- Do you know why?
- Why?
Because ...
A friend of my mom was a doctor and, was quite respectable, and ...
I guess I always have thought that, respect.
And helping people.
Yeah, well, people change by all sorts of reasons.
Sometimes I do not believe or think about it, until they are here, face to face
With all this, some sometimes realize ... who are stressed, are long hours and ... the nature of work is not they thought it would be.
It is not unusual for people to see that maybe this ...
- Not what you want after all.
- This is what I want.
I can learn more, I just take something time to learn your system.
Actually I had no advantage growing up or going to school.
So sometimes I have to work harder, and I do.
But some of the nurses ...
I thought we had a career in chemical biology.
That nurse is me like a foolish child.
Does not seem fair, but ...
I do want to be here.
Hi Martin, I am Valerie Nixon, was very nice to see you the other night.
Too bad you have had to go so fast.
My mom bought you a bag of gifts, but give it forget.
So I do not know if you want to arrange a time to come and pick it up.
Or it could leave the hospital.
Or your department, if you want ...
So call us, I'll be home tonight.
Ok, bye!
- Oh, Doctor Blake, forward,
- Thank you.
- I can bring some coffee or something?
- No thanks.
Valerie called, Did he mention that there was something I could collect?
Yes.
- But I hope in the hospital.
- Oh, right!
- Could I use your bathroom?
- Certainly!
Do you remember where is it?
Oh, here.
- Thank you.
- It's something to thank him.
Thanks again Doc!
Are there any instructions Diane special?
Only you finish your medicine.
I thought it was just laziness, being much time at home.
I told you is Pilonefritis.
I thought it was better.
So it seemed.
We will do some analysis to be sure.
But there are some resistors that are difficult to treat.
Hey, Doc.
It's nice to have that pretty girl back in 324 right?
I do not think it is good that speak well of the patients.
Oh, I should not do it?
What is this?
This is nonsense!
- Forgot to give you something, Doctor?
- No.
This is something else.
See?
was no reaction penisilina, it was my mistake.
It seems that all is well, it happens ...
When someone does not administers the medicine well.
I'm not surprised because I never told Teresa anything about these things.
We will review, How is everything?
That girl Nixon, do you turn?
Yes, said he took all his medicines.
I will do a resistance test, just to be safe.
Very good, keep up the good work.
- You can not zoom out.
- So it seems.
Sorry.
I do not.
Do not want to go back to school?
¿Rich?
Now the virus is stronger.
You'll be fine, soon.
Do I have to?
I'm so sorry, doctor.
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.
They just say goodbye, will not be here for anyone else.
I missed the vincomizen Mr. Sanchez.
I changed the sheet, and just panicked.
I just feel sorry for having harmed to a patient.
- Where was Teresa?
- No, she did not know anything about it.
Oh, so sorry, I'll help.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Sorry doctor.
Good morning.
Good morning.
- How do you feel?
- Same, I guess.
I uploaded a little temperature.
I do not feel so bad.
Not bad, but you may have to stay a day or two.
Is that bad?
No, okay, while you are coming to see me.
God Hey, Doc
We were here, talking.
- Did this woman is in the hospital?
- It's all good, brother.
It's just a fun friend, just she is fine.
Mandy, tell the doctor you're okay.
Doctor, I'm fine.
What does down here, doc?
Is there something that can help?
Just leave here.
Very well have to return you, Mandy.
Good job, doc.
Son of a bitch.
- What are you doing here, at midnight.
- Yes, just had to finish some things.
The patient has been a difficult case.
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, everything is fine.
Go home to rest, Doc
My big concern is a access, or some kind of bacteria.
Oh, that's weird, resistance we have seen this.
Nomenzar would with a pair of analysis.
If not begin to stabilize, we have to move to ICU.
Keep it under surveillance, How often the vigils?
- Every two hours.
- Ok, let me know if you spend more.
What does that mean?
That your condition is a little more hard we thought.
We must ensure the antibiotic, which you are enduring.
What is that?
- An infection intravenal.
- A intra what?
The fluid is blood.
Is that serious?
It can be.
I did not think that doctors had to do that.
I do not mind it.
If I have to operate, Would it be you that I operate?
I do not trade.
I do not want to cut people.
The latter in internalized.
- I did my job, right?
- It's what you do.
I do not want to talk.
Expected.
I think too.
Need descanzar.
I know.
- I can help?
- Yes, I look for Diane Nixon.
I'm afraid I can not see you now.
Look friend had a great fight, I have only see two minutes.
Not a good idea, let alone only a little longer.
Need descanzar.
Can you give this?
Insurance.
You should be sleeping.
I can not.
What does the expert?
He said it is a difficult case, but we to work together on it.
Everything will be fine.
There's something I did not say.
Before you return to the hospital.
I do not know if all goes to make I get sick again.
What happened?
Rich had sex with before finish the medication.
Could that have affected my situation?
I think that was what happened.
But do not think that you will re sick.
Sometimes you do things he knows he should not.
But I just can not avoid.
Yes.
I not die, right?
No.
Of course not.
I always thought that if I was going to die, would not until ... die if someone shoot me stopping a crime, or something.
I know it's stupid.
Did you ever think you in such things?
When I was younger, maybe.
It's silly.
What imagined?
I was thinking of entering the ocean and disappear as if it never existed.
And the world would be without me.
I love the ocean.
I'm not sure have seen something like this before.
It is a difficult case.
I have seen this virus, but had never seen one as resistant to everything.
Have you been doing regular rounds seeing if there is another virus?
- Or something more advanced?
- I considered that, but nothing is ...
Nothing has gone to 100%.
I'm very happy, he did everything what I would do in a case.
What has been administered properly?
Yes.
Well Martin ...
Seems to have landed in a rather difficult.
I did a protocol to treat it.
Hell, I should have left in my car!
- I left it up, would you mind?
- No.
- No, that's fine.
- A silver Mercedes.
Back Fast!
- You will not feel anything, does not hurt.
- Will you see me, when you want?
Yes.
So you're going to see the inside my heart?
Hey!
How do you feel?
Right.
Just a little odd.
They are putting you drug in the blood.
What's in pain?
No, the truth is strange, I feel good.
¿I can ask you a question?
Of course.
You're not married, or have a girlfriend or something?
Why you ask?
Why not?
You know how people are.
Yes?
For a while I thought you liked my sister.
No.
Good, because it is a bitch.
You do not want a girl like that.
- I know, I did it myself.
- Where is it?
Excuse me, who?
- Diane Nixon!
- She was taken for an MRI.
- I see it.
I do not know what you mean.
Where is it!
DoctorBlake.
-DoctorBlake.
- Yes
Sorry about yesterday, Nixon for the girl.
He seemed friendly.
It was, thanks.
- Doctor Blake?
- Yes?
The Doctor is waiting Waylans in conference room 3.
You wanted to see me?
Yes, Martin.
Sit.
Is it the first time this has happened?
Yes.
I never wanted to happen, just ...
I had it under control.
Well talk to Sally, she is a psychiatrist.
Hello, Martin.
It's always hard to lose a patient.
Especially the first time.
Do you question it?
Wondering if you made mistakes?
If you missed something?
If you could be faster.
These things happen.
It is the other part of being a doctor.
If there is anything you want to express ... please do not keep it.
¿I can ask you a question?
Ok.
Did you cry today?
I did, yes.
Very good.
That is good.
- Mr. Nixon.
- I have to talk to the doctor.
- You killed my baby.
- Ok.
Mr. Nixon, really sorry for her loss, but can not come here ...
- And start to accuse my doctors
- That bastard killed my daughter.
Is there a problem, sir?
She was fine, then came here and he killed her.
Martin, let me handle this, that Mr. infection was very difficult to treat.
It was very rare, if she had not taken all your pills ...
That could have given more power to infection, do not know.
She took her pills, told me.
Do not blame the dr.
Blake, supervised throughout the case in everything he did.
We did everything we could, However, all of us.
Lord, please Am I with?
- Sir?
- Let go, go alone.
Bastards.
It's all good, man.
It is enough to have to deal with guilt.
It was a tough one.
Do not worry, they say you're not a doctor ... really until lose to a patient.
Hey, you look like one of "Scrubs"
Hey, wait!
How are you, Mr. Granger?
Do not listen to Mr. Grangger truth, crazy bastard.
You must be relieved that you could passing notation.
It seems that the last was quite difficult.
One of the things unfortunate to be a doctor.
Dealing with losses.
That's being a doctor, right?
.
So it seems.
You know what I thought it would the best part of being a doctor?
Women.
They love to doctors.
- Do you already have a lady with you?
- By the way, yes.
No, what do you mean?
Come, come and see.
- What is it?
- Well doctor, I wanted to ask you a question.
On the relations between staff and patients.
That woman in the room supplements?
Forget it.
No, that's not my question, I am more interested in such a situation.
Let's say a guy like me, who likes to party.
A standard rate, regardless of my age.
One day he decides to change everything.
Before there was a girl, but just death, as this guy ... takes the mattress, and to his surprise ... find a book under it.
Well, there are some things about a Dr. young ...
It seems they had something special.
My question is this:
Think is wrong, ethically, this situation ... the fact of staying with this book ... or give to superiors.
Let's take a walk.
Where do we go?
Another reason would be doctor, for prescribirme a better time.
I leave party and no one will see this.
I can not do that.
Well there is always a way, right?
Doctor?
I have a question about this.
- What is it?
- I can read it.
It is something that has to do with Mr. Granger.
Yes, you may do it, then yes.
Ok, fine, I just wanted to check it.
- Need Help?
- No thanks.
- What bothers you?
- What?
That is for the stomach.
And that's more for sneezing.
I know, I'ma doctor.
Ok ...
Sorry.
What?
¿4?
- They are difficult to obtain.
- I hope this is what I ordered.
Yes, well.
- What's the book?
- What about him?
- When you give me?
- You want it?
We will not do this then.
I believe there is another option, doctor.
Now switched to decaf?
Health.
I told you that the rotations were not so difficult.
This time of year everything is easier.
Martin!
I'm sorry about your patients.
- It was a difficult case.
- Yes, it was.
I was doing a study on these resistant virus, was waiting ... who may want help to review this virus, in particular.
If you saved your notes and cards.
I heard that you are applying for research grant.
Yes.
I think it's a good idea.
Very good idea!
What's up, Doc?
- Is this the patient?
- Yes
- James.
- Yes
I would like to talk to you when you have time.
Yes, I leave in 30 minutes.
Clear.
Hey, buddy.
Got it?
It looks different.
Is morphine.
It's better than normal, I want the book.
Yes ..
I will soon.
Really?
No, it will not work for me just keep bringing me things.
Have fun!
You know I will!
What are you doing?
You can not take it here.
Why not?
I'm out of service.
You should not drive with that in the system.
I have who takes me.
What's up friend?
Do not do like a big deal.
We are all human beings.
What are you doing?
Do not follow me.
- I'm just walking.
- Stay away from me!
You're doing this more rare than that has to be, friend.
You know what?
- Want more?
- Yes, sure.
- What is happening?
- I do not know, some kind of infection!
Call someone!
I have it, I have.
Jimmy, Jimmy!
Can you hear me?
Jimmy, I'm Dr. Waylans!
Jimmy!
Jimmy, stay with me!
Jimmy!
Stay with us.
- He was sick or something?
- Do not know.
He went into some kind of attack, I tried to help.
I would not be surprised if some type of drug overdose.
What makes you think that?
These symptoms are very normal.
Some nurses were account may be abusing drugs.
We had a scan, to confirm.
Maybe you should go home, relax, returns to be a doctor on Monday.
Is it OK?
Yes.
Ok, ok if this detective Doctor goes home?
Well ... yeah, I guess.
If you have any other questions or ...
I do not know, we could be in contact if you do not mind.
Not at all.
-Dr.Blake?
- Yes
DetectiveBrownof thehospital.
saidhecouldtalktoyouif had more questions.
Sorry well come without warning.
course,pass.
- I can get you anything?
- No thanks.
It seems that the pills mr.
Vega taken, were mixed with potassium.
Do you know what that is?
- No.
Well, something that I know.
Some people suspected who abused drugs.
- Seems to have had a bad patch.
- I see.
I mean, did not know him so well, perhaps know to tell if you know better.
Greeted him.
- Have you ever saw him taking drugs?
- No.
I hardly knew him, as I said.
Do you have a pen I can borrow?
Thank you.
- Did you know him too little?
- Yes, very little.
Not even that.
I mean, he was ... not my type of person.
Do you know where could drugs have gotten?
- Do you think got into the hospital?
- No, they are very careful.
Only a doctor can prescribe.
Do you know a Doctor he could deal given?
Theoretically, a doctor can ... make a prescription false for a patient ... but it would be unethical, so do not.
So ...
Did a doctor may have achieved something?
No!
Do you know a doctor who may have had any relationship with him?
What?
No, do not know.
As I said, I did not care much, so do not go out much with him.
Are there any other doctor, maybe he did not like?
Or they could have altered the pills ...
- With the ...
- Cyanide of potassium.
Look, I'm sorry if you it seems distracted.
I understand.
It must be difficult to return to normal after seeing someone die like that.
Yes. has been ...
Especially with it.
Who?
No one.
Only one patient of mine who died.
He had a rare infection.
He started up his infection, very rare.
And in the end could not hold your body.
It was a difficult case, all are agree with that.
Not to sound a maniac but ... was not a good person, he grotezcos comments to patients.
I think I even could have had something to some.
As a doctor, you can not do that.
Diane was a very pretty girl.
We were very close.
In a way, with a ratio of doctor / patient before he died.
But that's over and I can back to being a doctor.
Is it a beautiful day, right?
Well you know where I am detective.
If you have further questions.
Excuse me.
- Doctor?
- A second!
- Is there a problem?
- No, no, no!
All right!
Sorry, I have to collect some things I need in the hospital.
Do you have any other questions?
I'm afraid I'm a little late.
Well, no ...
I guess not.
I'll let him get ready then.
- Thanks for your help doctor.
- The pleasure is all mine.
WBC 1237 at 10:49 is in prospect yet.
I gave him some antibiotics, I am by give him his third dose.
- Time to put the time to 101.
- Yes
- Will it hurt?
- A little.
But do not worry, improved each time, make a fist.
- Doctor!
- Yes?
Martin.
Come on, we're on.
How do you get by with so little sleep?
Ambition, good diet.
Constant self-medication.
Time you got a new bag?
I got this from a friend of the family.
- It used to be his.
- Oh, well, in that case...
I kinda like it.
You going to that thing for the new residents?
I don't know.
Carson's daughter's gonna be there.
Who's Carson?
Radiology.
Supposedly his daughter's a real peach.
Come on, Martin,
Time to start looking for that trophy wife.
Bring the bag.
Dr. Levy, 4152.
How are you...
Mr. Sanchez?
No Hablo Ingles.
Oh.
- No Hablo Espanol.
- Doctor,
Excuse me one...
On moment.
Por favor, doctor...
Dr. Page?
Do you speak Spanish?
No.
Can you cough?
Thank you.
Okay, you need a lot of rest.
Rest.
Sleep.
You need to rest.
- Yes.
That's what you need.
Okay?
The barium pictures were negative.
Why the D-Xyclose absorption series?
I felt I should rule out Zollinger-Ellison syndrome,
Whipple's disease, and celiac.
I say mild peptic ulcer.
I mean, possible chronic reflux.
Smokes, drinks...
filed for divorce.
I didn't know about the divorce.
Did you talk to her?
Not about stuff like that.
We're not fishing for syndromes here, folks.
Communication is key.
- Dr. Waylans.
- Yes?
Ah.
Martin...
Blake.
Things going okay?
Yeah.
I was wondering,
You did the infectious diseases fellowship?
Yeah.
Well, I'm applying.
Do you have any advice?
You're only six days into residency.
You can't even apply till next year.
I just want to be prepared.
Oh.
Well, it's not much.
You know, a good candidate is just a good doctor.
Right.
You do know the secret to being a good doctor,
Don't you, Martin?
You act like one.
I do, I think.
Well, then, you're fine.
- Dr. Waylans?
- Yes, Martin?
Is it possible to get our I.D. Picture retaken?
I have no idea.
Excuse me, what does that say?
Penicillin.
Excuse me, when will the doctor be here?
I am the doctor.
Okay, that's it for now.
Nurse?
I'll need labs drawn.
You're gonna have to do it yourself...
We're swamped.
You know how, right?
Yes.
Of course.
Thank you.
Is that okay?
Sorry.
A phlebotomist is supposed to do this.
A what?
It's who draws the blood.
Doctors aren't supposed to have to do this.
There you go.
Okay.
Here you are.
I'm so sorry, I thought you were someone else.
Who did you think I was?
I see you've met my esteemed colleague.
I did.
For a minute, I thought he was you.
There's only one of me.
That's the rule.
This is Martin.
Martin, this is Christine.
- Hi.
- Dr. Carson's daughter.
So back to you being such a big nerd in high school.
- The biggest.
- Really?
Yep.
And then one day I realized
I was gonna die a virgin.
That thought can come as quite a shock to a young man.
Don't you have some other rooms to attend to?
Let's just be a couple dirty Mexicans and make it happen.
Make what happen?
How 'bout I just talk to you?
Let's make ourselves useful.
Jimmy, come on.
Yo.
Good morning, doc.
Hi.
How you feeling?
Bad.
What's wrong with me again?
Pyelonephritis.
It's a UTI of the upper tract and kidney.
Pie-Lo-Na-Fry-Tis.
Like that?
Pyelonephritis.
Mm-Hmm.
Sit up.
Okay... are you sore there?
- Yeah.
Here?
Yeah.
Pyelonephritis.
Can you die from that?
Maybe, if you never took care of it.
But that's what us doctors are here for.
I thought you guys just played golf.
I don't know how to play golf.
I thought all doctors played golf.
I'm gonna learn.
Oh, hello, doctor.
Doctor, nice to see you again.
How's she doing?
Good.
Responding to antibiotics.
I could've died...right?
I was just saying it can be serious.
But it's completely under control.
So you mean, like, if this were before hospitals,
She'd be dead?
I didn't say that.
It's amazing knowing how to save people like that.
I bet you even know the name of this.
Philtrum.
See, I told you he'd know it.
Hi.
- Oh, hi, Rich.
- Hey, Mrs. Nixon.
Val.
This is my doctor.
He said I could have died.
- Dr. Blake.
Hey.
So...how's it going?
Okay.
You able to walk or...
I'll look in again later on.
You got, like, some kind of infection?
This says "penicillin," right?
Yeah.
Come with me, please.
Mr. Sanchez is allergic to penicillin.
Well, it didn't say so on the...
This isn't the original admit sheet...
Where's the original?
I don't know what you're talking about.
On the original sheet, it said "NKA," no known allergies.
- Well, did you ask him?
- He doesn't speak English.
If you knew he was allergic, why'd you give him penicillin?
Because you're the doctor.
I only do what you say.
Okay, let's get a Benadryl line...
Already took care of it.
Thank you.
Where are you going?
To file an incident report.
A what?
Why?
This is an incident.
It's procedure.
And can you rewrite this legibly?
What are you doing?
I'm looking for the original admit sheet.
I'm sorry, doctor,
But whatever it is you're looking for,
You're not gonna find it there.
Here you go, T. Little present for you.
Marty!
This seat taken?
Look, right, right, right...
Look, look, look, look.
Hey, Nancy,
You want to sit down, right here?
So that's a no.
Have a good weekend.
Excuse me.
Excuse me a second.
- No problem.
Dr. Waylans, can I talk to you for a second?
Sure.
I just wanted to ask you about incident reports.
Is this about the Sanchez thing?
I wouldn't worry about it.
But does it go on my record?
I mean, is it bad?
I don't think so.
I mean, it's not good.
Will it affect my application
For the infectious diseases fellowship?
I can't undo it, if that's what you mean.
I haven't heard that before.
No, that's fine.
Perfect.
While you're at it, why don't you just go screw her
And get it over with?
No.
Because I'm sick, and I'm in the hospital,
If you haven't noticed.
Oh, please.
You're such an asshole!
Go to hell.
I'm getting better.
It looks that way.
Everything okay?
Do you remember Rich?
I should break up with him.
You think I should break up with him?
That's none of my business.
He is the most popular guy in school.
I wasn't the most popular guy in school.
And now I'm a doctor.
What do you think Rich is going to be?
I don't know.
An idiot.
It's hard to dump him, though.
We've been together for a while.
I mean, I don't know if we're in love or anything.
- Well, you know what they say.
- What?
If you love someone...
set them free.
Who says that?
Sting.
I think.
Who?
Excuse me, doctor.
I'm with a patient.
I can't do these orders until I can read them.
I can't do these orders... press "door open".
Press "door open"!
Hello, doctor.
Having a rough day, are we?
No.
Fine.
Don't worry, I got it too.
Every goddamn day's a shit fight
Just to get out of bed in the morning.
Oh.
What's bugging you, doc?
This is a hospital.
The staff is supposed to follow orders, right?
Isn't that how it's supposed to be?
Doctors get a little respect?
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe.
It's probably not what you think, though.
I just want things to be like they're supposed to be.
How long has Theresa been here?
Didn't you learn how to get rid of people like that
In med school?
Just slip 'em something,
Then they're going along, and then bam!
Heart attack!
Too bad.
I'm kidding, doc.
Just, uh...bet you were thinking about it.
Okay, I'm clocking out.
Hi.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Okay, I guess.
What was the deal with that nurse?
It was a misunderstanding.
It's okay.
Shouldn't she be fired or something
For yelling at a doctor?
Probably.
I don't want to cause a fuss.
Am I cured?
Nearly.
No more hospital?
No.
No more helpful advice?
I'll tell nurse Ratched you're a good doctor.
Maybe she'll leave you alone.
Thanks.
You're a good patient.
Ah, Nixon.
Signs are okay.
No pain, no spikes.
She's outta here.
Just another day, to be sure?
I already signed her out.
Let's move on.
Mr. Sanchez...
Hi.
Are you Diane's doctor?
- Yes.
- I'm Diane's father.
Thank you for everything.
I was just coming to say good-Bye.
My wife just took her down to the car.
Any last-Minute advice?
Finish her pills.
She could relapse.
Okay, we'll do that.
Uh, I don't know how to say this,
But my daughter took quite a shine to you.
She thought you two got on pretty well,
And she wondered if I might ask you over
For dinner on Friday.
Friday.
Yes.
That'd be nice.
- Great.
- Friday.
We'll count on it.
See you then.
8:00 Friday.
Diane, you feeling better?
How are you feeling?
Mr. Nixon, Mrs. Nixon.
- Is that the doctor?
- Uh, yeah.
- Let him in.
- Hi.
Hi.
Come on in.
Welcome to our home.
Oh, you remember Valerie, right?
Hi.
I love your jacket.
Thanks.
And this is our youngest, Donny.
- Hello.
- What's up?
- Not much.
- Please sit down.
Where's Diane?
Oh, she's out.
I told her to stay... so that she didn't seem ungrateful... because we really are.
But...she's having a talk with Rich.
So what's it like being a doctor?
A lot of work.
A lot of responsibility.
But I like it.
How many operations you do a week?
I'm in internal medicine.
What's that, like, intestines?
Donny, not at the table.
That'd be great.
Get in there and just dig around.
I don't do surgery.
I bet it pays pretty well, doesn't it, being a doctor?
Donny, don't pry.
It's actually less than you think,
But it's a lot more than I'd make back home.
And he makes more than you do, Donny.
Besides, the money comes when you go
Into private practice, right?
You got a nice place?
It's okay.
The beach.
Oh, I love the beach.
You're so lucky.
I wish I lived by the beach
And knew all this incredible knowledge
About the human body.
You know plenty.
Donny, you pig!
Stop...
- Valerie!
- Mom!
He started it.
Mom, this was brand-New.
You're just gonna get sperm on it anyway.
Let's not have that kind of language
At the table there, guy.
Honestly, Donny.
I am so sorry, doctor.
It's okay.
Could I use your restroom?
- Certainly.
It's down the hall on the right.
Excuse me.
What, mom?
He's a doctor.
It's not like he's never heard of sperm before.
- Hey!
- You are upsetting your father.
Where do you come up with this stuff?
Oh!
Sorry.
It's just something came up at the hospital,
And I really have to go.
- Bye.
- Thank you.
Okay, that's it.
Have a good day, everyone.
Thanks.
I'll see you there.
Blake, can you stay for a second, please?
Sure.
Have a seat.
So...how's it going?
Fine.
Oh, yeah?
Tired?
A little.
Happy?
Want some coffee?
No, thanks.
First year of residency can be tough, I know.
If this is about Mr. Sanchez...
I just wanted to chat about the big picture.
Tell me something, Martin...
When did you first want to become a doctor?
When?
- Yeah.
- A long time ago, I guess.
Did you know why?
Why?
Because... a friend of my mother's was a doctor,
And he was respected,
And I guess I just always thought, you know,
To have that respect, and to... and be helping people.
Yeah, people go into medicine for all kinds of reasons.
You know, sometimes they don't really think about it
Till they're here, face-To-Face with it all.
And sometimes they realize the stress and the hours
And the nature of the work
Aren't what they thought it would be.
I mean, it's not unusual for people to realize
Maybe this isn't what they wanted after all.
This is what I want.
I mean, I know I can do better.
It's just taking time for me to learn your system here.
I mean, I didn't have all the advantages, you know,
Growing up and school, and so sometimes
I just have to work harder, and I do.
Some of the nurses, I mean...
Maryanne's fine, but with Theresa...
I double-Majored in chemistry and biology.
I went to school, I did all this work,
And she just treats me like I'm some nobody.
It doesn't seem fair, but...
I do want this.
There you go.
- Thanks.
Hi, Martin, it's Valerie Nixon.
It was really nice to see you the other night.
I'm sorry you had to rush off.
My mom actually got you a gift basket,
But we forgot to give it to you.
So I don't know if you wanted to arrange a time
To come by and get it,
Or I could drop it by the hospital... or your apartment, if you like.
So give us a call.
I'm home any time but tonight.
Okay, bye.
Oh, dr.
Blake, come in.
Thank you.
Can I get you some coffee or anything?
No thanks.
Valerie called.
She mentioned there was something for me to collect?
Yeah.
But I'm expected at the hospital.
Oh, of course.
Could I use your restroom?
Certainly.
You remember where it was?
- Yeah.
- Oh, here you go.
- Thank you.
It's just a little something to say thanks.
Thanks again, doctor.
Any special instructions for Diane?
Just finish her medicine.
I thought it was just malaise
From hanging around the house so much.
- I told you, it's Pyelonephritis.
Ow.
I thought she was all better.
It did seem that way.
We'll run some tests to make sure.
But there are some resistant strains
That are harder to treat.
Hey, doc!
Hey, it's nice to have the little number back
In 324, huh?
I don't think it's appropriate
To talk about the patients in that manner.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hippocratichyppocratic oath, right?
Yeah.
I need a cam profile.
- We need the ultrasound.
- Get it from...
- There's one here.
- All right.
Who's the primary doctor?
Where's the chart?
What is this?
This doesn't make sense.
Another allergic reaction, doctor?
No.
This is something else.
See?
Vancomycin.
Not a penicillin reaction.
It wasn't my mistake.
Yeah, looks like red man syndrome.
Well, that can happen when...
When someone misadministers Vancomycin.
Which doesn't surprise me
Because I never thought that Theresa, beyond her attitude,
Was all that sharp about these things.
Well, I'll look into it.
How's everything else?
I see the Nixon girl is back?
Yeah.
She said she took her oral meds.
But I'll do a resistance culture just to be sure.
All right.
Keep up the good work.
So...
can't keep away.
It seems that way.
I'm sorry.
I'm not.
You don't want to go back to school?
Rich?
The medicine you're on now is much stronger.
You'll get better very soon.
Do I have to?
Ooh!
Oh, I'm really so sorry, doctor.
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.
Maryanne, I'm really busy...
You know what, um...
they just let me go.
And before you hear it from anyone else,
I messed up Mr. Sanchez's Vancomycin.
I switched the sheet, and I just panicked.
I'm just sorry if I jeopardized a patient.
I thought it was Theresa.
No.
She didn't know anything about it.
Oh... so sorry to hold you up.
It's fine.
Excuse me.
Sorry, doctor.
Good morning.
How are you feeling?
- The same, I guess.
Your temperature's up a little.
Is that bad?
It's nothing serious,
But you might have to stay an extra day or two.
Is that bad?
No.
That's fine.
Once you check in on me.
- Someone's coming.
- What are you talking about?
Oh, hey, doc.
Uh...
- Get off me.
We were just talking.
Is this woman under sedation?
It's cool, man.
It's just a party, man.
Shit, it was her idea anyway.
Mandy, tell the doctor you're okay.
Doctor, I'm okay.
What are you doing down here, doc?
Is there something I could help you with?
Just get her out of here.
All right, let's get you back to bed now, Mandy.
Mm-Hmm.
Nice work, doc.
Son of a bitch.
Weren't you off at midnight?
Yes.
I just had some things to finish.
This patient's been a difficult case.
Everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.
Why don't you go home, doctor.
My biggest concern would be an abscess
Or some kind of resistant bacterial strain.
An abscess is doubtful.
Keep your eye on the resistance culture.
We are seeing more resistance in these.
I was gonna start her on Ceftazidime.
Well, if she doesn't start stabilizing,
We're gonna have to move her to ICU.
And keep an eye out for sepsis.
How often are you checking signs?
- Two hours.
- Okay.
Good.
Let me know what the resistance culture says.
I will.
What does that mean?
Your infection might be a little tougher
Than we thought.
We're starting you on another antibiotic,
And we need to make sure that you're not developing sepsis.
What's that?
An intravascular infection.
An intra what?
It's in the bloodstream.
Is that serious?
It can be.
I didn't think doctors had to do that.
I don't mind.
If I have an operation, will you operate on me?
I don't operate.
Hmm.
I don't want to cut into people.
That's why I went into internal medicine.
If I do my job right,
We never have to go in at all.
I don't want to talk to him.
Well, don't... think about it too much.
You need rest.
I know.
Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm, uh, looking for Diane Nixon.
I'm afraid she can't take visitors.
Look, man, we had this big bust-Up.
I just need to see her for two minutes.
It's not a good idea.
Just leave her alone for a little while.
She needs rest.
Give this to her.
Sure.
You should be sleeping.
I can't.
What did the expert say?
He said it's a difficult case,
But we're gonna work together on it,
And everything's gonna be okay.
There's something I didn't tell you... about before I came back to the hospital.
I don't know if it's what could have made me get sick again.
What's that?
I had sex with Rich before I finished my medication.
That can upset your urinary tract, right?
I don't think that's what did it.
I didn't think you two were goin' out anymore.
You know how sometimes you do things you know you shouldn't,
But you just can't help it?
Yeah.
I'm not gonna die, am I?
No, of course not.
I always thought if I was gonna die, I wanted to, like,
Get shot stopping a crime, or something.
I know that's stupid.
Do you ever think about stuff like that?
When I was younger, maybe.
It's silly.
What did you imagine?
I would think about just walking into the ocean,
And just disappearing, like I never existed,
And the world would just go on without me.
I love the ocean.
I'm not sure I've seen anything quite like this.
Yeah, it's, uh, been a tough case.
They had an Acinetobacter at south east general,
But I've never seen one of these so resistant before.
You've been doing regular cultures
To check against some other bug, maybe some nosocomial thing?
I considered that,
But nothing's come up in cultures.
Martin's been very thorough.
He's done everything I would have done.
And she's been properly administered all along?
Yes.
Well, Martin, it looks like
You've landed yourself a tricky one.
I drew up the protocol to treat the sepsis...
Shoot.
I must have left it in my car.
I'm due upstairs.
Would you mind?
No.
No, I was just about to grab lunch.
Silver Mercedes, Johns Hopkins stickers.
And it's in the back.
It's a tube that goes into your heart.
It doesn't hurt.
So you can look in any time you want?
Yeah.
If you had one, too, we could have a heart-To-Heart.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
Just kind of groggy.
They put pain medicine into your I.V.
Any pain from the catheter?
No.
It's weird.
I feel kinda nice, actually.
Can I ask you a question?
Of course.
You're not married or don't have a girlfriend or anything.
What's the question?
Why not?
You know how people are in the world.
Yeah.
You know, for a while I thought you liked my sister.
No.
Good, she's a slut.
You don't want a girl like that.
Doctor.
I know, I did it myself...
Where is she?
Excuse me.
Who?
Diane...
Nixon.
Oh, they took her for an M.R.I.
I just got a code four.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where is she?
- Charge.
- Clear!
- clear!
- Clear!
Yeah.
Yeah, that's it.
Call it.
Dr. Blake?
Dr. Blake?
Yes?
Sorry about yesterday, the Nixon girl.
She seemed nice.
She was.
Thank you.
Dr. Blake?
Yes?
Dr. Waylans would like to see you
In conference room three.
You wanted to see me?
Yes, Martin.
Take a seat.
This the first time this has happened?
Yes.
I never meant it to happen, it just... got out of control.
Well, this is Dr. Sayler.
She's a psychiatrist on staff here.
Hello, Martin.
It's always hard to lose a patient,
Especially the first time.
You always question yourself.
You wonder if you made mistakes, if you missed something,
Could you have been quicker?
These things happen.
Accepting that is part of being a doctor.
If there's anything you want to express,
Please don't hold back.
Can I ask you a question?
Okay.
Did you cry yesterday?
I did, yes.
Good.
That's good.
Oh, Mr. Nixon, I am so sorr...
Just want to talk to the doctor.
You killed my little girl.
Okay, Mr. Nixon, I am truly sorry for your loss,
But you cannot come onto my ward and start accusing my doctors.
That bastard killed my daughter.
- Okay.
- What is the problem, sir?
She was fine, then she came in here,
And you killed her.
- Martin, let me handle this.
Sir, these infections can be very difficult to treat.
It was a rare, resistant strain.
Now, if she didn't take every one of her pills,
That could strengthen the infection...
We don't know.
She took her pills.
She told me.
Don't blame dr.
Blake, sir.
I supervised him
Through the entire case.
He was exemplary in every way.
We did everything we could,
Everything, all of us.
Sir, can you come with me, please?
Sir.
- Get your hands off me.
You bastards.
Is the situation under control,
Or do you need backup?
Everything's fine.
We're comin' out.
I'm sorry, Martin.
You shouldn't have to deal with that.
It's a tough one.
Yeah.
Don't worry about it.
Waylans told me
You're not really a doctor until you've lost a patient.
You got your scrubs.
Hey, hold up.
Goin' to X-Ray, Mr. Granger?
There's no hearing aid.
Right, Mr. Granger, you crazy, old fucker?
So it must be a relief to get onto that new rotation.
Sounds like that last one was pretty rough.
These things happen, unfortunately.
It's part of being a doctor, dealing with loss.
Oh.
So I guess you're a doctor now.
I suppose so.
You know what I always thought would be the best part
About being a doctor?
It's the ladies.
The ladies love a doctor.
You find that to be true?
I suppose so, yes.
No.
What do you mean?
Meet me in the east tower basement, five minutes.
- Why?
- I think you know.
What is it?
Well, doctor, I just wanted to ask you an ethical question
About the relations between staff and patients.
That woman in the supply room?
Forget about it.
No, no, no, no, that's not my question.
See, I'm more interested in a situation like this.
All right, say a guy like me,
You know, who likes to party,
But otherwise is a regular guy, like an orderly,
One day, he's takin' this gurney to change it out...
Oh, and the previous tenant was this girl,
It was a sweet girl, she just passed away.
Anyway, this guy's takin' out the mattress,
And to his surprise,
Finds a little book under there,
And, well, there's some really shocking stuff in there
About this one young doctor.
Seems they had kind of a little, special relationship goin' on.
Now my question is this, do you think it's wrong,
Ethically, for this orderly
To keep this book from his superiors?
Let's take a ride.
Another reason I wish I was a doctor
Is so I could prescribe myself a better time.
I party, and nobody sees this.
I can't do that.
Where there's a will, there's a way, right?
Ahem, doctor?
Uh, I had a question about this order.
Is it my handwriting?
Uh, no, I can read it, it's just,
You prescribed Oxycodone for Mr. Granger?
He's had some pain from the Hickman catheter, so yeah.
Okay, sorry, I just wanted to check.
Do you need help?
No, thanks.
W
- What's troubling you?
What?
That's for stomachs,
And that stuff's more for, like, sniffling and sneezing.
I know.
I'm a doctor.
Okay, sorry.
Dude, four?
They're hard to get.
I hope this is a down payment.
Okay, fine.
What about the book?
What about it?
When do I get it back?
You never had it.
I'm not gonna do this indefinitely.
I don't think you have much of a choice, doctor.
Time you switched to decaf?
Mmm.
Cheers.
Rotation wasn't so tough.
And they say the second half of the year,
Everything gets easier.
Martin.
I'm sorry to hear about your patient.
Difficult case.
- Yes, it was.
I've been doing a study of these resistant bugs
And was hoping you might be able to help me review this one
If you kept your notes and charts together.
Dr. Waylans tells me you're thinking of applying
For the I.D. Fellowship.
Yes, I am.
I think that's a fine idea.
Fine idea.
Yo, doc.
Is this the patient?
Yes.
James?
- Yeah?
I'd like to talk to you, when you get a chance.
- Yeah, I get off in 30 minutes.
- Great.
- Hello, doctor.
- Hi.
Hey, there, partner.
You got it?
Those are different.
They're more like morphine.
They're better.
I want the book.
Oh.
Maybe soon.
Really?
No, that's not gonna work for me.
You just keep 'em comin', you'll be all right.
Have fun.
You know I will.
What are you doing?
You can't take those here.
Why not?
I'm off duty.
You shouldn't drive on them.
I got a ride.
What's with you, man?
Dude, don't make a big deal out of this.
We're all human beings.
We all gotta get our kicks somehow.
What are you doing?
Don't follow me.
I'm just walking.
Get away from me.
You're makin' this more than it has to be, doc.
You want more?
Yeah.
- You want more?
- Sure, yeah.
All right.
Oof.
- What's goin' on?
- I don't know.
Some kind of seizure.
Call a code, he's gone into arrest!
All right, all right, I got it.
I'm on it.
Okay.
Okay, jimmy!
Jimmy, can you hear me?
Jimmy?
Okay, okay, okay.
Jimmy, it's dr.
Waylans.
Jimmy!
Jimmy, stay with me.
Jimmy.
Stay with us.
- So was he sick or anything?
- I don't know.
He went into some kind of seizure.
I tried to help.
I wouldn't be surprised if it was some sort of drug overdose.
What makes you think that?
It's very erratic behavior.
Some of the nursing staff, it occurred to them
That he might be a drug abuser.
They had a mandatory test scheduled.
Perhaps you should go home.
Take a break.
Get back to the business of being a doctor on Monday.
You off tomorrow?
Yup.
Okay with you, detective,
If the good doctor here goes home?
Uh...yeah, I guess.
If we have any more questions, we'll be in touch,
If you don't mind.
No, not at all.
He kissed me... went to the hospital today...
they want to keep me overnight.
Rich asked me to be his girlfriend... the diagnosis is...
...but he doesn't act like it... looks like a U.T.I...
If you love someone, set them free.
I spent the night at Rich's...
they called a specialist.
He carried me into the bedroom and laid me down...
I can't believe he's...
he's such a liar.
Having surgery tomorrow...
I have a step-Sister... they put the tube in this morning... it's an infection.
The anesthesia was great... it's actually...
gave me the weirdest dreams...
Dr. Blake?
Yes.
Detective Krauss, from the hospital yesterday.
You said if we had any more questions...
I'm sorry to just drop by like this.
Right.
Fine, come in.
Can I get you anything?
No, thanks.
So it seems the, uh, the pills Mr. Vega took
Were spiked with potassium cyanide.
You know about that?
- No.
Well, yeah, I mean, I know what it is.
Some people suspect that he, uh, he abused drugs.
Looks like maybe he got a bad batch.
That's a shame.
I mean, I didn't know him that well.
That's why I'm not as upset as I would be if I knew him better.
I knew him to say hello to.
Did you ever see him taking drugs?
No.
I hardly knew him, like I said.
You have a pen I could borrow?
Thanks.
You knew this, uh, orderly.
Just slightly.
Not well, kind of.
I mean, he was...
not my kind of person.
Do you know where he got the drugs?
Could he have gotten them from the hospital, stolen them?
No, they're carefully monitored,
So I don't know how an orderly could.
Only a doctor can prescribe.
Could a doctor have gotten them for him?
Theoretically...
a doctor could... fake a prescription, or skim from a patient,
But that wouldn't be ethical, so they don't.
So a doctor could have gotten these.
No.
Did any doctors have any kind of a relationship with Mr. Vega?
What?
No, I...
I don't know.
I mean, like I said, I didn't care for him,
So I didn't hang around him.
Were there any other doctors who may have disliked him,
Who could've tainted the pills with the, uh, the...
Potassium cyanide.
Look, uh...
I'm sorry if I seem distracted.
I understand.
It must be tough trying to get back to normal,
After seeing somebody die like that.
It has been... especially with her.
Who?
No one.
Just...
A patient died.
It was a resistant strain of an infection.
They're rare, but increasingly common.
Antibiotics and cleansers are making germs tougher.
It was a difficult case, everyone agreed.
I know I must seem like I'm reacting differently now
Than with James' passing away, but he wasn't much of a person.
I mean, he'd make lewd comments at women patients.
I think he may have even fooled around with them,
Which, as a doctor, you can't.
Diane was a very nice girl.
We were close.
In a doctor-Patient way, before she died... but that's over now,
And I'm back to the business of being a doctor.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Well, you know where I am, detective,
If you have any more questions.
Excuse me a moment.
Doctor?
Just a second.
Mind if I have a glass of water?
No, not at all.
Help yourself.
I'm sorry.
I need to collect some things.
I'm needed at the hospital.
Do you have any more questions?
I'm afraid I'm in a bit of a hurry.
Well, no.
I guess not.
I'll let you get ready, then.
Thanks for your help, doctor.
My pleasure.
His HH are 12 and 36.
WBC 10.9
With a slight shift to the left.
He's on a broad-Spectrum antibiotic.
I'm about to hang his third dose.
- Let's do blood cultures now and times two for a temporary,
Then 101.
- Yeah.
- Is it gonna hurt?
- A little, but don't worry.
I'm getting better all the time.
Make a fist.
- Doctor?
- Yes.
Martin.
Come on, we're on.
How do you get by with so little sleep?
Ambition, good diet.
Constant self-medication.
Time you got a new bag?
I got this from a friend of the family.
- It used to be his.
- Oh, well, in that case...
I kinda like it.
You going to that thing for the new residents?
I don't know.
Carson's daughter's gonna be there.
Who's Carson?
Radiology.
Supposedly his daughter's a real peach.
Come on, Martin,
Time to start looking for that trophy wife.
Bring the bag.
Dr. Levy, 4152.
How are you...
Mr. Sanchez?
No Hablo Ingles.
Oh.
- No Hablo Espanol.
- Doctor,
Excuse me one...
On moment.
Por favor, doctor...
Dr. Page?
Do you speak Spanish?
No.
Can you cough?
Thank you.
Okay, you need a lot of rest.
Rest.
Sleep.
You need to rest.
- Yes.
That's what you need.
Okay?
The barium pictures were negative.
Why the D-Xyclose absorption series?
I felt I should rule out Zollinger-Ellison syndrome,
Whipple's disease, and celiac.
I say mild peptic ulcer.
I mean, possible chronic reflux.
Smokes, drinks...
filed for divorce.
I didn't know about the divorce.
Did you talk to her?
Not about stuff like that.
We're not fishing for syndromes here, folks.
Communication is key.
- Dr. Waylans.
- Yes?
Ah.
Martin...
Blake.
Things going okay?
Yeah.
I was wondering,
You did the infectious diseases fellowship?
Yeah.
Well, I'm applying.
Do you have any advice?
You're only six days into residency.
You can't even apply till next year.
I just want to be prepared.
Oh.
Well, it's not much.
You know, a good candidate is just a good doctor.
Right.
You do know the secret to being a good doctor,
Don't you, Martin?
You act like one.
I do, I think.
Well, then, you're fine.
- Dr. Waylans?
- Yes, Martin?
Is it possible to get our I.D. Picture retaken?
I have no idea.
Excuse me, what does that say?
Penicillin.
Excuse me, when will the doctor be here?
I am the doctor.
Okay, that's it for now.
Nurse?
I'll need labs drawn.
You're gonna have to do it yourself...
We're swamped.
You know how, right?
Yes.
Of course.
Thank you.
Is that okay?
Sorry.
A phlebotomist is supposed to do this.
A what?
It's who draws the blood.
Doctors aren't supposed to have to do this.
There you go.
Okay.
Here you are.
I'm so sorry, I thought you were someone else.
Who did you think I was?
I see you've met my esteemed colleague.
I did.
For a minute, I thought he was you.
There's only one of me.
That's the rule.
This is Martin.
Martin, this is Christine.
- Hi.
- Dr. Carson's daughter.
So back to you being such a big nerd in high school.
- The biggest.
- Really?
Yep.
And then one day I realized
I was gonna die a virgin.
That thought can come as quite a shock to a young man.
Don't you have some other rooms to attend to?
Let's just be a couple dirty Mexicans and make it happen.
Make what happen?
How 'bout I just talk to you?
Let's make ourselves useful.
Jimmy, come on.
Yo.
Good morning, doc.
Hi.
How you feeling?
Bad.
What's wrong with me again?
Pyelonephritis.
It's a UTI of the upper tract and kidney.
Pie-Lo-Na-Fry-Tis.
Like that?
Pyelonephritis.
Mm-Hmm.
Sit up.
Okay... are you sore there?
- Yeah.
Here?
Yeah.
Pyelonephritis.
Can you die from that?
Maybe, if you never took care of it.
But that's what us doctors are here for.
I thought you guys just played golf.
I don't know how to play golf.
I thought all doctors played golf.
I'm gonna learn.
Oh, hello, doctor.
Doctor, nice to see you again.
How's she doing?
Good.
Responding to antibiotics.
I could've died...right?
I was just saying it can be serious.
But it's completely under control.
So you mean, like, if this were before hospitals,
She'd be dead?
I didn't say that.
It's amazing knowing how to save people like that.
I bet you even know the name of this.
Philtrum.
See, I told you he'd know it.
Hi.
- Oh, hi, Rich.
- Hey, Mrs. Nixon.
Val.
This is my doctor.
He said I could have died.
- Dr. Blake.
Hey.
So...how's it going?
Okay.
You able to walk or...
I'll look in again later on.
You got, like, some kind of infection?
This says "penicillin," right?
Yeah.
Come with me, please.
Mr. Sanchez is allergic to penicillin.
Well, it didn't say so on the...
This isn't the original admit sheet...
Where's the original?
I don't know what you're talking about.
On the original sheet, it said "NKA," no known allergies.
- Well, did you ask him?
- He doesn't speak English.
If you knew he was allergic, why'd you give him penicillin?
Because you're the doctor.
I only do what you say.
Okay, let's get a Benadryl line...
Already took care of it.
Thank you.
Where are you going?
To file an incident report.
A what?
Why?
This is an incident.
It's procedure.
And can you rewrite this legibly?
What are you doing?
I'm looking for the original admit sheet.
I'm sorry, doctor,
But whatever it is you're looking for,
You're not gonna find it there.
Here you go, T. Little present for you.
Marty!
This seat taken?
Look, right, right, right...
Look, look, look, look.
Hey, Nancy,
You want to sit down, right here?
So that's a no.
Have a good weekend.
Excuse me.
Excuse me a second.
- No problem.
Dr. Waylans, can I talk to you for a second?
Sure.
I just wanted to ask you about incident reports.
Is this about the Sanchez thing?
I wouldn't worry about it.
But does it go on my record?
I mean, is it bad?
I don't think so.
I mean, it's not good.
Will it affect my application
For the infectious diseases fellowship?
I can't undo it, if that's what you mean.
I haven't heard that before.
No, that's fine.
Perfect.
While you're at it, why don't you just go screw her
And get it over with?
No.
Because I'm sick, and I'm in the hospital,
If you haven't noticed.
Oh, please.
You're such an asshole!
Go to hell.
I'm getting better.
It looks that way.
Everything okay?
Do you remember Rich?
I should break up with him.
You think I should break up with him?
That's none of my business.
He is the most popular guy in school.
I wasn't the most popular guy in school.
And now I'm a doctor.
What do you think Rich is going to be?
I don't know.
An idiot.
It's hard to dump him, though.
We've been together for a while.
I mean, I don't know if we're in love or anything.
- Well, you know what they say.
- What?
If you love someone...
set them free.
Who says that?
Sting.
I think.
Who?
Excuse me, doctor.
I'm with a patient.
I can't do these orders until I can read them.
I can't do these orders... press "door open".
Press "door open"!
Hello, doctor.
Having a rough day, are we?
No.
Fine.
Don't worry, I got it too.
Every goddamn day's a shit fight
Just to get out of bed in the morning.
Oh.
What's bugging you, doc?
This is a hospital.
The staff is supposed to follow orders, right?
Isn't that how it's supposed to be?
Doctors get a little respect?
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe.
It's probably not what you think, though.
I just want things to be like they're supposed to be.
How long has Theresa been here?
Didn't you learn how to get rid of people like that
In med school?
Just slip 'em something,
Then they're going along, and then bam!
Heart attack!
Too bad.
I'm kidding, doc.
Just, uh...bet you were thinking about it.
Okay, I'm clocking out.
Hi.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Okay, I guess.
What was the deal with that nurse?
It was a misunderstanding.
It's okay.
Shouldn't she be fired or something
For yelling at a doctor?
Probably.
I don't want to cause a fuss.
Am I cured?
Nearly.
No more hospital?
No.
No more helpful advice?
I'll tell nurse Ratched you're a good doctor.
Maybe she'll leave you alone.
Thanks.
You're a good patient.
Ah, Nixon.
Signs are okay.
No pain, no spikes.
She's outta here.
Just another day, to be sure?
I already signed her out.
Let's move on.
Mr. Sanchez...
Hi.
Are you Diane's doctor?
- Yes.
- I'm Diane's father.
Thank you for everything.
I was just coming to say good-Bye.
My wife just took her down to the car.
Any last-Minute advice?
Finish her pills.
She could relapse.
Okay, we'll do that.
Uh, I don't know how to say this,
But my daughter took quite a shine to you.
She thought you two got on pretty well,
And she wondered if I might ask you over
For dinner on Friday.
Friday.
Yes.
That'd be nice.
- Great.
- Friday.
We'll count on it.
See you then.
8:00 Friday.
Diane, you feeling better?
How are you feeling?
Mr. Nixon, Mrs. Nixon.
- Is that the doctor?
- Uh, yeah.
- Let him in.
- Hi.
Hi.
Come on in.
Welcome to our home.
Oh, you remember Valerie, right?
Hi.
I love your jacket.
Thanks.
And this is our youngest, Donny.
- Hello.
- What's up?
- Not much.
- Please sit down.
Where's Diane?
Oh, she's out.
I told her to stay... so that she didn't seem ungrateful... because we really are.
But...she's having a talk with Rich.
So what's it like being a doctor?
A lot of work.
A lot of responsibility.
But I like it.
How many operations you do a week?
I'm in internal medicine.
What's that, like, intestines?
Donny, not at the table.
That'd be great.
Get in there and just dig around.
I don't do surgery.
I bet it pays pretty well, doesn't it, being a doctor?
Donny, don't pry.
It's actually less than you think,
But it's a lot more than I'd make back home.
And he makes more than you do, Donny.
Besides, the money comes when you go
Into private practice, right?
You got a nice place?
It's okay.
The beach.
Oh, I love the beach.
You're so lucky.
I wish I lived by the beach
And knew all this incredible knowledge
About the human body.
You know plenty.
Donny, you pig!
Stop...
- Valerie!
- Mom!
He started it.
Mom, this was brand-New.
You're just gonna get sperm on it anyway.
Let's not have that kind of language
At the table there, guy.
Honestly, Donny.
I am so sorry, doctor.
It's okay.
Could I use your restroom?
- Certainly.
It's down the hall on the right.
Excuse me.
What, mom?
He's a doctor.
It's not like he's never heard of sperm before.
- Hey!
- You are upsetting your father.
Where do you come up with this stuff?
Oh!
Sorry.
It's just something came up at the hospital,
And I really have to go.
- Bye.
- Thank you.
Okay, that's it.
Have a good day, everyone.
Thanks.
I'll see you there.
Blake, can you stay for a second, please?
Sure.
Have a seat.
So...how's it going?
Fine.
Oh, yeah?
Tired?
A little.
Happy?
Want some coffee?
No, thanks.
First year of residency can be tough, I know.
If this is about Mr. Sanchez...
I just wanted to chat about the big picture.
Tell me something, Martin...
When did you first want to become a doctor?
When?
- Yeah.
- A long time ago, I guess.
Did you know why?
Why?
Because... a friend of my mother's was a doctor,
And he was respected,
And I guess I just always thought, you know,
To have that respect, and to... and be helping people.
Yeah, people go into medicine for all kinds of reasons.
You know, sometimes they don't really think about it
Till they're here, face-To-Face with it all.
And sometimes they realize the stress and the hours
And the nature of the work
Aren't what they thought it would be.
I mean, it's not unusual for people to realize
Maybe this isn't what they wanted after all.
This is what I want.
I mean, I know I can do better.
It's just taking time for me to learn your system here.
I mean, I didn't have all the advantages, you know,
Growing up and school, and so sometimes
I just have to work harder, and I do.
Some of the nurses, I mean...
Maryanne's fine, but with Theresa...
I double-Majored in chemistry and biology.
I went to school, I did all this work,
And she just treats me like I'm some nobody.
It doesn't seem fair, but...
I do want this.
There you go.
- Thanks.
Hi, Martin, it's Valerie Nixon.
It was really nice to see you the other night.
I'm sorry you had to rush off.
My mom actually got you a gift basket,
But we forgot to give it to you.
So I don't know if you wanted to arrange a time
To come by and get it,
Or I could drop it by the hospital... or your apartment, if you like.
So give us a call.
I'm home any time but tonight.
Okay, bye.
Oh, dr.
Blake, come in.
Thank you.
Can I get you some coffee or anything?
No thanks.
Valerie called.
She mentioned there was something for me to collect?
Yeah.
But I'm expected at the hospital.
Oh, of course.
Could I use your restroom?
Certainly.
You remember where it was?
- Yeah.
- Oh, here you go.
- Thank you.
It's just a little something to say thanks.
Thanks again, doctor.
Any special instructions for Diane?
Just finish her medicine.
I thought it was just malaise
From hanging around the house so much.
- I told you, it's Pyelonephritis.
Ow.
I thought she was all better.
It did seem that way.
We'll run some tests to make sure.
But there are some resistant strains
That are harder to treat.
Hey, doc!
Hey, it's nice to have the little number back
In 324, huh?
I don't think it's appropriate
To talk about the patients in that manner.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hippocratichyppocratic oath, right?
Yeah.
I need a cam profile.
- We need the ultrasound.
- Get it from...
- There's one here.
- All right.
Who's the primary doctor?
Where's the chart?
What is this?
This doesn't make sense.
Another allergic reaction, doctor?
No.
This is something else.
See?
Vancomycin.
Not a penicillin reaction.
It wasn't my mistake.
Yeah, looks like red man syndrome.
Well, that can happen when...
When someone misadministers Vancomycin.
Which doesn't surprise me
Because I never thought that Theresa, beyond her attitude,
Was all that sharp about these things.
Well, I'll look into it.
How's everything else?
I see the Nixon girl is back?
Yeah.
She said she took her oral meds.
But I'll do a resistance culture just to be sure.
All right.
Keep up the good work.
So...
can't keep away.
It seems that way.
I'm sorry.
I'm not.
You don't want to go back to school?
Rich?
The medicine you're on now is much stronger.
You'll get better very soon.
Do I have to?
Ooh!
Oh, I'm really so sorry, doctor.
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.
Maryanne, I'm really busy...
You know what, um...
they just let me go.
And before you hear it from anyone else,
I messed up Mr. Sanchez's Vancomycin.
I switched the sheet, and I just panicked.
I'm just sorry if I jeopardized a patient.
I thought it was Theresa.
No.
She didn't know anything about it.
Oh... so sorry to hold you up.
It's fine.
Excuse me.
Sorry, doctor.
Good morning.
How are you feeling?
- The same, I guess.
Your temperature's up a little.
Is that bad?
It's nothing serious,
But you might have to stay an extra day or two.
Is that bad?
No.
That's fine.
Once you check in on me.
- Someone's coming.
- What are you talking about?
Oh, hey, doc.
Uh...
- Get off me.
We were just talking.
Is this woman under sedation?
It's cool, man.
It's just a party, man.
Shit, it was her idea anyway.
Mandy, tell the doctor you're okay.
Doctor, I'm okay.
What are you doing down here, doc?
Is there something I could help you with?
Just get her out of here.
All right, let's get you back to bed now, Mandy.
Mm-Hmm.
Nice work, doc.
Son of a bitch.
Weren't you off at midnight?
Yes.
I just had some things to finish.
This patient's been a difficult case.
Everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.
Why don't you go home, doctor.
My biggest concern would be an abscess
Or some kind of resistant bacterial strain.
An abscess is doubtful.
Keep your eye on the resistance culture.
We are seeing more resistance in these.
I was gonna start her on Ceftazidime.
Well, if she doesn't start stabilizing,
We're gonna have to move her to ICU.
And keep an eye out for sepsis.
How often are you checking signs?
- Two hours.
- Okay.
Good.
Let me know what the resistance culture says.
I will.
What does that mean?
Your infection might be a little tougher
Than we thought.
We're starting you on another antibiotic,
And we need to make sure that you're not developing sepsis.
What's that?
An intravascular infection.
An intra what?
It's in the bloodstream.
Is that serious?
It can be.
I didn't think doctors had to do that.
I don't mind.
If I have an operation, will you operate on me?
I don't operate.
Hmm.
I don't want to cut into people.
That's why I went into internal medicine.
If I do my job right,
We never have to go in at all.
I don't want to talk to him.
Well, don't... think about it too much.
You need rest.
I know.
Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm, uh, looking for Diane Nixon.
I'm afraid she can't take visitors.
Look, man, we had this big bust-Up.
I just need to see her for two minutes.
It's not a good idea.
Just leave her alone for a little while.
She needs rest.
Give this to her.
Sure.
You should be sleeping.
I can't.
What did the expert say?
He said it's a difficult case,
But we're gonna work together on it,
And everything's gonna be okay.
There's something I didn't tell you... about before I came back to the hospital.
I don't know if it's what could have made me get sick again.
What's that?
I had sex with Rich before I finished my medication.
That can upset your urinary tract, right?
I don't think that's what did it.
I didn't think you two were goin' out anymore.
You know how sometimes you do things you know you shouldn't,
But you just can't help it?
Yeah.
I'm not gonna die, am I?
No, of course not.
I always thought if I was gonna die, I wanted to, like,
Get shot stopping a crime, or something.
I know that's stupid.
Do you ever think about stuff like that?
When I was younger, maybe.
It's silly.
What did you imagine?
I would think about just walking into the ocean,
And just disappearing, like I never existed,
And the world would just go on without me.
I love the ocean.
I'm not sure I've seen anything quite like this.
Yeah, it's, uh, been a tough case.
They had an Acinetobacter at south east general,
But I've never seen one of these so resistant before.
You've been doing regular cultures
To check against some other bug, maybe some nosocomial thing?
I considered that,
But nothing's come up in cultures.
Martin's been very thorough.
He's done everything I would have done.
And she's been properly administered all along?
Yes.
Well, Martin, it looks like
You've landed yourself a tricky one.
I drew up the protocol to treat the sepsis...
Shoot.
I must have left it in my car.
I'm due upstairs.
Would you mind?
No.
No, I was just about to grab lunch.
Silver Mercedes, Johns Hopkins stickers.
And it's in the back.
It's a tube that goes into your heart.
It doesn't hurt.
So you can look in any time you want?
Yeah.
If you had one, too, we could have a heart-To-Heart.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
Just kind of groggy.
They put pain medicine into your I.V.
Any pain from the catheter?
No.
It's weird.
I feel kinda nice, actually.
Can I ask you a question?
Of course.
You're not married or don't have a girlfriend or anything.
What's the question?
Why not?
You know how people are in the world.
Yeah.
You know, for a while I thought you liked my sister.
No.
Good, she's a slut.
You don't want a girl like that.
Doctor.
I know, I did it myself...
Where is she?
Excuse me.
Who?
Diane...
Nixon.
Oh, they took her for an M.R.I.
I just got a code four.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where is she?
- Charge.
- Clear!
- clear!
- Clear!
Yeah.
Yeah, that's it.
Call it.
Dr. Blake?
Dr. Blake?
Yes?
Sorry about yesterday, the Nixon girl.
She seemed nice.
She was.
Thank you.
Dr. Blake?
Yes?
Dr. Waylans would like to see you
In conference room three.
You wanted to see me?
Yes, Martin.
Take a seat.
This the first time this has happened?
Yes.
I never meant it to happen, it just... got out of control.
Well, this is Dr. Sayler.
She's a psychiatrist on staff here.
Hello, Martin.
It's always hard to lose a patient,
Especially the first time.
You always question yourself.
You wonder if you made mistakes, if you missed something,
Could you have been quicker?
These things happen.
Accepting that is part of being a doctor.
If there's anything you want to express,
Please don't hold back.
Can I ask you a question?
Okay.
Did you cry yesterday?
I did, yes.
Good.
That's good.
Oh, Mr. Nixon, I am so sorr...
Just want to talk to the doctor.
You killed my little girl.
Okay, Mr. Nixon, I am truly sorry for your loss,
But you cannot come onto my ward and start accusing my doctors.
That bastard killed my daughter.
- Okay.
- What is the problem, sir?
She was fine, then she came in here,
And you killed her.
- Martin, let me handle this.
Sir, these infections can be very difficult to treat.
It was a rare, resistant strain.
Now, if she didn't take every one of her pills,
That could strengthen the infection...
We don't know.
She took her pills.
She told me.
Don't blame dr.
Blake, sir.
I supervised him
Through the entire case.
He was exemplary in every way.
We did everything we could,
Everything, all of us.
Sir, can you come with me, please?
Sir.
- Get your hands off me.
You bastards.
Is the situation under control,
Or do you need backup?
Everything's fine.
We're comin' out.
I'm sorry, Martin.
You shouldn't have to deal with that.
It's a tough one.
Yeah.
Don't worry about it.
Waylans told me
You're not really a doctor until you've lost a patient.
You got your scrubs.
Hey, hold up.
Goin' to X-Ray, Mr. Granger?
There's no hearing aid.
Right, Mr. Granger, you crazy, old fucker?
So it must be a relief to get onto that new rotation.
Sounds like that last one was pretty rough.
These things happen, unfortunately.
It's part of being a doctor, dealing with loss.
Oh.
So I guess you're a doctor now.
I suppose so.
You know what I always thought would be the best part
About being a doctor?
It's the ladies.
The ladies love a doctor.
You find that to be true?
I suppose so, yes.
No.
What do you mean?
Meet me in the east tower basement, five minutes.
- Why?
- I think you know.
What is it?
Well, doctor, I just wanted to ask you an ethical question
About the relations between staff and patients.
That woman in the supply room?
Forget about it.
No, no, no, no, that's not my question.
See, I'm more interested in a situation like this.
All right, say a guy like me,
You know, who likes to party,
But otherwise is a regular guy, like an orderly,
One day, he's takin' this gurney to change it out...
Oh, and the previous tenant was this girl,
It was a sweet girl, she just passed away.
Anyway, this guy's takin' out the mattress,
And to his surprise,
Finds a little book under there,
And, well, there's some really shocking stuff in there
About this one young doctor.
Seems they had kind of a little, special relationship goin' on.
Now my question is this, do you think it's wrong,
Ethically, for this orderly
To keep this book from his superiors?
Let's take a ride.
Another reason I wish I was a doctor
Is so I could prescribe myself a better time.
I party, and nobody sees this.
I can't do that.
Where there's a will, there's a way, right?
Ahem, doctor?
Uh, I had a question about this order.
Is it my handwriting?
Uh, no, I can read it, it's just,
You prescribed Oxycodone for Mr. Granger?
He's had some pain from the Hickman catheter, so yeah.
Okay, sorry, I just wanted to check.
Do you need help?
No, thanks.
W
- What's troubling you?
What?
That's for stomachs,
And that stuff's more for, like, sniffling and sneezing.
I know.
I'm a doctor.
Okay, sorry.
Dude, four?
They're hard to get.
I hope this is a down payment.
Okay, fine.
What about the book?
What about it?
When do I get it back?
You never had it.
I'm not gonna do this indefinitely.
I don't think you have much of a choice, doctor.
Time you switched to decaf?
Mmm.
Cheers.
Rotation wasn't so tough.
And they say the second half of the year,
Everything gets easier.
Martin.
I'm sorry to hear about your patient.
Difficult case.
- Yes, it was.
I've been doing a study of these resistant bugs
And was hoping you might be able to help me review this one
If you kept your notes and charts together.
Dr. Waylans tells me you're thinking of applying
For the I.D. Fellowship.
Yes, I am.
I think that's a fine idea.
Fine idea.
Yo, doc.
Is this the patient?
Yes.
James?
- Yeah?
I'd like to talk to you, when you get a chance.
- Yeah, I get off in 30 minutes.
- Great.
- Hello, doctor.
- Hi.
Hey, there, partner.
You got it?
Those are different.
They're more like morphine.
They're better.
I want the book.
Oh.
Maybe soon.
Really?
No, that's not gonna work for me.
You just keep 'em comin', you'll be all right.
Have fun.
You know I will.
What are you doing?
You can't take those here.
Why not?
I'm off duty.
You shouldn't drive on them.
I got a ride.
What's with you, man?
Dude, don't make a big deal out of this.
We're all human beings.
We all gotta get our kicks somehow.
What are you doing?
Don't follow me.
I'm just walking.
Get away from me.
You're makin' this more than it has to be, doc.
You want more?
Yeah.
- You want more?
- Sure, yeah.
All right.
Oof.
- What's goin' on?
- I don't know.
Some kind of seizure.
Call a code, he's gone into arrest!
All right, all right, I got it.
I'm on it.
Okay.
Okay, jimmy!
Jimmy, can you hear me?
Jimmy?
Okay, okay, okay.
Jimmy, it's dr.
Waylans.
Jimmy!
Jimmy, stay with me.
Jimmy.
Stay with us.
- So was he sick or anything?
- I don't know.
He went into some kind of seizure.
I tried to help.
I wouldn't be surprised if it was some sort of drug overdose.
What makes you think that?
It's very erratic behavior.
Some of the nursing staff, it occurred to them
That he might be a drug abuser.
They had a mandatory test scheduled.
Perhaps you should go home.
Take a break.
Get back to the business of being a doctor on Monday.
You off tomorrow?
Yup.
Okay with you, detective,
If the good doctor here goes home?
Uh...yeah, I guess.
If we have any more questions, we'll be in touch,
If you don't mind.
No, not at all.
He kissed me... went to the hospital today...
they want to keep me overnight.
Rich asked me to be his girlfriend... the diagnosis is...
...but he doesn't act like it... looks like a U.T.I...
If you love someone, set them free.
I spent the night at Rich's...
they called a specialist.
He carried me into the bedroom and laid me down...
I can't believe he's...
he's such a liar.
Having surgery tomorrow...
I have a step-Sister... they put the tube in this morning... it's an infection.
The anesthesia was great... it's actually...
gave me the weirdest dreams...
Dr. Blake?
Yes.
Detective Krauss, from the hospital yesterday.
You said if we had any more questions...
I'm sorry to just drop by like this.
Right.
Fine, come in.
Can I get you anything?
No, thanks.
So it seems the, uh, the pills Mr. Vega took
Were spiked with potassium cyanide.
You know about that?
- No.
Well, yeah, I mean, I know what it is.
Some people suspect that he, uh, he abused drugs.
Looks like maybe he got a bad batch.
That's a shame.
I mean, I didn't know him that well.
That's why I'm not as upset as I would be if I knew him better.
I knew him to say hello to.
Did you ever see him taking drugs?
No.
I hardly knew him, like I said.
You have a pen I could borrow?
Thanks.
You knew this, uh, orderly.
Just slightly.
Not well, kind of.
I mean, he was...
not my kind of person.
Do you know where he got the drugs?
Could he have gotten them from the hospital, stolen them?
No, they're carefully monitored,
So I don't know how an orderly could.
Only a doctor can prescribe.
Could a doctor have gotten them for him?
Theoretically...
a doctor could... fake a prescription, or skim from a patient,
But that wouldn't be ethical, so they don't.
So a doctor could have gotten these.
No.
Did any doctors have any kind of a relationship with Mr. Vega?
What?
No, I...
I don't know.
I mean, like I said, I didn't care for him,
So I didn't hang around him.
Were there any other doctors who may have disliked him,
Who could've tainted the pills with the, uh, the...
Potassium cyanide.
Look, uh...
I'm sorry if I seem distracted.
I understand.
It must be tough trying to get back to normal,
After seeing somebody die like that.
It has been... especially with her.
Who?
No one.
Just...
A patient died.
It was a resistant strain of an infection.
They're rare, but increasingly common.
Antibiotics and cleansers are making germs tougher.
It was a difficult case, everyone agreed.
I know I must seem like I'm reacting differently now
Than with James' passing away, but he wasn't much of a person.
I mean, he'd make lewd comments at women patients.
I think he may have even fooled around with them,
Which, as a doctor, you can't.
Diane was a very nice girl.
We were close.
In a doctor-Patient way, before she died... but that's over now,
And I'm back to the business of being a doctor.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Well, you know where I am, detective,
If you have any more questions.
Excuse me a moment.
Doctor?
Just a second.
Mind if I have a glass of water?
No, not at all.
Help yourself.
I'm sorry.
I need to collect some things.
I'm needed at the hospital.
Do you have any more questions?
I'm afraid I'm in a bit of a hurry.
Well, no.
I guess not.
I'll let you get ready, then.
Thanks for your help, doctor.
My pleasure.
His HH are 12 and 36.
WBC 10.9
With a slight shift to the left.
He's on a broad-Spectrum antibiotic.
I'm about to hang his third dose.
- Let's do blood cultures now and times two for a temporary,
Then 101.
- Yeah.
- Is it gonna hurt?
- A little, but don't worry.
I'm getting better all the time.
Make a fist.
- Doctor?
- Yes.
Martin.
Come on, we're on.
How do you get by with so little sleep?
I don't know.
Ambition, good diet.
Constant self-medication.
Time you got a new bag?
I got this from a friend of the family.
- It used to be his.
- Oh, well, in that case...
I kinda like it.
You going to that thing for the new residents?
I don't know.
Carson's daughter's gonna be there.
- Who's Carson?
- Radiology.
Supposedly his daughter's a real peach.
Come on, Martin, time to start looking for that trophy wife.
Bring the bag.
Dr. Levy, 4152.
Dr. Levy, 4152.
How are you, Mr...
Sanchez?
No hablo ingles.
Oh.
- No hablo espanol.
- Doctor.
Excuse me one...
one moment.
Por favor, Doctor.
Dr. Page?
Do you speak Spanish?
No.
Can you cough?
Thank you.
Okay, you need a lot of rest.
Rest.
Sleep.
You need to rest.
Yes, that's what you need, okay?
The barium pictures were negative.
Why the D-xylose absorption series?
I felt I should rule out Zollinger-Ellison syndrome,
Whipple's disease, and celiac.
I say mild peptic ulcer.
I mean, possible chronic reflux.
Look, smokes, drinks, filed for divorce.
I didn't know about the divorce.
Did you talk to her?
Not about stuff like that.
We're not fishing for syndromes here, folks.
Communication is key.
- Dr. Waylans.
- Yes?
Ah, Martin Blake.
Things going okay?
Yeah.
I was wondering, you did the infectious diseases fellowship?
Yeah.
Well, I'm applying.
Do you have any advice?
You're only six days into residency.
You can't even apply till next year.
I just want to be prepared.
Oh.
Well, it's not much.
You know, a good candidate is just a good doctor.
Right.
You do know the secret to being a good doctor, don't you, Martin?
You act like one.
I do, I think.
Well, then, you're fine.
- Dr. Waylans?
- Yes, Martin?
Is it possible to get our id picture retaken?
I have no idea.
Excuse me, what does that say?
Penicillin.
Excuse me, when will the doctor be here?
I am the doctor.
Okay, that's it for now.
Nurse?
I'll need labs drawn.
You're gonna have to do it yourself.
We're swamped.
You know how, right?
Yes.
Of course.
Thank you.
Is that okay?
Sorry.
A phlebotomist is supposed to do this.
- A what?
- It's who draws the blood.
Doctors aren't supposed to have to do this.
There you go.
Okay.
There you are.
I'm so sorry, I thought you were someone else.
Who did you think I was?
I see you've met my esteemed colleague.
I did.
For a minute, I thought he was you.
There's only one of me.
That's the rule.
This is Martin.
Martin, this is Christine.
- Hello.
- Dr. Carson's daughter.
So back to you being such a big nerd in high school.
- The biggest.
- Really?
Yup.
And then one day I realized
I was gonna die a virgin.
That thought can come as quite a shock to a young man.
Don't you have some other rooms to attend to?
Let's just be a couple dirty Mexicans and make it happen.
Make what happen?
How 'bout I just talk to you?
Let's make ourselves useful.
- Jimmy, come on.
- Yo.
Morning, Doc.
Hi.
How you feeling?
Bad.
What's wrong with me again?
Pyelonephritis.
It's a uti of the upper tract and kidney.
Pie-lo-na-fry-tis.
Like that?
Pyelonephritis.
Mm-hmm.
Sit up.
Okay.
- Are you sore there?
- Yeah.
- Here?
- Yeah.
Pyelonephritis.
Can you die from that?
Maybe, if you never took care of it.
But that's what us doctors are here for.
I thought you guys just played golf.
I don't know how to play golf.
I thought all doctors played golf.
I'm gonna learn.
Oh, hello, doctor.
Doctor, nice to see you again.
How's she doing?
Good.
Responding to antibiotics.
I could've died, right?
I was just saying it can be serious.
But it's completely under control.
So you mean, like, if this were before hospitals, she'd be dead?
I didn't say that.
It's amazing knowing how to save people like that.
I bet you even know the name of this.
Philtrum.
See?
I told you he'd know it.
Hi.
- Oh, hi, Rich.
- Hey, Mrs. Nixon.
Val.
This is my doctor.
He said I could have died.
- Dr. Blake.
- Hey.
So how's it going?
Okay.
You able to walk or...
I'll look in again later on.
You got, like, some kind of infection?
This says penicillin, right?
- Yeah.
- Come with me, please.
Mr. Sanchez is allergic to penicillin.
Well, it didn't say so on the...
This isn't the original admit sheet.
Where's the original?
I don't know what you're talking about.
On the original sheet, it said NKA, no known allergies.
- Well, did you ask him?
- He doesn't speak English.
If you knew he was allergic, why'd you give him penicillin?
Because you're the doctor.
I only do what you say.
Okay, let's get a Benadryl line...
Already took care of it.
Thank you.
- Where are you going?
- To file an incident report.
A what?
Why?
This is an incident.
It's procedure.
And can you rewrite this legibly?
What are you doing?
I'm looking for the original admit sheet.
I'm sorry, Doctor, but whatever it is you're looking for, you're not gonna find it there.
Here you go, T. Little present for you.
Marty!
This seat taken?
Look, right, right, right.
Right here, look, look, look, look.
Hey, Nancy, you want to sit down, right here?
So that's a no?
Have a good weekend.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me a second.
- Yeah, no problem.
Dr. Waylans, could I talk to you for a second?
Sure.
I just wanted to ask you about incident reports.
Is this about the Sanchez thing?
I wouldn't worry about it.
But does it go on my record?
I mean, is it bad?
I don't think so.
I mean, it's not good.
Will it affect my application for the infectious diseases fellowship?
I can't undo it, if that's what you mean.
I haven't heard that before.
No, that's fine.
Perfect.
While you're at it, why don't you just go screw her and get it over with?
No.
Because I'm sick, and I'm in the hospital, if you haven't noticed.
Oh, please.
You're such an asshole!
Go to hell.
I'm getting better.
It looks that way.
Everything okay?
Do you remember Rich?
I should break up with him.
You think I should break up with him?
That's none of my business.
He is the most popular guy in school.
I wasn't the most popular guy in school.
And now I'm a doctor.
What do you think Rich is going to be?
I don't know.
An idiot.
It's hard to dump him, though.
We've been together for a while.
I mean, I don't know if we're in love or anything.
- Well, you know what they say.
- What?
If you love someone, set them free.
Who says that?
Sting.
- I think.
- Who?
Excuse me, Doctor.
I'm with a patient.
I can't do these orders until I can read them.
I can't do these orders...
Press door open.
Press door open!
Hello, Doctor.
Having a rough day, are we?
No.
Fine.
Don't worry, I got it, too.
Every goddamn day's a shit fight just to get out of bed in the morning.
Oh.
What's bugging you, Doc?
This is a hospital.
The staff is supposed to follow orders, right?
Isn't that how it's supposed to be?
Doctors get a little respect?
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe.
It's probably not what you think, though.
I just want things to be like they're supposed to be.
How long has Theresa been here?
Didn't you learn how to get rid of people like that in med school?
Just slip 'em something, then they're going along, and then bam!
Heart attack!
Too bad.
I'm kidding, Doc.
Just bet you were thinking about it.
Okay, I'm clocking out.
Hi.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Okay, I guess.
What was the deal with that nurse?
It was a misunderstanding.
It's okay.
Shouldn't she be fired or something for yelling at a doctor?
Probably.
I don't want to cause a fuss.
Am I cured?
Nearly.
No more hospital?
No.
No more helpful advice?
I'll tell Nurse Ratched you're a good doctor.
Maybe she'll leave you alone.
Thanks.
You're a good patient.
All right, Nixon.
Signs are okay.
No pain, no spikes.
She's outta here.
Just another day, to be sure?
I already signed her out.
Let's move on.
Mr. Sanchez.
Hi.
Are you Diane's doctor?
- Yes.
- I'm Diane's father.
Thank you for everything.
I was just coming to say good-bye.
My wife just took her down to the car.
Any last-minute advice?
Finish her pills.
She could relapse.
Okay, we'll do that.
Uh, I don't know how to say this, but my daughter took quite a shine to you.
She thought you two got on pretty well, and she wondered if I might ask you over for dinner on Friday.
Friday.
Yes.
That'd be nice.
- Great.
- Friday.
We'll count on it.
See you then.
8:00 Friday.
Hello, Diane.
You feeling better?
How are you feeling?
Mr. Nixon.
Mrs. Nixon.
- Is that the doctor?
- Uh, yeah.
Let him in, for God's sake.
- Hi.
Come on in.
- Hi.
Welcome to our home.
Oh, you remember Valerie, right?
Hi.
I love yourjacket.
Thanks.
And this is our youngest, Donny.
- Hello.
- What's up?
- Not much.
- Please sit down.
- Where's Diane?
- Oh, she's out.
I told her to stay so that she didn't seem ungrateful, because we really are.
But she's having a talk with Rich.
So what's it like being a doctor?
A lot of work.
A lot of responsibility.
But I like it.
How many operations you do a week?
I'm in internal medicine.
What's that, like, intestines?
Donny, not at the table.
That'd be great.
Get in there and just dig around.
I don't do surgery.
I bet it pays pretty well, doesn't it, being a doctor?
Donny, don't pry.
It's actually less than you think, but it's a lot more than I'd make back home.
Bet he makes more than you do, Donny.
Besides, the money comes when you go into private practice, right?
You got a nice place?
It's okay.
The beach.
Oh, I love the beach.
You're so lucky.
I wish I lived by the beach and knew all this incredible knowledge about the human body.
- You know plenty.
- Donny, you pig!
- Stop...
- Valerie!
- Mom!
- He started it.
Moron, this was brand-new.
You're just gonna get sperm on it anyway.
Ow!
Let's not have that kind of language at the table there, guy.
Honestly, Donny.
I am so sorry, Doctor.
It's okay.
- Could I use your restroom?
- Certainly.
- It's down the hall on the right.
- Excuse me.
What, Mom?
He's a doctor.
It's not like he's never heard of sperm before.
- Hey!
- You are upsetting your father.
Where do you come up with this stuff?
- Oh!
- Sorry.
It's just something came up at the hospital, and I really have to go.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
Okay, that's it.
Have a good day, everyone.
Thanks.
I'll see you there.
Blake, can you stay for a second, please?
Sure.
Have a seat.
So how's it going?
Fine.
Oh, yeah?
Tired?
A little.
Happy?
Want some coffee?
No, thanks.
First year of residency can be tough, I know.
If this is about Mr. Sanchez...
I just wanted to chat about the big picture.
Tell me something, Martin, when did you first want to become a doctor?
- When?
- Yeah.
A long time ago, I guess.
Did you know why?
Why?
Because... a friend of my mother's was a doctor and he was respected, and I guess I just always thought, you know, to have that respect and to... and be helping people.
Yeah, people go into medicine for all kinds of reasons.
You know, sometimes they don't really think about it till they're here, face-to-face with it all.
And sometimes they realize the stress and the hours and the nature of the work aren't what they thought it would be.
I mean, it's not unusual for people to realize maybe this isn't what they wanted after all.
This is what I want.
I mean, I know I can do better.
It's just taking time for me to learn your system here.
I mean, I didn't have all the advantages, you know, growing up and school, and so sometimes
I just have to work harder, and I do.
Some of the nurses, I mean...
Maryanne's fine, but with Theresa...
I double-majored in chemistry and biology.
I went to school, I did all this work, and she just treats me like I'm some nobody.
It doesn't seem fair, but...
I do want this.
Hi, Martin, it's Valerie Nixon.
It was really nice to see you the other night.
I'm sorry you had to rush off.
My mom actually got you a gift basket, but we forgot to give it to you.
So I don't know if you wanted to arrange a time to come by and get it, or I could drop it by the hospital or your apartment, if you like.
So give us a call.
I'm home anytime but tonight.
Okay, bye.
Oh, Dr. Blake, come in.
Thank you.
Can I get you some coffee or anything?
No, thanks.
Valerie called.
She mentioned there was something for me to collect?
- Yeah.
- But I'm expected at the hospital.
Oh, of course.
Could I use your restroom?
Certainly.
- You remember where it was?
- Yeah.
- Oh, here you go.
- Thank you.
It's just a little something to say thanks.
Thanks again, Doctor.
Are there any special instructions for Diane?
Just finish her medicine.
I thought it was just malaise from hanging around the house so much.
I told you, it's pyelonephritis.
Ow.
I thought she was all better.
It did seem that way.
We'll run some tests to make sure.
But there are some resistant strains that are harder to treat.
Hey, Doc!
Hey, it's nice to have the little number back in 324, huh?
I don't think it's appropriate you talk about the patients in that manner.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hippocratic oath, right?
Yeah.
I need a cam profile.
- We need the ultrasound.
- Getting it.
- Here's one here.
- All right.
Who's the primary doctor?
Where's the chart?
What is this?
This doesn't make sense.
Another allergic reaction, Doctor?
No, this is something else.
See?
Vancomycin.
Not a penicillin reaction.
It wasn't my mistake.
Yeah, looks like red man syndrome.
Well, it can happen when...
When someone misadministers vancomycin.
Which doesn't surprise me because I never thought that Theresa, beyond her attitude, was all that sharp about these things.
Right, I'll look into it.
How's everything else?
I see the Nixon girl is back.
Yeah.
She said she took her oral meds.
But I'll do a resistance culture just to be sure.
All right.
Keep up the good work.
So, can't keep away.
It seems that way.
I'm sorry.
I'm not.
You don't want to go back to school?
Rich?
The medicine you're on now is much stronger.
You'll get better very soon.
Do I have to?
- Ooh!
- Oh, I'm really so sorry, Doctor.
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.
Maryanne, I'm really busy...
You know what?
They just let me go.
And before you hear it from anyone else,
I messed up Mr. Sanchez's vancomycin.
I switched the sheet and I just panicked.
I'm just sorry if I jeopardized a patient.
I thought it was Theresa.
No.
She didn't know anything about it.
Oh, so sorry to hold you up.
It's fine.
Excuse me.
Sorry, Doctor.
Good morning.
- How are you feeling?
- The same, I guess.
Your temperature's up a little.
Is that bad?
It's nothing serious, but you might have to stay an extra day or two.
Is that bad?
No.
That's fine.
Why don't you check in on me?
- Someone's coming.
- Shh, shh.
- Someone's coming.
- What are you talking about?
No one comes down here.
I promise you, baby.
- Ahem.
- Oh, hey, Doc.
- Uh...
- Get off me.
We were just talking.
Is this woman under sedation?
It's cool, man.
It's just a party, man.
Shit, it was her idea anyway.
Mandy, tell the doctor you're okay.
Doctor, I'm okay.
What are you doing down here, Doc?
Is there something I could help you with?
Just get her out of here.
All right, let's get you back to bed now, Mandy.
Mm-hmm.
Nice work, Doc.
Son of a bitch.
Is he paranoid?
Doc's all right.
He's just a little uptight.
Weren't you off at midnight?
Yes.
I just had some things to finish.
This patient's been a difficult case.
Everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.
Why don't you go home, Doctor?
My biggest concern would be an abscess or some kind of resistant bacterial strain.
An abscess is doubtful.
Keep your eye on the resistance culture.
We are seeing more resistance in these.
I was gonna start her on ceftazidime.
Well, if she doesn't start stabilizing, we're gonna have to move her to icu.
And keep an eye out for sepsis.
How often are you checking signs?
- Two hours.
- Okay.
Good.
Let me know what the resistance culture says.
I will.
What does that mean?
Your infection might be a little tougher than we thought.
We're starting you on another antibiotic, and we need to make sure that you're not developing sepsis.
What's that?
An intravascular infection.
An intra what?
It's in the bloodstream.
- Is that serious?
- It can be.
I didn't think doctors had to do that.
I don't mind.
If I have an operation, will you operate on me?
I don't operate.
Hmm.
I don't want to cut into people.
That's why I went into internal medicine.
If I do my job right, we never have to go in at all.
I don't want to talk to him.
Well, don't... think about it too much.
You need rest.
I know.
Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm looking for Diane Nixon.
I'm afraid she can't take visitors.
Look, man, we had this big bust-up.
I just need to see her for two minutes.
It's not a good idea.
Just leave her alone for a little while.
She needs rest.
Give this to her.
Sure.
You should be sleeping.
I can't.
What did the expert say?
He said it's a difficult case, but we're gonna work together on it and everything's gonna be okay.
There's something I didn't tell you about before I came back to the hospital.
I don't know if it's what could have made me get sick again.
What's that?
I had sex with Rich before I finished my medication.
That can upset your urinary tract, right?
I don't think that's what did it.
I didn't think you two were going out anymore.
You know how sometimes you do things you know you shouldn't, but you just can't help it?
Yeah.
I'm not gonna die, am I?
No, of course not.
I always thought if I was gonna die,
I wanted to, like, get shot stopping a crime or something.
I know that's stupid.
Do you ever think about stuff like that?
When I was younger, maybe.
It's silly.
What did you imagine?
I would think about just walking into the ocean and just disappearing like I never existed.
And the world would just go on without me.
I love the ocean.
I'm not sure I've seen anything quite like this.
Yeah, it's been a tough case.
They had an Acinetobacter at South East General, but I've never seen one of these so resistant before.
You've been doing regular cultures to check against some other bug, maybe some nosocomial thing?
I considered that, but nothing's come up in cultures.
Martin's been very thorough.
He's done everything I would have done.
And she's been properly administered all along?
Yes.
Well, Martin, it looks like you've landed yourself a tricky one.
I drew up the protocol to treat the sepsis... shoot.
I must have left it in my car.
I'm due upstairs.
Would you mind?
No.
No, I was just about to grab lunch.
Silver Mercedes, Johns Hopkins stickers.
And it's in the back.
It's a tube that goes into your heart.
It doesn't hurt.
So you can look in any time you want?
Yeah.
If you had one, too, we could have a heart-to-heart.
Doctor, we're ready to proceed.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
Just kind of groggy.
They put pain medicine into your iv.
Any pain from the catheter?
No.
It's weird.
I feel kinda nice, actually.
Can I ask you a question?
Of course.
You're not married or don't have a girlfriend or anything.
What's the question?
Why not?
You know how people are in the world.
Yeah.
You know, for a while, I thought you liked my sister.
No.
Good, she's a slut.
You don't want a girl like that.
Doctor.
I know, I did it myself.
Where is she?
Excuse me.
Who?
Diane Nixon.
Oh, they took her for an mri.
I just got a code four.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where is she?
!
- Epinephrine.
- Epinephrine in.
Start Lidocaine drip.
Get the defibrillator.
Set it to 102.
- Charge.
- Clear!
Start CPR.
Hold CPR.
- Clear!
- We're clear!
Yeah.
Yeah, that's it.
Call it.
Dr. Blake?
- Dr. Blake?
- Yes?
Sorry about yesterday, the Nixon girl.
She seemed nice.
She was.
Thank you.
- Dr. Blake?
- Yes?
Dr. Waylans would like to see you in conference room three.
You wanted to see me?
Yes, Martin.
Take a seat.
This the first time this has happened?
Yes.
I never meant it to happen.
It just... got out of control.
Well, this is Dr. Sayler.
She's a psychiatrist on staff here.
Hello, Martin.
It's always hard to lose a patient, especially the first time.
You always question yourself.
You wonder if you made mistakes, if you missed something, could you have been quicker?
These things happen.
Accepting that is part of being a doctor.
If there's anything you want to express, please don't hold back.
Can I ask you a question?
Okay.
Did you cry yesterday?
I did, yes.
Good.
That's good.
Oh, Mr. Nixon, I am so sorr...
Just want to talk to the doctor.
You killed my little girl.
Okay, Mr. Nixon, I am truly sorry for your loss, but you cannot come onto my ward and start accusing my doctors.
That bastard killed my daughter.
What is the problem, sir?
She was fine, then she came in here and you killed her.
Martin, let me handle this.
Sir, these infections can be very difficult to treat.
It was a rare, resistant strain.
Now, if she didn't take every one of her pills, that could strengthen the infection.
We don't know.
She took her pills.
She told me.
Don't blame Dr. Blake, sir.
I supervised him through the entire case.
He was exemplary in every way.
We did everything we could.
Everything, all of us.
Sir, can you come with me, please?
- Sir.
- Get your hands off me.
You bastards.
Is the situation under control, or do you need backup?
Everything's fine.
We're coming out.
I'm sorry, Martin.
You shouldn't have to deal with that.
It's a tough one.
Yeah.
Don't worry about it.
Waylans told me you're not really a doctor until you've lost a patient.
You got your scrubs.
Hey, hold up.
Going to x-ray, Mr. Granger?
There's no hearing aid.
Right, Mr. Granger, you crazy old fucker?
So it must be a relief to get onto that new rotation.
Sounds like that last one was pretty rough.
These things happen, unfortunately.
It's part of being a doctor, dealing with loss.
Oh.
So I guess you're a doctor now.
I suppose so.
You know what I always thought would be the best part about being a doctor?
It's the ladies.
The ladies love a doctor.
You find that to be true?
I suppose so, yes.
No.
What do you mean?
Meet me in the east tower basement, five minutes.
- Why?
- I think you know.
What is it?
Well, Doctor, I just wanted to ask you an ethical question about the relations between staff and patients.
That woman in the supply room?
Forget about it.
No, no, no, no, that's not my question.
See, I'm more interested in a situation like this.
All right, say a guy like me, you know, who likes to party, but otherwise is a regular guy, like an orderly, one day, he's taking this gurney to change it out... oh, and the previous tenant was this girl,
this sweet girl, she just passed away.
Anyway, this guy's taking out the mattress, and to his surprise, finds a little book under there.
And, well, there's some really shocking stuff in there about this one young doctor.
Seems they had kind of a little special relationship going on.
Now my question is this, do you think it's wrong, ethically, for this orderly to keep this book from his superiors?
Let's take a ride.
What do you want?
Another reason I wish I was a doctor is so I could prescribe myself a better time.
I party, and nobody sees this.
I can't do that.
Where there's a will, there's a way, right?
Ahem, Doctor?
Uh, I had a question about this order.
Is it my handwriting?
Uh, no, I can read it, it's just you prescribed oxycodone for Mr. Granger?
He's had some pain from the Hickman catheter, so, yeah.
Okay, sorry, I just wanted to check.
Do you need help?
No, thanks.
What's troubling you?
What?
That's for stomachs, and that stuff's more for, like, sniffling and sneezing.
I know.
I'm a doctor.
Okay, sorry.
Dude, four?
They're hard to get.
I hope this is a down payment.
Okay, fine.
What about the book?
- What about it?
- When do I get it back?
You never had it.
I'm not gonna do this indefinitely.
I don't think you have much of a choice, Doctor.
Time you switched to decaf?
Mmm.
Cheers.
Rotation wasn't so tough.
And they say the second half of the year, everything gets easier.
Martin.
I'm sorry to hear about your patient.
- Difficult case.
- Yes, it was.
I've been doing a study of these resistant bugs and was hoping you might be able to help me review this one if you kept your notes and charts together.
Dr. Waylans tells me you're thinking of applying for the lD fellowship.
Yes, I am.
I think that's a fine idea.
Fine idea.
Yo, Doc.
Is this the patient?
Yes.
- James?
- Yeah?
I'd like to talk to you when you get a chance.
Yeah, I get off in 30 minutes.
Great.
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hi.
Hey there, partner.
You got it?
Those are different.
They're more like morphine.
They're better.
I want the book.
Oh.
Maybe soon.
Really?
No, that's not gonna work for me.
You just keep 'em coming, you'll be all right.
Have fun.
You know I will.
What are you doing?
You can't take those here.
Why not?
I'm off duty.
You shouldn't drive on them.
I got a ride.
What's with you, man?
Dude, don't make a big deal out of this.
We're all human beings.
We all gotta get our kicks somehow.
What are you doing?
Don't follow me.
I'm just walking.
Get away from me.
You're making this more than it has to be, Doc.
- You want more?
- Yeah.
- You want more?
- Sure, yeah.
All right.
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
Some kind of seizure.
Call a code, he's gone into arrest!
All right, all right.
I got it.
Okay.
Okay, Jimmy!
Jimmy, can you hear me?
Jimmy?
Okay, okay, okay.
Jimmy, it's Dr. Waylans.
Jimmy!
Jimmy, stay with me.
Jimmy.
Stay with us.
- I got the elevator.
- All right, good.
- So was he sick or anything?
- I don't know.
He went into some kind of seizure.
I tried to help.
I wouldn't be surprised if it was some sort of drug overdose.
What makes you think that?
His very erratic behavior.
Some of the nursing staff, it occurred to them that he might be a drug abuser.
They had a mandatory test scheduled.
Perhaps you should go home.
Take a break.
Get back to the business of being a doctor on Monday.
You off tomorrow?
Yup.
Okay with you, Detective, if the good doctor here goes home?
Uh, yeah, I guess.
If we have any more questions, we'll be in touch, if you don't mind.
No, not at all.
I'm pretty sure Rich was there.
He kissed me right as I was leaving.
Went to the hospital today.
They want to keep me overnight.
Rich asked me to be his girlfriend.
The diagnosis isn't anything bad.
He said he loved me, but he doesn't act like it.
It looks like a uti.
If you love someone, set them free.
I spent the night at Rich's.
They called a specialist.
He carried me into the bedroom and laid me down.
I can't believe he's hanging out with Jenny.
He looks at me like I'm some lab rat in a cage.
He's such a liar.
Having surgery tomorrow.
I have sepsis.
They put the tube in this morning.
It's an infection.
The anesthesia was great.
It's actually kinda nice.
Gave me the weirdest dreams.
Why is this happening to me?
It's so quiet.
I can't sleep.
I'm not getting any better.
Dr. Blake?
Yes.
Detective Krauss, from the hospital yesterday.
You said if we had any more questions...
I'm sorry to just drop by like this.
Right.
Fine, come in.
Can I get you anything?
No, thanks.
So it seems the, uh, the pills Mr. Vega took were spiked with potassium cyanide.
- You know about that?
- No.
Well, yeah, I mean, I know what it is.
Some people suspect that he abused drugs.
Looks like maybe he got a bad batch.
That's a shame.
I mean, I didn't know him that well.
That's why I'm not as upset as I would be if I knew him better.
I knew him to say hello to.
Did you ever see him taking drugs?
No.
I hardly knew him, like I said.
You have a pen I could borrow?
Thanks.
You knew this orderly?
Just slightly.
Not well.
Kind of.
I mean, he was not my kind of person.
Do you know where he got the drugs?
Could he have gotten them from the hospital?
Stolen them?
No, they're carefully monitored, so I don't know how an orderly could.
Only a doctor can prescribe.
Could a doctor have gotten them for him?
Theoretically a doctor could... fake a prescription or skim from a patient.
But that wouldn't be ethical, so they don't.
So a doctor could have gotten these?
No.
Did any doctors have any kind of a relationship with Mr. Vega?
What?
No, I...
I don't know.
I mean, like I said, I didn't care for him, so I didn't hang around him.
Were there any other doctors who may have disliked him, who could've tainted the pills with the, uh...
Potassium cyanide.
Look, uh...
I'm sorry if I seem distracted.
I understand.
It must be tough trying to get back to normal after seeing somebody die like that.
It has been... especially with her.
Who?
No one.
Just... a patient died.
It was a resistant strain of an infection.
They're rare, but increasingly common.
Antibiotics and cleansers are making germs tougher.
It was a difficult case, everyone agreed.
I know I must seem like I'm reacting differently now than with James' passing away, but he wasn't much of a person.
I mean, he'd make lewd comments at women patients.
I think he may have even fooled around with them, which, as a doctor, you can't.
Diane was a very nice girl.
We were close.
In a doctor-patient way, before she died.
But that's over now, and I'm back to the business of being a doctor.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Well, you know where I am, Detective, if you have any more questions.
Excuse me a moment.
- Doctor?
- Just a second.
Mind if I have a glass of water?
No, not at all.
Help yourself.
I'm sorry.
I need to collect some things.
I'm needed at the hospital.
Do you have any more questions?
I'm afraid I'm in a bit of a hurry.
Well, no.
I guess not.
I'll let you get ready, then.
Thanks for your help, Doctor.
My pleasure.
His HH are 12 and 36.
WBC 10.9 with a slight shift to the left.
He's on a broad-spectrum antibiotic.
I'm about to hang his third dose.
Let's do blood cultures now and times two for a temporary, then 101.
- Yeah.
- Is it gonna hurt?
A little, but don't worry.
I'm getting better all the time.
Make a fist.
- Doctor?
- Yes.
Martin
We and touches us.
How come you fell asleep so fast?
Ambition, a good diet, concentration, good communication.
Got a new support?
I heard that is part of the family and used be his.
Well, in that case ...
As I like.
Are you going to that thing for the new residence?
I do not know.
- Carson's daughter will be there.
- Who is Carson?
Cardiology.
It is the best in that specialty.
Mark's time we start looking for that trophy wife.
Bring it back!
Dr.Leary,4152.
Doctor Leary, 4152.
As it is, sir ...
- Sanchez?
- I do not speak English.
- Do not speak Spanish.
- Doctor, mind you.
I s ent b in here in my chest.
I have a lot of pain, much, much pain here.
- I need medicine, I feel good.
- Please wait for me a moment.
- Please, Doctor!
- Doctor Pange, do you speak Spanish?
No.
Can you cough?
.
Right.
Ok, you need descanzar enough.
- Rest.
Sleep.
Resting.
- Rest.
So, is that you need ok?
The results are negative.
What proposals are for this case?
I thought we should discard it.
Ell has the syndrome are and is likely to have a slow death.
So, is something that can be a pain chronic.
- What are you talking about a divorce?
.
- Did you talk to her?
- No, not on things like that.
- We are talking about a syndrome.
Communication is the key to everything.
- Blake!
- Yes?
- Blake, things are going well?
- Yes
I was wondering, the infection is exposed to the disease?
- Yes
- Okay so I wanted to say.
Do you have any advice?
Missing 6 days for the residence, you can not apply until next year.
I just want to be prepared.
Oh well not much to do.
A great candidate is simply a good doctor.
Clear.
That means you're a good doctor.
Is not Martin?
It acts like one.
- I do, I do.
- Well then you're fine.
- Doctor Waylans!
- Yes, Martin?
Can I re-take the photo identification?
I have no idea!
- Excuse me, what does it say here?
- Penicillin.
Excuse me, when will the doctor?
I am the doctor.
Ok, that's all for now.
¿Nurse, doing this procedure?
You'll have to do it yourself.
Do you know how to do it?
Yeah, thanks.
Is that right?
Sorry, we assume that a nurse do this type of thing.
- A what?
- This will drain some blood.
Doctors do not do this.
Very good.
Ok.
There you are!
I'm so sorry, I thought you were someone else!
Who thought it was?
I already knew.
So, for a minute I thought it was you!
There is only one, that's my rule.
He is Martin, She is Christine Martin.
- Hello.
- She is the daughter of Dr. Carson.
Well, again you were a nerd Total high school.
That's right!
- Really?
- Yes!
One day I realized that he would die virgin.
With a couple of Mexicans we can make it all happen.
- Make it happen, why?
- What if you're just something useful?
Jimmy, come on.
Good morning, Doctor.
Hey.
- How do you feel?
- Mal
What do I have?
Pilonefritis, is a disease in the kidney.
Pilonefritis.
Like this?
Pilonefritis.
Sit back,
OK?
- Do you feel pain?
- Yes
- Here?
- Yes
Pilonefritis.
- Can you die from it?
- Maybe.
If ever you take care of that, but for that is that we the doctors here.
- I'm just playing golf.
- I do not know how to play Golf.
I thought all doctors playing golf.
Ended.
- Oh, hello doctor.
- Doctor is a pleasure to see again.
How are you?
- Very well, responding to antibiotics.
I could die!
Right?
Just saying that could be serious.
But this completely under control.
You say that if I had not come to hospital in time, be dead?
I did not say that.
It's amazing to know how to save people that way.
I bet you an even, know the name of this.
- Philtrum!
- I told you I knew it!
- Hello!
- Hey Rich.
Hello Mrs. Nixon.
He is my doctor said I could have died.
- Doctor Blank?
- Hey.
What is good?
- How's it going?
- Well.
- You can walk or ...
- Then come back later.
You say penicillin, right?
- Yes
- Come with me, please.
Mr. Sanchez is penisilina allergic to.
Do not say that?
This tab is not even original ...
I do not know what you mean.
The orginal tab says NKAA, analysis.
Well, Would you ask?
Speak English, why you give penicillin?
Because you're the doctor, and I do what you say.
- Ok, traigámosle a ...
- I took care of that.
- Thank you.
- Where are you going?
- To make an incident report.
- Why?
This is an incident, is the procedure.
And can write this legibly?
What do you do?
I am looking for the original tab.
Sorry doctor, whatever it is looking for is not going to find here.
Hello beautiful, here I leave you this gift.
Is this seat taken?
Look, look, look.
Hey Nancy, Will you sit here?
So always.
- Excuse me, excuse me a second.
- Yes, no problem.
Doctor Waylans, ¿I can speak a second?
Insurance.
I wanted to ask about incident reports.
Is this thing on Mr. Sanchez?
Do not worry about that.
But do not go on my record?
That's bad.
I think not, I say, not a good thing.
¿It would affect my application for scholarship studying infectious diseases?
I can not undo it, if that is what you mean.
Itlooksgood.
Perfect wanted to discuss it.
You know, because I'm sick and I'm in the hospital, if you have not noticed.
Oh, please, you're an idiot!
Go to hell.
I'm improving.
So it seems.
All right?
Do you remember Rich?
Should end with him.
- Do you have to end it?
- It's not my business.
This is the most popular in school.
I was never the kid more popular in school.
And now ...
I am a doctor.
- What will you do?
- Do not know.
He's an idiot.
It's hard to end it because we been together a while.
I mean, I do not know if I love or something.
You know what they say.
What?
If you love someone, set them free.
- Who says that?
- Sting.
- What are you laughing?
- Who?
Excuse me, doctor?
I'm with a patient.
I can not make these orders until they are reviewed.
Do not close the door.
Do not close the door.
Hello Doctor!
- Is having a rough day, right?
- No, I'm fine.
Do not worry, I feel the same.
Every day is a fight, only to out of bed in the morning.
What floor is, doctor?
This is a hospital, the staff is supposed to follow orders, right?
Do doctors do not receive a little respect?
I do not know, perhaps, probably not what you think.
I just want things to be as they are supposed to be.
How long have you been working here, Teresa?
Do not you taught to deal with people like in medical school?
Just ignore them and do not follow the current.
And then, bam!
A heart attack!
Too bad!
Just kidding, Doc.
I think I know what I was thinking.
- Hello.
- Hello.
How do you feel?
- Well I guess.
What about that nurse?
That was a misunderstanding, All is well.
Should not dismiss her, or something, by yelling at a doctor?
Probably.
But I mean no problems.
Am I cured?
Almost.
No more hospital?
No.
Will you give me some advice?
Everyone says you're a good doctor.
Maybe I should leave.
Thank you.
You're a good patient.
Let's see, next.
No pain, no stitches, she can go from here.
Only one more day, to be sure.
No, I gave him high.
Mr. Sanchez ...
- Hello, is Dr. Diane?
- Yes
I am the parent of D BC, thanks for everything.
- I just came to say goodbye.
- My wife has just brought the car.
Any last minute advice?
To take your pills and is like new.
Ok, we will.
My daughter took a shine with you.
Fairly well cared for and ...
I wanted you to invite dinner at home on Friday.
Friday?
- Yes, on Friday would be fine.
- Great.
You will have then.
See you there, at 8 o'clock on Friday.
Hi Diane, you feel better?
How do you feel?
Mr. Nixon, Mrs. Nixon.
- Is the doctor?
- Yes, hello.
Hello, happens!
Welcome to our home.
- Oh, recalls Valerie, right?
- Hello, I love your jacket.
- Thank you.
- He is our youngest son, Donny.
- Hello?
- What is it?
Not much!
Sit down please.
- Where is Diane?
- Left.
I told him to stay, so they do not seems spoiled.
For in truth, We are very grateful, but ...
He's talking to Rich.
How is being a doctor?
Lots of work, a lot of responsibility, but I like it.
- How many operations a week ago?
- I still hospitalized.
- What is that, as a test?
- Dony, not in the table.
Let's mom I can not say anything?
I do not think it is just that.
I bet they pay very good doctors.
Donny, please.
It's less than you think, but is much more than he earned at home.
In addition, he earns more than you, Donny.
Besides the money comes, when you enter to a private, right?
- Have a nice house?
- Yes, okay.
- On the beach.
- Oh, I love the beach.
You're so lucky!
I want to live ... on the beach, and know as much on the human body.
You seem like ...
Do not be stupid!
Valerie!
- Mom!
- He started it!
- Mom this was new!
- As he drops cum!
No!
Look you know what nenesito you do, right?
Honestly, Donny!
- I'm so sorry doctor!
- Okay.
¿I can use your bathroom?
Sure, it's down the hall in his right hand.
What mom?
it's not like a doctor had never heard sperm.
A thousand apologies.
Ok, that's all.
Release tables.
Blake, Can we talk a minute?
Clear.
Sit down, please.
Well, how's it going?
Very good.
Yes, all right?
A little.
Are you happy?
Want some coffee?
No, no thanks.
I think we can talk about your residence.
If this is about mr.
Sanchez ...
I just wanted to talk of something more general.
Tell me something Martin?
When was the first time you wanted to be doctor?
- When?
- Yes
Makes a long time ago, I guess.
- Do you know why?
- Why?
Because ...
A friend of my mom was a doctor and, was quite respectable, and ...
I guess I always have thought that, respect.
And helping people.
Yeah, well, people change by all sorts of reasons.
Sometimes I do not believe or think about it, until they are here, face to face
With all this, some sometimes realize ... who are stressed, are long hours and ... the nature of work is not they thought it would be.
It is not unusual for people to see that maybe this ...
- Not what you want after all.
- This is what I want.
I can learn more, I just take something time to learn your system.
Actually I had no advantage growing up or going to school.
So sometimes I have to work harder, and I do.
But some of the nurses ...
I thought we had a career in chemical biology.
That nurse is me like a foolish child.
Does not seem fair, but ...
I do want to be here.
Hi Martin, I am Valerie Nixon, was very nice to see you the other night.
Too bad you have had to go so fast.
My mom bought you a bag of gifts, but give it forget.
So I do not know if you want to arrange a time to come and pick it up.
Or it could leave the hospital.
Or your department, if you want ...
So call us, I'll be home tonight.
Ok, bye!
- Oh, Doctor Blake, forward,
- Thank you.
- I can bring some coffee or something?
- No thanks.
Valerie called, Did he mention that there was something I could collect?
Yes.
- But I hope in the hospital.
- Oh, right!
- Could I use your bathroom?
- Certainly!
Do you remember where is it?
Oh, here.
- Thank you.
- It's something to thank him.
Thanks again Doc!
Are there any instructions Diane special?
Only you finish your medicine.
I thought it was just laziness, being much time at home.
I told you is Pilonefritis.
I thought it was better.
So it seemed.
We will do some analysis to be sure.
But there are some resistors that are difficult to treat.
Hey, Doc.
It's nice to have that pretty girl back in 324 right?
I do not think it is good that speak well of the patients.
Oh, I should not do it?
What is this?
This is nonsense!
- Forgot to give you something, Doctor?
- No.
This is something else.
See?
was no reaction penisilina, it was my mistake.
It seems that all is well, it happens ...
When someone does not administers the medicine well.
I'm not surprised because I never told Teresa anything about these things.
We will review, How is everything?
That girl Nixon, do you turn?
Yes, said he took all his medicines.
I will do a resistance test, just to be safe.
Very good, keep up the good work.
- You can not zoom out.
- So it seems.
Sorry.
I do not.
Do not want to go back to school?
¿Rich?
Now the virus is stronger.
You'll be fine, soon.
Do I have to?
I'm so sorry, doctor.
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.
They just say goodbye, will not be here for anyone else.
I missed the vincomizen Mr. Sanchez.
I changed the sheet, and just panicked.
I just feel sorry for having harmed to a patient.
- Where was Teresa?
- No, she did not know anything about it.
Oh, so sorry, I'll help.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Sorry doctor.
Good morning.
Good morning.
- How do you feel?
- Same, I guess.
I uploaded a little temperature.
I do not feel so bad.
Not bad, but you may have to stay a day or two.
Is that bad?
No, okay, while you are coming to see me.
God Hey, Doc
We were here, talking.
- Did this woman is in the hospital?
- It's all good, brother.
It's just a fun friend, just she is fine.
Mandy, tell the doctor you're okay.
Doctor, I'm fine.
What does down here, doc?
Is there something that can help?
Just leave here.
Very well have to return you, Mandy.
Good job, doc.
Son of a bitch.
- What are you doing here, at midnight.
- Yes, just had to finish some things.
The patient has been a difficult case.
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, everything is fine.
Go home to rest, Doc
My big concern is a access, or some kind of bacteria.
Oh, that's weird, resistance we have seen this.
Nomenzar would with a pair of analysis.
If not begin to stabilize, we have to move to ICU.
Keep it under surveillance, How often the vigils?
- Every two hours.
- Ok, let me know if you spend more.
What does that mean?
That your condition is a little more hard we thought.
We must ensure the antibiotic, which you are enduring.
What is that?
- An infection intravenal.
- A intra what?
The fluid is blood.
Is that serious?
It can be.
I did not think that doctors had to do that.
I do not mind it.
If I have to operate, Would it be you that I operate?
I do not trade.
I do not want to cut people.
The latter in internalized.
- I did my job, right?
- It's what you do.
I do not want to talk.
Expected.
I think too.
Need descanzar.
I know.
- I can help?
- Yes, I look for Diane Nixon.
I'm afraid I can not see you now.
Look friend had a great fight, I have only see two minutes.
Not a good idea, let alone only a little longer.
Need descanzar.
Can you give this?
Insurance.
You should be sleeping.
I can not.
What does the expert?
He said it is a difficult case, but we to work together on it.
Everything will be fine.
There's something I did not say.
Before you return to the hospital.
I do not know if all goes to make I get sick again.
What happened?
Rich had sex with before finish the medication.
Could that have affected my situation?
I think that was what happened.
But do not think that you will re sick.
Sometimes you do things he knows he should not.
But I just can not avoid.
Yes.
I not die, right?
No.
Of course not.
I always thought that if I was going to die, would not until ... die if someone shoot me stopping a crime, or something.
I know it's stupid.
Did you ever think you in such things?
When I was younger, maybe.
It's silly.
What imagined?
I was thinking of entering the ocean and disappear as if it never existed.
And the world would be without me.
I love the ocean.
I'm not sure have seen something like this before.
It is a difficult case.
I have seen this virus, but had never seen one as resistant to everything.
Have you been doing regular rounds seeing if there is another virus?
- Or something more advanced?
- I considered that, but nothing is ...
Nothing has gone to 100%.
I'm very happy, he did everything what I would do in a case.
What has been administered properly?
Yes.
Well Martin ...
Seems to have landed in a rather difficult.
I did a protocol to treat it.
Hell, I should have left in my car!
- I left it up, would you mind?
- No.
- No, that's fine.
- A silver Mercedes.
Back Fast!
- You will not feel anything, does not hurt.
- Will you see me, when you want?
Yes.
So you're going to see the inside my heart?
Hey!
How do you feel?
Right.
Just a little odd.
They are putting you drug in the blood.
What's in pain?
No, the truth is strange, I feel good.
¿I can ask you a question?
Of course.
You're not married, or have a girlfriend or something?
Why you ask?
Why not?
You know how people are.
Yes?
For a while I thought you liked my sister.
No.
Good, because it is a bitch.
You do not want a girl like that.
- I know, I did it myself.
- Where is it?
Excuse me, who?
- Diane Nixon!
- She was taken for an MRI.
- I see it.
I do not know what you mean.
Where is it!
DoctorBlake.
-DoctorBlake.
- Yes
Sorry about yesterday, Nixon for the girl.
He seemed friendly.
It was, thanks.
- Doctor Blake?
- Yes?
The Doctor is waiting Waylans in conference room 3.
You wanted to see me?
Yes, Martin.
Sit.
Is it the first time this has happened?
Yes.
I never wanted to happen, just ...
I had it under control.
Well talk to Sally, she is a psychiatrist.
Hello, Martin.
It's always hard to lose a patient.
Especially the first time.
Do you question it?
Wondering if you made mistakes?
If you missed something?
If you could be faster.
These things happen.
It is the other part of being a doctor.
If there is anything you want to express ... please do not keep it.
¿I can ask you a question?
Ok.
Did you cry today?
I did, yes.
Very good.
That is good.
- Mr. Nixon.
- I have to talk to the doctor.
- You killed my baby.
- Ok.
Mr. Nixon, really sorry for her loss, but can not come here ...
- And start to accuse my doctors
- That bastard killed my daughter.
Is there a problem, sir?
She was fine, then came here and he killed her.
Martin, let me handle this, that Mr. infection was very difficult to treat.
It was very rare, if she had not taken all your pills ...
That could have given more power to infection, do not know.
She took her pills, told me.
Do not blame the dr.
Blake, supervised throughout the case in everything he did.
We did everything we could, However, all of us.
Lord, please Am I with?
- Sir?
- Let go, go alone.
Bastards.
It's all good, man.
It is enough to have to deal with guilt.
It was a tough one.
Do not worry, they say you're not a doctor ... really until lose to a patient.
Hey, you look like one of "Scrubs"
Hey, wait!
How are you, Mr. Granger?
Do not listen to Mr. Grangger truth, crazy bastard.
You must be relieved that you could passing notation.
It seems that the last was quite difficult.
One of the things unfortunate to be a doctor.
Dealing with losses.
That's being a doctor, right?
.
So it seems.
You know what I thought it would the best part of being a doctor?
Women.
They love to doctors.
- Do you already have a lady with you?
- By the way, yes.
No, what do you mean?
Come, come and see.
- What is it?
- Well doctor, I wanted to ask you a question.
On the relations between staff and patients.
That woman in the room supplements?
Forget it.
No, that's not my question, I am more interested in such a situation.
Let's say a guy like me, who likes to party.
A standard rate, regardless of my age.
One day he decides to change everything.
Before there was a girl, but just death, as this guy ... takes the mattress, and to his surprise ... find a book under it.
Well, there are some things about a Dr. young ...
It seems they had something special.
My question is this:
Think is wrong, ethically, this situation ... the fact of staying with this book ... or give to superiors.
Let's take a walk.
Where do we go?
Another reason would be doctor, for prescribirme a better time.
I leave party and no one will see this.
I can not do that.
Well there is always a way, right?
Doctor?
I have a question about this.
- What is it?
- I can read it.
It is something that has to do with Mr. Granger.
Yes, you may do it, then yes.
Ok, fine, I just wanted to check it.
- Need Help?
- No thanks.
- What bothers you?
- What?
That is for the stomach.
And that's more for sneezing.
I know, I'ma doctor.
Ok ...
Sorry.
What?
¿4?
- They are difficult to obtain.
- I hope this is what I ordered.
Yes, well.
- What's the book?
- What about him?
- When you give me?
- You want it?
We will not do this then.
I believe there is another option, doctor.
Now switched to decaf?
Health.
I told you that the rotations were not so difficult.
This time of year everything is easier.
Martin!
I'm sorry about your patients.
- It was a difficult case.
- Yes, it was.
I was doing a study on these resistant virus, was waiting ... who may want help to review this virus, in particular.
If you saved your notes and cards.
I heard that you are applying for research grant.
Yes.
I think it's a good idea.
Very good idea!
What's up, Doc?
- Is this the patient?
- Yes
- James.
- Yes
I would like to talk to you when you have time.
Yes, I leave in 30 minutes.
Clear.
Hey, buddy.
Got it?
It looks different.
Is morphine.
It's better than normal, I want the book.
Yes ..
I will soon.
Really?
No, it will not work for me just keep bringing me things.
Have fun!
You know I will!
What are you doing?
You can not take it here.
Why not?
I'm out of service.
You should not drive with that in the system.
I have who takes me.
What's up friend?
Do not do like a big deal.
We are all human beings.
What are you doing?
Do not follow me.
- I'm just walking.
- Stay away from me!
You're doing this more rare than that has to be, friend.
You know what?
- Want more?
- Yes, sure.
- What is happening?
- I do not know, some kind of infection!
Call someone!
I have it, I have.
Jimmy, Jimmy!
Can you hear me?
Jimmy, I'm Dr. Waylans!
Jimmy!
Jimmy, stay with me!
Jimmy!
Stay with us.
- He was sick or something?
- Do not know.
He went into some kind of attack, I tried to help.
I would not be surprised if some type of drug overdose.
What makes you think that?
These symptoms are very normal.
Some nurses were account may be abusing drugs.
We had a scan, to confirm.
Maybe you should go home, relax, returns to be a doctor on Monday.
Is it OK?
Yes.
Ok, ok if this detective Doctor goes home?
Well ... yeah, I guess.
If you have any other questions or ...
I do not know, we could be in contact if you do not mind.
Not at all.
-Dr.Blake?
- Yes
DetectiveBrownof thehospital.
saidhecouldtalktoyouif had more questions.
Sorry well come without warning.
course,pass.
- I can get you anything?
- No thanks.
It seems that the pills mr.
Vega taken, were mixed with potassium.
Do you know what that is?
- No.
Well, something that I know.
Some people suspected who abused drugs.
- Seems to have had a bad patch.
- I see.
I mean, did not know him so well, perhaps know to tell if you know better.
Greeted him.
- Have you ever saw him taking drugs?
- No.
I hardly knew him, as I said.
Do you have a pen I can borrow?
Thank you.
- Did you know him too little?
- Yes, very little.
Not even that.
I mean, he was ... not my type of person.
Do you know where could drugs have gotten?
- Do you think got into the hospital?
- No, they are very careful.
Only a doctor can prescribe.
Do you know a Doctor he could deal given?
Theoretically, a doctor can ... make a prescription false for a patient ... but it would be unethical, so do not.
So ...
Did a doctor may have achieved something?
No!
Do you know a doctor who may have had any relationship with him?
What?
No, do not know.
As I said, I did not care much, so do not go out much with him.
Are there any other doctor, maybe he did not like?
Or they could have altered the pills ...
- With the ...
- Cyanide of potassium.
Look, I'm sorry if you it seems distracted.
I understand.
It must be difficult to return to normal after seeing someone die like that.
Yes. has been ...
Especially with it.
Who?
No one.
Only one patient of mine who died.
He had a rare infection.
He started up his infection, very rare.
And in the end could not hold your body.
It was a difficult case, all are agree with that.
Not to sound a maniac but ... was not a good person, he grotezcos comments to patients.
I think I even could have had something to some.
As a doctor, you can not do that.
Diane was a very pretty girl.
We were very close.
In a way, with a ratio of doctor / patient before he died.
But that's over and I can back to being a doctor.
Is it a beautiful day, right?
Well you know where I am detective.
If you have further questions.
Excuse me.
- Doctor?
- A second!
- Is there a problem?
- No, no, no!
All right!
Sorry, I have to collect some things I need in the hospital.
Do you have any other questions?
I'm afraid I'm a little late.
Well, no ...
I guess not.
I'll let him get ready then.
- Thanks for your help doctor.
- The pleasure is all mine.
WBC 1237 at 10:49 is in prospect yet.
I gave him some antibiotics, I am by give him his third dose.
- Time to put the time to 101.
- Yes
- Will it hurt?
- A little.
But do not worry, improved each time, make a fist.
- Doctor!
- Yes?
I just think people are struggling to get past the idea of living in an old asylum
Bad things happened here.
That doesn't just go away.
Do you see ghosts?
I don't just see ghosts.
I see how they die.
- What are you frightened of?
- Help!
Get out!
Zoey never came home last night.
I know who you are.
You're never out of the looney bins for long, are you Jed?
Just like your mother.
You Bettanys are all the same.
Ex-patient.
Used to hang around the place apparently.
Ella.
Come play.
Ella, come back.
Bedlam S01E04 using timing from sub by LEGENDA TRX MARÇO DE 2011
Ella.
Come and play.
Come see.
She's got a serious mood on her.
Have you tried talking to her?
Only for the past 20 years.
- God.
Who died?
- Short memory, Mol
- The old lady?
- Grace.
- Were you guys at a funeral?
- Yeah.
Pay our respects.
Okay.
Look at the time.
Wow, you're really buying into this whole punctuality thing, Mol.
Yeah.
Trying to get a kid to school will do that to you.
So does having a crush on the dad.
If you've been feeding him this, can I just say it's really sad.
I haven't said anything.
At least you didn't over-react.
Then I'd think you really like him.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Dad!
- Ella, can you give me that, please.
- Can you give it to me?
- No. 'cause you'll want it all night long.
How do you turn this off?
Right.
Arms up, arms up.
Can I call you back in 10 minutes?
You cannot wear that to school.
You can't.
How many times, no!
Right.
Shoes.
Shoes...
Right.
There you go.
Now put this on.
Go, quick.
We should get to the crem.
Frankly, I think it's completely sick what you're doing.
- Excuse me?
- You don't explain yourself.
- What's to explain?
- That outburst.
you know what, you can air your opinions about me, but when I say something it's an outburst
- I wasn't having a go at you.
- Well it felt pretty personal from this end.
You know, you don't know anything about Sean.
You've got no right to judge me for seeing him.
- Yeah, well I know he's got a wife.
- You can't stop yourself, can you?
Is this some sort of ex-mental patient thing getting all moralistic the way prisoners get religion?
No, I just think you're better than that.
Wow.
That was condescending.
Or was it supposed to be a compliment?
Yes, why would you care what kind of grief you cause, eh?
That's your family, through and through isn't it?
Never explain, never apologize.
What is that supposed to mean?
I just found out my mom died here.
Maybe that's got something to do with it.
- Morning, monkey.
How are you doing?
- Good.
We had our moments this morning.
Are we friends again?
- See you later.
- Ooh, bag.
School bag.
- See you.
- Okay, we got everything?
Sandwiches?
Good.
- I've got a new friend.
- Yeah?
She's *** *** packed lunch.
She's called Allison and she wants me to play with her.
You are very lucky, aren't you?
She gave me a present.
- This is weird.
- Weird is how she died.
- Is Grace here?
Can you see her?
- That's not how it happens.
What if nobody will talk.
They will. *** ***
That's all she wanted to do is talk about those missing girls.
This is going to be useful.
- What are you doing here?
- I'll give you two guesses.
- Were you hanging around waiting for her to go?
- Ah, the things I do to get you on your own.
- Kate.
- Sean.
We were in bed and I lost control.
How flattering is that?
Now here I am coming to stroke your ego all the same.
I had my way, but now it's your turn.
We'll do whatever you want.
Get lost, Kate!
In the blessed rest of everlasting peace and in the glorious company of the saints in light.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Uncle Warren, so what are you doing here?
Fancied a day out?
Don't be flippant, Jed.
Old dear had no one else.
- That's very thoughtful.
- How about you two?
Like you say, she had no one else.
You might want to say hello, Jed.
Took care of your mom.
Of course it was just me back then.
You don't have to thank me.
We've always looked after our own.
- What's he doing here?
- Got a pretty good idea.
I think he killed her.
I think he wanted her out of the way.
What?
So, what do we ...
Do we say something to ...?
You think she's going to listen to me?
Okay.
We're going to talk to the police then.
And tell them what?
I've got a feeling about it?
"Divers Search for Missing Girl."
"Death threats:
Laura hides out"
"Scandal Rocks Asylum" What the hell do you think you're doing?
***** ***** words, didn't we?
Yes, and we did a story.
Well that is above and beyond.
That's great.
Thank you.
I didn't do it.
You did it all by yourself, didn't you?
Right, I think it might be time for bed.
Good night.
I'll be in, in a sec, sweetheart okay?
- Say "Night night".
- Night night.
- Night.
Right, I'm going to go and make dinner for my flat mate.
I promised to make something extra special.
- Right.
Okay.
- What?
No... it's um...
I was just going to ask if you fancied eating with me.
It's not a problem.
I mean, I'd hate you to get in trouble with your family.
I pretty much am all the time anyway so, sure why not?
Cool.
- Wine ok?
- Yeah, great.
Ella...
Come and see.
Be my friend.
- Ella.
What's the matter?
- Nothing.
What are you doing?
Go to bed.
You'll be tired for school.
- Have you been writing on the wall?
- No.
Ella, don't pick things up when you don't know where they're from.
Sorry.
I don't like it anyway.
Night night.
Come and play.
****** to say about me.
I'm a widower.
My wife ran off with the bathroom fitter.
- The bathroom fitter?
- Mmm hmm.
- So what's the truth?
- Ah, the truth...
Well, I was with her mom for three months.
I'm just sad it wasn't going anywhere.
And then Susan found out that she was pregnant.
And she went through with it?
Well...
She liked the idea of being a mom.
Until she was one.
It's not like people think.
Not everyone can hack it.
That's a bit tough on you.
Her mom likes her freedom.
Don't you miss your freedom?
Just a bit.
Yeah.
Can we swap lives, please?
No.
You would get the worse deal.
Trust me.
I don't believe that for a second.
I've landed on my feet with you.
I know that.
- You really get her, don't you?
- She's a lovely girl.
Ella.
Come and see.
Over here.
Nearly.
Warmer.
Warmer.
Bad man
Ella.
What's wrong?
Come and see.
Ella.
Why would you do this?
Why would you draw such a thing?
I didn't.
Alice did.
Ella.
Listen to me.
You are not allowed to draw on walls.
I didn't.
Alice did.
Alice, she's not allowed to draw on walls either, okay?
Please, don't tell daddy.
- Ella, uh...
- But he'll tell me off.
Alice didn't do it on purpose.
A bad man made her do it.
A bad man?
Okay.
Come here.
It's just such a violent image.
I don't know how a six year old could do that.
And what does she say?
She blames her imaginary friend, Alice.
She said a bad man made her do it.
She said he'd been doing bad things.
- Well, who is he?
- I don't know.
What if someone is hurting her?
Abusing her or something.
Like who?
Her dad?
- How well do you know him?
- A bit better than I did yesterday.
- What?
- Nothing.
So did you ask her what was going on?
She just made up a story.
Blamed her imaginary friend.
Right.
- Do you see what I mean?
- Yeah.
- I'll be about 20 minutes.
- Okay.
I'll make us a cuppa.
Mommy!
Help me!
Alice?
Alice?
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Yeah?
- Something making you unhappy?
No.
People like to own things.
Human nature.
They'll start buying soon.
In the meantime, the tenants will keep us ticking over.
We'll survive.
I want to show you something.
Come on.
I can't ***, I'm afraid.
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
You're turning down work?
There's got to be something in Grace's room that links her to Warren.
He might have a feeling.
I wasn't kidding, you know, when I said it was just a feeling.
I'll go to Grace's room to do some research.
- Dad, what the hell is it?
- I found it on the top floor.
Your granddad managed to hide it from the scavengers that descended on the place.
Is that granddad operating?
Yes.
This is what we used to do.
It's pioneering work.
Medical journals never gave him his due.
This is how we kept a record.
Well I hope he knew what he was doing.
It's never about what you know, it's about what you don't know.
Why are you showing me this?
I've seen you wondering sometimes.
What on earth we're doing it for.
So much to be proud of, Kate.
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.
- Maria, isn't it?
- Yeah, sorry.
I'm useless with names.
It's Kate.
I'm just checking.
the power went off in some of the the apartments last night.
- Oh, no.
We've been fine.
- Perfect.
Wow the place looks great!
Cheeky question, but can I steal some ideas?
- Yeah, of course.
- Great!
My husband, Sean, no point telling him, he just doesn't see things like this.
- Try having three flatmates.
I'm loving these textures together.
- I mean, you've really thought about this.
- Well, it is my job.
- How do you mean?
- Interior design.
That's what I do.
Oh, really?
We're about to renovate another level.
I could do with a designer's opinion.
I mean, you don't have to make your mind up right away.
No, no, it's okay.
Yeah, I'd love to have a look.
- Fantastic.
- Coffee?
Love one.
- Alright if I take some pictures?
- Oh, help yourself.
This is gorgeous.
- Could I take a look in the...
- Oh, go on, go in.
Thank you.
It's great having someone to bounce ideas off.
Oh, I'd be glad to help.
Oh lovely.
Thank you.
You guys look so happy together.
- You married?
- Oh, god no!
I can't ever imagine being that sure of someone.
- There's no guarantees.
- But isn't that the whole point?
I mean, you might not be in cheating boyfriend hell with the rest of us.
Oh I don't know.
I'm sorry, it's just the types I attract.
I must give off vibes or something.
- anyhow, let's not talk about my car-crash of a love life.
- I don't mind.
God, no!
I don't want to do that to you.
Ryan?
Did any kids live here?
In Victorian times.
I need to know if one died.
Ryan?
Staff lived in.
I guess they must have had kids.
Listen.

Catherine Hawestag last seen June '83
Her sister was an out-patient.
Grace's daughter, Jane Healy, never made it home from a quiz at a pub 3 miles away.
We're talking at least 4 girls.
- How come everyone didn't know about this.
- Have their bodies ever been found?
No.
Well then there's nothing to prove they're dead.
OK.
So who's going to hide and who's going to count?
- I want to count.
- You want to count?
I'm so surprised, Miss Total Genius.
Close your eyes.
Hands.
- Go.
- 1, 2, 3...
- ... 16, 17, 18...
- Follow me.
We've been meaning to start on this floor for ages, just one thousand a day.
Oh, it must totally take over your life.
Yes, this pretty much is my life right now.
- But to be honest, it's quite nice to have a distraction.
- Why is that?
Oh, I don't want to bore you with my personal stuff again.
- It's OK.
- Well, my latest disaster.
It turned out, he'd been cheating on me for months.
and he really messed me up.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I don't know why I don't see the signs.
I should be a bloody expert by now.
- Sorry, I've got to just send...
- No, no, of course.
None of my business, but how did you find out in the end?
Checked his phone, and there it all was.
God, sorry.
Listen to me.
At it again.
Not that I'm bitter.
thanks for last night, you were great, Lv charlotte xxx
Adding image...
Been trying to air the place, but between the pigeon droppings and the water damage it's a losing battle.
There's so much space, isn't there?
I mean so much you can do.
Look out!
I'm so sorry, I don't know how that happened.
Are you OK?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm fine.
Look, is it ok if we do this a different day?
Yeah, of course.
Ella.
Ella, I'm coming.
Ella!
Ella!
Ella.
Follow me.
Ella, Ella, Ella, Ella.
Come and play.
Ella!
Ella!
Follow me.
Ella, you're the winner.
Just tell me where you are!
Ella!
Ella, please!
Ella!
Ella!
Nearly there.
Ella!
I've been all around.
Shouting her name.
She's not there.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You go back to the flat.
I'll check the building.
Come and see.
Ella!
- Come and see.
- Stop it!
No!
- We can be friends forever.
- I don't want to.
No!
It's ok.
Don't worry.
Oh, thank goodness.
Come here.
Where on earth did you get to?
You must never run off like that again, ok?
You gave me a heart attack, Ella!
- Easy, will you?
- Where was she?
Upstairs.
Keep an eye on her.
Honey, what is it?
What were you doing upstairs?
I'm sorry.
Maria, don't do this!
This is crazy!
Maria!
I saw your text.
I have no idea who sent it!
Hi.
Hey, Ells Bells.
You looking after Molly?
- How was it?
- It was fine.
Cool.
- Is everything all right with her at the moment?
- What like you and me?
No, no she...
She keeps talking about this invisible friend.
It's kids imagination.
No, she keeps talking about a man...
the man that keeps hurting her friend, being cruel to her.
- How?
- Well...
I get the feeling she doesn't really want to say, or she doesn't know how to describe it.
Where is she getting this from?
And so I'm asking him in case...
What?
Abuse?
No, no I'm not saying that, but she's such a chatty little thing normally.
She spends time only here at our house... and **** mom.
Rob, who are you calling?
Her mom.
Look maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe it's just her imagination.
Hey, Susan, it's me.
No, no, no, she's fine, just...
Have you left her with any of your boyfriends?
Well, I'm gonna tell you what's the question...
The safety of our daughter.
I don't care who are they.
You're not hearing me!
You know what I'm talking about.
Mom's boyfriends.
It's a classic, isn't it?
I'm not been agressive, Susan.
Listen, I'm not accusing you...
Alice Brackley, Sarah's mother, housekeeper.
They lived in the staff quarters.
Do you think it's Alice *** **** Molly ****?
Is this all about him?
No.

She is buried in church's graveyard.
Well, how many were they?
A few, but anyone in the period you are looking for.
And now she's after Ella.
She wants to take Ella with her.
Ella.
Come to play.
Come and see.
Ella.
Follow me.
Here.
I'm sorry.
Ella, sorry.
Please, forgive me.
I'm so sorry.
- Are we ok?
- Why wouldn't be, Jed?
- Hey!
Any chance I can borrow a £10?
- Yep.
Here you go.
Oh, it's just until Rob pays the last of what he owes me.
I'm going to get like a little cool thing for Ella.
Nice.
Don't work too hard.
- I didn't even go in today.
- So why is this?
Is anything freaking you?
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.
- Writing or something else?
- No, it's...
- Is she with you?
- No, why?
I can't find her.
She's gone.
I'm comming with you.
Ella!
Ella!
Ella.
This is for you.
Hello, Ella!
Don't move, right?
I'm comming down.
Stay there!
You're ok.
Can you move, yeah?
Right.
Come here!
You are ok.
You are ok.
Ok, let's got to put you down for a second.
Two seconds.
Right?
Stay there, yeah?
Jesus Christ!
Zoey!
Here we go.
- Ok.
Thank you so much for looking.
- No problem.
Ella!
Oh my God, are you ok?
Where was she?
Ella.
You can't go off like that!
She felt through the floor.
She's fine.
Something broke the fall.
- You are?
- I'm Jed.
Haven't you just come back from a looney bin?
- Rob, he found her.
- And it's funny, yeah?
- I'm sorry?
- Well, the whole building is searching and you just happen to know where she is?
- I heard Ella crying!
- ******** the police.
Rob!
She was your responsability.
You were supposed to look after her.
Just keep away from my daughter, okay?
- You're scaring her.
- And that goes for you as well!
Jed.
Sorry, I've got to go.
- Jed, Jed!
Where are you going?
- Alice!
Alice!
- Jed.
- There's a body.
- I think it might be Zoey.
- What?
Upstairs.
The door is busted.
Wait me there!
Alice!
Your friends are here.
- Jed, she's here!
- Call the police.
- There's nothing in there.
- Her body was here.
Someone must have moved her, right?
She was here!
Are you sure what you saw was real?
Next Time.
[Transcribed by err0001, ilse for addic7ed]
Your wife is ill.
In three months, if your plan fails she will be dead.
But this is not something you will hear about because I would have killed you first.
This... amnesia.
You think I'm faking it, sir?
Are you?
I know who shot you.
Who is this?
'My name's Peter Glickman.'
Follow the drugs, Detective Inspector, and then we'll meet.
I was Peter Glickman's... girlfriend.
I am his girlfriend.
I just want to know what's happened.
That's the first code.
Our code.
It means this brick has been here before.
Someone took it out.
You offered to cut Delaney a deal, strip him a rank and give him to me to put back in line.
But that's not how it worked out, is it?
It was 30 kilos in total. 30.
Guess where the last 4 were found?
In the back of the car in which you both got shot.
You may have started out getting Delaney to walk the line, but looks like he pulled you into the shadows.
You think I'm a bad cop.
I think you're a good one.
It comes with the card.
God!
It's daddy.
You have to tell your wife.
I'm in hell.
No, we are in limbo and you need to get us out.
This programme contains some strong language and scenes which some viewers may find disturbing.
You can read my mind.
Not quite.
At least, not yet.
But we can evaluate your reaction to the photos and that gives us an insight into brain function.
Or lack of.
Hmm...
Well, it's interesting.
The scan images above the pictures are from three months ago, beneath the pictures are now.
What's interesting is that most of them have remained consistent.
So your response to your childhood... schooling, etc.
All these have remained the same.
There's been a change in response to your wife.
There's more orange in it now.
Hmm...
Meaning?
We don't know what the change means yet, just that there's been one.
Your response to your colleague who was killed... also remains unchanged.
However, and this is what's particularly interesting, your response to the scene of the killing and where you were shot, that has changed considerably.
If you look at the scan from three months ago, there's hardly any reaction at all.
Because of the injury?
This is what interests us.
Whereas, today's scan... shows distinctly more activity.
You think my memory's coming back?
Starting to, maybe.
Through a glass, darkly.
Ah, yes.
But later...
Yeah.
Later.
It's all right.
Go back to sleep.
Everything's fine.
Laura, there's something I have to tell you.
Don't worry.
Whatever happens, it'll be all right.
Why do you say that?
Why do you always say that?
It will not be all right to lose this baby.
It will not be!
I didn't...
Stop it, Jonah!
Stop always hedging your fucking bets!
When are you going to want something?
!
Want something so much, you can't bear to lose it?
Say it!
Say you want this!
Of course I do.
Good!
Because sometimes wanting something so much that you can't live... you can't even see a future if you lose it... is the only reason you get it!
So, for once, want it!
Like you have never wanted anything else!
It's all right!
It's there!
See!
Want it!
I do.
I do.
Jonah Gabriel.
Peter Glickman.
So where did the drugs lead you?
To me.
So does that mean you've stopped looking?
What else is there to find?
You think this is all about you - good cop, bad cop?
You think that's what this is all about?
You, drugs, dead cops, royal pardons, Harvey Wratten...
It's not about you, it's not about any of you.
You're all just threads, little tiny threads.
But if you want to find the rope, there's only one line for you to follow.
The money.
What money?
Talk to Commissioner Penney.
Ask him about...
Counterpoint.
What's Counterpoint?
Say you're looking for answers and you won't stop till you've found them.
He won't give you any, but then he'll get in contact with someone who can.
Who?
Gatehouse.
How do I find him?
Oh, you won't need to.
Once he knows you're looking, he'll find you.
So... tell me your secret.
I don't have one.
Everyone has a secret.
Everyone.
And that's what he will find.
And that's where he will find you... at your most vulnerable.
I don't... have a secret.
You want to know who you are, Gabriel?
You want to know what side of the line you really stand?
Then tell me your secret, because once he finds it, I'm the only one who can save you.
Good boy.
I'm not doing it.
You have to trust me on this.
A new hotel every night?
!
It's just for a short time.
What's a short time?
It's not long!
Shhh!
Is that what she is doing?
No.
Why not?
Because she's your wife, because she's pregnant?
Because she's not the one in danger.
And we are?
!
You may be, yes.
If you stay here.
Why?
Because if this man comes looking for me, he may well come here.
I'll just tell him where to go!
Why would he come here?
Because...
Because... we are your weakness.
Yes.
Is he trying to blackmail you?
No.
Threaten us?
Call her!
Tell her!
Tell everyone!
I will.
Not will!
Do it now!
Then he'll have nothing because everything will be out in the open.
That won't work.
It'll work for me!
It'll work for him!
It's what I've been asking you for a long time!
It looks like this guy's doing me a favour!
It will make it worse.
Worse for who?
For you?
For your wife?
!
Yes!
For Laura, for you, for me, for Conrad, for everyone!
Why?
Because if this man thinks my secret is here, this is where he'll come.
So you're using us as bait?
!
No, because you won't be here!
You'll be safe!
And all he'll find...
All he'll find... is me.
Who is this man?
I don't know.
That's what I'm going to find out.
That's five million.
I'll need 48 hours to get you the rest.
For that kind of a turnover, it's only polite to wait.
You're in the game now.
Better than being on it.
You want the next two shipments in one go?
400 kilos at 15 grand a kilo.
Then I need three million up front.
It's in the bag... along with the four I already owe you.
Seven.
Seven million.
Plus three on delivery, gives you your ten, as I promised.
400 kilos, that's a heavy weight.
Flowers won't cover it.
I don't expect them to.
Then what do you expect?
A change of plan.
Hmmm.
So what have you got?
400 kilograms, brown, at least 70%, import.
When?
Within three weeks.
Who?
Joseph Bede.
How much do you want?
250,000.
What?
With a street value of 20-odd million, I reckon your people will wear it.
Why are you doing this?
Ours is a dog-eat-dog world... and this dog's getting too tired to run.
You didn't come.
It was good... but it would have been better with you.
I'm sorry.
You ought to tell me.
About what?
Whatever it is you want to say.
Tell me.
I wish I could, but I can't.
Is there something you know?
About Peter?
Yes.
No.
I meant about you and me.
I wish...
But I can't.
Because of your wife.
Because of everything.
It would be a shame to lose you completely.
I mean, we've only just met.
Then next time I'll come.
Next time it's Bach.
I like Bach.
Yes, I think I saw that about you.
Then Bach it shall be.
As friends.
As friends.
Where's the harm in that?
No harm... at all.
Jonah.
Commander.
Not any more.
Just plain mister.
And why was that, exactly?
You still lost your memory, Detective Inspector?
I'm yet to get the full picture, if that's what you mean, sir.
How convenient.
It hasn't been.
But I'm starting to pull some threads together.
Well, be careful they don't form into a noose.
For whose neck?
You're not the first, you know.
To do what?
Stand there.
Who else is there?
Was.
That journalist.
McGovern.
Asking questions.
About you?
About you, actually.
Look what happened to him.
I don't ride bikes.
No.
It's too dangerous.
It's not worth the risk.
But what is?
The truth.
Because you're a policeman?
It's who I am.
You don't know who you are.
I think I might be about to find out.
Be careful what you wish for.
Maybe it's what you don't know that's keeping you alive.
Counterpoint.
What's Counterpoint?
It's music, isn't it?
It's...
It's by Bach.
Gatehouse.
Who's Gatehouse?
And what about the money?
Safe journey, Detective Inspector.
See you when I get there, Mr Penney.
Well, that's great men for you.
In my world, Commander, when everyone knows who you are, you haven't done your fucking job.
So?
Gabriel.
Well, he wasn't faking it.
And if he doesn't know, he hasn't told anyone else.
Except now he wants to find out for himself.
Well, if you're walking around with a bullet in your head, it's all just a matter of time.
Sir Richard...
I know, I know.
Very moving.
How?
He has an ex-mistress and a love child he wants to keep secret.
They argue... often.
Neighbours have heard them.
So when your people finally break in, because she's missed an appointment or whatever, and find two bodies... hers will be murdered, and his will have turned the gun on himself - silenced, of course... and, incidentally, stolen from his department a few days previously.
But, when asked, it will be the arguments the neighbours remember and not the unnoticed visit from a stranger the night before.
And the child?
Hmmm.
Lucky to be alive.
Like the rest of us, don't you think?
When it's your time...
It's your time.
No matter where you look.
I might have a shadow on a line.
Are you interested?
Whose?
Where Harvey Wratten left off.
How much for it?
Quarter of a million.
400 kilos Turkish Brown, 70% pure.
When?
I need a quick decision.
I'll need a name.
Without a target there's nothing to aim at.
Bede.
Joseph Bede.
Never heard of him.
Isn't that the point?
Mama...
Come on, darling, we're going.
What are you doing here?
!
What are YOU doing here?
!
This is my home!
You have to go.
Alison!
You have to go!
Oh, go on!
Just you try it.
Don't go in there.
Alison!
Too late.
Here we are.
Here we are, my darling.
Safe and sound.
Yes, now it's time to go to sleep.
Mummy's going to go out and I'll come back and give you a kiss, OK?
Shhh...
Shhh...
He's here?
Go in the kitchen.
Don't open the door!
It's too late.
Don't call anyone.
I'm not...
Go in the kitchen.
Don't come out.
Jonah Gabriel.
Who are you?
We need to talk.
What about?
May I come in?
No.
I have something very important to tell you.
Then say it here.
I can't do that.
Why not?
It's a secret.
Then whisper.
You want to protect your family.
I understand.
Good.
But then, you see, if I'd wanted to kill them,
I could have done it at the hotel.
And if I'd needed to kill you...
I could have done it long before now.
You...
Where are they?
Why do you need to know?
It would be best if they didn't see me.
He's in his room, she's in the kitchen.
Tell her to stay there.
I have.
When?
Before I came to the door.
Why?
It's my job.
Do you call it a living room or a lounge?
Neither.
Then let's go there.
Come in.
Sit down.
That's your choice.
This is mine.
Will she come in?
No.
So you want to know why I shot you.
I want to know why I was there.
Because you're afraid you'd come to sell me drugs like Delaney had before.
That somehow he'd... corrupted you.
Had he?
You really don't know?
But what do you think?
I don't.
Because you can't remember?
That's what your bullet did to me.
But people just know.
Don't they?
Instinctively.
Whether they're good or bad.
Why don't you?
Is it here?
Is it her?
Is it your son?
Is it the lies you tell your wife?
What is it that makes you so unsure?
Because whatever it is, it's not just the bullet in your head that makes you need to ask.
May I?
What?
I have something to give you.
What?
It's what you want to know.
It's in my breast pocket.
May I?
It's all right.
Finger and thumb.
Finger and thumb.
It's Delaney's notebook, the one I took from him after he'd been shot.
It's all written down.
Like what?
You weren't selling drugs.
The line you walked was straight.
You even got Delaney to walk it with you, right to its very end.
It's all right.
You were a good cop.
But whether you're a good person...
Well, that's not for me to say.
But here.
Find out for yourself.
No, I don't think I'll be doing that.
No?
Why not?
Because you're wearing gloves.
No!
My baby!
No!
Hello?
Petra?
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right, it's all right.
Shhh...
Shhhh, it's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It'll be all right.
It'll be all right.
It'll be all right.
Thank you for coming.
I didn't think I should.
I wanted you to.
I needed you to.
I have to tell you something.
These past three years I have been living a lie.
And there came a point I decided that I would do anything... anything to make it stop.
Two weeks ago I told Jonah that if he didn't tell you about Connie then I would.
This week.
Maybe even today, who knows?
And if I had done that...
I would have ruined your life.
But I would have done it willingly.
Willingly, you know... because that's how we feel about truth, isn't it?
It has to be known, no matter what.
Even if it means wrecking an innocent woman's life... or opening the door to a man he should never have let in.
But standing here today,
I can tell you
I would rather live with an eternity of lies than a second without my son.
You must tell your husband to do the same, because if he doesn't,
I'm very afraid the next person to be standing here will be you.
Detective, this way.
Detective, look this way a moment?
Detective Inspector.
Just one more.
This way.
How much do they know?
They certainly smell a story.
A corrupt police officer selling drugs to criminals.
They don't know that.
Not yet.
What other choice have I got?
That's going to make things very difficult for me.
You should have thought of that before you insisted on bringing him back in.
I'll need time... to tidy up.
Be sure to take your ashtray with you when you go.
What?
Richard, you've no-one to blame...
but yourself.
Inspector.
This way.
We are ready to deliver.
My end buyer needs notice.
I can give you up to one week.
I'll take that.
Three million.
You'll have it.
How's your wife?
Don't speak about my wife!
It was you who put her in the deal.
What did he mean by that?
Jesus, Joseph!
What have you done?
Tell the boy we need that money.
Yeah, that's fine.
Fine?
Is that like OK?
Because it's got to be more than that.
It's got to be definite.
Don't worry, I'll get you the money.
We're not talking about a visit to the sweet shop.
You going to watch me make the call?
You know what?
When both the cops AND the criminals begin to look like kids, it really is time to leave the game.
Well, that's a call only you can make, Granddad.
Just get that money.
Shit!
Apparently he's got the heartbeat of a 20-year-old.
That's Benecol for you.
Can I have a word?
So what did he have to tell you that was so important you let him in?
You were a good cop?
Hmmm.
At least I'm not alone.
Doesn't make it true.
Judge yourself by your actions, Jonah.
If you weren't, you'd have given up long before now.
That's why Khokar wants to have you thrown to the wolves.
And if I let the press rip you to bits, pretty soon they're going to start licking their chops at me.
Then maybe you and your boss should think that through more carefully.
And maybe HE already has.
You know how to survive?
It's not just the first blow you've got to look out for, it's knowing where the next one will come.
So if Khokar's happy enough to have my arse stripped out, whatever he's got to hide must look like a whole fucking abattoir.
And that's the stench he obviously thinks you've caught a whiff of.
You talked to the wrong guy, Jonah.
So if there's anything you know, now's the time to tell me, because then we can beat this together.
I met with Peter Glickman.
Ah.
When?
Before he was killed, sir.
What did he tell you?
Where did you get it from?
DS Delaney.
When?
Just before he died, must've been.
Is it your share?
What of?
A drug's deal.
I think it was his share.
Of the drugs that got him busted.
So why's it in OUR wardrobe?
Because I wanted to know why...
Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it?
What have you done, Jonah?
No, Laura, it's them.
What have they done?
Who?
Look.
What is it?
It's a code.
Whose?
Ours.
I've been looking in the wrong direction.
It's not the drugs, it's the money - the money used to buy them!
Jonah, I...
It's a police code, Laura.
What?
This money... is from our side.
So give it back.
But that's not how it got here.
If Delaney got this from selling drugs, then who was buying?
I don't know...
The police, Laura.
He was selling it to us.
So whose side are we on?
Can I have a private word?
I've been offered a shadow on a line.
Whose line?
A guy called Joseph Bede.
Never heard of him.
Isn't that the point?
What's he looking to bring in?
400 kilos of heroin, 70% pure.
Who's the shadow?
How much does he want?
A quarter of a million.
Baked beans?
Pounds.
Hang on, there's a phrase people use for this.
It's funny, it's, em...
"Fuck you!" Yeah, that's it.
Fuck you!
Yes, that's one of our codes.
When?
May the 5th last year.
How much was marked?
I can't tell you that.
What can you tell me?
Whatever's not classified.
Is this operation still ongoing?
We were never asked to locate the money.
Why not?
It was never initiated.
What does that mean?
Well, whoever had it smudged never asked us to trace them.
And who was that?
You lost a son.
Yes, I did.
That's terrible.
You log every access request?
Yes.
Can you tell me the last person to ask to access that file?
Well, you were...
- and a...
- Detective Sergeant Delaney.
See?
They're geeks.
The reason no-one's here is cos they can talk to each other without even speaking.
I know why I got shot.
Harvey Wratten needed to get himself out of jail.
To do that, he got Gatehouse to buy up a huge amount of drugs and pass them on to Customs.
Delaney found out and wanted to get in on the act, so he stole 30 kilos of heroin from a leaky property room and sold them on to Gatehouse and when Customs got them, they gave them back to you.
How'd you know it was Delaney?
Silly boy tried to do it again.
One should always know when to quit.
So you decided to throw a blanket over it, and that's where the story should have ended, and it would have if Delaney hadn't decided to take a second chance to heart, because that's when he showed me this.
The cash he got for the drugs was marked.
Gatehouse had been buying it all with police money.
So if Gatehouse was working for Harvey Wratten, then Harvey Wratten was working for us.
And that's why I didn't log the operation the night we went out.
I didn't want anyone from our side to know we were looking, but, as it turned out...
Someone already did.
And that's what got me shot.
Whoever it was had the money marked.
And his name will be on that file.
You pull the cord on that and by the time you get to see it, it won't even exist.
No, your judgement was right in the first place.
The key to this... is Gatehouse.
Don't worry.
It'll be over in a heartbeat.
Beep...
Beep...
Beep...
Beep!

I do.
Jonah Gabriel?
Peter Glickman.
So, where did the drugs lead you?
To me.
So, does that mean you've stopped looking?

Good cop, bad cop?

Oh, you won't need to.
Once he knows you're looking, he'll find you.
So, tell me your secret.
I don't have one.
Everyone has a secret.
Everyone.
And that's what he will find.
And that's where he will find you.
At your most vulnerable.
I don't... have a secret.
You want to know who you are, Gabriel?
You want to know what side of the line you really stand?
Then tell me your secret.
Because once he finds it,
I'm the only one who can save you.
(BOY CHATTERING)
Good boy.
Good boy.
I'm not doing it.
You have to trust me on this.

-What's a short time?
-(SHOUTING) It's not long!
-Shh.
(BOY CHATTERING)
-Is that what she's doing?
-No.
Why not?
Because she's your wife?
-Because she's pregnant?
-Because she's not the one in danger.
Oh.
And we are?
You may be.
Yes, if you stay here.
Why?
Because if this man comes looking for me, he may well come here.
Then I'lljust tell him where to go.
(SCOFFING)
Why would he come here?
Because...
Because we are your weakness.
Yes.
Is he trying to blackmail you?
No.
Threaten us?
Call her.
Tell her.
Tell everyone!
-I will.
-Not "will".
Do it now!
Then he'll have nothing, because everything will be out in the open.
-That won't work.
-But it'll work for me.
It'll work for him!
It's what I've been asking you for a long time.
(LAUGHS) God!
It looks like this guy's doing me a favour.
It will make it worse.
Worse for who?
For you?
For your wife?
Yes!
For Laura, for you, for me, for Con, for everyone!
Why?
Because if this man thinks my secret is here, this is where he'll come.
So, you're using us as bait?
No!
Because you won't be here!
You'll be safe!
And all he'll find...
All he'll find is me.
Who is this man?
I don't know.
That's what I'm going to find out.
That's five million.
I'll need 48 hours to get you the rest.
With that kind of turnover, it's only polite to wait.
You're in the game now.
Better than being on it.
(CURRENCY COUNTER WHIRRING)
You want the next two shipments in one go?
Four hundred kilos at 15 grand a kilo.
Then I need three million up front.
It's in the bag, along with the four I already owe you.
Seven.
Seven million.
Plus three on delivery.
Gives you your 10, as I promised.
Four hundred kilos, that's a heavy weight.
-Flowers won't cover it.
-I don't expect them to.
Then what do you expect?
A change of plan.
Hmm.
FOLEY:
So, what have you got?
MALE VOICE: 400 kilogram, brown.
At least 70%.
Import.
-When?
-Within three weeks.
-Who?
-Joseph Bede.
How much do you want?
-Two hundred and fifty thousand.
-What?
With a street value of 20-odd million, I reckon your people are wary.
Why are you doing this?
Ours is a dog-eat-dog world.
And this dog's getting too tired to run.
You didn't come.
It was good.
Would have been better with you.
I'm sorry.
You ought to tell me.
About what?
Whatever it is you want to say.
(KICKING DESK)
Tell me.
I wish I could but I can't.
Is it something you know?
-About Peter?
-Yes.
No.
I meant about you and me, I wish...
But I can't.
-Because of your wife?
-Because of everything.
(SIGHS)
Well, it'd be a shame to lose you completely.
I mean, we've only just met.
Then next time I'll come.
-Next time it's Bach.
-I like Bach.
Yes, I think I thought that about you.
(LAUGHS)
(SIGHS)
Then Bach it shall be.
As friends.
Where's the harm in that?
No harm.
At all.
-Jonah.
-Commander.
Not any more.
Just plain Mister.
And why was that, exactly?
Have you still lost your memory, Detective Inspector?
I'm yet to get the full picture, if that's what you mean, sir.
Oh, how convenient.
Hasn't been.
But I'm starting to pull some threads together.
Well, be careful they don't form into a noose.
For whose neck?
You're not the first, you know.
To do what?
Stand there.
-Who else is there?
-Was.
That journalist.
-McGovern.
-Asking questions.
-About you?
-About you, actually.
Look what happened to him.
I don't ride bikes.
No.
It's too dangerous.
It's not worth the risk.
-What is?
-The truth.
Because you're a policeman?
It's who I am.
You don't know who you are.
I think I might be about to find out.
Be careful what you wish for.
Maybe it's what you don't know that's keeping you alive.
Counterpoint.
What's Counterpoint?
It's music, isn't it?
It's by Bach.
Gatehouse.
Who's Gatehouse?
And what about the money?
Safe journey, Detective Inspector.
I'll see you when I get there, Mr Penney.
(ORGAN PLAYING TOCCA TA AND FUGUE IN D MINOR)
An absolute fucking melting pot.
Well, that's great men for you.
In my world, Commander, when everyone knows who you are, you haven't done your fucking job.
-So.
-Gabriel.
Well, he wasn't faking it.
And if he doesn't know, he hasn't told anyone else.
Except now he wants to find out for himself.
Well, if you're walking around with a bullet in your head, it's alljust a matter of time.
-Sir Richard...
-I know.
I know.
Very moving.
How?
He has an ex-mistress and a love child he wants to keep secret.
They argue often.
Neighbours have heard them.
So, when your people finally break in because she's missed an appointment or whatever and find two bodies,
hers will be murdered and his will have turned the gun on himself.
Silenced, of course, and incidentally, stolen from his department a few days previously.
But when asked, it will be the arguments the neighbours remember and not the unnoticed visit from a stranger the night before.
And the child?
Mmm.
Lucky to be alive.
Like the rest of us.
Don't you think?
FOLEY:
When it's your time...
-It's your time.
-No matter where you look.
I might have a shadow on a line.
Are you interested?
Whose?
Where Harvey Wratten left off.
-How much for it?
-Quarter of a million.
(CLICKING TONGUE)
Four hundred kilos, Turkish brown, 70% pure.
-When?
-I'll need a quick decision.
I'll need a name.
Without a target, there's nothing to aim at.
-Bede.
Joseph Bede.
-Never heard of him.
Isn't that the point?
(WHISTLING TUNE)
Mama.
Come on, darling.
We're going.
(SIREN WAILING)
(BOY MURMURING)
(THUD)
(DOOR OPENS)
(DOOR CLOSES)
(BOY MUMBLING)
(GASPS)
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
This is my home!
You have to go.
Alison, you have to go.
Go on.
Just you try it.
Don't go in there.
Alison!
Too late.
Here we are.
Here we are, my darling.
Hmm?
Safe and sound.
Yes.
No, it's time to go to sleep.
Mummy's going to go out and I'll come back and give you a kiss, okay?
Shh.
(CAT MEOWING)
(ALISON APPROACHING)
Shh!
-It's him.
-(WHISPERS) Go in the kitchen.
-Don't open the door.
-It's too late.
Don't call anyone.
-I'm not...
-Go in the kitchen.
Don't come out.
(LEAVES RUSTLING)
Jonah Gabriel.
Who are you?
We need to talk.
What about?
-May I come in?
-No.
I have something very important to tell you.
-Then say it here.
-I can't do that.
-Why not?
-It's a secret.
Then whisper.
You want to protect your family.
I understand.
Good.
But then, you see, if I'd wanted to kill them
I could have done it at the hotel.
And if I'd needed to kill you,
I could have done it long before now.
(SOFTLY) You...
(GUNSHOTS REVERBERATING)
(GUNSHOT ECHOES)
Where are they?
Why do you need to know?
It would be best if they didn't see me.
He's in his room, she's in the kitchen.
Tell her to stay there.
I have.
When?
Before I came to the door.
Why?
It's my job.
Do you call it a living room or lounge?
Neither.
Then let's go there.
Come in.
Sit down.
That's your choice.
This is mine.
Will she come in?
No.
So, you want to know why I shot you.
I want to know why I was there.
Because you're afraid you'd come to sell me drugs, like Delaney had before?
That somehow he'd...corrupted you?
Had he?
You really don't know?
But what do you think?
I don't.
Because you can't remember?
That's what your bullet did to me.
But people just know.
Don't they?
Instinctively.
Whether they're good or bad.
Why don't you?
Is it you?
Is it her?
Is it your son?
Is it the lies you tell your wife?
What is it that makes you so unsure?
Because whatever it is, it's not just the bullet in your head that makes you need to ask.
May I?
What?
I have something to give you.
What?
It's what you want to know.
It's in my breast pocket.
May I?
It's all right.
Finger and thumb.
Finger and thumb.
It's Delaney's notebook, the one I took from him after he'd been shot.
It's all written down.
Like what?
You weren't selling drugs.
The line you walked was straight.
You even got Delaney to walk it with you.
Right to its very end.
It's all right.
You were a good cop.
But whether you're a good person... well, that's not for me to say.
But here.
Find out for yourself.
No, I don't think I'll be doing that.
No?
Why not?
Because you're wearing gloves.
(SCREAMS)
-No!
-Give him to me!
My baby!
Give him to me!
-No!
-My baby!
(BOTH WAILING)
Give me my baby!
Give him!
Give him!
(CONTINUES SCREAMING)
(MOBILE RINGING)
Hello?
(CAR DOOR SHUTS)
Petra.
-(SOBBING)
-Oh, it's all right.
Oh, it's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Shh.
Shh, it's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It'll be all right.
-(GRUNTS)
-It'll be all right.
It'll be all right.
Thank you for coming.
I didn't think I should.
I wanted you to.
I needed you to.
I have to tell you something.
These past three years, I have been living a lie.
And there came a point I decided that I would do anything, anything to make it stop.
Two weeks ago I told Jonah that if he didn't tell you about Connie, then I would.
This week?
Maybe even today, who knows?
And if I had done that,
I would have ruined your life.
But I would have done it willingly.
Willingly, you know?
Because that's how we feel about truth, isn't it?
It has to be known, no matter what.
Even if it means wrecking an innocent woman's life.
Or opening the door to a man you should never have let in.
But standing here today,
I can tell you,
I would rather live with an eternity of lies than a second without my son.
You must tell your husband to do the same.
Because if he doesn't,
I'm very afraid the next person to be standing here will be you.
MAN:
This way.
Detective!
If you'd just look this way, Detective Inspector!
Just one more.
This way.
(CAMERAS SNAPPING)
How much do they know?
Well they certainly smell a story.
A corrupt police officer selling drugs to criminals.
-They don't know that.
-Not yet.
What other choice have I got?
That's going to make things very difficult for me.
You should've thought of that before you insisted on bringing him back in.
I'll need time...to tidy up.
Be sure to take your ashtray with you when you go.
What?
Richard, you've no one to blame but yourself.
-(CAMERAS SNAPPING)
-Detective Inspector, this way.
We are ready to deliver.
My end buyer needs notice.
I can give you up to one week.
-I'll take that.
-Three million?
You'll have it.
How's your wife?
Don't speak about my wife!
It was you who put her in the deal.
What did he mean by that?
Jesus, Joseph, what have you done?
Tell the boy we need that money.
Yeah, that's fine.
Fine?
What, is that like, okay?
'Cause it's got to be more than that, it's got to be definite.
Don't worry, I'll get you the money.
We're not talking about a visit to the sweet shop now.
Want to watch me make the call?
You know what?
When both the cops and the criminals begin to look like kids, it really is time to leave the game.
Well, that's a call only you can make, Granddad.
Just get that money.
Shit.
Apparently he's got the heartbeat of a 20-year-old.
That's Benecol for you.
Can I have a word?
So, what did he have to tell you that was so important you let him in?
You were a good cop?
At least I'm not alone.
Doesn't make it true.
Judge yourself by your actions, Jonah.
If you weren't, you'd have given up long before now.
That's why Khokar wants to have you thrown to the wolves.
And if I let the press rip you to bits, pretty soon they're going to start licking their chops at me.
Well, then maybe you and your boss should think that through
-a little more carefully.
-And maybe he already has.
I have to survive.
It's not just the first blow you got to look out for, it's knowing when the next one will come.
So, if Khokar's happy enough to have my arse stripped out, whatever he's got to hide must look like a whole fucking abattoir.
And that's a stench he obviously thinks you've caught a whiff of.
You talked to the wrong guy, Jonah.
So if there's anything you know, now is the time to tell me.
Because then we can beat this together.
I met with Peter Glickman.
Oh.
When?
Before he was killed, sir.
And what did he tell you?
Where did you get it from?
DS Delaney.
When?
Just before he died, must've been.
Is it your share?
What of?
A drugs deal.
I think it was his share of the drugs that got him busted.
So why is it in our wardrobe?
Because I wanted to know why.
Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it?
What have you done, Jonah?
(SIGHS) No, Laura.
It's them.
What have they done?
Who?
Look.
LAURA:
What is it?
(SIGHS) It's a code.
Whose?
Ours.
I've been looking in the wrong direction.
It's not the drugs, it's the money.
-The money used to buy them.
-Jonah, I'm not...
It's a police code, Laura.
-What?
-This money is from our side.
-So give it back.
-But that's not how it got here.
If Delaney got this from selling drugs, then who was buying?
-I don't know.
-The police, Laura.
He was selling it to us.
(SIGHS)
So whose side are we on?
A private word?
Been offered a shadow on a line.
Whose line?
A guy called Joseph Bede.
Never heard of him.
Isn't that the point?
What's he looking to bring in?
Four hundred kilos of heroin, 70% pure.
Who's the shadow?
How much does he want?
Quarter of a million.
Baked beans?
Pounds.
Hold on, there's a phrase people use for this.
It's funny, it's, um...
Fuck you.
Yeah, that's it.
Fuck you.
-Yeah, that's one of our codes.
-When?
-May the 5th, last year.
-How much was marked?
-I can't tell you that.
-What can you tell me?
Whatever's not classified.
Is this operation still ongoing?
We were never asked to locate the money.
Why not?
Well, it was never initiated.
What does that mean?
Well, whoever had it smudged never asked us to trace it.
And who was that?
You lost a son?
Yes, I did.
That's terrible.
-You log every access request?
-Yes.
Can you tell me the last person to ask to access that file?
Well, you were.
-And Detective Sergeant Delaney.
-...
Sergeant Delaney.
See?
They're geeks.
The reason no one's here is because they can all talk to each other without even speaking.
(DOOR OPENS)
I know why I got shot.
Harvey Wratten needed to get himself out of jail.
To do that, he got Gatehouse to buy up a huge amount of drugs and pass them on to Customs.
Delaney found out about it and wanted to get in on the act.
So he stole 30 kilos of heroin from a leaky property room and sold them on to Gatehouse.
And when Customs got them, they gave them back to you.
How did you know it was Delaney?
Silly boy tried to do it again.
One should always know when to quit.
So you decided to throw a blanket over it.
And that's where the story should've ended, and it would have, if Delaney hadn't decided to take his second chance to heart.
Because that's when he showed me this.
The cash he got for the drugs was marked.
Gatehouse had been buying it all with police money.
So if Gatehouse was working for Harvey Wratten, then Harvey Wratten was working for us.
And that's why I didn't log the operation the night we went out.
I didn't want anyone from our side to know we were looking.
But as it turned out...
Someone already did.
And that's what got me shot.
Whoever it was had the money marked?
And his name will be on that file.
You pull a cord on that, by the time you get to see it, it won't even exist.
No.
Your judgement was right in the first place.
The key to this... is Gatehouse.
(BEEPING)
Don't worry.
It'll all be over in a heartbeat.
(BEEPING CONTINUES)
Beep.
(MONITOR BEEPS)
Beep.
(GRUNTS)
(CRACKS)
(MONITOR BEEPS)
(BEEPS)
Hmm.
(MONITOR BLEEPS)
(MONITOR RESUMES REGULAR BEEPING)
(MONITOR CONTINUES BEEPING)
Your wife is ill.
So, in three months time, if your plan fails she will be dead.
But this is not something you will hear about because I would have killed you first.
- This amnesia.
- You think I'm faking it?
Are you?
I know who shot you.
- Who is this?
- My name's Peter Glickman.
Follow the drugs, Detective Inspector, and then we'll meet.
I was Peter Glickman's... girlfriend.
I am his girlfriend.
I just want to know what's happened.
That's the first code.
Our code.
It means this brick has been here before.
- Someone took it out.
- You offered to cut Delaney a deal, strip him a rank and give him to me to put back in line.
But that's not how it worked out, is it?
It was 30 kilos in total. 30.
And guess where the last 4 were found?
In the back of the car in which you both got shot.
You may have started out getting Delaney to walk the line, but looks to me like he ended up pulling you into the shadows.
You think I'm a bad cop.
I think you're a good one.
It comes with the card.
God!
It's daddy.
You have to tell your wife.
- I'm in hell.
- No, we are in limbo and you need to get us out.
This programme contains some strong language and scenes which some viewers may find disturbing.
You can read my mind.
Not quite.
At least, not yet.
But we can evaluate your reaction to the photos and that gives us an insight into brain function.
- Or lack of.
- Hmm...
Well, it's interesting.
The scan images above the pictures are from three months ago, beneath the pictures are now.
What's interesting is that most of them have remained consistent.
So your response to your childhood... schooling, etc.
All these have remained the same.
There's been a change in response to your wife.
There's more orange in it now.
Hmm...
Meaning?
As I say, We don't know what the change means yet, just that there's been one.
Your response to your colleague who was killed... also remains unchanged.
However, and this is what's particularly interesting, your response to the scene of the killing and where you were shot, that has changed considerably.
If you look at the scan from three months ago, there's hardly any reaction at all.
Because of the injury?
This is what interests us.
Whereas, today's scan... shows distinctly more activity.
You think my memory's coming back?
Starting to, maybe.
Through a glass, darkly.
Ah, yes.
- But later...
- Yeah.
Later.
It's all right.
Go back to sleep.
Everything's fine.
Laura, there's something I have to tell you.
Don't worry.
Whatever happens, it'll be all right.
Why do you say that?
Why do you always say that?
It will not be all right to lose this baby.
It will not be!
- I didn't...
- Stop it, Jonah!
Stop always hedging your fucking bets!
When are you going to want something?
!
Want something so much, you can't bear to lose it?
Say it!
Say you want this!
- Of course I do.
- Good!
Because sometimes wanting something so much that you can't live... you can't even see a future if you lose it... is the only reason you get it!
So, for once, want it!
Like you have never wanted anything else!
It's all right!
It's there!
See?
!
Want it!
I do.
I do.
Jonah Gabriel.
Peter Glickman.
So where did the drugs lead you?
To me.
So... does that mean you've stopped looking?
What else is there to find?
You think this is all about you - good cop, bad cop?
You think that's what this is all about?
You, drugs, dead cops, royal pardons, Harvey Wratten...
It's not about you, it's not about any of you.
You're all just threads, little tiny threads.
But if you want to find the rope, there's only one line for you to follow.
The money.
What money?
Talk to Commissioner Penney.
Ask him about...
Counterpoint.
- What's Counterpoint?
- Say you're looking for answers and you won't stop till you've found them.
He won't give you any, but then he'll get in contact with someone who can.
Who?
Gatehouse.
How do I find him?
Oh, you won't need to.
Once he knows you're looking, he'll find you.
So... tell me your secret.
- I don't have one.
- Everyone has a secret.
Everyone.
And that's what he will find.
And that's where he will find you... at your most vulnerable.
I don't... have a secret.
You want to know who you are, Gabriel?
You want to know what side of the line you really stand?
Then tell me your secret, because once he finds it, I'm the only one who can save you.
Good boy.
- I'm not doing it.
- You have to trust me on this.
A new hotel every night?
!
- It's just for a short time.
- What's a short time?
- It's not long!
- Shhh!
- Is that what she is doing?
- No.
Why not?
Because she's your wife,
- because she's pregnant?
- Because she's not the one in danger.
- And we are?
!
- You may be, yes.
If you stay here.
Why?
Because if this man comes looking for me, he may well come here.
I'll just tell him where to go!
Why would he come here?
Because...
Because... we are your weakness.
Yes.
Is he trying to blackmail you?
No.
Threaten us?
Call her!
Tell her!
Tell everyone!
I will.
Not will!
Do it now!
Then he'll have nothing because everything will be out in the open.
- That won't work.
- It'll work for me!
It'll work for him!
It's what I've been asking you for a long time!
It looks like this guy's doing me a favour!
- It will make it worse.
- Worse for who?
For you?
For your wife?
!
Yes!
For Laura, for you, for me, for Conrad,
- for everyone!
- Why?
Because if this man thinks my secret is here, this is where he'll come.
So you're using us as bait?
!
No, because you won't be here!
You'll be safe!
And all he'll find...
All he'll find... is me.
Who is this man?
I don't know.
That's what I'm going to find out.
That's five million.
I'll need 48 hours to get you the rest.
For that kind of a turnover, it's only polite to wait.
You're in the game now.
Better than being on it.
You want the next two shipments in one go?
400 kilos at 15 grand a kilo.
Then I need three million up front.
It's in the bag... along with the four I already owe you.
Seven.
- Seven million.
- Plus three on delivery, gives you your ten, as I promised.
400 kilos, that's a heavy weight.
Flowers won't cover it.
- I don't expect them to.
- Then what do you expect?
A change of plan.
Hmmm.
So what have you got?
400 kilograms, brown, at least 70%, import.
- When?
- Within three weeks.
Who?
Joseph Bede.
How much do you want?
250,000.
What?
With a street value of 20-odd million, I reckon your people will wear it.
Why are you doing this?
Ours is a dog-eat-dog world... and this dog's getting too tired to run.
You didn't come.
It was good... but it would have been better with you.
I'm sorry.
You ought to tell me.
About what?
Whatever it is you want to say.
Tell me.
I wish I could, but I can't.
Is there something you know?
- About Peter?
- Yes.
No.
I meant about you and me.
I wish...
But I can't.
- Because of your wife.
- Because of everything.
It would be a shame to lose you completely.
I mean, we've only just met.
Then next time I'll come.
- Next time it's Bach.
- I like Bach.
Yes, I think I saw that about you.
Then Bach it shall be.
As friends.
As friends.
Where's the harm in that?
No harm... at all.
- Jonah.
- Commander.
Not any more.
Just plain mister.
And why was that, exactly?
You still lost your memory, Detective Inspector?
I'm yet to get the full picture, if that's what you mean, sir.
How convenient.
It hasn't been.
But I'm starting to pull some threads together.
Well, be careful they don't form into a noose.
For whose neck?
- You're not the first, you know.
- To do what?
Stand there.
Who else is there?
Was.
That journalist.
- McGovern.
- Asking questions.
- About you?
- About you, actually.
Look what happened to him.
I don't ride bikes.
No.
It's too dangerous.
It's not worth the risk.
- But what is?
- The truth.
Because you're a policeman?
It's who I am.
You don't know who you are.
I think I might be about to find out.
Be careful what you wish for.
Maybe it's what you don't know that's keeping you alive.
Counterpoint.
What's Counterpoint?
It's music, isn't it?
It's...
It's by Bach.
Gatehouse.
Who's Gatehouse?
And what about the money?
- Safe journey, Detective Inspector.
- See you when I get there, Mr Penney.
♪
- Absolute *** world.
- Well... that's great men for you.
In my world, Commander, when everyone knows who you are, you haven't done your fucking job.
So?
Gabriel.
Well, he wasn't faking it.
And if he doesn't know, he hasn't told anyone else.
Except now, he wants to find out for himself.
Well, if you're walking around with a bullet in your head, it's all... just a matter of time.
- Sir Richard...
- I know, I know.
Very moving.
How?
He has an ex-mistress and a love child he wants to keep secret.
They argue... often.
Neighbours have heard them.
So when your people finally break in, because she's missed an appointment or whatever, and find two bodies... hers will be murdered, and his will have turned the gun on himself - silenced, of course... and, incidentally, stolen from his department a few days previously.
But, when asked, it will be the arguments the neighbours remember and not the unnoticed visit from a stranger the night before.
- And the child?
- Hmmm.
Lucky to be alive.
Like the rest of us, don't you think?
When it's your time...
- It's your time.
- No matter where you look.
I might have a shadow on a line.
Are you interested?
- Whose?
- Where Harvey Wratten left off.
- How much for it?
- Quarter of a million.
400 kilos Turkish Brown, 70% pure.
- When?
- I need a quick decision.
I'll need a name.
Without a target there's nothing to aim at.
- Bede.
Joseph Bede.
- Never heard of him.
Isn't that the point?
Mama...
Come on, darling, we're going.
- What are you doing here?
!
- What are YOU doing here?
!
This is my home!
You have to go.
Alison!
You have to go!
Oh, go on!
Just you try it.
Don't go in there.
Alison!
Too late.
Here we are.
Here we are, my darling.
Safe and sound.
Yes, now it's time to go to sleep.
Mummy's going to go out and I'll come back and give you a kiss, OK?
Shhh...
Shhh...
- He's here?
- Go in the kitchen.
- Don't open the door!
- It's too late.
Don't call anyone.
- I'm not...
- Go in the kitchen.
Don't come out.
Jonah Gabriel.
Who are you?
- We need to talk.
- What about?
- May I come in?
- No.
I have something very important to tell you.
Then say it here.
I can't do that.
- Why not?
- It's a secret.
Then whisper.
You want to protect your family.
I understand.
Good.
But then, you see, if I'd wanted to kill them,
I could have done it at the hotel.
And if I'd needed to kill you...
I could have done it long before now.
You...
Where are they?
Why do you need to know?
It would be best if they didn't see me.
He's in his room, she's in the kitchen.
Tell her to stay there.
I have.
When?
Before I came to the door.
Why?
It's my job.
Do you call it a living room or a lounge?
Neither.
Then let's go there.
Come in.
Sit down.
That's your choice.
This is mine.
Will she come in?
No.
So you want to know why I shot you.
I want to know why I was there.
Because you're afraid you'd come to sell me drugs like Delaney had before.
That somehow he'd... corrupted you.
Had he?
You really don't know?
But what do you think?
I don't.
Because you can't remember?
That's what your bullet did to me.
But people just know.
Don't they?
Instinctively.
Whether they're good or bad.
Why don't you?
Is it here?
Is it her?
Is it your son?
Is it the lies you tell your wife?
What is it that makes you so unsure?
Because whatever it is, it's not just the bullet in your head that makes you need to ask.
May I?
What?
I have something to give you.
What?
It's what you want to know.
It's in my breast pocket.
May I?
It's all right.
Finger and thumb.
Finger and thumb.
It's Delaney's notebook, the one I took from him after he'd been shot.
It's all written down.
Like what?
You weren't selling drugs.
The line you walked was straight.
You even got Delaney to walk it with you, right to its very end.
It's all right.
You were a good cop.
But whether you're a good person...
Well, that's not for me to say.
But here.
Find out for yourself.
No, I don't think I'll be doing that.
No?
Why not?
Because you're wearing gloves.
- No!
- My God!
- No!
- My baby!
- No!
- My baby!
No!
My baby!
Give me my baby!
- No!
- Give me!
Give me my baby!
Give me!
Give me!
Hello?
Petra?
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right, it's all right.
Shhh...
Shhhh, it's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It'll be all right.
It'll be all right.
It'll be all right.
Thank you for coming.
I didn't think I should.
I wanted you to.
I needed you to.
I have to tell you something.
These past three years I have been living a lie.
And there came a point I decided that I would do anything... anything to make it stop.
Two weeks ago I told Jonah that if he didn't tell you about Connie then I would.
This week.
Maybe even today, who knows?
And if I had done that...
I would have ruined your life.
But I would have done it willingly.
Willingly, you know... because that's how we feel about truth, isn't it?
It has to be known, no matter what.
Even if it means wrecking an innocent woman's life... or opening the door to a man he should never have let in.
But standing here today,
I can tell you
I would rather live with an eternity of lies than a second without my son.
You must tell your husband to do the same, because if he doesn't,
I'm very afraid the next person to be standing here will be you.
Detective, this way.
Detective, look this way a moment?
Detective Inspector.
Just one more.
This way.
How much do they know?
They certainly smell a story.
A corrupt police officer selling drugs to criminals.
- They don't know that.
- Not yet.
What other choice have I got?
That's going to make things very difficult for me.
You should have thought of that before you insisted on bringing him back in.
I'll need time... to tidy up.
Be sure to take your ashtray with you when you go.
What?
Richard, you've no-one to blame...
but yourself.
Inspector.
This way.
We are ready to deliver.
My end buyer needs notice.
I can give you up to one week.
- I'll take that.
- Three million.
You'll have it.
How's your wife?
Don't speak about my wife!
It was you who put her in the deal.
What did he mean by that?
Jesus, Joseph!
What have you done?
Tell the boy we need that money.
Yeah, that's fine.
Fine?
Is that like OK?
Because it's got to be more than that.
It's got to be definite.
Don't worry, I'll get you the money.
We're not talking about a visit to the sweet shop.
You going to watch me make the call?
You know what?
When both the cops AND the criminals begin to look like kids, it really is time to leave the game.
Well, that's a call only you can make, Granddad.
Just get that money.
Shit!
Apparently he's got the heartbeat of a 20-year-old.
That's Benecol for you.
Can I have a word?
So... what did he have to tell you that was so important you let him in?
You were a good cop?
At least I'm not alone.
Doesn't make it true.
Judge yourself by your actions, Jonah.
If you weren't, you'd have given up long before now.
That's why Khokar wants to have you thrown to the wolves.
And if I let the press rip you to bits, pretty soon they're going to start licking their chops at me.
Then maybe you and your boss should think that through more carefully.
And maybe HE already has.
You know how to survive?
It's not just the first blow you've got to look out for, it's knowing where the next one will come.
So if Khokar's happy enough to have my arse stripped out, whatever he's got to hide must look like a whole fucking abattoir.
And that's the stench he obviously thinks you've caught a whiff of.
You talked to the wrong guy, Jonah.
So if there's anything you know, now's the time to tell me, because then we can beat this together.
I met with Peter Glickman.
When?
Before he was killed, sir.
What did he tell you?
Where did you get it from?
DS Delaney.
When?
Just before he died, must've been.
Is it your share?
What of?
A drug's deal.
I think it was his share.
Of the drugs that got him busted.
So why's it in OUR wardrobe?
Because I wanted to know why...
Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it?
What have you done, Jonah?
No, Laura, it's them.
What have they done?
Who?
Look.
What is it?
It's a code.
Whose?
Ours.
I've been looking in the wrong direction.
It's not the drugs, it's the money - the money used to buy them!
- Jonah, I...
- It's a police code, Laura.
What?
This money... is from our side.
- So give it back.
- But that's not how it got here.
If Delaney got this from selling drugs, then who was buying?
- I don't know...
- The police, Laura.
He was selling it to us.
So whose side are we on?
Can I have a private word?
I've been offered a shadow on a line.
- Whose line?
- A guy called Joseph Bede.
- Never heard of him.
- Isn't that the point?
What's he looking to bring in?
400 kilos of heroin, 70% pure.
Who's the shadow?
- How much does he want?
- A quarter of a million.
Baked beans?
Pounds.
Hang on, there's a phrase people use for this.
It's funny, it's, em...
"Fuck you!" Yeah, that's it.
Fuck you!
- Yes, that's one of our codes.
- When?
- May the 5th last year.
- How much was marked?
- I can't tell you that.
- What can you tell me?
Whatever's not classified.
Is this operation still ongoing?
We were never asked to locate the money.
Why not?
It was never initiated.
What does that mean?
Well, whoever had it smudged never asked us to trace them.
And who was that?
You lost a son.
Yes, I did.
That's terrible.
You log every access request?
- Yes.
- Can you tell me the last person to ask to access that file?
Well, you were...
- and a...
- Detective Sergeant Delaney.
See?
They're geeks.
The reason no-one's here is cos they can talk to each other without even speaking.
I know why I got shot.
Harvey Wratten needed to get himself out of jail.
To do that, he got Gatehouse to buy up a huge amount of drugs and pass them on to Customs.
Delaney found out and wanted to get in on the act, so he stole 30 kilos of heroin from a leaky property room and sold them on to Gatehouse and when Customs got them, they gave them back to you.
How'd you know it was Delaney?
Silly boy tried to do it again.
One should always know when to quit.
So you decided to throw a blanket over it, and that's where the story should have ended, and it would have if Delaney hadn't decided to take a second chance to heart, because that's when he showed me this.
The cash he got for the drugs was marked.
Gatehouse had been buying it all with police money.
So if Gatehouse was working for Harvey Wratten, then Harvey Wratten was working for us.
And that's why I didn't log the operation the night we went out.
I didn't want anyone from our side to know we were looking, but, as it turned out...
Someone already did.
And that's what got me shot.
Whoever it was had the money marked.
And his name will be on that file.
You pull the cord on that and by the time you get to see it, it won't even exist.
No, your judgement was right in the first place.
The key to this... is Gatehouse.
Don't worry.
It'll be over in a heartbeat.
Beep...
Beep...
Beep...
Beep!

You can read my mind?
Not quite.
At least not yet.
But we can evaluate your reaction to the photos, and that gives us some insight into brain function.
Or lack of?
Hmm.
Well, it's interesting.
The scan images above the pictures are from three months ago, beneath the pictures are now.
What's interesting is that most of them have remained consistent.
So your response to your childhood... schooling, etcetera,
all these have remained the same.
There's been a change in response to your wife.
There's more orange in it now.
Hmm.
Meaning?
As I say, we don't know what the change means yet, just that there's been one.
Your response to your colleague who was killed also remains unchanged.
However, and this is what's particularly interesting, your response to the scene of the killing and where you were shot, that has changed considerably.
If you look at the scan from three months ago, there's hardly any reaction at all.
Because of the injury.
This is what interests us.
Whereas today's scan shows distinctly more activity.
You think my memory's coming back?
Starting to, maybe.
-Though a glass, darkly.
-Ah, yes.
-But later...
-Yeah.
Later.
It's all right.
Go back to sleep.
Everything's fine.
Laura, there's something I have to tell you.
Don't worry.
Whatever happens, it'll be all right.
Why do you say that?
Why do you always say that?
It will not be all right to lose this baby.
It will not be.
-I didn't...
-Stop it, Jonah.
Stop always hedging your fucking bets!
When are you going to want something?
Want something so much you can't bear to lose it?
Say it.
Say you want this.
-Of course I do.
-Good.
Because sometimes wanting something so much that you can't live...
You can't even see a future if you lose it, is the only reason you get it.
So for once, want it.
Like you have never wanted anything else.
It's all right.
It's there.
See?
Want it.
I do.
Jonah Gabriel?
Peter Glickman.
So, where did the drugs lead you?
To me.
So, does that mean you've stopped looking?
What else is there to find?
Do you think this is all about you?
Good cop, bad cop?
You think that's what this is all about?
You, drugs, dead cops, Royal Pardons, Harvey Wratten...
It's not about you.
It's not about any of you.
You're alljust threads.
Little, tiny threads.
But if you want to find the rope, there's only one line for you to follow.
The money.
What money?
Talk to Commissioner Penney.
Ask him about Counterpoint.
What's Counterpoint?
Say you're looking for answers and you won't stop till you've found them.
He won't give you any, but then he'll get in contact with someone who can.
Who?
Gatehouse.
How do I find him?
Oh, you won't need to.
Once he knows you're looking, he'll find you.
So, tell me your secret.
I don't have one.
Everyone has a secret.
Everyone.
And that's what he will find.
And that's where he will find you.
At your most vulnerable.
I don't... have a secret.
You want to know who you are, Gabriel?
You want to know what side of the line you really stand?
Then tell me your secret.
Because once he finds it,
I'm the only one who can save you.
Good boy.
Good boy.
I'm not doing it.
You have to trust me on this.
A new hotel every night?
-It's just for a short time.
-What's a short time?
-It's not long!
-Shh.
-Is that what she's doing?
-No.
Why not?
Because she's your wife?
-Because she's pregnant?
-Because she's not the one in danger.
Oh.
And we are?
You may be.
Yes, if you stay here.
Why?
Because if this man comes looking for me, he may well come here.
Then I'lljust tell him where to go.
Why would he come here?
Because...
Because we are your weakness.
Yes.
Is he trying to blackmail you?
No.
Threaten us?
Call her.
Tell her.
Tell everyone!
-I will.
-Not "will".
Do it now!
Then he'll have nothing, because everything will be out in the open.
-That won't work.
-But it'll work for me.
It'll work for him!
It's what I've been asking you for a long time.
God!
It looks like this guy's doing me a favour.
It will make it worse.
Worse for who?
For you?
For your wife?
Yes!
For Laura, for you, for me, for Con, for everyone!
Why?
Because if this man thinks my secret is here, this is where he'll come.
So, you're using us as bait?
No!
Because you won't be here!
You'll be safe!
And all he'll find...
All he'll find is me.
Who is this man?
I don't know.
That's what I'm going to find out.
That's five million.
I'll need 48 hours to get you the rest.
With that kind of turnover, it's only polite to wait.
You're in the game now.
Better than being on it.
You want the next two shipments in one go?
Four hundred kilos at 15 grand a kilo.
Then I need three million up front.
It's in the bag, along with the four I already owe you.
Seven.
Seven million.
Plus three on delivery.
Gives you your 10, as I promised.
Four hundred kilos, that's a heavy weight.
-Flowers won't cover it.
-I don't expect them to.
Then what do you expect?
A change of plan.
Hmm.
So, what have you got?
400 kilogram, brown.
At least 70%.
Import.
-When?
-Within three weeks.
-Who?
-Joseph Bede.
How much do you want?
-Two hundred and fifty thousand.
-What?
With a street value of 20-odd million, I reckon your people are wary.
Why are you doing this?
Ours is a dog-eat-dog world.
And this dog's getting too tired to run.
You didn't come.
It was good.
Would have been better with you.
I'm sorry.
You ought to tell me.
About what?
Whatever it is you want to say.
Tell me.
I wish I could but I can't.
Is it something you know?
-About Peter?
-Yes.
No.
I meant about you and me, I wish...
But I can't.
-Because of your wife?
-Because of everything.
Well, it'd be a shame to lose you completely.
I mean, we've only just met.
Then next time I'll come.
-Next time it's Bach.
-I like Bach.
Yes, I think I thought that about you.
Then Bach it shall be.
As friends.
Where's the harm in that?
No harm.
At all.
-Jonah.
-Commander.
Not any more.
Just plain Mister.
And why was that, exactly?
Have you still lost your memory, Detective Inspector?
I'm yet to get the full picture, if that's what you mean, sir.
Oh, how convenient.
Hasn't been.
But I'm starting to pull some threads together.
Well, be careful they don't form into a noose.
For whose neck?
You're not the first, you know.
To do what?
Stand there.
-Who else is there?
-Was.
That journalist.
-McGovern.
-Asking questions.
-About you?
-About you, actually.
Look what happened to him.
I don't ride bikes.
No.
It's too dangerous.
It's not worth the risk.
-What is?
-The truth.
Because you're a policeman?
It's who I am.
You don't know who you are.
I think I might be about to find out.
Be careful what you wish for.
Maybe it's what you don't know that's keeping you alive.
Counterpoint.
What's Counterpoint?
It's music, isn't it?
It's by Bach.
Gatehouse.
Who's Gatehouse?
And what about the money?
Safe journey, Detective Inspector.
I'll see you when I get there, Mr Penney.
An absolute fucking melting pot.
Well, that's great men for you.
In my world, Commander, when everyone knows who you are, you haven't done your fucking job.
-So.
-Gabriel.
Well, he wasn't faking it.
And if he doesn't know, he hasn't told anyone else.
Except now he wants to find out for himself.
Well, if you're walking around with a bullet in your head, it's alljust a matter of time.
-Sir Richard...
-I know.
I know.
Very moving.
How?
He has an ex-mistress and a love child he wants to keep secret.
They argue often.
Neighbours have heard them.
So, when your people finally break in because she's missed an appointment or whatever and find two bodies,
hers will be murdered and his will have turned the gun on himself.
Silenced, of course, and incidentally, stolen from his department a few days previously.
But when asked, it will be the arguments the neighbours remember and not the unnoticed visit from a stranger the night before.
And the child?
Mmm.
Lucky to be alive.
Like the rest of us.
Don't you think?
When it's your time...
-It's your time.
-No matter where you look.
I might have a shadow on a line.
Are you interested?
Whose?
Where Harvey Wratten left off.
-How much for it?
-Quarter of a million.
Four hundred kilos, Turkish brown, 70% pure.
-When?
-I'll need a quick decision.
I'll need a name.
Without a target, there's nothing to aim at.
-Bede.
Joseph Bede.
-Never heard of him.
Isn't that the point?
Mama.
Come on, darling.
We're going.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
This is my home!
You have to go.
Alison, you have to go.
Go on.
Just you try it.
Don't go in there.
Alison!
Too late.
Here we are.
Here we are, my darling.
Hmm?
Safe and sound.
Yes.
No, it's time to go to sleep.
Mummy's going to go out and I'll come back and give you a kiss, okay?
Shh.
Shh!
-It's him.
-Go in the kitchen.
-Don't open the door.
-It's too late.
Don't call anyone.
-I'm not...
-Go in the kitchen.
Don't come out.
Jonah Gabriel.
Who are you?
We need to talk.
What about?
-May I come in?
-No.
I have something very important to tell you.
-Then say it here.
-I can't do that.

Tell her to stay there.
I have.
When?
Before I came to the door.

It's my job.
Do you call it a living room or lounge?
Neither.
Then let's go there.
Come in.
Sit down.
That's your choice.
This is mine.
Will she come in?
No.
So, you want to know why I shot you.
I want to know why I was there.
Because you're afraid you'd come to sell me drugs, like Delaney had before?
That somehow he'd...corrupted you?
Had he?
You really don't know?
But what do you think?
I don't.
Because you can't remember?
That's what your bullet did to me.
But people just know.

It's Delaney's notebook, the one I took from him after he'd been shot.
It's all written down.

You weren't selling drugs.
The line you walked was straight.
You even got Delaney to walk it with you.
Right to its very end.
It's all right.
You were a good cop.
But whether you're a good person... well, that's not for me to say.
But here.
Find out for yourself.
No, I don't think I'll be doing that.
No?
Why not?
Because you're wearing gloves.
-No!
-Give him to me!
My baby!
Give him to me!
-No!
-My baby!
Give me my baby!
Give him!
Give him!
Hello?
Petra.
-Oh, it's all right.
Oh, it's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Shh.
Shh, it's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It'll be all right.
-It'll be all right.
It'll be all right.
Thank you for coming.
I didn't think I should.
I wanted you to.
I needed you to.
I have to tell you something.
These past three years, I have been living a lie.

You must tell your husband to do the same.

This way.
Detective!
If you'd just look this way, Detective Inspector!
Just one more.
This way.
How much do they know?
Well they certainly smell a story.
A corrupt police officer selling drugs to criminals.
-They don't know that.
-Not yet.
What other choice have I got?
That's going to make things very difficult for me.
You should've thought of that before you insisted on bringing him back in.
I'll need time...to tidy up.
Be sure to take your ashtray with you when you go.
What?
Richard, you've no one to blame but yourself.
-Detective Inspector, this way.
We are ready to deliver.
My end buyer needs notice.
I can give you up to one week.
-I'll take that.
-Three million?
You'll have it.
How's your wife?
Don't speak about my wife!
It was you who put her in the deal.
What did he mean by that?
Jesus, Joseph, what have you done?
Tell the boy we need that money.
Yeah, that's fine.
Fine?
What, is that like, okay?
'Cause it's got to be more than that, it's got to be definite.
Don't worry, I'll get you the money.
We're not talking about a visit to the sweet shop now.
Want to watch me make the call?
You know what?
When both the cops and the criminals begin to look like kids, it really is time to leave the game.
Well, that's a call only you can make, Granddad.
Just get that money.
Shit.
Apparently he's got the heartbeat of a 20-year-old.
That's Benecol for you.
Can I have a word?
So, what did he have to tell you that was so important you let him in?
You were a good cop?
At least I'm not alone.
Doesn't make it true.
Judge yourself by your actions, Jonah.
If you weren't, you'd have given up long before now.
That's why Khokar wants to have you thrown to the wolves.
And if I let the press rip you to bits, pretty soon they're going to start licking their chops at me.
Well, then maybe you and your boss should think that through
-a little more carefully.
-And maybe he already has.
I have to survive.
It's not just the first blow you got to look out for, it's knowing when the next one will come.
So, if Khokar's happy enough to have my arse stripped out, whatever he's got to hide must look like a whole fucking abattoir.
And that's a stench he obviously thinks you've caught a whiff of.
You talked to the wrong guy, Jonah.
So if there's anything you know, now is the time to tell me.
Because then we can beat this together.
I met with Peter Glickman.
Oh.
When?
Before he was killed, sir.
And what did he tell you?
Where did you get it from?
DS Delaney.
When?
Just before he died, must've been.
Is it your share?
What of?
A drugs deal.
I think it was his share of the drugs that got him busted.
So why is it in our wardrobe?
Because I wanted to know why.
Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it?
What have you done, Jonah?
No, Laura.
It's them.
What have they done?
Who?
Look.
What is it?
It's a code.
Whose?
Ours.
I've been looking in the wrong direction.
It's not the drugs, it's the money.
-The money used to buy them.
-Jonah, I'm not...
It's a police code, Laura.
-What?
-This money is from our side.
-So give it back.
-But that's not how it got here.
If Delaney got this from selling drugs, then who was buying?
-I don't know.
-The police, Laura.
He was selling it to us.
So whose side are we on?
A private word?
Been offered a shadow on a line.
Whose line?
A guy called Joseph Bede.
Never heard of him.
Isn't that the point?
What's he looking to bring in?
Four hundred kilos of heroin, 70% pure.
Who's the shadow?
How much does he want?
Quarter of a million.
Baked beans?
Pounds.
Hold on, there's a phrase people use for this.
It's funny, it's, um...
Fuck you.
Yeah, that's it.
Fuck you.
-Yeah, that's one of our codes.
-When?
-May the 5th, last year.
-How much was marked?
-I can't tell you that.
-What can you tell me?
Whatever's not classified.
Is this operation still ongoing?
We were never asked to locate the money.
Why not?
Well, it was never initiated.
What does that mean?
Well, whoever had it smudged never asked us to trace it.
And who was that?
You lost a son?
Yes, I did.
That's terrible.
-You log every access request?
-Yes.
Can you tell me the last person to ask to access that file?
Well, you were.
-And Detective Sergeant Delaney.
-...
Sergeant Delaney.
See?
They're geeks.
The reason no one's here is because they can all talk to each other without even speaking.
I know why I got shot.
Harvey Wratten needed to get himself out of jail.
To do that, he got Gatehouse to buy up a huge amount of drugs and pass them on to Customs.
Delaney found out about it and wanted to get in on the act.
So he stole 30 kilos of heroin from a leaky property room and sold them on to Gatehouse.
And when Customs got them, they gave them back to you.
How did you know it was Delaney?
Silly boy tried to do it again.
One should always know when to quit.
So you decided to throw a blanket over it.
And that's where the story should've ended, and it would have, if Delaney hadn't decided to take his second chance to heart.
Because that's when he showed me this.
The cash he got for the drugs was marked.
Gatehouse had been buying it all with police money.
So if Gatehouse was working for Harvey Wratten, then Harvey Wratten was working for us.
And that's why I didn't log the operation the night we went out.
I didn't want anyone from our side to know we were looking.
But as it turned out...
Someone already did.
And that's what got me shot.
Whoever it was had the money marked?
And his name will be on that file.
You pull a cord on that, by the time you get to see it, it won't even exist.
No.
Your judgement was right in the first place.
The key to this... is Gatehouse.
Don't worry.
It'll all be over in a heartbeat.
Beep.
Beep.
Hmm.
(SCANNER WHIRRING RHYTHMICALLY)
You can read my mind?
Not quite.
At least not yet.
But we can evaluate your reaction to the photos, and that gives us some insight into brain function.
Or lack of?
Hmm.
Well, it's interesting.
The scan images above the pictures are from three months ago, beneath the pictures are now.
What's interesting is that most of them have remained consistent.
So your response to your childhood... schooling, etcetera,
all these have remained the same.
There's been a change in response to your wife.
GABRIEL:
There's more orange in it now.
DOCTOR:
Hmm.
Meaning?
As I say, we don't know what the change means yet, just that there's been one.
Your response to your colleague who was killed also remains unchanged.
However, and this is what's particularly interesting, your response to the scene of the killing and where you were shot, that has changed considerably.
If you look at the scan from three months ago, there's hardly any reaction at all.
Because of the injury.
This is what interests us.
Whereas today's scan shows distinctly more activity.
You think my memory's coming back?
Starting to, maybe.
-GABRIEL:
Though a glass, darkly.
-Ah, yes.
-DOCTOR:
But later...
-Yeah.
Later.
(MOBILE RINGING)
It's all right.
Go back to sleep.
Everything's fine.
(SIGHS)
Laura, there's something I have to tell you.
Don't worry.
Whatever happens, it'll be all right.
Why do you say that?
Why do you always say that?
It will not be all right to lose this baby.
It will not be.
-I didn't...
-Stop it, Jonah.
Stop always hedging your fucking bets!
When are you going to want something?
Want something so much you can't bear to lose it?
Say it.
Say you want this.
-(SOFTLY) Of course I do.
-Good.
Because sometimes wanting something so much that you can't live...
You can't even see a future if you lose it, is the only reason you get it.
So for once, want it.
Like you have never wanted anything else.
NURSE:
It's all right.
It's there.
(HEARTBEAT WHOOSHING)
(EXHALING)
See?
Want it.
I do.
Jonah Gabriel?
Peter Glickman.
So, where did the drugs lead you?
To me.
So, does that mean you've stopped looking?
What else is there to find?
Do you think this is all about you?
Good cop, bad cop?
You think that's what this is all about?
You, drugs, dead cops, Royal Pardons, Harvey Wratten...
It's not about you.
It's not about any of you.
You're alljust threads.
Little, tiny threads.
But if you want to find the rope, there's only one line for you to follow.
The money.
What money?
Talk to Commissioner Penney.
Ask him about Counterpoint.
What's Counterpoint?
Say you're looking for answers and you won't stop till you've found them.
He won't give you any, but then he'll get in contact with someone who can.
Who?
Gatehouse.
How do I find him?
Oh, you won't need to.
Once he knows you're looking, he'll find you.
So, tell me your secret.
I don't have one.
Everyone has a secret.
Everyone.
And that's what he will find.
And that's where he will find you.
At your most vulnerable.
I don't... have a secret.
You want to know who you are, Gabriel?
You want to know what side of the line you really stand?
Then tell me your secret.
Because once he finds it,
I'm the only one who can save you.
(BOY CHATTERING)
Good boy.
Good boy.
I'm not doing it.
You have to trust me on this.
A new hotel every night?
-It's just for a short time.
-What's a short time?
-(SHOUTING) It's not long!
-Shh.
(BOY CHATTERING)
-Is that what she's doing?
-No.
Why not?
Because she's your wife?
-Because she's pregnant?
-Because she's not the one in danger.
Oh.
And we are?
You may be.
Yes, if you stay here.
Why?
Because if this man comes looking for me, he may well come here.
Then I'lljust tell him where to go.
(SCOFFING)
Why would he come here?
Because...
Because we are your weakness.
Yes.
Is he trying to blackmail you?
No.
Threaten us?
Call her.
Tell her.
Tell everyone!
-I will.
-Not "will".
Do it now!
Then he'll have nothing, because everything will be out in the open.
-That won't work.
-But it'll work for me.
It'll work for him!
It's what I've been asking you for a long time.
(LAUGHS) God!
It looks like this guy's doing me a favour.
It will make it worse.
Worse for who?
For you?
For your wife?
Yes!
For Laura, for you, for me, for Con, for everyone!
Why?
Because if this man thinks my secret is here, this is where he'll come.
So, you're using us as bait?
No!
Because you won't be here!
You'll be safe!
And all he'll find...
All he'll find Who is this man?
I don't know.
That's what I'm going to find out.
That's five million.
I'll need 48 hours to get you the rest.
With that kind of turnover, it's only polite to wait.
You're in the game now.
Better than being on it.
(CURRENCY COUNTER WHIRRING)
You want the next two shipments in one go?
Four hundred kilos at 15 grand a kilo.
Then I need three million up front.
It's in the bag, along with the four I already owe you.
Seven.
Seven million.
Plus three on delivery.
Gives you your 10, as I promised.
Four hundred kilos, that's a heavy weight.
-Flowers won't cover it.
-I don't expect them to.
Then what do you expect?
A change of plan.
Hmm.
FOLEY:
So, what have you got?
MALE VOICE: 400 kilogram, brown.
At least 70%.
Import.
-When?
-Within three weeks.
-Who?
-Joseph Bede.
How much do you want?
-Two hundred and fifty thousand.
-What?
With a street value of 20-odd million, I reckon your people are wary.
Why are you doing this?
Ours is a dog-eat-dog world.
And this dog's getting too tired to run.
You didn't come.
It was good.
Would have been better with you.
I'm sorry.
You ought to tell me.
About what?
Whatever it is you want to say.
(KICKING DESK)
Tell me.
I wish I could but I can't.
Is it something you know?
-About Peter?
-Yes.
No.
I meant about you and me, I wish...
But I can't.
-Because of your wife?
-Because of everything.
(SIGHS)
Well, it'd be a shame to lose you completely.
I mean, we've only just met.
Then next time I'll come.
-Next time it's Bach.
-I like Bach.
Yes, I think I thought that about you.
(LAUGHS)
(SIGHS)
Then Bach it shall be.
As friends.
Where's the harm in that?
No harm.
At all.
-Jonah.
-Commander.
Not any more.
Just plain Mister.
And why was that, exactly?
Have you still lost your memory, Detective Inspector?
I'm yet to get the full picture, if that's what you mean, sir.
Oh, how convenient.
Hasn't been.
But I'm starting to pull some threads together.
Well, be careful they don't form into a noose.
For whose neck?
You're not the first, you know.
To do what?
Stand there.
-Who else is there?
-Was.
That journalist.
-McGovern.
-Asking questions.
-About you?
-About you, actually.
Look what happened to him.
I don't ride bikes.
No.
It's too dangerous.
It's not worth the risk.
-What is?
-The truth.
Because you're a policeman?
It's who I am.
You don't know who you are.
I think I might be about to find out.
Be careful what you wish for.
Maybe it's what you don't know that's keeping you alive.
Counterpoint.
What's Counterpoint?
It's music, isn't it?
It's by Bach.
Gatehouse.
Who's Gatehouse?
And what about the money?
Safe journey, Detective Inspector.
I'll see you when I get there, Mr Penney.
(ORGAN PLAYING TOCCA TA AND FUGUE IN D MINOR)
An absolute fucking melting pot.
Well, that's great men for you.
In my world, Commander, when everyone knows who you are, you haven't done your fucking job.
-So.
-Gabriel.
Well, he wasn't faking it.
And if he doesn't know, he hasn't told anyone else.
Except now he wants to find out for himself.
Well, if you're walking around with a bullet in your head, it's alljust a matter of time.
-Sir Richard...
-I know.
I know.
Very moving.
How?
He has an ex-mistress and a love child he wants to keep secret.
They argue often.
Neighbours have heard them.
So, when your people finally break in because she's missed an appointment or whatever and find two bodies,
hers will be murdered and his will have turned the gun on himself.
Silenced, of course, and incidentally, stolen from his department a few days previously.
But when asked, it will be the arguments the neighbours remember and not the unnoticed visit from a stranger the night before.
And the child?
Mmm.
Lucky to be alive.
Like the rest of us.
Don't you think?
FOLEY:
When it's your time...
-It's your time.
-No matter where you look.
I might have a shadow on a line.
Are you interested?
Whose?
Where Harvey Wratten left off.
-How much for it?
-Quarter of a million.
(CLICKING TONGUE)
Four hundred kilos, Turkish brown, 70% pure.
-When?
-I'll need a quick decision.
I'll need a name.
Without a target, there's nothing to aim at.
-Bede.
Joseph Bede.
-Never heard of him.
Isn't that the point?
(WHISTLING TUNE)

We're going.

This is my home!
You have to go.
Alison, you have to go.
Go on.
Just you try it.
Don't go in there.
Alison!
Too late.
Here we are.
Here we are, my darling.
Hmm?
Safe and sound.
Yes.
No, it's time to go to sleep.
Mummy's going to go out and I'll come back and give you a kiss, okay?
Shh.
(CAT MEOWING)
(ALISON APPROACHING)
Shh!
-It's him.
-(WHISPERS) Go in the kitchen.
-Don't open the door.
-It's too late.
Don't call anyone.
-I'm not...
-Go in the kitchen.
Don't come out.
(LEAVES RUSTLING)
Jonah Gabriel.
Who are you?
We need to talk.
What about?
-May I come in?
-No.
I have something very important to tell you.
-Then say it here.
-I can't do that.
-Why not?
-It's a secret.
Then whisper.
You want to protect your family.
I understand.
Good.
But then, you see, if I'd wanted to kill them
I could have done it at the hotel.
And if I'd needed to kill you,
I could have done it long before now.
(SOFTLY) You...
(GUNSHOTS REVERBERATING)
(GUNSHOT ECHOES)
Where are they?
Why do you need to know?
It would be best if they didn't see me.
He's in his room, she's in the kitchen.
Tell her to stay there.
I have.
When?
Before I came to the door.
Why?
It's my job.
Do you call it a living room or lounge?
Neither.
Then let's go there.
Come in.
Sit down.
That's your choice.
This is mine.
Will she come in?
No.
So, you want to know why I shot you.
I want to know why I was there.
Because you're afraid you'd come to sell me drugs, like Delaney had before?
That somehow he'd...corrupted you?
Had he?
You really don't know?
But what do you think?
I don't.
Because you can't remember?
That's what your bullet did to me.
But people just know.
Don't they?
Instinctively.
Whether they're good or bad.
Why don't you?
Is it you?
Is it her?
Is it your son?
Is it the lies you tell your wife?
What is it that makes you so unsure?
Because whatever it is, it's not just the bullet in your head that makes you need to ask.
May I?
What?
I have something to give you.
What?
It's what you want to know.
It's in my breast pocket.
May I?
It's all right.
Finger and thumb.
Finger and thumb.
It's Delaney's notebook, the one I took from him after he'd been shot.
It's all written down.
Like what?
You weren't selling drugs.
The line you walked was straight.
You even got Delaney to walk it with you.
Right to its very end.
It's all right.
You were a good cop.
But whether you're a good person... well, that's not for me to say.
But here.
Find out for yourself.
No, I don't think I'll be doing that.
No?
Why not?
Because you're wearing gloves.
(SCREAMS)
-No!
-Give him to me!
My baby!
Give him to me!
-No!
-My baby!
(BOTH WAILING)
Give me my baby!
Give him!
Give him!

Shh.
Shh, it's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It'll be all right.
-(GRUNTS)
-It'll be all right.
It'll be all right.
Thank you for coming.
I didn't think I should.
I wanted you to.
I needed you to.
I have to tell you something.
These past three years, I have been living a lie.
And there came a point I decided that I would do anything, anything to make it stop.
Two weeks ago I told Jonah that if he didn't tell you about Connie, then I would.
This week?
Maybe even today, who knows?
And if I had done that,
I would have ruined your life.
But I would have done it willingly.
Willingly, you know?
Because that's how we feel about truth, isn't it?
It has to be known, no matter what.
Even if it means wrecking an innocent woman's life.
Or opening the door to a man you should never have let in.
But standing here today,
I can tell you,
I would rather live with an eternity of lies than a second without my son.
You must tell your husband to do the same.
Because if he doesn't,
I'm very afraid the next person to be standing here will be you.
MAN:
This way.
Detective!
If you'd just look this way, Detective Inspector!
Just one more.
This way.
(CAMERAS SNAPPING)
How much do they know?
Well they certainly smell a story.

-They don't know that.

That's going to make things very difficult for me.
You should've thought of that before you insisted on bringing him back in.

I can give you up to one week.
-I'll take that.

You'll have it.
How's your wife?
Don't speak about my wife!
It was you who put her in the deal.
What did he mean by that?
Jesus, Joseph, what have you done?
Tell the boy we need that money.
Yeah, that's fine.
Fine?
What, is that like, okay?
'Cause it's got to be more than that, it's got to be definite.
Don't worry, I'll get you the money.
We're not talking about a visit to the sweet shop now.
Want to watch me make the call?
You know what?
When both the cops and the criminals begin to look like kids, it really is time to leave the game.
Well, that's a call only you can make, Granddad.
Just get that money.

That's Benecol for you.
Can I have a word?
So, what did he have to tell you that was so important you let him in?
You were a good cop?
At least I'm not alone.
Doesn't make it true.
Judge yourself by your actions, Jonah.
If you weren't, you'd have given up long before now.
That's why Khokar wants to have you thrown to the wolves.
And if I let the press rip you to bits, pretty soon they're going to start licking their chops at me.
Well, then maybe you and your boss should think that through
-a little more carefully.
-And maybe he already has.
I have to survive.
It's not just the first blow you got to look out for, it's knowing when the next one will come.
So, if Khokar's happy enough to have my arse stripped out, whatever he's got to hide must look like a whole fucking abattoir.
And that's a stench he obviously thinks you've caught a whiff of.

I didn't want anyone from our side to know we were looking.
But as it turned out...
Someone already did.
And that's what got me shot.
Whoever it was had the money marked?
And his name will be on that file.
You pull a cord on that, by the time you get to see it, it won't even exist.
No.
Your judgement was right in the first place.
The key to this... is Gatehouse.
(BEEPING)
Don't worry.
It'll all be over in a heartbeat.
(BEEPING CONTINUES)
Beep.
(MONITOR BEEPS)
Beep.
(GRUNTS)
(CRACKS)
(MONITOR BEEPS)
(BEEPS)
Hmm.
(MONITOR BLEEPS)
(MONITOR RESUMES REGULAR BEEPING)
(MONITOR CONTINUES BEEPING)

What the hell was that?

Uh, but today my afternoon off.
You remember?
I told you.
Ah shit, that's right.
- Look, give these to Massughi.
- Sure.
- Hi Eva.
- Hey, Al.
No, let go of me!
Let go of me, man!
- Get off me!
- Keep walking.
Hey lady.
Lady.
Lady.
Please help me!
I didn't do nothing, man!
Get off of me!
Eva, you can stop holding back.
Stop holding back, Eva.
Eva!
Rise and shine.
It's late, Eva.
The day is almost over.
- Hiii!
- Don't pick him up.
Please don't pick him up.
I just put him down, Franklin.
Hi.
There he is.
You wanna play?
You wanna play?
It's alright.
Just rock him a little bit.
He's alright.
Do you think I'm exaggerating?
You just have to rock him a little bit.
You just have to rock him a little bit.
There's my little dude!
Jesus!
All 12?
- I'll take them as they are.
- But they are totally broken ...
I will take them as they are!
You're gonna be a good looking boy.
All the girls are gonna love you.
I know it.
Don't wake up.
Don't wake up.
Can you say "mommy"?
"mom-my", "mommy", Kevin?
Can you say "ball"? "ball"?
"ba-", "ba-", "ba-".
"Ball"?
No?
Okay.
I'm gonna throw it to you, and you're gonna roll it back to me, okay?
Okay.
Roll it back to mommy.
Roll it back.
Roll.
Roll it back.
Okay, okay.
Roll it back, okay?
Roll it back.
Roll it back.
Roll it back.
When he was a baby, he never stopped screaming.
I thought maybe it had damaged his hearing.
No, his hearing is fine.
But shouldn't he be talking by now?
I read somewhere that non-verbalizing was the... an early sign of autism.
He has none of the tell-tale rocking signs.
I wouldn't worry about it too much.
He's a fluffy little boy, isn't he?
But there is nothing wrong with him.
Thank you.
Okay.
Roll it back to mom.
Okay.
Gonna roll it back again.
That was really good, Kevin.
Okay.
Here we go.
Okay?
Okay?
"E" is for elephant, large as a house, he's big as can be, not small as a mouse.
Can you say "Elephant, Kevin?
"Elephant"?
"Elephant".
Kevin!
Kevin?
Can you say "mommy" for me?
No!
- "mommy"?
- No!
- Just say "mommy".
- No.
Trick or treat?
Trick or treat?
Hey lady.
We know you're in there.
I don't like that!
I don't like that!
I don't like that!
Mommy was happy before little Kevin came along.
Do you know that?
And now mommy wakes up every morning... and wishes she was in France!
That elevator is a death trap.
He needs a yard, somewhere he can toss a ball, fill a pool.
But I love New York.
Come on!
You sound like a bumper sticker.
It's a matter of priorities, Eva.
He's only gonna be a kid once.
You can house hunt all you want.
I'm telling you, I'm not leaving the city.
Kevin, stop that.
That's enough.
Let mommy and daddy talk.
Kevin, quit that!
You have your family room here.
Master bedroom is back there and two huge walking closets.
The bathroom is amazing.
Here we are guys.
Our very own castle.
I'm gonna go and grab some lunch.
Does anybody want anything?
Hey!
Hey!
Wait up!
Ms. K!
Hey.
It's me.
Soweto.
Hi there.
I just wanted to see how you were.
I'm fine.
Thanks.
You look well.
Yeah.
The doctors are saying there's a chance I might walk again.
That's great.
You take care, ms.
K.
You too.
Come on, come on!
Die!
Die!
No!
No!
No!
- Die!
- How do you jump?
Die!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Die!
Hey Kev?
Are you out there?
Kevin?
Kevin, you hear that?
Dad goes pee pee.
You can do that too.
So you want a connector right there.
You see?
And click on that link and it should open right up.
And If it doesn't ...
we'll try it again.
- So you left click.
Wanna give it a try?
- Yes.
- No, no.
- I'm sorry.
- Right click, right there.
- Yeah.
See that?
It comes up.
Right.
Yeah, thanks.
I think I got it.
Thank you for your help.
I pooped.
Hey buddy.
What?
You pooped?
Oh okay.
Here let me help you.
Okay.
Go to your room.
I'll be right there.
Let's not wake up mommy.
Go on!
Go on, buddy.
These scribled squares of paper.
They are dumb.
Everybody needs a room of their own.
You have your room.
This is the mother's room.
I can help you make your room special, if you'd like.
What do you mean, "Special"?
Well, so it looks like your personality.
What personality?
I think you know what I mean.
They're dumb.
No, no, no.
I mean it's good.
You don't need me to do that?
And... and the guy...
Okay.
Well, I mean if you handle the lot ...
I could.
Really?
Well.
That all sounds great.
Okay, John.
Okay.
I'll talk to you later.
Goodbye.
Kevin?
Kevin?
What else do you have to say?
Go wash your face!
He said, he's really sorry.
And that he was only trying to help make it special.
Do you remember how you got that?
It's the most honest thing you ever did.
Do you know how they potty train cats?
They stick their noses in their own shit.
They don't like it.
So they use the box.
Okay.
Let's work on our counting.
- What comes after 3?
- 9.
- What comes after 7?
- 71.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,
41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.
Now, can we quit?
There.
You can add that together if you think you're so smart.
You did not ...
You did not ...
Are you enjoying yourself?
I can see the doctor by myself.
I have to tell you something, Eva.
It's a brave boy you've got there.
- Thank you.
- That's fine.
What mamma did was very, very wrong.
And she's so, so sorry.
Kev?
Kev, hold on a sec!
Kev?
Kevin?
Hey Kev.
What happened?
I broke my arm.
How did you brake your arm?
I had poopy pants.
Mommy went to get wipes.
I fell off the changing table onto my dump trucks.
Mom took me to doctor Goldbutt.
It's all my fault.
No, don't be silly.
You can't watch him every second of the day.
Franklin ...
Unbelievable.
How did you get him to do that?
Well, whatever it was it worked.
Not yet.
Okay.
I love you, kiddo.
I don't like that.
Turn it off.
Honey.
Do you mind if we stop over at the store?
I wanna go home.
It's just that I need to pick up...
Home it is.
Hi guys!
Hi Dad.
How was work?
Did you take any cool pictures?
Eva, he is just a boy.
He's a sweet little boy.
That's what boys do.
Mom is fat!
When did you ...
When were you gonna tell me?
Soon.
Now.
How am I part of the decision now?
What am I supposed to say now?
So, the daddy bear plants his seed in the mommy bear and it grows into an egg.
Is this about fucking?
Do you know what that means?
The boy puts his pee pee in the girl's doo doo.
Well ...
Haven't you ever wished you had somebody around to play with?
No.
You might like it.
What if I don't like it?
Then you get used to it.
Just because you're used to something ... doesn't mean you like it.
You're used to me.
Yes, well ...
In a few months we're all gonna get used to somebody new.
Beautiful.
Hey Kev.
Come on and meet your little sister.
This is your brother.
It's Kevin.
It's your big brother.
Yes, that's right.
It's Kevin.
Yes, yes ...
Kevin!
Don't do that.
No, Kevin.
That's not nice.
No problem dear.
We're getting snacks, okay?
Come on.
Christ!
To Ecuador?
For 2 months?
Why can't they send someone else?
I really wanna work this deal.
First he cries too much, then he's too quiet.
Then he makes up his own little language, and that is annoying.
He has trouble communicating.
A lot of kids do.
And you see this as some kind of personal vendetta?
It's not good for him.
Franklin, pick up the god damn phone!
Pick up the god damn phone.
... 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 20, 21, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 ...
Please.
Please.
Let me have a drink.
Please
Kevin?
Kevin!
Honey?
Are you ok?
I'm sorry mom.
Not to worry, sweetheart.
You couldn't help it.
"By my soul," cried Gilbert.
"Aren't thou the devil in blue to shoot in that way?"
"Nay," posed Robin, laughing.
"Not quite so ill as that I trust."
"Then he took up another shaft ..." Are you okay, honey?
Then he took up another shaft, and fitted it to the string.
Again he shot.
Again, he smoathed the arrow close beside the center.
The third time, he losed his bowstring and dropped the arrow just betwix the other two, and into the very center, so that the feathers of all three were ruffled together seeming from a distance to be one big shaft.
And now a low murmur ran all along the great crowd.
Hey champ.
How are you doing?
Feeling better?
Go away.
I'm tired.
Oh.
Okay.
Sure thing, buddy.
You just get some rest, okay?
Don't stop reading, mom.
280 score shafts were shot in all and so deftly were they sped, that when the shooting was done each target looked like the back of a hedgehog ... when a farm dog snuffed at it.
Good afternoon, ma'am.
I hope this isn't an inconvenient time.
Well, it is actually.
Well, we just have a couple of quick questions for you.
What is it about?
Do you know where you are spending the afterlife?
Oh, yeah.
I do as a matter of fact.
I'm going straight to hell.
Eternal damnation.
Thank you for asking.
Okay?
Hey honey.
Let me help you with that.
I can dress myself.
Can you leave?
Sure.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
Do you want some more of that chowder for lunch?
Whatever.
- Or grilled cheese sandwich?
- I don't give a rat's ass.
Thanks Dad, this is so cool.
You're welcome, buddy.
Right.
Here we go.
In the middle.
Ooooh.
Almost.
Here.
Take that one.
Try again.
Use your finger ...
Keep your eyes in the middle.
Good shot, Kev.
You're a natural.
Perfect.
Thanks Dad.
Right.
It's like this.
You wake up.
Then you watch TV.
You get in the car, then you listen to the radio.
Then you go to you little job or your little school but we're not gonna hear about that on the 6pm news.
Why?
Because nothing is really happening.
Thenyougo home and watch some more TV.
Ormaybeit 'safun night, and you go out and you watch a movie.
I mean it's got so bad, that half the time the people on TV, inside the TV, they're watching TV.
And what are all these people watching?
People like me.
And what are all you doing right now?
You're watching me.
Don't you think you would have changed the channel by now if all I did was getting "A" in geometry?
Me and Kevin were plaiying "Christmas kidnapping".
Kevin!
Kevin, you're my friend!
You're my friend.
Beat it, Celia.
Get me a soda.
Not that, you retard.
Get me a Root Beer.
What ?
Thank you, Celia.
I was thirsty.
Hey, you wanne know a secret?
Come closer.
Do you know who else is thirsty?
You don't?
It's the vacuum monster.
Cut it out!
- Hey troops!
- Daddy!
Ho, ho, ho.
See what I got!
Kev, come here.
Give me a hand.
Yeah, sure dad.
- You wanna dance?
- No thanks, Harland.
- Come on.
Just one.
- I don't dance, really.
Where do you get off, you stuck up bitch?
Do you think anyone else is gonna want you now?
Come on.
Stay for another drink.
Come on.
Come on.
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.
Can we leave a carrot for the reindeer!
- Should we?
- Yeah.
Kevin!
Didn't I see you at the bookstore today?
No.
Oh, I could have sworn.
By the way, are you doing anything on Friday?
Why?
I just thought we might do something together.
For fun.
Like, do what?
Maybe take you for dinner.
Or play around with miniature golf?
Okay.
Why didn't you bring a coat?
You just can't get uncomfortable enough, can you?
Uncomfortable?
With my own mother?
Whenever I see fat people, they are always eating.
Dont' give me any of this "slower metabolism thyroid gland" crap.
It's food.
They are fat because they eat the wrong food.
Too much of it, and all the time.
You know, you can be kind of harsh sometimes.
You're one to talk.
Yeah, I am.
I wonder where I got it.
Well, you won.
So.
What next, momsy?
We're gonna go home.
You're gonna get changed into something reasonable.
And I take you to dinner.
Great.
We're going to dinner.
I was hungry.
I'm a growing boy, you know.
I'll have a calorie salad, steak, medium rare, and a bottle of Merlot.
Very well.
So, how is school going?
It's going.
on a course schedule.
How about the teachers?
Are there any of them ...
Right, right, what bands am I listening to these days?
Next you can read all about if there isn't some cute little cunt in the front row who's got me itchy.
Then you can segway into the whole, it's all up to me of course but before bailing the chick in the hallway I might decide to way until I'm ready.
Right around dessert, you can ask about drugs
Real careful, like cause you don't want to scare me into, like, lying my head off.
So you have to say, like, how you experimented.
Then finally once you've sucked up that entire bottle of wine, you can go all gooey eyed and say how nice it is to spend quality time together, then scooch over and put your arm around my shoulder.
Give it a little squeeze.
Fuck!
- Your computer is fucked, isn't it?
- Yeah.
It's fucked.
And so are all the ones at work.
I guess I deserved it.
- Why would you let out something like that?
- I collect them.
Isn't that a weird thing to collect?
I don't like stamps.
But what is the point?
There is no point.
That's the point.
No, it really hasn't been any trouble at all.
Everybody is bringing a dish.
Oh.
That's him now.
I got to go.
You have a great day.
Bye, mom.
Merry Christmas.
Alright, Kev.
You're next.
Can you guess what it is?
That's a series 7.
The guy in the store said it was the best one.
- Gee, dad.
Thank you so much.
- Merry Christmas.
What did you have for breakfast?
Had a good day, Snuffles?
Did you hear that thump?
That's a powerful thing, man.
Celia!
Come on, honey.
Time for bed Here we go.
I thought I closed the door.
Kevin said I was stupid, and he was right.
You're not stupid, honey.
Don't you worry.
We'll find him.
Now you scoop down.
Come on.
Cozy?
I'm sure Snuffles has gone to the big pet store in the sky.
- Don't say that!
Don't say that!
- Yes.
It's the truth!
Dearly beloved,
We are gathered here to mourn mr.
Snuffles ...
Stop it!
Who will ... tragically early ...
So daddy and mommy were looking for him the whole night.
And you know why we couldn't find him?
Because Snuffles has gone to live in the garden.
He's living in the garden now, with a whole bunch of new animal friends.
Celia.
Okay, give me the spoon.
So, they're having a big party tonight... with the chipmunks, and the squarrels, and the racoons ... and they're eating nuts, and berries, and they're gonna have a whole bunch ...
Why did you leave the drain stuff out?
I didn't.
- I put it way.
- Then how did it get out?
Ask Kevin.
Kevin did it.
You need to go talk to someone.
Uhm Kev.
Mom has something else she wanted to tell you.
I wanted to ... thank you for calling the ambulance.
And?
And ...
I was concerned that you might be feeling responsible.
Why is that?
Because you was supposed to be looking after her.
We just don't want you to blame yourself.
No.
I don't ...
I never said I did.
She's gonna need a glass eye, Kevin.
So, we would appreciate you looking after her, and any namecalling ...
You don't really remember being a kid much do you, dad?
Celia is just gonna have to suck it up.
I thought you didn't like those.
Well, they're a ...
Now what do you call it ... an acquired taste.
I'm so sorry.
There you go.
Okay.
Thank you, mommy.
- Hey kiddo.
You're going to practice?
- Yeah, you know it.
- Hey Celia, you wanna come collect arrows?
- No!
So ...
What do you want to do?
Let's wait for the school year to end, and make arrangements for this summer.
At least the custody is a no-brainer.
Is it?
You've decided?
Eva, there's nothing left to decide.
It already happened.
- I needed a drink of water.
- Hi, Kev.
Listen, buddy, it's easy to misunderstand something if you hear it out of context.
Why would I not know the "context"?
I am the context.
- You have to appeal to reject punitive damage.
- No.
You'll lose everything.
The business, your house.
I hate the house.
I always have.
You'll rot in hell!
A personal for Kevin Khatcha ...
dourian?
- Careful, it's heavy.
- It is?
- Have a nice day.
- You too.
What are these for?
You never ride your bike.
I got these for a song of the web.
You make a bundle on them at school.
Like Donald Trump, huh.
I'll take you back to my ship.
1, 2, 3.

-Yeah.

-Yes.
- Did you eat all your cereal?
Alright.
You're a little clammy.
Are you okay?
Never better.
Hey.
Only three days to go till you're 16.
We should do something.
How about Sunday?
I don't know.
I might be tied up.
Come clean up some of this mess and then we're gonna get dressed and go.
I do not want to go to school.
I know, but daddy have to take a shower and then we'll go.
Say goodbye!
Do you think we could make some time later to talk.
Just the two of us, without the kids?
I really wanna work this thing out.
Doesn't Kevin go to Gladstone High?
Franklin ...
Pick up the god damn phone!
Franklin ...
I have my son in here.
Kevin?

Kevin!
Kevin!
Lauren!
Franklin?
Celia?
Franklin?
Celia?
You don't look happy.
Have I ever?
I'm almost 18, aren't I?
What is it?
Going to the big school making you nervous?
Nervous?
Do you know anything about those places?
Well.
You managed it all so well.
A child of a minor.
Out of your head on prozac.
You'll be out of here in a couple of years.
Do you know what day it is today?
Why the let me come see you on a monday?
Sure.
It's my anniversary.
Two years.
Plenty of time to think about it.
I want you to tell me why.
I used to think I knew.
Now I'm not so sure.
Time is up.
We Need To Talk About Kevin
When you go to the ball... you have to learn how to dance like a princess, right?
1, 2, 3...
1, 2, 3...

I really wanna work this thing out.
Okay?
I miss you.
Eva Khatchadourian!
It's a lot.
Look, Eva.
I don't really care who you are or what you've done so long as you can type and you can file.
You can have this job.

I wont let you down.
I promise you.
Thank you.
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

Great.

Looks like someone is having a nice day?
Enjoying yourself?
I'm sorry?
I hope you rot in hell, you fucking bitch!
Jesus.
What the hell was that?
Are you ok?
No, no, no, it's nothing.
Its really... its nothing.
- Let me call 911.
- No, no, it was my fault.
- But she just totally...
- No, no, I'm fine.
Eva, when are you coming home?
I miss you.
I love you.
Promise me you'll never go away again.
I will never, never, never go away again.

We did it.
I'm gonna need all these processed today, Eva.
Uh, but today my afternoon off.
You remember?
I told you.
Ah shit, that's right.
- Look, give these to Massughi.
- Sure.
- Hey, Eva.
- Hey, Al.
No, let go of me!
Let go of me, man!
- Get off me!
- Keep walking.
Hey lady!
Lady!
Lady!
Please help me!
I didn't do nothing, man!
Get off of me!
Eva, you can stop resisting.
Stop resisting, Eva.
Eva!
Rise and shine.
It's late, Eva.
The day is almost over.
- Hiii!
- Don't pick him up.
Please don't pick him up.
I just put him down, Franklin.
Hi.
There he is.
You wanna play?
You wanna play?
It's alright.
Just rock him a little bit.
He's alright.
Do you think I'm exaggerating?
You just have to rock him a little bit.
You just have to rock him a little bit.
There's my little dude!
Jesus!
All 12?
- I'll take them as they are.
- But they are totally broken...
I'll take them as they are!
You're gonna be a good looking boy.
All the girls are gonna love you.
I know it.
Don't wake up.
Don't wake up.
Can you say "mommy"?
"mom-my", "mommy", Kevin?
Can you say "ball"? "ball"?
"ba-", "ba-", "ba-".
"Ball"?
No?
Okay.
I'm gonna throw it to you, and you're gonna roll it back to me, okay?
Okay.
Roll it back to mommy.
Roll it back.
Roll.
Roll it back.
Okay, okay.
Roll it back, okay?
Roll it back.
Roll it back.
Roll it back.
When he was a baby, he never stopped screaming.
I thought maybe it had damaged his hearing.
No, his hearing is fine.
But shouldn't he be talking by now?
I read somewhere that non-verbalizing was the... an early sign of autism.
He has none of the tell-tale rocking signs.
I wouldn't worry about it too much.
He's a fluffy little boy, isn't he?
But there is nothing wrong with him.
Thank you.
Okay.
Roll it back to mommy.
Okay.
Gonna roll it back again.
That was really good, Kev.
Okay.
Here we go.
Okay?
Okay?
"E" is for elephant, large as a house, he's big as can be, not small like a mouse.
Can you say "Elephant, Kevin?
"Elephant"?
"Elephant".
Kevin!
Kevin?
Can you say "mommy" for me?
No!
- "Mommy"?
- No!
- Just say "mommy".
- No.
Trick or treat?
Trick or treat?
Hey lady.
We know you're in there.
I don't like that!
I don't like that!
I don't like that!
Mommy was happy before little Kevin came along.
Do you know that?
And now mommy wakes up every morning... and wishes she was in France!
That elevator is a death trap.
He needs a yard, somewhere he can toss a ball, fill a pool.
But I love New York.
Come on!
You sound like a bumper sticker.
It's a matter of priorities, Eva.
He's only gonna be a kid once.
You can house hunt all you want.
I'm telling you, I'm not leaving the city.
Kevin, stop that.
That's enough.
Let mommy and daddy talk.
Kevin, quit that!
You have your family room here.
Master bedroom is back there and two huge walk-in closets.
The bathroom is amazing.
Here we are, guys.
Our very own castle.
I'm gonna go and grab some lunch.
Does anybody want anything?
Hey!
Hey!
Wait up!
Mrs. K!
Hey!
It's me!
Soweto.
Hi there.
I just wanted to see how you were.
I'm fine.
Thanks.
You look well.
Yeah.
The doctors are saying there's a chance I might walk again.
That's great.
Well, you take care, Mrs. K.
You, too.
Come on, come on!
Die!
Die!
No!
No!
No!
- Die!
- How do you jump?
Die!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Die!
Hey Kev?
Are you out there?
Kevin?
Kevin, you hear that?
Dad goes pee pee.
You can do that too.
So you want a connector right there.
You see?
And click on that link and it should open right up.
And If it doesn't...
we'll try it again.
- So you left click.
Wanna give it a try?
- Sure.
- No, no.
- I'm sorry.
- Right click, right there.
- Yeah.
See that?
It comes up.
Right.
Yeah, thanks.
I think I got it.
Thank you for your help.
I pooped.
Hey buddy.
What?
You pooped?
Oh okay.
Here let me help you.
Okay.
Go to your room.
I'll be right there.
Let's not wake up mommy.
Go on!
Go on, buddy.
These squiggly squares of paper, they are dumb.
Everybody needs a room of their own.
You have your room.
This is the mama's room.
I can help you make your room special, if you'd like.
What do you mean, "special"?
Well, so it looks like your personality.
What personality?
I think you know what I mean.
They're dumb.
No, no, no.
I mean it's good.
You don't need me to do that?
And... and the guys...
Okay.
Well, I mean, if you have it in hand...
I could.
Really?
Well, that all sounds great.
Okay, John.
Okay.
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
Kevin?
Kevin?
What else do you have to say?
Go wash your face!
He said, he's really sorry.
And that he was only trying to help make it special.
Do you remember how you got that?
It's the most honest thing you ever did.
Do you know how they potty train cats?
They stick their noses in their own shit.
They don't like it.
So they use the box.
Okay.
Let's work on our counting.
- What comes after 3?
- 9.
- What comes after 7?
- 71.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,
41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.
Now, can we quit?
There.
You can add that together if you think you're so smart.
You did not...
You did not...
Are you enjoying yourself?
I can see the doctor by myself.
I have to tell you something, Eva.
It's a brave boy you've got there.
- Thank you.
- Anytime.
What mamma did was very, very wrong.
And she's so, so sorry.
Hey, Kev?
Kev, hold on a sec!
Kev?
Kevin?
Hey Kev.
What happened?
I broke my arm.
How did you brake your arm?
I had poopy pants.
Mommy went to get wipes.
I fell off the changing table onto my dump trucks.
Mom took me to doctor Goldbutt.
It's all my fault.
No, no, don't be silly.
You can't watch him every second of the day.
Franklin...
Unbelievable.
How did you get him to do that?
Well, whatever it was it worked.
Not yet.
Okay.
I love you, kiddo.
I don't like that.
Turn it off.
Honey.
Do you mind if we stop over at the store?
I wanna go home.
It's just that I need to pick up...
Home it is.
Hey, guys!
Hey, Dad!
How was work?
Did you take any cool pictures?
Eva, he's just a boy.
He's a sweet little boy.
That's what boys do.
Mom is fat!
When did you...
When were you gonna tell me?
Soon.
Now.
How am I part of the decision now?
What am I supposed to say now?
So, the daddy bear plants his seed in the mommy bear and it grows into an egg.
Is this about fucking?
Do you know what that means?
The boy puts his pee pee in the girl's doo doo.
Well...
Haven't you ever wished you had somebody else around to play with?
No.
You might like it.
What if I don't like it?
Then you get used to it.
Just because you're used to something... doesn't mean you like it.
You're used to me.
Yes, well...
In a few months we're all gonna get used to somebody new.
Beautiful.
Hey, Kev.
Come over and meet your little sister.
This is your brother.
It's Kevin.
It's your big brother.
Yes, yeah.
It's Kevin.
Yes, yes...
Kevin!
Don't do that.
No, Kevin.
That's not nice.
It's OK.
We're getting snacks, okay?
Come on.
Christ!
To Ecuador?
For 2 months?
Why can't you send someone else?
I really wanna work this deal.
First he cries too much, then he's too quiet.
Then he makes up his own little language, and it's annoying.
He has trouble toilet-training.
A lot of kids do.
And you see this as some kind of personal vendetta?
This is not good for him.
Franklin, pick up the god damn phone!
Pick up the god damn phone.
...13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 20, 21, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27...
Please!
Please!
Let me have a drink.
I'm begging you!
Pleeeease!
Kevin?
Kevin!
Honey?
Are you ok?
I'm sorry, mom.
Not to worry, sweetheart.
You couldn't help it.
"By my soul," cried Gilbert.
"Art thou the devil in blue, to shoot in that wise?"
"Nay," quoth Robin, laughing, "not quite so ill as that, I trust."
"And he took up another shaft... " Are you okay, honey?
"And he took up another shaft and fitted it to the string."
"Again he shot..."
"and again he smote the arrow close beside the center;"
"a third time he loosed his bowstring"
"and dropped his arrow just betwixt the other two"
"and into the very center,"
"so that the feathers of all three were ruffled together,"
"seeming from a distance to be one thick shaft."
"And now a low murmur ran all among that great crowd..."
Hey champ.
How are you doing?
Feeling better?
Go away.
I'm tired.
Oh.
Okay.
Sure thing, buddy.
You just get some rest, okay?
Don't stop reading, mom.
"Two hundred and eighty score shafts were shot in all,"
"and so deftly were they sped that when the shooting was done"
"each target looked like the back of a hedgehog"
"when the farm dog snuffs at it."
Good afternoon, ma'am.
I hope this isn't an inconvenient time.
Well, it is actually.
Well, we just have a couple of quick questions for you.
What's this about?
Do you know where you are spending the afterlife?
Oh, yes, I do as a matter of fact.
I'm going straight to hell.
Eternal damnation, the whole bit.
Thank you for asking.
Okay?
Hey, honey.
Let me help you with that.
I can dress myself.
Can you leave?
Sure.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
Do you want some more of that chowder for lunch?
Whatever.
- Or a grilled cheese sandwich?
- I don't give a rat's ass.
Thank you, dad, this is so cool!
You're welcome, buddy.
Right.
Here we go.
In the middle.
Ooooh.
Almost.
Here.
Take that one.
Try again.
Use your finger...
Keep your eyes in the middle.
Good shot, Kev.
You're a natural.
Perfect.
Thanks, dad.
Right.
It's like this.
You wake up.
Then you watch TV.
You get in the car, then you listen to the radio.
Then you go to you little job or your little school but we're not gonna hear about that on the 6 o'clock news.
Why?
Because nothing is really happening.
Then you go home and watch some more TV.
Or maybe it's a fun night, and you go out and you watch a movie.
I mean it's got so bad, that half the time the people on TV, inside the TV, they're watching TV.
And what are all these people watching?
People like me.
And what are all you doing right now but watching me?
You don't think they would have changed the channel by now if all I did was getting "A" in geometry?
Me and Kevin were playing "Christmas kidnapping".
Kevin!
Kevin, you're my friend!
You're my friend.
Beat it, Celia.
Get me a soda.
No, nott that one, you retard.
Get me a root beer.
- Hey!
What?
Thanks, Celia.
I was thirsty.
Hey, you wanne know a secret?
Come closer.
Do you know who else is thirsty?
You don't?
It's the vacuum monster.
Cut it out!
- Hey troops!
- Daddy!
Ho, ho, ho.
Look what I got!
Kev, come here.
Give me a hand.
Yeah, sure, dad.
- You wanna dance?
- No thanks, Harland.
- Come on.
Just one.
- I don't dance, really.
Where do you get off, you stuck up bitch?
Do you think anyone else is gonna want you now?
Come on.
Stay for another drink.
Come on.
Come on.
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.
Can we leave a carrot for the reindeer?
- We'll see.
- Yeah.
Kevin!
Didn't I see you at the bookstore today?
Nope.
Funny, I could have sworn.
By the way, are you doing anything on Friday?
Why?
I just thought we might do something together.
For fun.
Like, do what?
Maybe take you for dinner.
Or play around with miniature golf?
Okay.
Why didn't you bring a coat?
You just can't get uncomfortable enough, can you?
Uncomfortable?
With my own mother?
Whenever I see fat people, they are always eating.
Dont' give me any of this "slow metabolism, it's the glands" crap.
It's food.
They are fat because they eat the wrong food.
Too much of it, and all the time.
You know, you can be kind of harsh sometimes.
You're one to talk.
Yeah, I am.
I wonder where I got it.
Well, you won.
So.
What next, momsy?
We're gonna go home.
You're gonna get changed into something reasonable.
And I'm taking you to dinner.
Great.
We're going to dinner.
I was hungry.
I'm a growing boy, you know.
I'll have a... calorie salad, steak, medium rare, and a bottle of merlot.
All right.
So, how's school going?
It's going.
On a course schedule.
How about your teachers?
Are there any who are...
Right, what bands am I listening to these days?
Next you can weed all about whether there isn't some cute little cunt in the front row who's got me itchy.
That way you can segway into how it's all up to me, of course but before bailing the chick in the hallway, that I might decide to wait until I'm ready.
Right around dessert, you can ask about drugs.
Real careful, like cause you don't want to scare me into, like, lying my head off.
So you have to say how you've experimented.
Then finally once you've sucked up that entire bottle of wine, you can go all gooey-eyed and say how nice it is to spend quality time together, then scooch over and put your arm around my shoulder.
Give it a little squeeze.
Fuck!
- Your computer is fucked, isn't it?
- Yeah.
It's fucked.
And so are all the ones at work.
I guess I deserved it.
- Why would you let out something like that?
- I collect them.
Isn't that a weird thing to collect?
I don't like stamps.
But what is the point?
There is no point.
That's the point.
No, it really hasn't been any trouble at all.
Everybody is bringing a dish.
Oh!
That's them now.
I got to go.
OK, you have a great day.
Bye, mom.
Merry Christmas.
Alright, Kev.
You're next.
Can you guess what it is?
That's a series 7.
The guy in the store said it was the best one.
- Gee, dad.
Thank you so much.
- Merry Christmas.
- It's perfect.
What did you eat for breakfast?
How was your day, Snuffles?
Did you hear that thump?
That's a powerful thing, man.
Celia!
Come on, honey.
Time for bed.
Here we go.
I thought I closed the door.
Kevin said I'm stupid, and he's right.
You're not stupid, honey.
Don't you worry.
We'll find him.
Now you scoot down.
Come on.
Cozy?
I'm sure Snuffles has gone to the big pet store in the sky.
- Don't say that!
Don't say that!
- Yes.
It's the truth!
Dearly beloved,
We are gathered here to mourn Mr. Snuffles...
Stop it!
...who was snuffed out... tragically early.
So daddy and mommy were looking for him the whole night.
And you know why we couldn't find him?
Because Snuffles has gone to live in the garden.
He's living in the garden now, with a whole bunch of new animal friends.
Celia.
Okay, give me the spoon.
So, they're having a big party tonight... with the chipmunks, and the squarrels, and the racoons... and they're eating nuts, and berries, and they're gonna have a whole bunch...
Why did you leave the drain stuff out?
I didn't.
- I put it away!
- Then how did it get out?
Ask Kevin.
Kevin did it.
You need to go talk to someone.
Kev, mom had something that she wanted to tell you.
I wanted to... thank you for calling the ambulance.
And?
And...
I was concerned that you might be feeling responsible.
Why is that?
Because you was supposed to be looking after her.
We just don't want you to blame yourself.
No.
I don't...
I mean I...
I never said I did.
She's gonna need a glass eye, Kevin.
So, we would appreciate you looking after her, and any namecalling...
You don't really remember being a kid much do you, dad?
Celia is just gonna have to suck it up.
I thought you didn't like those.
Well, they're a...
Now what do you call it... an acquired taste.
I'm so sorry.
There you go.
Okay.
Thank you, mommy.
- Hey, kiddo.
Going to practice?
- Yeah, you know it.
- Hey, Celia, you wanna come collect arrows?
- No!
So...
What do you wanna do?
We'll last out the school year if we can and... make arrangements over the summer.
At least custody is a no-brainer.
Is it?
You've decided?
Eva, there's nothing left to decide.
It already happened.
- Needed a drink of water.
- Hey you, Kev.
Listen, buddy, it's easy to misunderstand something when you hear it out of context.
Why would I not know the "context"?
I am the context.
- You have to appeal.
- No.
But you'll lose everything, the business, your house.
I hate the house.
I always have.
You'll rot in hell!
A personal for Kevin Khatcha...
dourian?
- Careful, it's heavy.
- It is?
- Yeah.
- Have a nice day.
- You, too.
What are they for?
You never ride your bike.
I got these for a song of the web.
I'll make a bundle selling them at school.
Like Donald Trump, huh.
I'll take you back to my ship.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
Ready for the big dip?
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
I'm charmed to meet you, young lady
- Yeah.
- Yes, I did.
- Did you eat all your cereal?
-Yes, I did.
-Alright.
You're a little clammy.
Feeling okay?
Never better.
Hey, only three days to go till you're 16.
We should do something.
How about Sunday?
Don't know.
Might be tied up.
Come on, clean up some of this mess and then we're gonna get dressed and go.
I do not want to go to school.
I know, but daddy has to take a shower, we have to go.
Say goodbye!
Do you think we could make some time to talk later, just the two of us, without the kids?
I really wanna work this thing out.
Doesn't Kevin go to Gladstone High?
Franklin...
Pick up the god damn phone!
Franklin...
I have my son there.
Kevin?
Kevin!
Have you seen Kevin?
Kevin!
Kevin!
Lauren!
Franklin?
Celia?
Franklin?
Celia?
You don't look happy.
Have I ever?
I'm almost 18, aren't I?
What is it?
Going to the big school making you nervous?
Nervous?
Do you know anything about those places?
Well, you managed it all so well.
Tried as a minor.
Out of your head on prozac.
You'll be out of there in a couple years.
Do you know what day it is today?
Why the let me come see you on a Monday?
Sure.
It's my anniversary.
Two years.
Plenty of time to think about it.
I want you to tell me why.
Used to think I knew.
Now I'm not so sure.
Time's up.
We Need To Talk About Kevin
When you go to the ball... you have to learn how to dance like a princess, right?
1, 2, 3...
1, 2, 3...
- 1, 2, 3...
- Yeah!
What are you gonna wear today?
- I'm gonna wear...
- You're gonna wear...
- I'm gonna wear...
- A bucket on your head.
- No!
- 1, 2, 3...
No?
- And a barrel round your bottom.
- No!
- And cloth bags for shoes?
- Nooo!
1, 2, 3...
1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3...
1, 2, 3...
Good morning.
Hey buddy!
Want something to eat?
No.
I'm not hungry.
Yeah, that's fine.
Yeah.
Franklin?
Hey.
It's me.
I just wanted to leave a message.
Do you think we could make some time to talk later just the two of us, without the kids?
I really wanna work this thing out.
Okay?
I miss you.
Eva Khatchadourian!
It's a lot.
Look, Eva.
I don't really care who you are or what you've done so long as you can type and you can file.
You can have this job.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Thank you.
I wont let you down.
I promise you.
Thank you.
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.
See you Monday.
Great.
Thank you.
Looks like someone is having a nice day?
Enjoying yourself?
I'm sorry?
I hope you rot in hell, you fucking bitch!
Jesus.
What the hell was that?
Are you ok?
No, no, no, it's nothing.
Its really... its nothing.
- Let me call 911.
- No, no, it was my fault.
- But she just totally...
- No, no, I'm fine.
Eva, when are you coming home?
I miss you.
I love you.
Promise me you'll never go away again.
I will never, never, never go away again.
Promise me.
Promise me you'll never go away again.
Is it safe?
No, it's not safe.
Sure?
Are you sure about this?
This really happened?
I can see, I can feel it...
We did it.
I'm gonna need all these processed today, Eva.
Uh, but today my afternoon off.
You remember?
I told you.
Ah shit, that's right.
- Look, give these to Massughi.
- Sure.
- Hey, Eva.
- Hey, Al.
No, let go of me!
Let go of me, man!
- Get off me!
- Keep walking.
Hey lady!
Lady!
Lady!
Please help me!
I didn't do nothing, man!
Get off of me!
Eva, you can stop resisting.
Stop resisting, Eva.
Eva!
Rise and shine.
It's late, Eva.
The day is almost over.
- Hiii!
- Don't pick him up.
Please don't pick him up.
I just put him down, Franklin.
Hi.
There he is.
You wanna play?
You wanna play?
It's alright.
Just rock him a little bit.
He's alright.
Do you think I'm exaggerating?
You just have to rock him a little bit.
You just have to rock him a little bit.
There's my little dude!
Jesus!
All 12?
- I'll take them as they are.
- But they are totally broken...
I'll take them as they are!
You're gonna be a good looking boy.
All the girls are gonna love you.
I know it.
Don't wake up.
Don't wake up.
Can you say "mommy"?
"mom-my", "mommy", Kevin?
Can you say "ball"? "ball"?
"ba-", "ba-", "ba-".
"Ball"?
No?
Okay.
I'm gonna throw it to you, and you're gonna roll it back to me, okay?
Okay.
Roll it back to mommy.
Roll it back.
Roll.
Roll it back.
Okay, okay.
Roll it back, okay?
Roll it back.
Roll it back.
Roll it back.
When he was a baby, he never stopped screaming.
I thought maybe it had damaged his hearing.
No, his hearing is fine.
But shouldn't he be talking by now?
I read somewhere that non-verbalizing was the... an early sign of autism.
He has none of the tell-tale rocking signs.
I wouldn't worry about it too much.
He's a fluffy little boy, isn't he?
But there is nothing wrong with him.
Thank you.
Okay.
Roll it back to mommy.
Okay.
Gonna roll it back again.
That was really good, Kev.
Okay.
Here we go.
Okay?
Okay?
"E" is for elephant, large as a house, he's big as can be, not small like a mouse.
Can you say "Elephant, Kevin?
"Elephant"?
"Elephant".
Kevin!
Kevin?
Can you say "mommy" for me?
No!
- "Mommy"?
- No!
- Just say "mommy".
- No.
Trick or treat?
Trick or treat?
Hey lady.
We know you're in there.
I don't like that!
I don't like that!
I don't like that!
Mommy was happy before little Kevin came along.
Do you know that?
And now mommy wakes up every morning... and wishes she was in France!
That elevator is a death trap.
He needs a yard, somewhere he can toss a ball, fill a pool.
But I love New York.
Come on!
You sound like a bumper sticker.
It's a matter of priorities, Eva.
He's only gonna be a kid once.
You can house hunt all you want.
I'm telling you, I'm not leaving the city.
Kevin, stop that.
That's enough.
Let mommy and daddy talk.
Kevin, quit that!
You have your family room here.
Master bedroom is back there and two huge walk-in closets.
The bathroom is amazing.
Here we are, guys.
Our very own castle.
I'm gonna go and grab some lunch.
Does anybody want anything?
Hey!
Hey!
Wait up!
Mrs. K!
Hey!
It's me!
Soweto.
Hi there.
I just wanted to see how you were.
I'm fine.
Thanks.
You look well.
Yeah.
The doctors are saying there's a chance I might walk again.
That's great.
Well, you take care, Mrs. K.
You, too.
Come on, come on!
Die!
Die!
No!
No!
No!
- Die!
- How do you jump?
Die!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Die!
Hey Kev?
Are you out there?
Kevin?
Kevin, you hear that?
Dad goes pee pee.
You can do that too.
So you want a connector right there.
You see?
And click on that link and it should open right up.
And If it doesn't...
we'll try it again.
- So you left click.
Wanna give it a try?
- Sure.
- No, no.
- I'm sorry.
- Right click, right there.
- Yeah.
See that?
It comes up.
Right.
Yeah, thanks.
I think I got it.
Thank you for your help.
I pooped.
Hey buddy.
What?
You pooped?
Oh okay.
Here let me help you.
Okay.
Go to your room.
I'll be right there.
Let's not wake up mommy.
Go on!
Go on, buddy.
These squiggly squares of paper, they are dumb.
Everybody needs a room of their own.
You have your room.
This is the mama's room.
I can help you make your room special, if you'd like.
What do you mean, "special"?
Well, so it looks like your personality.
What personality?
I think you know what I mean.
They're dumb.
No, no, no.
I mean it's good.
You don't need me to do that?
And... and the guys...
Okay.
Well, I mean, if you have it in hand...
I could.
Really?
Well, that all sounds great.
Okay, John.
Okay.
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
Kevin?
Kevin?
What else do you have to say?
Go wash your face!
He said, he's really sorry.
And that he was only trying to help make it special.
Do you remember how you got that?
It's the most honest thing you ever did.
Do you know how they potty train cats?
They stick their noses in their own shit.
They don't like it.
So they use the box.
Okay.
Let's work on our counting.
- What comes after 3?
- 9.
- What comes after 7?
- 71.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,
41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.
Now, can we quit?
There.
You can add that together if you think you're so smart.
You did not...
You did not...
Are you enjoying yourself?
I can see the doctor by myself.
I have to tell you something, Eva.
It's a brave boy you've got there.
- Thank you.
- Anytime.
What mamma did was very, very wrong.
And she's so, so sorry.
Hey, Kev?
Kev, hold on a sec!
Kev?
Kevin?
Hey Kev.
What happened?
I broke my arm.
How did you brake your arm?
I had poopy pants.
Mommy went to get wipes.
I fell off the changing table onto my dump trucks.
Mom took me to doctor Goldbutt.
It's all my fault.
No, no, don't be silly.
You can't watch him every second of the day.
Franklin...
Unbelievable.
How did you get him to do that?
Well, whatever it was it worked.
Not yet.
Okay.
I love you, kiddo.
I don't like that.
Turn it off.
Honey.
Do you mind if we stop over at the store?
I wanna go home.
It's just that I need to pick up...
Home it is.
Hey, guys!
Hey, Dad!
How was work?
Did you take any cool pictures?
Eva, he's just a boy.
He's a sweet little boy.
That's what boys do.
Mom is fat!
When did you...
When were you gonna tell me?
Soon.
Now.
How am I part of the decision now?
What am I supposed to say now?
So, the daddy bear plants his seed in the mommy bear and it grows into an egg.
Is this about fucking?
Do you know what that means?
The boy puts his pee pee in the girl's doo doo.
Well...
Haven't you ever wished you had somebody else around to play with?
No.
You might like it.
What if I don't like it?
Then you get used to it.
Just because you're used to something... doesn't mean you like it.
You're used to me.
Yes, well...
In a few months we're all gonna get used to somebody new.
Beautiful.
Hey, Kev.
Come over and meet your little sister.
This is your brother.
It's Kevin.
It's your big brother.
Yes, yeah.
It's Kevin.
Yes, yes...
Kevin!
Don't do that.
No, Kevin.
That's not nice.
It's OK.
We're getting snacks, okay?
Come on.
Christ!
To Ecuador?
For 2 months?
Why can't you send someone else?
I really wanna work this deal.
First he cries too much, then he's too quiet.
Then he makes up his own little language, and it's annoying.
He has trouble toilet-training.
A lot of kids do.
And you see this as some kind of personal vendetta?
This is not good for him.
Franklin, pick up the god damn phone!
Pick up the god damn phone.
...13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 20, 21, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27...
Please!
Please!
Let me have a drink.
I'm begging you!
Pleeeease!
Kevin?
Kevin!
Honey?
Are you ok?
I'm sorry, mom.
Not to worry, sweetheart.
You couldn't help it.
"By my soul," cried Gilbert.
"Art thou the devil in blue, to shoot in that wise?"
"Nay," quoth Robin, laughing, "not quite so ill as that, I trust."
"And he took up another shaft... " Are you okay, honey?
"And he took up another shaft and fitted it to the string."
"Again he shot..."
"and again he smote the arrow close beside the center;"
"a third time he loosed his bowstring"
"and dropped his arrow just betwixt the other two"
"and into the very center,"
"so that the feathers of all three were ruffled together,"
"seeming from a distance to be one thick shaft."
"And now a low murmur ran all among that great crowd..."
Hey champ.
How are you doing?
Feeling better?
Go away.
I'm tired.
Oh.
Okay.
Sure thing, buddy.
You just get some rest, okay?
Don't stop reading, mom.
"Two hundred and eighty score shafts were shot in all,"
"and so deftly were they sped that when the shooting was done"
"each target looked like the back of a hedgehog"
"when the farm dog snuffs at it."
Good afternoon, ma'am.
I hope this isn't an inconvenient time.
Well, it is actually.
Well, we just have a couple of quick questions for you.
What's this about?
Do you know where you are spending the afterlife?
Oh, yes, I do as a matter of fact.
I'm going straight to hell.
Eternal damnation, the whole bit.
Thank you for asking.
Okay?
Hey, honey.
Let me help you with that.
I can dress myself.
Can you leave?
Sure.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
Do you want some more of that chowder for lunch?
Whatever.
- Or a grilled cheese sandwich?
- I don't give a rat's ass.
Thank you, dad, this is so cool!
You're welcome, buddy.
Right.
Here we go.
In the middle.
Ooooh.
Almost.
Here.
Take that one.
Try again.
Use your finger...
Keep your eyes in the middle.
Good shot, Kev.
You're a natural.
Perfect.
Thanks, dad.
Right.
It's like this.
You wake up.
Then you watch TV.
You get in the car, then you listen to the radio.
Then you go to you little job or your little school but we're not gonna hear about that on the 6 o'clock news.
Why?
Because nothing is really happening.
Then you go home and watch some more TV.
Or maybe it's a fun night, and you go out and you watch a movie.
I mean it's got so bad, that half the time the people on TV, inside the TV, they're watching TV.
And what are all these people watching?
People like me.
And what are all you doing right now but watching me?
You don't think they would have changed the channel by now if all I did was getting "A" in geometry?
Me and Kevin were playing "Christmas kidnapping".
Kevin!
Kevin, you're my friend!
You're my friend.
Beat it, Celia.
Get me a soda.
No, nott that one, you retard.
Get me a root beer.
- Hey!
What?
Thanks, Celia.
I was thirsty.
Hey, you wanne know a secret?
Come closer.
Do you know who else is thirsty?
You don't?
It's the vacuum monster.
Cut it out!
- Hey troops!
- Daddy!
Ho, ho, ho.
Look what I got!
Kev, come here.
Give me a hand.
Yeah, sure, dad.
- You wanna dance?
- No thanks, Harland.
- Come on.
Just one.
- I don't dance, really.
Where do you get off, you stuck up bitch?
Do you think anyone else is gonna want you now?
Come on.
Stay for another drink.
Come on.
Come on.
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.
Can we leave a carrot for the reindeer?
- We'll see.
- Yeah.
Kevin!
Didn't I see you at the bookstore today?
Nope.
Funny, I could have sworn.
By the way, are you doing anything on Friday?
Why?
I just thought we might do something together.
For fun.
Like, do what?
Maybe take you for dinner.
Or play around with miniature golf?
Okay.
Why didn't you bring a coat?
You just can't get uncomfortable enough, can you?
Uncomfortable?
With my own mother?
Whenever I see fat people, they are always eating.
Dont' give me any of this "slow metabolism, it's the glands" crap.
It's food.
They are fat because they eat the wrong food.
Too much of it, and all the time.
You know, you can be kind of harsh sometimes.
You're one to talk.
Yeah, I am.
I wonder where I got it.
Well, you won.
So.
What next, momsy?
We're gonna go home.
You're gonna get changed into something reasonable.
And I'm taking you to dinner.
Great.
We're going to dinner.
I was hungry.
I'm a growing boy, you know.
I'll have a... calorie salad, steak, medium rare, and a bottle of merlot.
All right.
So, how's school going?
It's going.
On a course schedule.
How about your teachers?
Are there any who are...
Right, what bands am I listening to these days?
Next you can weed all about whether there isn't some cute little cunt in the front row who's got me itchy.
That way you can segway into how it's all up to me, of course but before bailing the chick in the hallway, that I might decide to wait until I'm ready.
Right around dessert, you can ask about drugs.
Real careful, like cause you don't want to scare me into, like, lying my head off.
So you have to say how you've experimented.
Then finally once you've sucked up that entire bottle of wine, you can go all gooey-eyed and say how nice it is to spend quality time together, then scooch over and put your arm around my shoulder.
Give it a little squeeze.
Fuck!
- Your computer is fucked, isn't it?
- Yeah.
It's fucked.
And so are all the ones at work.
I guess I deserved it.
- Why would you let out something like that?
- I collect them.
Isn't that a weird thing to collect?
I don't like stamps.
But what is the point?
There is no point.
That's the point.
No, it really hasn't been any trouble at all.
Everybody is bringing a dish.
Oh!
That's them now.
I got to go.
OK, you have a great day.
Bye, mom.
Merry Christmas.
Alright, Kev.
You're next.
Can you guess what it is?
That's a series 7.
The guy in the store said it was the best one.
- Gee, dad.
Thank you so much.
- Merry Christmas.
- It's perfect.
What did you eat for breakfast?
How was your day, Snuffles?
Did you hear that thump?
That's a powerful thing, man.
Celia!
Come on, honey.
Time for bed.
Here we go.
I thought I closed the door.
Kevin said I'm stupid, and he's right.
You're not stupid, honey.
Don't you worry.
We'll find him.
Now you scoot down.
Come on.
Cozy?
I'm sure Snuffles has gone to the big pet store in the sky.
- Don't say that!
Don't say that!
- Yes.
It's the truth!
Dearly beloved,
We are gathered here to mourn Mr. Snuffles...
Stop it!
...who was snuffed out... tragically early.
So daddy and mommy were looking for him the whole night.
And you know why we couldn't find him?
Because Snuffles has gone to live in the garden.
He's living in the garden now, with a whole bunch of new animal friends.
Celia.
Okay, give me the spoon.
So, they're having a big party tonight... with the chipmunks, and the squarrels, and the racoons... and they're eating nuts, and berries, and they're gonna have a whole bunch...
Why did you leave the drain stuff out?
I didn't.
- I put it away!
- Then how did it get out?
Ask Kevin.
Kevin did it.
You need to go talk to someone.
Kev, mom had something that she wanted to tell you.
I wanted to... thank you for calling the ambulance.
And?
And...
I was concerned that you might be feeling responsible.
Why is that?
Because you was supposed to be looking after her.
We just don't want you to blame yourself.
No.
I don't...
I mean I...
I never said I did.
She's gonna need a glass eye, Kevin.
So, we would appreciate you looking after her, and any namecalling...
You don't really remember being a kid much do you, dad?
Celia is just gonna have to suck it up.
I thought you didn't like those.
Well, they're a...
Now what do you call it... an acquired taste.
I'm so sorry.
There you go.
Okay.
Thank you, mommy.
- Hey, kiddo.
Going to practice?
- Yeah, you know it.
- Hey, Celia, you wanna come collect arrows?
- No!
So...
What do you wanna do?
We'll last out the school year if we can and... make arrangements over the summer.
At least custody is a no-brainer.
Is it?
You've decided?
Eva, there's nothing left to decide.
It already happened.
- Needed a drink of water.
- Hey you, Kev.
Listen, buddy, it's easy to misunderstand something when you hear it out of context.
Why would I not know the "context"?
I am the context.
- You have to appeal.
- No.
But you'll lose everything, the business, your house.
I hate the house.
I always have.
You'll rot in hell!
A personal for Kevin Khatcha...
dourian?
- Careful, it's heavy.
- It is?
- Yeah.
- Have a nice day.
- You, too.
What are they for?
You never ride your bike.
I got these for a song of the web.
I'll make a bundle selling them at school.
Like Donald Trump, huh.
I'll take you back to my ship.

I'm charmed to meet you, young lady
- Yeah.
- Yes, I did.
- Did you eat all your cereal?
-Yes, I did.
-Alright.
You're a little clammy.
Feeling okay?
Never better.
Hey, only three days to go till you're 16.
We should do something.
How about Sunday?
Don't know.
Might be tied up.
Come on, clean up some of this mess and then we're gonna get dressed and go.
I do not want to go to school.
I know, but daddy has to take a shower, we have to go.
Say goodbye!
Do you think we could make some time to talk later, just the two of us, without the kids?
I really wanna work this thing out.
Doesn't Kevin go to Gladstone High?
Franklin...
Pick up the god damn phone!
Franklin...
I have my son there.
Kevin?
Kevin!
Have you seen Kevin?
Kevin!
Kevin!
Lauren!
Franklin?
Celia?
Franklin?
Celia?
You don't look happy.
Have I ever?
I'm almost 18, aren't I?
What is it?
Going to the big school making you nervous?
Nervous?
Do you know anything about those places?
Well, you managed it all so well.
Tried as a minor.
Out of your head on prozac.
You'll be out of there in a couple years.
Do you know what day it is today?
Why the let me come see you on a Monday?
Sure.
It's my anniversary.
Two years.
Plenty of time to think about it.
I want you to tell me why.
Used to think I knew.
Now I'm not so sure.
Time's up.
Come on, come on.
Go.
Push.
I'm getting ready for the party La, la, la-la la
Better bring my daughter La, la, la-la, la
If you're gonna go to the ball, you have to know how to dance like a princess.
One, two, three.

What are you gonna wear today?
- I'm gonna wear...
- You're gonna wear...
- I'm gonna wear...
- A bucket on your head?
No!
No?
- And a barrel around your body.
- No!
And scrub brushes for your shoes.
- No!
- One, two, three...
Ah!
One, two, three...
Arf, arf, arf, arf-arf.
Arf, arf, arf...
- Good morning.

No, I'm not hungry.

Roll it back.
Roll it back to Mommy.
OK.

Roll it back, OK?
Just roll it back.
Just roll it.
When he was a baby, he never stopped screaming, and I thought maybe it had damaged his hearing.
No, his hearing's fine.
But shouldn't he be talking by now?
I read somewhere that non-verbalising was an early sign of autism.
He has none of the tell-tale rocking signs.
I wouldn't worry about it too much.
He's a floppy little boy, isn't he?
But there's nothing wrong with him.
Thank you.
OK.
Roll it back to Mommy.
Oh!
Whoa!
Yay!
Yay!
OK.
Gonna roll it back again.
That was really good, Kev.
OK, here we go.
OK?
OK?

Kevin, stop that.
That's enough.
Let Mom and Daddy talk.
- Neh, neh-neh, ner.
- Kevin, quit that!
'You got a family room here.'
'Master bedroom's back there with two huge walk-in closets.'
'The bathroom is amazing.'
Here we are, guys.
Our very own castle.
I'm gonna go and grab some lunch.
Does anybody want anything?
Hey?
Hey, wait up.
Mrs K!
Hey.
It's me.
Soweto.
Hi there.
I just wanted to see how you were.
I'm fine.
Thanks.
- You look well.
- Yeah.
The doctors are saying there's a chance I might walk again.
That's great.
Well, you take care, Mrs K.
You too.
Come on, come on!
Die, die, die!
Ah!
No, no, no!
- No, no, no, no.
- Got him!
- How do you jump?
- Die!
Aargh!
Go, go, go, go!
Die!
Kev, you up there?
Kevin?
Kev, you in there?
Let Daddy go pee-pee.
In the pooper-dooper.

See, you wanna kind of...
go right there.
- Oh!
- See?
Click on that link and it should open right up.
And if it doesn't...
Well, try it again.
- So left click.
Wanna give it a try?
- Sure.
- No, no.
- Sorry.
- You wanna right click, right there.
- Yeah.
OK.
- See, it opens up.
Right there.
- Great.
Yeah, thanks.
I think I got it.
Thanks for your help.
- I pooped.
- Oh!
Hey, buddy.
What?
You pooped?
Oh, OK.
Well, let me help you.
Here...
Wait a minute, OK.
Here, erm... go to your room.
I'll be right there.
Let's not wake up Mommy.
Go on.
Go on, buddy.
These squiggly squares of paper...
they're dumb.
Everybody needs a room of their own.
You have your room.
This is Mommer's room.
I can help you make your room special if you like.
What do you mean, "special"?
Well, so it looks like your personality.
What personality?
I think you know what I mean.
They're dumb.
No, no, no.
I mean, it's good.
You don't need me to do that?
And...
And the guide...?
OK.
Well, I mean, if you have it in hand...
I could?
Really?
Well, that all sounds great.
OK, John.
OK?
I'll talk to you later.
OK, bye.
Kevin?
Kevin?
What else do you have to say?
Go wash your face and hands.
He says he's really sorry and that he was only trying to help make it special.
Do you remember how you got that?
The most honest thing you ever did.
You know how they potty train cats?
They stick their noses in their own shit.
They don't like it, so they use the box.
OK.
Let's work on our counting.
What comes after three?
Nine.
- What comes after seven?
- 71.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,

41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.
Now can we quit?
There, you can add that together, since you think you're so smart.
You did not?
You did not.
Oh!
Are you enjoying yourself?
'I can see the doctor by myself.'
I have to tell you something, Eva.
That's a brave boy you've got there.
- Thank you.
- Anytime.
What Mommer did was very, very wrong and she's so, so sorry.
Hey, Kev?
Kev, hold on a sec!
Kev!
Kevin.
Hey, Kev.
What happened?
- I broke my arm.
- How did you break your arm?
I had poopy pants.
Mommer went to get wipes.
I fell off the changing table onto my dump truck.
Mom took me to Doctor Goldblatt.
It was all my fault.
No, no, don't be silly.
You can't watch him every second of the day.
Franklin...
Unbelievable.
How did you get him to do that?
Well, whatever it was, it worked.
Not yet.
OK.
- I love you, kiddo.
- Nya-na-na-naah!
I don't like that.
Turn it off.
Honey, do you mind if I stop off at the store?
I wanna go home.
It's just that I need to pick up...
Home it is.
Hey, guys!
Hey, Dad, how was work?
Take any cool pictures?
Eva, he's just a boy.
He's a sweet little boy.
That's what boys do.
Mommer's fat!
When did you...?
When were you gonna tell me?
Soon.
Now.
How am I a part of the decision now?
What am I supposed to say now?
So the daddy bear plants his seed in the mommy bear and it grows into an egg.
Is this about fucking?
Do you know what that means?
The boy puts his pee-pee in the girl's doo-doo.
Well, haven't you ever wished you had somebody else around to play with?
No.
- You might like it.
- What if I don't like it?
Then you get used to it.
Just because you're used to something doesn't mean you like it.
You're used to me.
Yes, well, in a few months, we're all gonna get used to somebody new.
Beautiful.
Hey, Kev, come on over here and meet your little sister.
Here's your big brother.
That's Kevin.
Oh, that's your big brother.
Yes.
Yeah.
It's Kevin.
It is.
It is...
Kevin, don't.
Don't do that.
No.
That's not nice.
We'd better go downstairs and see if they have any snacks, OK?
We'll get us some Cheez Doodles.
'Christ!
Ecuador?
For two months?
'
'Why can't you send someone else?
'
'I really wanna work this thing out.'
'First he cries too much.
Then he's too quiet.'
'Then he makes up his own little language and it's annoying.'
'Then he has trouble toilet training, a lot of kids do.'
'And you see it as a personal vendetta.
This is not good for him.'
'Franklin, pick up the goddamned phone!
'
'Pick up the goddamned phone!

La, la, la-la-la Rah!
Please, please.
Oh, please, let me have a drink.
I'm begging you.
Please!
Kevin?
Kevin!
Honey?
Are you OK?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Not to worry, sweetheart.
You couldn't help it.
"By my soul," cried Gilbert,
"art thou the Devil in blue to shoot him that wise?"
"Nay, ' quoth Robin, laughing.
'Not quite so ill as that I trust."
"And he took up another shaft..." Are you OK, hon?
"And he took up another shaft and fitted it to the string."
"Again he shot and again he smote the arrow close beside the centre."
"A third time he loosed his bowstring and dropped his arrow"
"just betwixt the other two and into the very centre,"
"so that the feathers of all three were ruffled together,"
"seeming from a distance to be one thick shaft."
"And now a low murmur ran all among that great crowd."
Hey, champ, how you doing?
Feeling better?
Go away, I'm tired.
Oh?
OK.
Sure thing, buddy.
You just get some rest, OK?
Don't stop reading, Mom.
"280 score shafts were shot in all,"
"and so deftly were they sped that when the shooting was done,"
"each target looked like the back of a hedgehog"

[♪ WASHINGTON PHILLIPS:
"Mother's Last Word To Her Son"]
I never can forget the day
When my dear mother did sweetly say
"You are leaving, my darling boy"
"You always have been your mother's joy"
Good afternoon, ma'am.
I hope this isn't an inconvenient time?
Well, it is, actually.
Well, we just had a couple of quick questions for you.
What's this about?
Do you know where you're spending the afterlife?
Oh, yes, I do, as a matter of fact.
I'm going straight to hell.
Eternal damnation.
The whole bit.
Thank you for asking.
OK?
Honey, let me help you with that.
I can dress myself.
Can you leave?
Sure.
Glad you're feeling better.
You want some more of that chowder for lunch?
Whatever.
- Or a grilled cheese sandwich?
- I don't give a rat's ass.
- Thanks, Dad.
This is so cool.
- You're welcome, buddy.
All right, here we go.
Right in the middle.
Oh, almost!
Here, use that one.
Let's try again.
Gotta use your fingers and just keep your eye on the middle.
I never can forget the day
When my dear mother did sweetly say
"You are leaving, my darling boy"
"You always have been your mother's joy"
Now as you leave this world to roam
You may not be able to get back home
But remember Jesus who lives on high
Is watching over you with a mighty eye
The world is so full of old sin and woe
And many sorrows everywhere you go
But remember Jesus...
Good shot, Kev.
You're a natural.
Perfect.
Thanks, Dad.
Saving grace now and you have a burden
He'll make them light and He sure will guide you
All in the right
'All right.
It's like this.'
'You wake up and you watch TV.'
'Get in your car, and you listen to the radio.'
'And you go to your little job or your little school, ' 'but you're not going to hear about that on the six o'clock news.'
'Why?
'
'Because nothing is really happening.'
'Then you go home and you watch some more TV.'
'Or maybe, if it's a fun night, you go out and you watch a movie.'
I mean, it's got so bad that half the time the people on TV, inside the TV, they're watching TV.
And what are all these people watching?
Huh?
People like me.
'I mean, what are all you doing right now but watching me?
'
'You don't think they'd have changed the channel by now' 'if all I did was get an A in geometry?
'
Once in royal David's city
Stood a lowly cattle shed
Where a mother laid her baby
In a manger for his bed
Mary was that mother mild
Jesus Christ, her little child...
Me and Kevin were playing Christmas kidnapping.
Kevin!
Kevin, you're my friend!
You're my friend.
Beat it, Celie.
Go get me a soda.
No, not that one, you retard.
Get me a root beer.
- Hey!
- What?
Thanks, Celie.
I was thirsty.
Hey, you wanna know a secret?
Come really close.
You know who else is thirsty?
You don't?
Ah!
Ow, Mommy!
It's the vacuum monster!
Cut it out!
- Hey, troops!
- Daddy!
Ho, ho, ho!
Look what I got!
- Hey, Kev, give me a hand.
- Yeah, sure, Dad.
Oh.
[♪ WHAM!
: "Last Christmas"]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special...
We're gonna be talking about it next Monday!
Wanna dance?
No, thanks, Colin.
Come on.
Just one.
I don't dance.
Really.
Where do you get off, you stuck-up bitch?
You think anyone else is gonna want you now?
Hmm?
Come on, Eva, stay for another drink.
Eva, come on.
Oh, come on.
Come on, dance with me!
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.
Can we leave a carrot for the reindeer?
- Yes.
We'll see.
- Yeah.
- Ah, do
- Ah, do
- Ah, do
- Ah, do-doo-doo
- Ah, do
- Ah, do
- Ah, do
- Ah, do...
Kevin!
Didn't I see you at the book store today?
Nope.
Funny, I could've sworn...
By the way, are you doing anything Friday?
Why?
Just thought we might do something together, for fun.
Like do what?
Maybe take you for dinner?
Play a round of miniature golf.
OK.
Why didn't you bring a coat?
You just can't get uncomfortable enough, can you?
Uncomfortable?
With my own mother?
Whenever I see fat people, they're always eating.
Don't give me any of this "slow metabolism", "it's my glands" crap.
It's food.
They're fat because they eat the wrong food.
Too much of it and all the time.
You know, you can be kind of harsh sometimes.
You're one to talk.
Yeah, I am.
Wonder where I got it?
Well, you won.
So, what next, Mumsy?
We're gonna go home, you're gonna get changed into something reasonable and I'm taking you to dinner.
Great.
We're going to dinner.
I was hungry.
I'm a growing boy, you know.
I'll have er calamari salad, er... steak, medium rare, and a bottle of Merlot.
All right.
Be right back with that.
So, how's school going?
It's going.
Do you want my course schedule?
How about your teachers?
Are there any who are...?
What bands am I listening to these days, right?
Next, you can wheedle about whether there isn't some cute little cunt in the front row who's got me itchy.
That way, you can segue into how it's all up to me, of course, but before bailing the chick in the hallway,
I might decide to wait until I'm ready.
Right around dessert, you can ask about drugs.
Real careful, cos you don't want to scare me into lying my head off.
So you have to say how you've experimented.
Then once you've sucked up that entire bottle of wine, you can go all gooey-eyed and say how nice it is to spend quality time together.
You can scooch over and put your arm around my shoulder, give it a little squeeze.
[♪THE BEACH BOYS:
"In My Room"]
There's a world where I can go
And tell my secrets to
In my room...
In this world I lock out all my worries and my fears
In my room...
Do my dreaming and my scheming
Lie awake and pray
Do my crying and my sighing
Laugh at yesterday...
Fuck.
Your computer's fucked, isn't it?
Yeah, it's fucked, and so are all the ones at work.
I guess I deserved it.
Why would you have something like that?
I collect them.
Isn't that a weird thing to collect?
I don't like stamps.
But what's the point?
There is no point.
That's the point.
No, it really hasn't been any trouble at all.
Everybody's bringing a dish.
Mm-hm.
Oh, that's them now.
I gotta go.
OK, you have a great day.
Bye, Mom.
Merry Christmas.
'All right, Kev, you're next.'
Can you guess what it is?
It's a Series-7.
The guy in the store said it was the best one.
Gee, Dad.
Thank you so much.
- Merry Christmas.
- It's perfect.
Sorry.
What did you eat for breakfast?
Raow-raow!
How was your day, Snuffles?
Oh, yeah!
Did you hear that "thunk"?
That's a powerful thing, man.
Celie?
Come on, honey.
Time for bed.
There we go.
I thought I closed the door.
Kevin says I'm stupid, and he's right.
You're not stupid, honey.
Don't you worry, we'll find him.
Now you scoot down.
Come on.
Scoot down.
OK.
You cosy?
- Snuffles?
- Snuffles?
Eva... face it.
Mr Snuffles has gone to the big pet store in the sky.
- Don't say that.
Don't say that!
- Yes, but it's true.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to mourn Mr Snuffles.
Stop it, stop it!
Who was snuffed out...
tragically early!
So Daddy and Mommy were looking for him the whole night.
And you know why we couldn't find him?
Because Snuffles has gone to live in the garden.
He's living in the garden now, with a whole bunch of new animal friends.
Celie?
OK, give me the spoon.
So they're having a big party tonight with the chipmunks and the squirrels, and the raccoons.
And they're eating nuts and berries, and they're gonna have a whole bunch...
Urgh!
Wh...
Why did you leave the drain stuff out?
I didn't.
I put it away.
Then how did it get out?
It was Kevin.
Kevin did it.
You need to go talk to someone.
So, Kev, erm...
Mom had something that she wanted to tell you.
I wanted to... thank you for calling the ambulance.
Hmm.
And?
And I was concerned that you might be feeling responsible.
Why's that?
Because you were supposed to be looking after her.
We just don't want you to blame yourself.
No, I don't.
I mean, I never said I did.
She's gonna need a glass eye, Kevin.
So we would appreciate you looking out for her.
Any name calling...
You don't really remember being a kid much, do you, Dad?
Celia's just gonna have to suck it up.
I thought you didn't like those.
Yeah, well, they're...
What do you call it?
An acquired taste.
Sorry, honey.
I'm so sorry.
There you go.
OK.
Thank you, Mommy.
Hey, kiddo.
More practice?
Yeah, you know it.
Hey, Celie, you want to come collect arrows?
No!
Thanks, sweetie.
So... what do you want to do?
We'll last out the school year if we can, and make arrangements over the summer.
At least custody is a no-brainer.
Is it?
You've decided.
Eva, there's nothing left to decide.
It already happened.
I needed a drink of water.
Hey, Kev.
Listen, buddy, it's easy to misunderstand something when you hear it out of context.
Why would I not know the context?
I am the context.
You have to appeal.
Paying costs is punitive.
- No.
- You'll lose your business, your house.
I hate the house.
I always have.
Run, bitch!
You rot in hell!
- Hey.
- Parcel for Kevin Khatcha... dourian?
Dourian, right.
Careful, it's heavy.
- It is?
- Yeah.
- You have a nice day.
- You too.
What are they for?
You never ride your bike.
I got these for a song off the web.
I'm gonna make a bundle selling them at school.
Next Donald Trump, huh?
Come with me.
Come with me.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
I'll take you back to my ship.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three!
One, two, three...
- Ready for the big dip?
- Ah!
One, two, three.
One, two, three...
Enchanted to meet you, young lady.
'Did you eat all your cereal?
' 'Yes, I did.'
'All right.
You can have some toast.'
You're a little clammy.
You feeling OK?
Never better.
Hey, only three days to go till you're 16, huh?
We should do something.
How about Sunday?
Dunno.
Might be tied up.
Clean up some of this mess, and then get dressed and go.
- I don't wanna go to school.
- I know.
But Daddy has to take a shower, and we have to go.
Say goodbye.
'Franklin?
Do you think we could make some time to talk later.'
'Just the two of us without the kids?
I really wanna work this thing out.'
Doesn't Kevin go to Gladstone High?
'Franklin.
Pick up the goddamned phone!

'Franklin!

"Nobody's Child"]
As I was slowly passing
An orphan's home one day
I stopped for just a little while
To watch the children play
Alone a boy was standing
And when I asked him why
He turned with eyes that could not see
And he began to cry
"I'm nobody's child"
"I'm nobody's child"
"Just like a flower"
"I'm growing wild"
"I got no mommy's kisses"
"I got no daddy's smile"
Oh, nobody wants me...
You don't look happy.
Have I ever?
I'm almost 18, aren't I?
What is it?
Going to big school making you nervous?
Nervous?
Do you know anything about those places?
Well... you managed it all so well.
Tried as a minor, out of your head on Prozac.
You'll be out of there in a couple of years.
Know what day it is today?
Why they let me come and see you on a Monday?
Sure.
It's my anniversary.
Two years.
Plenty of time to think about it.
I want you to tell me... why.
I used to think I knew.
Now I'm not so sure.

No.
I'm not hungry.
Yeah, that's fine.
Yeah.

I just wanted to leave a message.
Do you think we could make some time to talk later just the two of us, without the kids?
I really wanna work this thing out.
Okay?
I miss you.
Eva Khatchadourian!
It's a lot.
Look, Eva.
I don't really care who you are or what you've done so long as you can type and you can file.
You can have this job.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Thank you.
I wont let you down.
I promise you.
Thank you.
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.
See you Monday.
Great.
Thank you.
Looks like someone is having a nice day?
Enjoying yourself?
I'm sorry?
I hope you rot in hell, you fucking bitch!

What the hell was that?
Are you ok?
No, no, no, it's nothing.
Its really... its nothing.
- Let me call 911.
- No, no, it was my fault.
- But she just totally...
- No, no, I'm fine.

I miss you.
I love you.
Promise me you'll never go away again.
I will never, never, never go away again.
Promise me.
Promise me you'll never go away again.
Is it safe?
No, it's not safe.
Sure?
Are you sure about this?
This really happened?
I can see, I can feel it...
We did it.
I'm gonna need all these processed today, Eva.
Uh, but today my afternoon off.
You remember?
I told you.
Ah shit, that's right.
- Look, give these to Massughi.
- Sure.
- Hey, Eva.
- Hey, Al.
No, let go of me!
Let go of me, man!
- Get off me!
- Keep walking.

Rise and shine.

- Hiii!
- Don't pick him up.
Please don't pick him up.
I just put him down, Franklin.
Hi.
There he is.
You wanna play?
You wanna play?
It's alright.
Just rock him a little bit.
He's alright.
Do you think I'm exaggerating?
You just have to rock him a little bit.
You just have to rock him a little bit.
There's my little dude!
Jesus!
All 12?
- I'll take them as they are.
- But they are totally broken...
I'll take them as they are!
You're gonna be a good looking boy.
All the girls are gonna love you.
I know it.
Don't wake up.
Don't wake up.
Can you say "mommy"?
"mom-my", "mommy", Kevin?
Can you say "ball"? "ball"?
"ba-", "ba-", "ba-".
"Ball"?
No?
Okay.
I'm gonna throw it to you, and you're gonna roll it back to me, okay?
Okay.
Roll it back to mommy.
Roll it back.
Roll.
Roll it back.
Okay, okay.
Roll it back, okay?
Roll it back.
Roll it back.
Roll it back.
When he was a baby, he never stopped screaming.
I thought maybe it had damaged his hearing.
No, his hearing is fine.
But shouldn't he be talking by now?
I read somewhere that non-verbalizing was the... an early sign of autism.
He has none of the tell-tale rocking signs.
I wouldn't worry about it too much.
He's a fluffy little boy, isn't he?
But there is nothing wrong with him.
Thank you.
Okay.
Roll it back to mommy.
Okay.
Gonna roll it back again.
That was really good, Kev.
Okay.
Here we go.
Okay?
Okay?
"E" is for elephant, large as a house, he's big as can be, not small like a mouse.

Can you say "mommy" for me?
No!
- "Mommy"?
- No!
- Just say "mommy".
- No.

Hey lady.
We know you're in there.
I don't like that!
I don't like that!
I don't like that!
Mommy was happy before little Kevin came along.
Do you know that?
And now mommy wakes up every morning... and wishes she was in France!
That elevator is a death trap.
He needs a yard, somewhere he can toss a ball, fill a pool.

You sound like a bumper sticker.
It's a matter of priorities, Eva.
He's only gonna be a kid once.
You can house hunt all you want.
I'm telling you, I'm not leaving the city.
Kevin, stop that.
That's enough.
Let mommy and daddy talk.
Kevin, quit that!
You have your family room here.
Master bedroom is back there and two huge walk-in closets.
The bathroom is amazing.
Here we are, guys.
Our very own castle.
I'm gonna go and grab some lunch.
Does anybody want anything?
Hey!
Hey!
Wait up!
Mrs. K!
Hey!
It's me!
Soweto.
Hi there.
I just wanted to see how you were.
I'm fine.
Thanks.
You look well.
Yeah.
The doctors are saying there's a chance I might walk again.
That's great.
Well, you take care, Mrs. K.
You, too.
Come on, come on!
Die!
Die!
No!
No!
No!
- Die!
- How do you jump?
Die!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Die!
Hey Kev?
Are you out there?
Kevin?
Kevin, you hear that?
Dad goes pee pee.
You can do that too.
So you want a connector right there.
You see?
And click on that link and it should open right up.
And If it doesn't...
we'll try it again.
- So you left click.
Wanna give it a try?
- Sure.
- No, no.
- I'm sorry.
- Right click, right there.
- Yeah.
See that?
It comes up.
Right.
Yeah, thanks.
I think I got it.
Thank you for your help.
I pooped.
Hey buddy.
What?
You pooped?
Oh okay.
Here let me help you.
Okay.
Go to your room.
I'll be right there.
Let's not wake up mommy.
Go on!
Go on, buddy.
These squiggly squares of paper, they are dumb.
Everybody needs a room of their own.
You have your room.
This is the mama's room.
I can help you make your room special, if you'd like.
What do you mean, "special"?
Well, so it looks like your personality.
What personality?
I think you know what I mean.
They're dumb.
No, no, no.
I mean it's good.
You don't need me to do that?
And... and the guys...
Okay.
Well, I mean, if you have it in hand...
I could.
Really?
Well, that all sounds great.
Okay, John.
Okay.
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
Kevin?
Kevin?
What else do you have to say?
Go wash your face!
He said, he's really sorry.
And that he was only trying to help make it special.
Do you remember how you got that?
It's the most honest thing you ever did.
Do you know how they potty train cats?
They stick their noses in their own shit.
They don't like it.
So they use the box.
Okay.
Let's work on our counting.
- What comes after 3?
- 9.
- What comes after 7?
- 71.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,
41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.
Now, can we quit?
There.
You can add that together if you think you're so smart.
You did not...
You did not...
Are you enjoying yourself?
I can see the doctor by myself.
I have to tell you something, Eva.
It's a brave boy you've got there.
- Thank you.
- Anytime.
What mamma did was very, very wrong.
And she's so, so sorry.
Hey, Kev?
Kev, hold on a sec!
Kev?
Kevin?
Hey Kev.
What happened?
I broke my arm.
How did you brake your arm?
I had poopy pants.
Mommy went to get wipes.
I fell off the changing table onto my dump trucks.
Mom took me to doctor Goldbutt.
It's all my fault.
No, no, don't be silly.
You can't watch him every second of the day.
Franklin...
Unbelievable.
How did you get him to do that?
Well, whatever it was it worked.
Not yet.
Okay.
I love you, kiddo.
I don't like that.
Turn it off.
Honey.
Do you mind if we stop over at the store?
I wanna go home.
It's just that I need to pick up...
Home it is.
Hey, guys!
Hey, Dad!
How was work?
Did you take any cool pictures?
Eva, he's just a boy.
He's a sweet little boy.
That's what boys do.
Mom is fat!
When did you...
When were you gonna tell me?
Soon.
Now.
How am I part of the decision now?
What am I supposed to say now?
So, the daddy bear plants his seed in the mommy bear and it grows into an egg.
Is this about fucking?
Do you know what that means?
The boy puts his pee pee in the girl's doo doo.
Well...
Haven't you ever wished you had somebody else around to play with?
No.
You might like it.
What if I don't like it?
Then you get used to it.
Just because you're used to something... doesn't mean you like it.
You're used to me.
Yes, well...
In a few months we're all gonna get used to somebody new.
Beautiful.
Hey, Kev.
Come over and meet your little sister.
This is your brother.
It's Kevin.
It's your big brother.
Yes, yeah.
It's Kevin.
Yes, yes...
Kevin!
Don't do that.
No, Kevin.
That's not nice.
It's OK.
We're getting snacks, okay?
Come on.
Christ!
To Ecuador?
For 2 months?
Why can't you send someone else?
I really wanna work this deal.
First he cries too much, then he's too quiet.
Then he makes up his own little language, and it's annoying.
He has trouble toilet-training.
A lot of kids do.
And you see this as some kind of personal vendetta?
This is not good for him.
Franklin, pick up the god damn phone!
Pick up the god damn phone.
...13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 20, 21, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27...
Please!
Please!
Let me have a drink.
I'm begging you!
Pleeeease!
Kevin?
Kevin!
Honey?
Are you ok?
I'm sorry, mom.
Not to worry, sweetheart.
You couldn't help it.
"By my soul," cried Gilbert.
"Art thou the devil in blue, to shoot in that wise?"
"Nay," quoth Robin, laughing, "not quite so ill as that, I trust."
"And he took up another shaft... " Are you okay, honey?
"And he took up another shaft and fitted it to the string."
"Again he shot..."
"and again he smote the arrow close beside the center;"
"a third time he loosed his bowstring"
"and dropped his arrow just betwixt the other two"
"and into the very center,"
"so that the feathers of all three were ruffled together,"
"seeming from a distance to be one thick shaft."
"And now a low murmur ran all among that great crowd..."
Hey champ.
How are you doing?
Feeling better?
Go away.
I'm tired.
Oh.
Okay.
Sure thing, buddy.
You just get some rest, okay?
Don't stop reading, mom.
"Two hundred and eighty score shafts were shot in all,"
"and so deftly were they sped that when the shooting was done"
"each target looked like the back of a hedgehog"
"when the farm dog snuffs at it."
Good afternoon, ma'am.
I hope this isn't an inconvenient time.
Well, it is actually.
Well, we just have a couple of quick questions for you.
What's this about?
Do you know where you are spending the afterlife?
Oh, yes, I do as a matter of fact.
I'm going straight to hell.
Eternal damnation, the whole bit.
Thank you for asking.
Okay?
Hey, honey.
Let me help you with that.
I can dress myself.
Can you leave?
Sure.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
Do you want some more of that chowder for lunch?
Whatever.
- Or a grilled cheese sandwich?
- I don't give a rat's ass.
Thank you, dad, this is so cool!
You're welcome, buddy.
Right.
Here we go.
In the middle.
Ooooh.
Almost.
Here.
Take that one.
Try again.
Use your finger...
Keep your eyes in the middle.
Good shot, Kev.
You're a natural.
Perfect.
Thanks, dad.
Right.
It's like this.
You wake up.
Then you watch TV.
You get in the car, then you listen to the radio.
Then you go to you little job or your little school but we're not gonna hear about that on the 6 o'clock news.
Why?
Because nothing is really happening.
Then you go home and watch some more TV.
Or maybe it's a fun night, and you go out and you watch a movie.
I mean it's got so bad, that half the time the people on TV, inside the TV, they're watching TV.
And what are all these people watching?
People like me.
And what are all you doing right now but watching me?
You don't think they would have changed the channel by now if all I did was getting "A" in geometry?
Me and Kevin were playing "Christmas kidnapping".
Kevin!
Kevin, you're my friend!
You're my friend.
Beat it, Celia.
Get me a soda.
No, nott that one, you retard.
Get me a root beer.
- Hey!
What?
Thanks, Celia.
I was thirsty.
Hey, you wanne know a secret?
Come closer.
Do you know who else is thirsty?
You don't?
It's the vacuum monster.
Cut it out!
- Hey troops!
- Daddy!
Ho, ho, ho.
Look what I got!
Kev, come here.
Give me a hand.
Yeah, sure, dad.
- You wanna dance?
- No thanks, Harland.
- Come on.
Just one.
- I don't dance, really.
Where do you get off, you stuck up bitch?
Do you think anyone else is gonna want you now?
Come on.
Stay for another drink.
Come on.
Come on.
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.
Can we leave a carrot for the reindeer?
- We'll see.
- Yeah.
Kevin!
Didn't I see you at the bookstore today?
Nope.
Funny, I could have sworn.
By the way, are you doing anything on Friday?
Why?
I just thought we might do something together.
For fun.
Like, do what?
Maybe take you for dinner.
Or play around with miniature golf?
Okay.
Why didn't you bring a coat?
You just can't get uncomfortable enough, can you?
Uncomfortable?
With my own mother?
Whenever I see fat people, they are always eating.
Dont' give me any of this "slow metabolism, it's the glands" crap.
It's food.
They are fat because they eat the wrong food.
Too much of it, and all the time.
You know, you can be kind of harsh sometimes.
You're one to talk.
Yeah, I am.
I wonder where I got it.
Well, you won.
So.
What next, momsy?
We're gonna go home.
You're gonna get changed into something reasonable.
And I'm taking you to dinner.
Great.
We're going to dinner.
I was hungry.
I'm a growing boy, you know.
I'll have a... calorie salad, steak, medium rare, and a bottle of merlot.
All right.
So, how's school going?
It's going.
On a course schedule.
How about your teachers?
Are there any who are...
Right, what bands am I listening to these days?
Next you can weed all about whether there isn't some cute little cunt in the front row who's got me itchy.
That way you can segway into how it's all up to me, of course but before bailing the chick in the hallway, that I might decide to wait until I'm ready.
Right around dessert, you can ask about drugs.
Real careful, like cause you don't want to scare me into, like, lying my head off.
So you have to say how you've experimented.
Then finally once you've sucked up that entire bottle of wine, you can go all gooey-eyed and say how nice it is to spend quality time together, then scooch over and put your arm around my shoulder.
Give it a little squeeze.
Fuck!
- Your computer is fucked, isn't it?
- Yeah.
It's fucked.
And so are all the ones at work.
I guess I deserved it.
- Why would you let out something like that?
- I collect them.
Isn't that a weird thing to collect?
I don't like stamps.
But what is the point?
There is no point.
That's the point.
No, it really hasn't been any trouble at all.
Everybody is bringing a dish.
Oh!
That's them now.
I got to go.
OK, you have a great day.
Bye, mom.
Merry Christmas.
Alright, Kev.
You're next.
Can you guess what it is?
That's a series 7.
The guy in the store said it was the best one.
- Gee, dad.
Thank you so much.
- Merry Christmas.
- It's perfect.
What did you eat for breakfast?
How was your day, Snuffles?
Did you hear that thump?
That's a powerful thing, man.
Celia!
Come on, honey.
Time for bed.
Here we go.
I thought I closed the door.
Kevin said I'm stupid, and he's right.
You're not stupid, honey.
Don't you worry.
We'll find him.
Now you scoot down.
Come on.
Cozy?
I'm sure Snuffles has gone to the big pet store in the sky.
- Don't say that!
Don't say that!
- Yes.
It's the truth!
Dearly beloved,
We are gathered here to mourn Mr. Snuffles...
Stop it!
...who was snuffed out... tragically early.
So daddy and mommy were looking for him the whole night.
And you know why we couldn't find him?
Because Snuffles has gone to live in the garden.
He's living in the garden now, with a whole bunch of new animal friends.
Celia.
Okay, give me the spoon.
So, they're having a big party tonight... with the chipmunks, and the squarrels, and the racoons... and they're eating nuts, and berries, and they're gonna have a whole bunch...
Why did you leave the drain stuff out?
I didn't.
- I put it away!
- Then how did it get out?
Ask Kevin.
Kevin did it.
You need to go talk to someone.
Kev, mom had something that she wanted to tell you.
I wanted to... thank you for calling the ambulance.
And?
And...
I was concerned that you might be feeling responsible.
Why is that?
Because you was supposed to be looking after her.
We just don't want you to blame yourself.
No.
I don't...
I mean I...
I never said I did.
She's gonna need a glass eye, Kevin.
So, we would appreciate you looking after her, and any namecalling...
You don't really remember being a kid much do you, dad?
Celia is just gonna have to suck it up.
I thought you didn't like those.
Well, they're a...
Now what do you call it... an acquired taste.
I'm so sorry.
There you go.
Okay.
Thank you, mommy.
- Hey, kiddo.
Going to practice?
- Yeah, you know it.
- Hey, Celia, you wanna come collect arrows?
- No!
So...
What do you wanna do?
We'll last out the school year if we can and... make arrangements over the summer.
At least custody is a no-brainer.
Is it?
You've decided?
Eva, there's nothing left to decide.
It already happened.
- Needed a drink of water.
- Hey you, Kev.
Listen, buddy, it's easy to misunderstand something when you hear it out of context.
Why would I not know the "context"?
I am the context.
- You have to appeal.
- No.
But you'll lose everything, the business, your house.
I hate the house.
I always have.
You'll rot in hell!
A personal for Kevin Khatcha...
dourian?
- Careful, it's heavy.
- It is?
- Yeah.
- Have a nice day.
- You, too.
What are they for?
You never ride your bike.
I got these for a song of the web.
I'll make a bundle selling them at school.
Like Donald Trump, huh.
I'll take you back to my ship.
1, 2, 3.

I'm charmed to meet you, young lady
- Yeah.
- Yes, I did.
- Did you eat all your cereal?
-Yes, I did.
-Alright.
You're a little clammy.
Feeling okay?
Never better.
Hey, only three days to go till you're 16.
We should do something.
How about Sunday?
Don't know.
Might be tied up.
Come on, clean up some of this mess and then we're gonna get dressed and go.
I do not want to go to school.
I know, but daddy has to take a shower, we have to go.
Say goodbye!
Do you think we could make some time to talk later, just the two of us, without the kids?
I really wanna work this thing out.
Doesn't Kevin go to Gladstone High?
Franklin...
Pick up the god damn phone!
Franklin...
I have my son there.
Kevin?
Kevin!
Have you seen Kevin?
Kevin!
Kevin!
Lauren!
Franklin?
Celia?
Franklin?
Celia?
You don't look happy.
Have I ever?
I'm almost 18, aren't I?
What is it?
Going to the big school making you nervous?
Nervous?
Do you know anything about those places?
Well, you managed it all so well.
Tried as a minor.
Out of your head on prozac.
You'll be out of there in a couple years.
Do you know what day it is today?
Why the let me come see you on a Monday?
Sure.
It's my anniversary.
Two years.
Plenty of time to think about it.
I want you to tell me why.
Used to think I knew.
Now I'm not so sure.
Time's up.

Good morning.
Hey buddy!
Want something to eat?
No.
I'm not hungry.
Yeah, that's fine.
Yeah.
Franklin?
Hey.
It's me.
I just wanted to leave a message.
Do you think we could make some time to talk later just the two of us, without the kids?
I really wanna work this thing out.
Okay?
I miss you.
Eva Khatchadourian!
It's a lot.
Look, Eva.
I don't really care who you are or what you've done so long as you can type and you can file.
You can have this job.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Thank you.
I won't let you down.
I promise you.
Thank you.
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.
See you Monday.
Great.
Thank you.
Looks like someone is having a nice day?
Enjoying yourself?
I'm sorry?
I hope you rot in hell, you fucking bitch!
Jesus.
What the hell was that?
Are you ok?
No, no, no, it's nothing.
It's really... it's nothing.
- Let me call 911.
- No, no, it was my fault.
- But she just totally...
- No, no, I'm fine.
Eva, when are you coming home?
I miss you.
I love you.
Promise me you'll never go away again.
I will never, never, never go away again.
Promise me.
Promise me you'll never go away again.
Is it safe?
No, it's not safe.
Sure?
Are you sure about this?
This really happened?
I can see, I can feel it...
We did it.
I'm gonna need all these processed today, Eva.
Uh, but today my afternoon off.
You remember?
I told you.
Ah shit, that's right.
- Look, give these to Massughi.
- Sure.
- Hey, Eva.
- Hey, Al.
No, let go of me!
Let go of me, man!
- Get off me!
- Keep walking.
Hey lady!
Lady!
Lady!
Please help me!
I didn't do nothing, man!
Get off of me!
Eva, you can stop resisting.
Stop resisting, Eva.
Eva!
Rise and shine.
It's late, Eva.
The day is almost over.
- Hi!
- Don't pick him up.
Please don't pick him up.
I just put him down, Franklin.
Hi.
There he is.
You wanna play?
You wanna play?
It's alright.
Just rock him a little bit.
He's alright.
Do you think I'm exaggerating?
You just have to rock him a little bit.
You just have to rock him a little bit.
There's my little dude!
Jesus!
All 12?
- I'll take them as they are.
- But they are totally broken...
I'll take them as they are!
You're gonna be a good looking boy.
All the girls are gonna love you.
I know it.
Don't wake up.
Don't wake up.
Can you say "mommy"?
"mom-my", "mommy", Kevin?
Can you say "ball"? "ball"?
"ba-", "ba-", "ba-".
"Ball"?
No?
Okay.
I'm gonna throw it to you, and you're gonna roll it back to me, okay?
Okay.
Roll it back to mommy.
Roll it back.
Roll.
Roll it back.
Okay, okay.
Roll it back, okay?
Roll it back.
Roll it back.
Roll it back.
When he was a baby, he never stopped screaming.
I thought maybe it had damaged his hearing.
No, his hearing is fine.
But shouldn't he be talking by now?
I read somewhere that non-verbalizing was the... an early sign of autism.
He has none of the tell-tale rocking signs.
I wouldn't worry about it too much.
He's a fluffy little boy, isn't he?
But there is nothing wrong with him.
Thank you.
Okay.
Roll it back to mommy.
Okay.
Gonna roll it back again.
That was really good, Kev.
Okay.
Here we go.
Okay?
Okay?
"E" is for elephant, large as a house, he's big as can be, not small like a mouse.
Can you say "Elephant, Kevin?
"Elephant"?
"Elephant".
Kevin!
Kevin?
Can you say "mommy" for me?
No!
- "Mommy"?
- No!
- Just say "mommy".
- No.
Trick or treat?
Trick or treat?
Hey lady.
We know you're in there.
I don't like that!
I don't like that!
I don't like that!
Mommy was happy before little Kevin came along.
Do you know that?
And now mommy wakes up every morning... and wishes she was in France!
That elevator is a death trap.
He needs a yard, somewhere he can toss a ball, fill a pool.
But I love New York.
Come on!
You sound like a bumper sticker.
It's a matter of priorities, Eva.
He's only gonna be a kid once.
You can house hunt all you want.
I'm telling you, I'm not leaving the city.
Kevin, stop that.
That's enough.
Let mommy and daddy talk.
Kevin, quit that!
You have your family room here.
Master bedroom is back there and two huge walk-in closets.
The bathroom is amazing.
Here we are, guys.
Our very own castle.
I'm gonna go and grab some lunch.
Does anybody want anything?
Hey!
Hey!
Wait up!
Mrs. K!
Hey!
It's me!
Soweto.
Hi there.
I just wanted to see how you were.
I'm fine.
Thanks.
You look well.
Yeah.
The doctors are saying there's a chance I might walk again.
That's great.
Well, you take care, Mrs. K.
You, too.
Come on, come on!
Die!
Die!
No!
No!
No!
- Die!
- How do you jump?
Die!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Die!
Hey Kev?
Are you out there?
Kevin?
Kevin, you hear that?
Dad goes pee pee.
You can do that too.
So you want a connector right there.
You see?
And click on that link and it should open right up.
And If it doesn't...
we'll try it again.
- So you left click.
Wanna give it a try?
- Sure.
- No, no.
- I'm sorry.
- Right click, right there.
- Yeah.
See that?
It comes up.
Right.
Yeah, thanks.
I think I got it.
Thank you for your help.
I pooped.
Hey buddy.
What?
You pooped?
Oh okay.
Here let me help you.
Okay.
Go to your room.
I'll be right there.
Let's not wake up mommy.
Go on!
Go on, buddy.
These squiggly squares of paper, they are dumb.
Everybody needs a room of their own.
You have your room.
This is the mama's room.
I can help you make your room special, if you'd like.
What do you mean, "special"?
Well, so it looks like your personality.
What personality?
I think you know what I mean.
They're dumb.
No, no, no.
I mean it's good.
You don't need me to do that?
And... and the guys...
Okay.
Well, I mean, if you have it in hand...
I could.
Really?
Well, that all sounds great.
Okay, John.
Okay.
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
Kevin?
Kevin?
What else do you have to say?
Go wash your face!
He said, he's really sorry.
And that he was only trying to help make it special.
Do you remember how you got that?
It's the most honest thing you ever did.
Do you know how they potty train cats?
They stick their noses in their own shit.
They don't like it.
So they use the box.
Okay.
Let's work on our counting.
- What comes after 3?
- 9.
- What comes after 7?
- 71.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,
41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.
Now, can we quit?
There.
You can add that together if you think you're so smart.
You did not...
You did not...
Are you enjoying yourself?
I can see the doctor by myself.
I have to tell you something, Eva.
It's a brave boy you've got there.
- Thank you.
- Anytime.
What mamma did was very, very wrong.
And she's so, so sorry.
Hey, Kev?
Kev, hold on a sec!
Kev?
Kevin?
Hey Kev.
What happened?
I broke my arm.
How did you break your arm?
I had poopy pants.
Mommy went to get wipes.
I fell off the changing table onto my dump trucks.
Mom took me to doctor Goldbutt.
It's all my fault.
No, no, don't be silly.
You can't watch him every second of the day.
Franklin...
Unbelievable.
How did you get him to do that?
Well, whatever it was it worked.
Not yet.
Okay.
I love you, kiddo.
I don't like that.
Turn it off.
Honey.
Do you mind if we stop over at the store?
I wanna go home.
It's just that I need to pick up...
Home it is.
Hey, guys!
Hey, Dad!
How was work?
Did you take any cool pictures?
Eva, he's just a boy.
He's a sweet little boy.
That's what boys do.
Mom is fat!
When did you...
When were you gonna tell me?
Soon.
Now.
How am I part of the decision now?
What am I supposed to say now?
So, the daddy bear plants his seed in the mommy bear and it grows into an egg.
Is this about fucking?
Do you know what that means?
The boy puts his pee pee in the girl's doo doo.
Well...
Haven't you ever wished you had somebody else around to play with?
No.
You might like it.
What if I don't like it?
Then you get used to it.
Just because you're used to something... doesn't mean you like it.
You're used to me.
Yes, well...
In a few months we're all gonna get used to somebody new.
Beautiful.
Hey, Kev.
Come over and meet your little sister.
This is your brother.
It's Kevin.
It's your big brother.
Yes, yeah.
It's Kevin.
Yes, yes...
Kevin!
Don't do that.
No, Kevin.
That's not nice.
It's OK.
We're getting snacks, okay?
Come on.
Christ!
To Ecuador?
For 2 months?
Why can't you send someone else?
I really wanna work this deal.
First he cries too much, then he's too quiet.
Then he makes up his own little language, and it's annoying.
He has trouble toilet-training.
A lot of kids do.
And you see this as some kind of personal vendetta?
This is not good for him.
Franklin, pick up the god damn phone!
Pick up the god damn phone.
...13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 20, 21, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27...
Please!
Please!
Let me have a drink.
I'm begging you!
Please!
Kevin?
Kevin!
Honey?
Are you ok?
I'm sorry, mom.
Not to worry, sweetheart.
You couldn't help it.
"By my soul," cried Gilbert.
"Art thou the devil in blue, to shoot in that wise?"
"Nay," Quoth Robin, laughing, "not quite so ill as that, I trust."
"And he took up another shaft... " Are you okay, honey?
"And he took up another shaft and fitted it to the string."
"Again he shot..."
"and again he smote the arrow close beside the center;"
"a third time he loosed his bowstring"
"and dropped his arrow just betwixt the other two"
"and into the very center,"
"so that the feathers of all three were ruffled together,"
"seeming from a distance to be one thick shaft."
"And now a low murmur ran all among that great crowd..."
Hey champ.
How are you doing?
Feeling better?
Go away.
I'm tired.
Oh.
Okay.
Sure thing, buddy.
You just get some rest, okay?
Don't stop reading, mom.
"Two hundred and eighty score shafts were shot in all,"
"and so deftly were they sped that when the shooting was done"
"each target looked like the back of a hedgehog"
"when the farm dog snuffs at it."
Good afternoon, ma'am.
I hope this isn't an inconvenient time.
Well, it is actually.
Well, we just have a couple of quick questions for you.
What's this about?
Do you know where you are spending the afterlife?
Oh, yes, I do as a matter of fact.
I'm going straight to hell.
Eternal damnation, the whole bit.
Thank you for asking.
Okay?
Hey, honey.
Let me help you with that.
I can dress myself.
Can you leave?
Sure.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
Do you want some more of that chowder for lunch?
Whatever.
- Or a grilled cheese sandwich?
- I don't give a rat's ass.
Thank you, dad, this is so cool!
You're welcome, buddy.
Right.
Here we go.
In the middle.
Oh.
Almost.
Here.
Take that one.
Try again.
Use your finger...
Keep your eyes in the middle.
Good shot, Kev.
You're a natural.
Perfect.
Thanks, dad.
Right.
It's like this.
You wake up.
Then you watch TV.
You get in the car, then you listen to the radio.
Then you go to your little job or your little school but we're not gonna hear about that on the 6 o'clock news.
Why?
Because nothing is really happening.
Then you go home and watch some more TV.
Or maybe it's a fun night, and you go out and you watch a movie.
I mean it's got so bad, that half the time the people on TV, inside the TV, they're watching TV.
And what are all these people watching?
People like me.
And what are all you doing right now but watching me?
You don't think they would have changed the channel by now if all I did was getting "A" in geometry?
Me and Kevin were playing "Christmas kidnapping".
Kevin!
Kevin, you're my friend!
You're my friend.
Beat it, Celia.
Get me a soda.
No, not that one, you retard.
Get me a root beer.
- Hey!
What?
Thanks, Celia.
I was thirsty.
Hey, you wanna know a secret?
Come closer.
Do you know who else is thirsty?
You don't?
It's the vacuum monster.
Cut it out!
- Hey troops!
- Daddy!
Ho, ho, ho.
Look what I got!
Kev, come here.
Give me a hand.
Yeah, sure, dad.
- You wanna dance?
- No thanks, Harland.
- Come on.
Just one.
- I don't dance, really.
Where do you get off, you stuck up bitch?
Do you think anyone else is gonna want you now?
Come on.
Stay for another drink.
Come on.
Come on.
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.
Can we leave a carrot for the reindeer?
- We'll see.
- Yeah.
Kevin!
Didn't I see you at the bookstore today?
Nope.
Funny, I could have sworn.
By the way, are you doing anything on Friday?
Why?
I just thought we might do something together.
For fun.
Like, do what?
Maybe take you for dinner.
Or play around with miniature golf?
Okay.
Why didn't you bring a coat?
You just can't get uncomfortable enough, can you?
Uncomfortable?
With my own mother?
Whenever I see fat people, they are always eating.
Don't give me any of this "slow metabolism, it's the glands" crap.
It's food.
They are fat because they eat the wrong food.
Too much of it, and all the time.
You know, you can be kind of harsh sometimes.
You're one to talk.
Yeah, I am.
I wonder where I got it.
Well, you won.
So.
What next, momsy?
We're gonna go home.
You're gonna get changed into something reasonable.
And I'm taking you to dinner.
Great.
We're going to dinner.
I was hungry.
I'm a growing boy, you know.
I'll have a... calorie salad, steak, medium rare, and a bottle of merlot.
All right.
So, how's school going?
It's going.
On a course schedule.
How about your teachers?
Are there any who are...
Right, what bands am I listening to these days?
Next you can weed all about whether there isn't some cute little cunt in the front row who's got me itchy.
That way you can Segway into how it's all up to me, of course but before bailing the chick in the hallway, that I might decide to wait until I'm ready.
Right around dessert, you can ask about drugs.
Real careful, like cause you don't want to scare me into, like, lying my head off.
So you have to say how you've experimented.
Then finally once you've sucked up that entire bottle of wine, you can go all gooey-eyed and say how nice it is to spend quality time together, then scooch over and put your arm around my shoulder.
Give it a little squeeze.
Fuck!
- Your computer is fucked, isn't it?
- Yeah.
It's fucked.
And so are all the ones at work.
I guess I deserved it.
- Why would you let out something like that?
- I collect them.
Isn't that a weird thing to collect?
I don't like stamps.
But what is the point?
There is no point.
That's the point.
No, it really hasn't been any trouble at all.
Everybody is bringing a dish.
Oh!
That's them now.
I got to go.
OK, you have a great day.
Bye, mom.
Merry Christmas.
Alright, Kev.
You're next.
Can you guess what it is?
That's a series 7.
The guy in the store said it was the best one.
- Gee, dad.
Thank you so much.
- Merry Christmas.
- It's perfect.
What did you eat for breakfast?
How was your day, Snuffles?
Did you hear that thump?
That's a powerful thing, man.
Celia!
Come on, honey.
Time for bed.
Here we go.
I thought I closed the door.
Kevin said I'm stupid, and he's right.
You're not stupid, honey.
Don't you worry.
We'll find him.
Now you scoot down.
Come on.
Cozy?
I'm sure Snuffles has gone to the big pet store in the sky.
- Don't say that!
Don't say that!
- Yes.
It's the truth!
Dearly beloved,
We are gathered here to mourn Mr. Snuffles...
Stop it!
...who was snuffed out... tragically early.
So daddy and mommy were looking for him the whole night.
And you know why we couldn't find him?
Because Snuffles has gone to live in the garden.
He's living in the garden now, with a whole bunch of new animal friends.
Celia.
Okay, give me the spoon.
So, they're having a big party tonight... with the chipmunks, and the squirrels, and the raccoons... and they're eating nuts, and berries, and they're gonna have a whole bunch...
Why did you leave the drain stuff out?
I didn't.
- I put it away!
- Then how did it get out?
Ask Kevin.
Kevin did it.
You need to go talk to someone.
Kev, mom had something that she wanted to tell you.
I wanted to... thank you for calling the ambulance.
And?
And...
I was concerned that you might be feeling responsible.
Why is that?
Because you was supposed to be looking after her.
We just don't want you to blame yourself.
No.
I don't...
I mean I...
I never said I did.
She's gonna need a glass eye, Kevin.
So, we would appreciate you looking after her, and any name-calling...
You don't really remember being a kid much do you, dad?
Celia is just gonna have to suck it up.
I thought you didn't like those.
Well, they're a...
Now what do you call it... an acquired taste.
I'm so sorry.
There you go.
Okay.
Thank you, mommy.
- Hey, kiddo.
Going to practice?
- Yeah, you know it.
- Hey, Celia, you wanna come collect arrows?
- No!
So...
What do you wanna do?
We'll last out the school year if we can and... make arrangements over the summer.
At least custody is a no-brainer.
Is it?
You've decided?
Eva, there's nothing left to decide.
It already happened.
- Needed a drink of water.
- Hey you, Kev.
Listen, buddy, it's easy to misunderstand something when you hear it out of context.
Why would I not know the "context"?
I am the context.
- You have to appeal.
- No.
But you'll lose everything, the business, your house.
I hate the house.
I always have.
You'll rot in hell!
A personal for Kevin Khatcha...
...dourian?
- Careful, it's heavy.
- It is?
- Yeah.
- Have a nice day.
- You, too.
What are they for?
You never ride your bike.
I got these for a song of the web.
I'll make a bundle selling them at school.
Like Donald Trump, huh.
I'll take you back to my ship.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

1, 2, 3.

1, 2, 3.
I'm charmed to meet you, young lady
- Yeah.
- Yes, I did.
- Did you eat all your cereal?
- Yes, I did.
- Alright.
You're a little clammy.
Feeling okay?
Never better.
Hey, only three days to go till you're 16.
We should do something.
How about Sunday?
Don't know.
Might be tied up.
Come on, clean up some of this mess and then we're gonna get dressed and go.
I do not want to go to school.
I know, but daddy has to take a shower, we have to go.
Say goodbye!
Do you think we could make some time to talk later, just the two of us, without the kids?
I really wanna work this thing out.
Doesn't Kevin go to Gladstone High?
Franklin...
Pick up the god damn phone!
Franklin...
I have my son there.
Kevin?
Kevin!
Have you seen Kevin?
Kevin!
Kevin!
Lauren!
Franklin?
Celia?
Franklin?
Celia?
You don't look happy.
Have I ever?
I'm almost 18, aren't I?
What is it?
Going to the big school making you nervous?
Nervous?
Do you know anything about those places?
Well, you managed it all so well.
Tried as a minor.
Out of your head on Prozac.
You'll be out of there in a couple years.
Do you know what day it is today?
Why the let me come see you on a Monday?
Sure.
It's my anniversary.
Two years.
Plenty of time to think about it.
I want you to tell me why.
Used to think I knew.
Now I'm not so sure.
Time's up.
When you go to the ball... you have to learn how to dance like a princess, right?
1, 2, 3...
1, 2, 3...
- 1, 2, 3...
- Yeah!
What are you gonna wear today?
- I'm gonna wear...
- You're gonna wear...
- I'm gonna wear...
- A bucket on your head.
- No!
- 1, 2, 3...
No?
- And a barrel round your bottom.
- No!
- And cloth bags for shoes?
- Nooo!
1, 2, 3...
1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3...
1, 2, 3...
Good morning.
Hey buddy!
Want something to eat?
No.
I'm not hungry.
Yeah, that's fine.
Yeah.
Franklin?
Hey.
It's me.
I just wanted to leave a message.
Do you think we could make some time to talk later just the two of us without kids?
I really wanna work this thing out.
Okay?
I miss you.
Eva Khatchadourian!
It's a lot.
Look, Eva.
I don't really care who you are or what you've done as long as you can type and you can file.
You can have this job.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Thank you.
I wont let you down.
I promise you.
Thank you.
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.
See you Monday.
Great.
Thank you.
Looks like someone is having a nice day?
Enjoying yourself?
I'm sorry?
I hope you rot in hell, you fucking bitch!
Jesus.
What the hell was that?
Are you ok?
No, no, no, it's nothing.
Its really... its nothing.
- Let me call an ambulance.
- No, no, it was my fault.
- But she just...
- No, no, I'm fine.
Eva, when are you coming home?
I missed you.
I love you.
Promise me you'll never go away again.
I will never, never, never go away again.
Promise me.
Promise me you'll never go away again.
Is it safe?
No, it's not safe.
Sure?
Are you sure about this?
This really happened?
I can see, I can feel it...
We did it.
I'm gonna need these processed today, Eva.
Uh, but today my afternoon off.
You remember?
I told you.
Ah shit, that's right.
- Look, give these to Massughi.
- Sure.
- Hi Eva.
- Hey, Al.
No, let go of me!
Let go of me, man!
- Get off me!
- Keep walking.
Hey lady.
Lady.
Lady.
Please help me!
I didn't do nothing, man!
Get off of me!
Eva, you can stop holding back.
Stop holding back, Eva.
Eva!
Rise and shine.
It's late, Eva.
The day is almost over.
- Hiii!
- Don't pick him up.
Please don't pick him up.
I just put him down, Franklin.
Hi.
There he is.
You wanna play?
You wanna play?
It's alright.
Just rock him a little bit.
He's alright.
Do you think I'm exaggerating?
You just have to rock him a little bit.
There's my little dude!
Jesus!
All 12?
- I'll take them as they are.
- But they are totally broken...
I will take them as they are!
You're gonna be a good looking boy.
All the girls are gonna love you.
I know it.
Don't wake up.
Don't wake up.
Can you say "mommy"?
"mom-my", "mommy", Kevin?
Can you say "ball"? "ball"?
"ba-", "ba-", "ba-".
"Ball"?
No?
Okay.
I'm gonna throw it to you, and you're gonna roll it back to me, okay?
Okay.
Roll it back to mommy.
Roll it back.
Roll.
Roll it back.
Okay, okay.
Roll it back, okay?
Roll it back.
Roll it back.
Roll it back.
When he was a baby, he never stopped screaming.
I thought maybe it had damaged his hearing.
No, his hearing is fine.
But shouldn't he be talking by now?
I read somewhere that non-verbalizing was the... an early sign of autism.
He has none of the tell-tale rocking signs.
I wouldn't worry about it too much.
He's a fluffy little boy, isn't he?
But there is nothing wrong with him.
Thank you.
Okay.
Roll it back to mom.
Okay.
Gonna roll it back again.
That was really good, Kevin.
Okay.
Here we go.
Okay?
Okay?
"E" is for elephant, large as a house, he's big as can be, not small as a mouse.
Can you say "Elephant, Kevin?
"Elephant"?
"Elephant".
Kevin!
Kevin?
Can you say "mommy" for me?
No!
- "mommy"?
- No!
- Just say "mommy".
- No.
Trick or treat?
Trick or treat?
Hey lady.
We know you're in there.
I don't like that!
I don't like that!
Mommy was happy before little Kevin came along.
Do you know that?
And now mommy wakes up every morning... and wishes she was in France!
That elevator is a death trap.
He needs a yard, somewhere he can toss a ball, fill a pool.
But I love New York.
Come on!
You sound like a bumper sticker.
It's a matter of priorities, Eva.
He's only gonna be a kid once.
You can house hunt all you want.
I'm telling you, I'm not leaving the city.
Kevin, stop that.
That's enough.
Let mommy and daddy talk.
Kevin, quit that!
You have your family room here.
Master bedroom is back there and two huge walking closets.
The bathroom is amazing.
Here we are guys.
Our very own castle.
I'm gonna go and grab some lunch.
Does anybody want anything?
Hey!
Hey!
Wait up!
Ms. K!
Hey.
It's me.
Soweto.
Hi there.
I just wanted to see how you were.
I'm fine.
Thanks.
You look well.
Yeah.
The doctors are saying there's a chance I might walk again.
That's great.
You take care, ms.
K.
You too.
Come on, come on!
Die!
Die!
No!
No!
No!
- Die!
- How do you jump?
Die!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Die!
Hey Kev?
Are you out there?
Kevin?
Kevin, you hear that?
Dad goes pee pee.
You can do that too.
So you want a connector right there.
You see?
And click on that link and it should open right up.
And If it doesn't...
we'll try it again.
- So you left click.
Wanna give it a try?
- Yes.
- No, no.
- I'm sorry.
- Right click, right there.
- Yeah.
See that?
It comes up.
Right.
Yeah, thanks.
I think I got it.
Thank you for your help.
I pooped.
Hey buddy.
What?
You pooped?
Oh okay.
Here let me help you.
Okay.
Go to your room.
I'll be right there.
Let's not wake up mommy.
Go on!
Go on, buddy.
These scribled squares of paper.
They are dumb.
Everybody needs a room of their own.
You have your room.
This is the mother's room.
I can help you make your room special, if you'd like.
What do you mean, "Special"?
Well, so it looks like your personality.
What personality?
I think you know what I mean.
They're dumb.
No, no, no.
I mean it's good.
You don't need me to do that?
And... and the guy...
Okay.
Well, I mean if you handle the lot...
I could.
Really?
Well.
That all sounds great.
Okay, John.
Okay.
I'll talk to you later.
Goodbye.
Kevin?
Kevin?
What else do you have to say?
Go wash your face!
He said, he's really sorry.
And that he was only trying to help make it special.
Do you remember how you got that?
It's the most honest thing you ever did.
Do you know how they potty train cats?
They stick their noses in their own shit.
They don't like it.
So they use the box.
Okay.
Let's work on our counting.
- What comes after 3?
- 9.
- What comes after 7?
- 71.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,
41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.
Now, can we quit?
There.
You can add that together if you think you're so smart.
You did not...
You did not...
Are you enjoying yourself?
I can see the doctor by myself.
I have to tell you something, Eva.
It's a brave boy you've got there.
- Thank you.
- That's fine.
What mamma did was very, very wrong.
And she's so, so sorry.
Kev?
Kev, hold on a sec!
Kev?
Kevin?
Hey Kev.
What happened?
I broke my arm.
How did you brake your arm?
I had poopy pants.
Mommy went to get wipes.
I fell off the changing table onto my dump trucks.
Mom took me to doctor Goldbutt.
It's all my fault.
No, don't be silly.
You can't watch him every second of the day.
Franklin...
Unbelievable.
How did you get him to do that?
Well, whatever it was it worked.
Not yet.
Okay.
I love you, kiddo.
I don't like that.
Turn it off.
Honey.
Do you mind if we stop over at the store?
I wanna go home.
It's just that I need to pick up...
Home it is.
Hi guys!
Hi Dad.
How was work?
Did you take any cool pictures?
Eva, he is just a boy.
He's a sweet little boy.
That's what boys do.
Mom is fat!
When did you...
When were you gonna tell me?
Soon.
Now.
How am I part of the decision now?
What am I supposed to say now?
So, the daddy bear plants his seed in the mommy bear and it grows into an egg.
Is this about fucking?
Do you know what that means?
The boy puts his pee pee in the girl's doo doo.
Well...
Haven't you ever wished you had somebody around to play with?
No.
You might like it.
What if I don't like it?
Then you get used to it.
Just because you're used to something... doesn't mean you like it.
You're used to me.
Yes, well...
In a few months we're all gonna get used to somebody new.
Beautiful.
Hey Kev.
Come on and meet your little sister.
This is your brother.
It's Kevin.
It's your big brother.
Yes, that's right.
It's Kevin.
Yes, yes...
Kevin!
Don't do that.
No, Kevin.
That's not nice.
No problem dear.
We're getting snacks, okay?
Come on.
Christ!
To Ecuador?
For 2 months?
Why can't they send someone else?
I really wanna work this deal.
Then he makes up his own little language, and that is annoying.
He has trouble communicating.
A lot of kids do.
And you see this as some kind of personal vendetta?
It's not good for him.
Franklin, pick up the god damn phone!
Pick up the god damn phone.
...13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 20, 21, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27...
Please.
Please.
Let me have a drink.
Please
Kevin?
Kevin!
Honey?
Are you ok?
I'm sorry mom.
Not to worry, sweetheart.
You couldn't help it.
"By my soul," cried Gilbert.
"Aren't thou the devil in blue to shoot in that way?"
"Nay," posed Robin, laughing.
"Not quite so ill as that I trust."
"Then he took up another shaft..." Are you okay, honey?
Then he took up another shaft, and fitted it to the string.
Again he shot.
Again, he smoathed the arrow close beside the center.
The third time, he losed his bowstring and dropped the arrow just betwix the other two, and into the very center, so that the feathers of all three were ruffled together seeming from a distance to be one big shaft.
And now a low murmur ran all along the great crowd.
Hey champ.
How are you doing?
Feeling better?
Go away.
I'm tired.
Oh.
Okay.
Sure thing, buddy.
You just get some rest, okay?
Don't stop reading, mom.
280 score shafts were shot in all and so deftly were they sped, that when the shooting was done each target looked like the back of a hedgehog... when a farm dog snuffed at it.
Good afternoon, ma'am.
I hope this isn't an inconvenient time.
Well, it is actually.
Well, we just have a couple of quick questions for you.
What is it about?
Do you know where you are spending the afterlife?
Oh, yeah.
I do as a matter of fact.
I'm going straight to hell.
Eternal damnation.
Thank you for asking.
Okay?
Hey honey.
Let me help you with that.
I can dress myself.
Can you leave?
Sure.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
Do you want some more of that chowder for lunch?
Whatever.
- Or grilled cheese sandwich?
- I don't give a rat's ass.
Thanks Dad, this is so cool.
You're welcome, buddy.
Right.
Here we go.
In the middle.
Ooooh.
Almost.
Here.
Take that one.
Try again.
Use your finger...
Keep your eyes in the middle.
Good shot, Kev.
You're a natural.
Perfect.
Thanks Dad.
Right.
It's like this.
You wake up.
Then you watch TV.
You get in the car, then you listen to the radio.
Then you go to you little job or your little school but we're not gonna hear about that on the 6pm news.
Why?
Because nothing is really happening.
Then you go home and watch some more TV.
Or maybe it's a fun night, and you go out and you watch a movie.
I mean it's got so bad, that half the time the people on TV, inside the TV, they're watching TV.
And what are all these people watching?
People like me.
And what are all you doing right now?
You're watching me.
Don't you think you would have changed the channel by now if all I did was getting "A" in geometry?
Me and Kevin were plaiying "Christmas kidnapping".
Kevin!
Kevin, you're my friend!
You're my friend.
Beat it, Celia.
Get me a soda.
Not that, you retard.
Get me a Root Beer.
What ?
Thank you, Celia.
I was thirsty.
Hey, you wanne know a secret?
Come closer.
Do you know who else is thirsty?
You don't?
It's the vacuum monster.
Cut it out!
- Hey troops!
- Daddy!
Ho, ho, ho.
See what I got!
Kev, come here.
Give me a hand.
Yeah, sure dad.
- You wanna dance?
- No thanks, Harland.
- Come on.
Just one.
- I don't dance, really.
Where do you get off, you stuck up bitch?
Do you think anyone else is gonna want you now?
Come on.
Stay for another drink.
Come on.
Come on.
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.
Can we leave a carrot for the reindeer!
- Should we?
- Yeah.
Kevin!
Didn't I see you at the bookstore today?
No.
Oh, I could have sworn.
By the way, are you doing anything on Friday?
Why?
I just thought we might do something together.
For fun.
Like, do what?
Maybe take you for dinner.
Or play around with miniature golf?
Okay.
Why didn't you bring a coat?
You just can't get uncomfortable enough, can you?
Uncomfortable?
With my own mother?
Whenever I see fat people, they are always eating.
Dont' give me any of this "slower metabolism thyroid gland" crap.
It's food.
They are fat because they eat the wrong food.
Too much of it, and all the time.
You know, you can be kind of harsh sometimes.
You're one to talk.
Yeah, I am.
I wonder where I got it.
Well, you won.
So.
What next, momsy?
We're gonna go home.
You're gonna get changed into something reasonable.
And I take you to dinner.
Great.
We're going to dinner.
I was hungry.
I'm a growing boy, you know.
I'll have a calorie salad, steak, medium rare, and a bottle of Merlot.
Very well.
So, how is school going?
It's going.
on a course schedule.
How about the teachers?
Are there any of them...
Right, right, what bands am I listening to these days?
Next you can read all about if there isn't some cute little cunt in the front row who's got me itchy.
Then you can segway into the whole, it's all up to me of course but before bailing the chick in the hallway I might decide to way until I'm ready.
Right around dessert, you can ask about drugs
Real careful, like cause you don't want to scare me into, like, lying my head off.
So you have to say, like, how you experimented.
Then finally once you've sucked up that entire bottle of wine, you can go all gooey eyed and say how nice it is to spend quality time together, then scooch over and put your arm around my shoulder.
Give it a little squeeze.
Fuck!
- Your computer is fucked, isn't it?
- Yeah.
It's fucked.
And so are all the ones at work.
I guess I deserved it.
- Why would you let out something like that?
- I collect them.
Isn't that a weird thing to collect?
I don't like stamps.
But what is the point?
There is no point.
That's the point.
No, it really hasn't been any trouble at all.
Everybody is bringing a dish.
Oh.
That's him now.
I got to go.
You have a great day.
Bye, mom.
Merry Christmas.
Alright, Kev.
You're next.
Can you guess what it is?
That's a series 7.
The guy in the store said it was the best one.
- Gee, dad.
Thank you so much.
- Merry Christmas.
What did you have for breakfast?
Had a good day, Snuffles?
Did you hear that thump?
That's a powerful thing, man.
Celia!
Come on, honey.
Time for bed Here we go.
I thought I closed the door.
Kevin said I was stupid, and he was right.
You're not stupid, honey.
Don't you worry.
We'll find him.
Now you scoop down.
Come on.
Cozy?
I'm sure Snuffles has gone to the big pet store in the sky.
- Don't say that!
Don't say that!
- Yes.
It's the truth!
Dearly beloved,
We are gathered here to mourn mr.
Snuffles...
Stop it!
Who will... tragically early...
So daddy and mommy were looking for him the whole night.
And you know why we couldn't find him?
Because Snuffles has gone to live in the garden.
He's living in the garden now, with a whole bunch of new animal friends.
Celia.
Okay, give me the spoon.
So, they're having a big party tonight... with the chipmunks, and the squarrels, and the racoons... and they're eating nuts, and berries, and they're gonna have a whole bunch...
Why did you leave the drain stuff out?
I didn't.
- I put it way.
- Then how did it get out?
Ask Kevin.
Kevin did it.
You need to go talk to someone.
Uhm Kev.
Mom has something else she wanted to tell you.
I wanted to... thank you for calling the ambulance.
And?
And...
I was concerned that you might be feeling responsible.
Why is that?
Because you was supposed to be looking after her.
We just don't want you to blame yourself.
No.
I don't...
I never said I did.
She's gonna need a glass eye, Kevin.
So, we would appreciate you looking after her, and any namecalling...
You don't really remember being a kid much do you, dad?
Celia is just gonna have to suck it up.
I thought you didn't like those.
Well, they're a...
Now what do you call it... an acquired taste.
I'm so sorry.
There you go.
Okay.
Thank you, mommy.
- Hey kiddo.
You're going to practice?
- Yeah, you know it.
- Hey Celia, you wanna come collect arrows?
- No!
So...
What do you want to do?
Let's wait for the school year to end, and make arrangements for this summer.
At least the custody is a no-brainer.
Is it?
You've decided?
Eva, there's nothing left to decide.
It already happened.
- I needed a drink of water.
- Hi, Kev.
Listen, buddy, it's easy to misunderstand something if you hear it out of context.
Why would I not know the "context"?
I am the context.
- You have to appeal to reject punitive damage.
- No.
You'll lose everything.
The business, your house.
I hate the house.
I always have.
You'll rot in hell!
A personal for Kevin Khatcha...
dourian?
- Careful, it's heavy.
- It is?
- Have a nice day.
- You too.
What are these for?
You never ride your bike.
I got these for a song of the web.
You make a bundle on them at school.
Like Donald Trump, huh.
I'll take you back to my ship.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

I'm charmed to meet you, young lady
- Yeah.
- Did you eat all your cereal?
- Yes.
- Did you eat all your cereal?
Alright.
You're a little clammy.
Are you okay?
Never better.
Hey.
Only three days to go till you're 16.
We should do something.
How about Sunday?
I don't know.
I might be tied up.
Come clean up some of this mess and then we're gonna get dressed and go.
I do not want to go to school.
I know, but daddy have to take a shower and then we'll go.
Say goodbye!
Do you think we could make some time later to talk.
Just the two of us, without the kids?
I really wanna work this thing out.
Doesn't Kevin go to Gladstone High?
Franklin...
Pick up the god damn phone!
Franklin...
I have my son in here.
Kevin?
Kevin!
Kevin!
Kevin!
Lauren!
Franklin?
Celia?
Franklin?
Celia?
You don't look happy.
Have I ever?
I'm almost 18, aren't I?
What is it?
Going to the big school making you nervous?
Nervous?
Do you know anything about those places?
Well.
You managed it all so well.
A child of a minor.
Out of your head on prozac.
You'll be out of here in a couple of years.
Do you know what day it is today?
Why the let me come see you on a monday?
Sure.
It's my anniversary.
Two years.
Plenty of time to think about it.
I want you to tell me why.

- Sure.
- Hi Eva.
- Hey, Al.
No, let go of me!
Let go of me, man!
- Get off me!
- Keep walking.
Hey lady.
Lady.
Lady.
Please help me!
I didn't do nothing, man!
Get off of me!
Eva, you can stop holding back.
Stop holding back, Eva.
Eva!
Rise and shine.
It's late, Eva.
The day is almost over.
- Hiii!
- Don't pick him up.
Please don't pick him up.
I just put him down, Franklin.
Hi.
There he is.
You wanna play?
You wanna play?
It's alright.
Just rock him a little bit.
He's alright.
Do you think I'm exaggerating?
You just have to rock him a little bit.
You just have to rock him a little bit.
There's my little dude!
Jesus!
All 12?
- I'll take them as they are.
- But they are totally broken ...
I will take them as they are!
You're gonna be a good looking boy.
All the girls are gonna love you.
I know it.
Don't wake up.
Don't wake up.
Can you say "mommy"?
"mom-my", "mommy", Kevin?
Can you say "ball"? "ball"?
"ba-", "ba-", "ba-".
"Ball"?
No?
Okay.
I'm gonna throw it to you, and you're gonna roll it back to me, okay?
Okay.
Roll it back to mommy.
Roll it back.
Roll.
Roll it back.
Okay, okay.
Roll it back, okay?
Roll it back.
Roll it back.
Roll it back.
When he was a baby, he never stopped screaming.
I thought maybe it had damaged his hearing.
No, his hearing is fine.
But shouldn't he be talking by now?
I read somewhere that non-verbalizing was the... an early sign of autism.
He has none of the tell-tale rocking signs.
I wouldn't worry about it too much.
He's a fluffy little boy, isn't he?
But there is nothing wrong with him.
Thank you.
Okay.
Roll it back to mom.
Okay.
Gonna roll it back again.
That was really good, Kevin.
Okay.
Here we go.
Okay?
Okay?
"E" is for elephant, large as a house, he's big as can be, not small as a mouse.
Can you say "Elephant, Kevin?
"Elephant"?
"Elephant".
Kevin!
Kevin?
Can you say "mommy" for me?
No!
- "mommy"?
- No!
- Just say "mommy".
- No.
Trick or treat?
Trick or treat?
Hey lady.
We know you're in there.
I don't like that!
I don't like that!
I don't like that!
Mommy was happy before little Kevin came along.
Do you know that?
And now mommy wakes up every morning... and wishes she was in France!
That elevator is a death trap.
He needs a yard, somewhere he can toss a ball, fill a pool.
But I love New York.
Come on!
You sound like a bumper sticker.
It's a matter of priorities, Eva.
He's only gonna be a kid once.
You can house hunt all you want.
I'm telling you, I'm not leaving the city.
Kevin, stop that.
That's enough.
Let mommy and daddy talk.
Kevin, quit that!
You have your family room here.
Master bedroom is back there and two huge walking closets.
The bathroom is amazing.
Here we are guys.
Our very own castle.
I'm gonna go and grab some lunch.
Does anybody want anything?
Hey!
Hey!
Wait up!
Ms. K!
Hey.
It's me.
Soweto.
Hi there.
I just wanted to see how you were.
I'm fine.
Thanks.
You look well.
Yeah.
The doctors are saying there's a chance I might walk again.
That's great.
You take care, ms.
K.
You too.
Come on, come on!
Die!
Die!
No!
No!
No!
- Die!
- How do you jump?
Die!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Die!
Hey Kev?
Are you out there?
Kevin?
Kevin, you hear that?
Dad goes pee pee.
You can do that too.
So you want a connector right there.
You see?
And click on that link and it should open right up.
And If it doesn't ...
we'll try it again.
- So you left click.
Wanna give it a try?
- Yes.
- No, no.
- I'm sorry.
- Right click, right there.
- Yeah.
See that?
It comes up.
Right.
Yeah, thanks.
I think I got it.
Thank you for your help.
I pooped.
Hey buddy.
What?
You pooped?
Oh okay.
Here let me help you.
Okay.
Go to your room.
I'll be right there.
Let's not wake up mommy.
Go on!
Go on, buddy.
These scribled squares of paper.
They are dumb.
Everybody needs a room of their own.
You have your room.
This is the mother's room.
I can help you make your room special, if you'd like.
What do you mean, "Special"?
Well, so it looks like your personality.
What personality?
I think you know what I mean.
They're dumb.
No, no, no.
I mean it's good.
You don't need me to do that?
And... and the guy...
Okay.
Well, I mean if you handle the lot ...
I could.
Really?
Well.
That all sounds great.
Okay, John.
Okay.
I'll talk to you later.
Goodbye.
Kevin?
Kevin?
What else do you have to say?
Go wash your face!
He said, he's really sorry.
And that he was only trying to help make it special.
Do you remember how you got that?
It's the most honest thing you ever did.
Do you know how they potty train cats?
They stick their noses in their own shit.
They don't like it.
So they use the box.
Okay.
Let's work on our counting.
- What comes after 3?
- 9.
- What comes after 7?
- 71.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,
41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.
Now, can we quit?
There.
You can add that together if you think you're so smart.
You did not ...
You did not ...
Are you enjoying yourself?
I can see the doctor by myself.
I have to tell you something, Eva.
It's a brave boy you've got there.
- Thank you.
- That's fine.
What mamma did was very, very wrong.
And she's so, so sorry.
Kev?
Kev, hold on a sec!
Kev?
Kevin?
Hey Kev.
What happened?
I broke my arm.
How did you brake your arm?
I had poopy pants.
Mommy went to get wipes.
I fell off the changing table onto my dump trucks.
Mom took me to doctor Goldbutt.
It's all my fault.
No, don't be silly.
You can't watch him every second of the day.
Franklin ...
Unbelievable.
How did you get him to do that?
Well, whatever it was it worked.
Not yet.
Okay.
I love you, kiddo.
I don't like that.
Turn it off.
Honey.
Do you mind if we stop over at the store?
I wanna go home.
It's just that I need to pick up...
Home it is.
Hi guys!
Hi Dad.
How was work?
Did you take any cool pictures?
Eva, he is just a boy.
He's a sweet little boy.
That's what boys do.
Mom is fat!
When did you ...
When were you gonna tell me?
Soon.
Now.
How am I part of the decision now?
What am I supposed to say now?
So, the daddy bear plants his seed in the mommy bear and it grows into an egg.
Is this about fucking?
Do you know what that means?
The boy puts his pee pee in the girl's doo doo.
Well ...
Haven't you ever wished you had somebody around to play with?
No.
You might like it.
What if I don't like it?
Then you get used to it.
Just because you're used to something ... doesn't mean you like it.
You're used to me.
Yes, well ...
In a few months we're all gonna get used to somebody new.
Beautiful.
Hey Kev.
Come on and meet your little sister.
This is your brother.
It's Kevin.
It's your big brother.
Yes, that's right.
It's Kevin.
Yes, yes ...
Kevin!
Don't do that.
No, Kevin.
That's not nice.
No problem dear.
We're getting snacks, okay?
Come on.
Christ!
To Ecuador?
For 2 months?
Why can't they send someone else?
I really wanna work this deal.
First he cries too much, then he's too quiet.
Then he makes up his own little language, and that is annoying.
He has trouble communicating.
A lot of kids do.
And you see this as some kind of personal vendetta?
It's not good for him.
Franklin, pick up the god damn phone!
Pick up the god damn phone.
... 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 20, 21, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 ...
Please.
Please.
Let me have a drink.
Please
Kevin?
Kevin!
Honey?
Are you ok?
I'm sorry mom.
Not to worry, sweetheart.
You couldn't help it.
"By my soul," cried Gilbert.
"Aren't thou the devil in blue to shoot in that way?"
"Nay," posed Robin, laughing.
"Not quite so ill as that I trust."
"Then he took up another shaft ..." Are you okay, honey?
Then he took up another shaft, and fitted it to the string.
Again he shot.
Again, he smoathed the arrow close beside the center.
The third time, he losed his bowstring and dropped the arrow just betwix the other two, and into the very center, so that the feathers of all three were ruffled together seeming from a distance to be one big shaft.
And now a low murmur ran all along the great crowd.
Hey champ.
How are you doing?
Feeling better?
Go away.
I'm tired.
Oh.
Okay.
Sure thing, buddy.
You just get some rest, okay?
Don't stop reading, mom.
280 score shafts were shot in all and so deftly were they sped, that when the shooting was done each target looked like the back of a hedgehog ... when a farm dog snuffed at it.
Good afternoon, ma'am.
I hope this isn't an inconvenient time.
Well, it is actually.
Well, we just have a couple of quick questions for you.
What is it about?
Do you know where you are spending the afterlife?
Oh, yeah.
I do as a matter of fact.
I'm going straight to hell.
Eternal damnation.
Thank you for asking.
Okay?
Hey honey.
Let me help you with that.
I can dress myself.
Can you leave?
Sure.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
Do you want some more of that chowder for lunch?
Whatever.
- Or grilled cheese sandwich?
- I don't give a rat's ass.
Thanks Dad, this is so cool.
You're welcome, buddy.
Right.
Here we go.
In the middle.
Ooooh.
Almost.
Here.
Take that one.
Try again.
Use your finger ...
Keep your eyes in the middle.
Good shot, Kev.
You're a natural.
Perfect.
Thanks Dad.
Right.
It's like this.
You wake up.
Then you watch TV.
You get in the car, then you listen to the radio.
Then you go to you little job or your little school but we're not gonna hear about that on the 6pm news.
Why?
Because nothing is really happening.
Thenyougo home and watch some more TV.
Ormaybeit 'safun night, and you go out and you watch a movie.
I mean it's got so bad, that half the time the people on TV, inside the TV, they're watching TV.
And what are all these people watching?
People like me.
And what are all you doing right now?
You're watching me.
Don't you think you would have changed the channel by now if all I did was getting "A" in geometry?
Me and Kevin were plaiying "Christmas kidnapping".
Kevin!
Kevin, you're my friend!
You're my friend.
Beat it, Celia.
Get me a soda.
Not that, you retard.
Get me a Root Beer.
What ?
Thank you, Celia.
I was thirsty.
Hey, you wanne know a secret?
Come closer.
Do you know who else is thirsty?
You don't?
It's the vacuum monster.
Cut it out!
- Hey troops!
- Daddy!
Ho, ho, ho.
See what I got!
Kev, come here.
Give me a hand.
Yeah, sure dad.
- You wanna dance?
- No thanks, Harland.
- Come on.
Just one.
- I don't dance, really.
Where do you get off, you stuck up bitch?
Do you think anyone else is gonna want you now?
Come on.
Stay for another drink.
Come on.
Come on.
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.
Can we leave a carrot for the reindeer!
- Should we?
- Yeah.
Kevin!
Didn't I see you at the bookstore today?
No.
Oh, I could have sworn.
By the way, are you doing anything on Friday?
Why?
I just thought we might do something together.
For fun.
Like, do what?
Maybe take you for dinner.
Or play around with miniature golf?
Okay.
Why didn't you bring a coat?
You just can't get uncomfortable enough, can you?
Uncomfortable?
With my own mother?
Whenever I see fat people, they are always eating.
Dont' give me any of this "slower metabolism thyroid gland" crap.
It's food.
They are fat because they eat the wrong food.
Too much of it, and all the time.
You know, you can be kind of harsh sometimes.
You're one to talk.
Yeah, I am.
I wonder where I got it.
Well, you won.
So.
What next, momsy?
We're gonna go home.
You're gonna get changed into something reasonable.
And I take you to dinner.
Great.
We're going to dinner.
I was hungry.
I'm a growing boy, you know.
I'll have a calorie salad, steak, medium rare, and a bottle of Merlot.
Very well.
So, how is school going?
It's going.
on a course schedule.
How about the teachers?
Are there any of them ...
Right, right, what bands am I listening to these days?
Next you can read all about if there isn't some cute little cunt in the front row who's got me itchy.
Then you can segway into the whole, it's all up to me of course but before bailing the chick in the hallway I might decide to way until I'm ready.
Right around dessert, you can ask about drugs
Real careful, like cause you don't want to scare me into, like, lying my head off.
So you have to say, like, how you experimented.
Then finally once you've sucked up that entire bottle of wine, you can go all gooey eyed and say how nice it is to spend quality time together, then scooch over and put your arm around my shoulder.
Give it a little squeeze.
Fuck!
- Your computer is fucked, isn't it?
- Yeah.
It's fucked.
And so are all the ones at work.
I guess I deserved it.
- Why would you let out something like that?
- I collect them.
Isn't that a weird thing to collect?
I don't like stamps.
But what is the point?
There is no point.
That's the point.
No, it really hasn't been any trouble at all.
Everybody is bringing a dish.
Oh.
That's him now.
I got to go.
You have a great day.
Bye, mom.
Merry Christmas.
Alright, Kev.
You're next.
Can you guess what it is?
That's a series 7.
The guy in the store said it was the best one.
- Gee, dad.
Thank you so much.
- Merry Christmas.
What did you have for breakfast?
Had a good day, Snuffles?
Did you hear that thump?
That's a powerful thing, man.
Celia!
Come on, honey.
Time for bed Here we go.
I thought I closed the door.
Kevin said I was stupid, and he was right.
You're not stupid, honey.
Don't you worry.
We'll find him.
Now you scoop down.
Come on.
Cozy?
I'm sure Snuffles has gone to the big pet store in the sky.
- Don't say that!
Don't say that!
- Yes.
It's the truth!
Dearly beloved,
We are gathered here to mourn mr.
Snuffles ...
Stop it!
Who will ... tragically early ...
So daddy and mommy were looking for him the whole night.
And you know why we couldn't find him?
Because Snuffles has gone to live in the garden.
He's living in the garden now, with a whole bunch of new animal friends.
Celia.
Okay, give me the spoon.
So, they're having a big party tonight... with the chipmunks, and the squarrels, and the racoons ... and they're eating nuts, and berries, and they're gonna have a whole bunch ...
Why did you leave the drain stuff out?
I didn't.
- I put it way.
- Then how did it get out?
Ask Kevin.
Kevin did it.
You need to go talk to someone.
Uhm Kev.
Mom has something else she wanted to tell you.
I wanted to ... thank you for calling the ambulance.
And?
And ...
I was concerned that you might be feeling responsible.
Why is that?
Because you was supposed to be looking after her.
We just don't want you to blame yourself.
No.
I don't ...
I never said I did.
She's gonna need a glass eye, Kevin.
So, we would appreciate you looking after her, and any namecalling ...
You don't really remember being a kid much do you, dad?
Celia is just gonna have to suck it up.
I thought you didn't like those.
Well, they're a ...
Now what do you call it ... an acquired taste.
I'm so sorry.
There you go.
Okay.
Thank you, mommy.
- Hey kiddo.
You're going to practice?
- Yeah, you know it.
- Hey Celia, you wanna come collect arrows?
- No!
So ...
What do you want to do?
Let's wait for the school year to end, and make arrangements for this summer.
At least the custody is a no-brainer.
Is it?
You've decided?
Eva, there's nothing left to decide.
It already happened.
- I needed a drink of water.
- Hi, Kev.
Listen, buddy, it's easy to misunderstand something if you hear it out of context.
Why would I not know the "context"?
I am the context.
- You have to appeal to reject punitive damage.
- No.
You'll lose everything.
The business, your house.
I hate the house.
I always have.
You'll rot in hell!
A personal for Kevin Khatcha ...
dourian?
- Careful, it's heavy.
- It is?
- Have a nice day.
- You too.
What are these for?
You never ride your bike.
I got these for a song of the web.
You make a bundle on them at school.
Like Donald Trump, huh.
I'll take you back to my ship.
1, 2, 3.

I'm charmed to meet you, young lady
-Yeah.
- Did you eat all your cereal?
-Yes.
- Did you eat all your cereal?
Alright.
You're a little clammy.
Are you okay?
Never better.
Hey.
Only three days to go till you're 16.
We should do something.
How about Sunday?
I don't know.
I might be tied up.
Come clean up some of this mess and then we're gonna get dressed and go.
I do not want to go to school.
I know, but daddy have to take a shower and then we'll go.
Say goodbye!
Do you think we could make some time later to talk.
Just the two of us, without the kids?
I really wanna work this thing out.
Doesn't Kevin go to Gladstone High?
Franklin ...
Pick up the god damn phone!
Franklin ...
I have my son in here.
Kevin?
Kevin!
Kevin!
Kevin!
Lauren!
Franklin?
Celia?
Franklin?
Celia?
You don't look happy.
Have I ever?
I'm almost 18, aren't I?
What is it?
Going to the big school making you nervous?
Nervous?
Do you know anything about those places?
Well.
You managed it all so well.
A child of a minor.
Out of your head on prozac.
You'll be out of here in a couple of years.
Do you know what day it is today?
Why the let me come see you on a monday?
Sure.
It's my anniversary.
Two years.
Plenty of time to think about it.
I want you to tell me why.
I used to think I knew.
Now I'm not so sure.
Time is up.
When you go to the ball ... you have to learn how to dance like a princess, right?
1, 2, 3 ...
1, 2, 3 ...
- 1, 2, 3 ...
- Yeah!
What are you gonna wear today?
- I'm gonna wear ...
- You're gonna wear ...
- I'm gonna wear ...
- A bucket on your head.
- No!
- 1, 2, 3 ...
No?
- And a barrel round your bottom.
- No!
- And cloth bags for shoes?
- Nooo!
1, 2, 3 ...
1, 2, 3 ... 1, 2, 3 ...
1, 2, 3 ...
Good morning.
Hey buddy!
Want something to eat?
No.
I'm not hungry.
Yeah, that's fine.
Yeah.
Franklin?
Hey.
It's me.
I just wanted to leave a message.
Do you think we could make some time to talk later just the two of us without kids?
I really wanna work this thing out.
Okay?
I miss you.
Eva Khatchadourian!
It's a lot.
Look, Eva.
I don't really care who you are or what you've done as long as you can type and you can file.
You can have this job.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Thank you.
I wont let you down.
I promise you.
Thank you.
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.
See you Monday.
Great.
Thank you.
Looks like someone is having a nice day?
Enjoying yourself?
I'm sorry?
I hope you rot in hell, you fucking bitch!
Jesus.
What the hell was that?
Are you ok?
No, no, no, it's nothing.
Its really... its nothing.
- Let me call an ambulance.
- No, no, it was my fault.
- But she just ...
- No, no, I'm fine.
Eva, when are you coming home?
I missed you.
I love you.
Promise me you'll never go away again.
I will never, never, never go away again.
Promise me.
Promise me you'll never go away again.
Is it safe?
No, it's not safe.
Sure?
Are you sure about this?
This really happened?
I can see, I can feel it ...
We did it.
I'm gonna need these processed today, Eva.
Uh, but today my afternoon off.
You remember?
I told you.
Ah shit, that's right.
- Look, give these to Massughi.
- Sure.
- Hi Eva.
- Hey, Al.
No, let go of me!
Let go of me, man!
- Get off me!
- Keep walking.
Hey lady.
Lady.
Lady.
Please help me!
I didn't do nothing, man!
Get off of me!
Eva, you can stop holding back.
Stop holding back, Eva.
Eva!
Rise and shine.
It's late, Eva.
The day is almost over.
- Hiii!
- Don't pick him up.
Please don't pick him up.
I just put him down, Franklin.
Hi.
There he is.
You wanna play?
You wanna play?
It's alright.
Just rock him a little bit.
He's alright.
Do you think I'm exaggerating?
You just have to rock him a little bit.
You just have to rock him a little bit.
There's my little dude!
Jesus!
All 12?
- I'll take them as they are.
- But they are totally broken ...
I will take them as they are!
You're gonna be a good looking boy.
All the girls are gonna love you.
I know it.
Don't wake up.
Don't wake up.
Can you say "mommy"?
"mom-my", "mommy", Kevin?
Can you say "ball"? "ball"?
"ba-", "ba-", "ba-".
"Ball"?
No?
Okay.
I'm gonna throw it to you, and you're gonna roll it back to me, okay?
Okay.
Roll it back to mommy.
Roll it back.
Roll.
Roll it back.
Okay, okay.
Roll it back, okay?
Roll it back.
Roll it back.
Roll it back.
When he was a baby, he never stopped screaming.
I thought maybe it had damaged his hearing.
No, his hearing is fine.
But shouldn't he be talking by now?
I read somewhere that non-verbalizing was the... an early sign of autism.
He has none of the tell-tale rocking signs.
I wouldn't worry about it too much.
He's a fluffy little boy, isn't he?
But there is nothing wrong with him.
Thank you.
Okay.
Roll it back to mom.
Okay.
Gonna roll it back again.
That was really good, Kevin.
Okay.
Here we go.
Okay?
Okay?
"E" is for elephant, large as a house, he's big as can be, not small as a mouse.
Can you say "Elephant, Kevin?
"Elephant"?
"Elephant".
Kevin!
Kevin?
Can you say "mommy" for me?
No!
- "mommy"?
- No!
- Just say "mommy".
- No.
Trick or treat?
Trick or treat?
Hey lady.
We know you're in there.
I don't like that!
I don't like that!
I don't like that!
Mommy was happy before little Kevin came along.
Do you know that?
And now mommy wakes up every morning... and wishes she was in France!
That elevator is a death trap.
He needs a yard, somewhere he can toss a ball, fill a pool.
But I love New York.
Come on!
You sound like a bumper sticker.
It's a matter of priorities, Eva.
He's only gonna be a kid once.
You can house hunt all you want.
I'm telling you, I'm not leaving the city.
Kevin, stop that.
That's enough.
Let mommy and daddy talk.
Kevin, quit that!
You have your family room here.
Master bedroom is back there and two huge walking closets.
The bathroom is amazing.
Here we are guys.
Our very own castle.
I'm gonna go and grab some lunch.
Does anybody want anything?
Hey!
Hey!
Wait up!
Ms. K!
Hey.
It's me.
Soweto.
Hi there.
I just wanted to see how you were.
I'm fine.
Thanks.
You look well.
Yeah.
The doctors are saying there's a chance I might walk again.
That's great.
You take care, ms.
K.
You too.
Come on, come on!
Die!
Die!
No!
No!
No!
- Die!
- How do you jump?
Die!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Die!
Hey Kev?
Are you out there?
Kevin?
Kevin, you hear that?
Dad goes pee pee.
You can do that too.
So you want a connector right there.
You see?
And click on that link and it should open right up.
And If it doesn't ...
we'll try it again.
- So you left click.
Wanna give it a try?
- Yes.
- No, no.
- I'm sorry.
- Right click, right there.
- Yeah.
See that?
It comes up.
Right.
Yeah, thanks.
I think I got it.
Thank you for your help.
I pooped.
Hey buddy.
What?
You pooped?
Oh okay.
Here let me help you.
Okay.
Go to your room.
I'll be right there.
Let's not wake up mommy.
Go on!
Go on, buddy.
These scribled squares of paper.
They are dumb.
Everybody needs a room of their own.
You have your room.
This is the mother's room.
I can help you make your room special, if you'd like.
What do you mean, "Special"?
Well, so it looks like your personality.
What personality?
I think you know what I mean.
They're dumb.
No, no, no.
I mean it's good.
You don't need me to do that?
And... and the guy...
Okay.
Well, I mean if you handle the lot ...
I could.
Really?
Well.
That all sounds great.
Okay, John.
Okay.
I'll talk to you later.
Goodbye.
Kevin?
Kevin?
What else do you have to say?
Go wash your face!
He said, he's really sorry.
And that he was only trying to help make it special.
Do you remember how you got that?
It's the most honest thing you ever did.
Do you know how they potty train cats?
They stick their noses in their own shit.
They don't like it.
So they use the box.
Okay.
Let's work on our counting.
- What comes after 3?
- 9.
- What comes after 7?
- 71.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,
41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.
Now, can we quit?
There.
You can add that together if you think you're so smart.
You did not ...
You did not ...
Are you enjoying yourself?
I can see the doctor by myself.
I have to tell you something, Eva.
It's a brave boy you've got there.
- Thank you.
- That's fine.
What mamma did was very, very wrong.
And she's so, so sorry.
Kev?
Kev, hold on a sec!
Kev?
Kevin?
Hey Kev.
What happened?
I broke my arm.
How did you brake your arm?
I had poopy pants.
Mommy went to get wipes.
I fell off the changing table onto my dump trucks.
Mom took me to doctor Goldbutt.
It's all my fault.
No, don't be silly.
You can't watch him every second of the day.
Franklin ...
Unbelievable.
How did you get him to do that?
Well, whatever it was it worked.
Not yet.
Okay.
I love you, kiddo.
I don't like that.
Turn it off.
Honey.
Do you mind if we stop over at the store?
I wanna go home.
It's just that I need to pick up...
Home it is.
Hi guys!
Hi Dad.
How was work?
Did you take any cool pictures?
Eva, he is just a boy.
He's a sweet little boy.
That's what boys do.
Mom is fat!
When did you ...
When were you gonna tell me?
Soon.
Now.
How am I part of the decision now?
What am I supposed to say now?
So, the daddy bear plants his seed in the mommy bear and it grows into an egg.
Is this about fucking?
Do you know what that means?
The boy puts his pee pee in the girl's doo doo.
Well ...
Haven't you ever wished you had somebody around to play with?
No.
You might like it.
What if I don't like it?
Then you get used to it.
Just because you're used to something ... doesn't mean you like it.
You're used to me.
Yes, well ...
In a few months we're all gonna get used to somebody new.
Beautiful.
Hey Kev.
Come on and meet your little sister.
This is your brother.
It's Kevin.
It's your big brother.
Yes, that's right.
It's Kevin.
Yes, yes ...
Kevin!
Don't do that.
No, Kevin.
That's not nice.
No problem dear.
We're getting snacks, okay?
Come on.
Christ!
To Ecuador?
For 2 months?
Why can't they send someone else?
I really wanna work this deal.
First he cries too much, then he's too quiet.
Then he makes up his own little language, and that is annoying.
He has trouble communicating.
A lot of kids do.
And you see this as some kind of personal vendetta?
It's not good for him.
Franklin, pick up the god damn phone!
Pick up the god damn phone.
... 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 20, 21, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 ...
Please.
Please.
Let me have a drink.
Please
Kevin?
Kevin!
Honey?
Are you ok?
I'm sorry mom.
Not to worry, sweetheart.
You couldn't help it.
"By my soul," cried Gilbert.
"Aren't thou the devil in blue to shoot in that way?"
"Nay," posed Robin, laughing.
"Not quite so ill as that I trust."
"Then he took up another shaft ..." Are you okay, honey?
Then he took up another shaft, and fitted it to the string.
Again he shot.
Again, he smoathed the arrow close beside the center.
The third time, he losed his bowstring and dropped the arrow just betwix the other two, and into the very center, so that the feathers of all three were ruffled together seeming from a distance to be one big shaft.
And now a low murmur ran all along the great crowd.
Hey champ.
How are you doing?
Feeling better?
Go away.
I'm tired.
Oh.
Okay.
Sure thing, buddy.
You just get some rest, okay?
Don't stop reading, mom.
280 score shafts were shot in all and so deftly were they sped, that when the shooting was done each target looked like the back of a hedgehog ... when a farm dog snuffed at it.
Good afternoon, ma'am.
I hope this isn't an inconvenient time.
Well, it is actually.
Well, we just have a couple of quick questions for you.
What is it about?
Do you know where you are spending the afterlife?
Oh, yeah.
I do as a matter of fact.
I'm going straight to hell.
Eternal damnation.
Thank you for asking.
Okay?
Hey honey.
Let me help you with that.
I can dress myself.
Can you leave?
Sure.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
Do you want some more of that chowder for lunch?
Whatever.
- Or grilled cheese sandwich?
- I don't give a rat's ass.
Thanks Dad, this is so cool.
You're welcome, buddy.
Right.
Here we go.
In the middle.
Ooooh.
Almost.
Here.
Take that one.
Try again.
Use your finger ...
Keep your eyes in the middle.
Good shot, Kev.
You're a natural.
Perfect.
Thanks Dad.
Right.
It's like this.
You wake up.
Then you watch TV.
You get in the car, then you listen to the radio.
Then you go to you little job or your little school but we're not gonna hear about that on the 6pm news.
Why?
Because nothing is really happening.
Then you go home and watch some more TV.
Or maybe it's a fun night, and you go out and you watch a movie.
I mean it's got so bad, that half the time the people on TV, inside the TV, they're watching TV.
And what are all these people watching?
People like me.
And what are all you doing right now?
You're watching me.
Don't you think you would have changed the channel by now if all I did was getting "A" in geometry?
Me and Kevin were plaiying "Christmas kidnapping".
Kevin!
Kevin, you're my friend!
You're my friend.
Beat it, Celia.
Get me a soda.
Not that, you retard.
Get me a Root Beer.
What ?
Thank you, Celia.
I was thirsty.
Hey, you wanne know a secret?
Come closer.
Do you know who else is thirsty?
You don't?
It's the vacuum monster.
Cut it out!
- Hey troops!
- Daddy!
Ho, ho, ho.
See what I got!
Kev, come here.
Give me a hand.
Yeah, sure dad.
- You wanna dance?
- No thanks, Harland.
- Come on.
Just one.
- I don't dance, really.
Where do you get off, you stuck up bitch?
Do you think anyone else is gonna want you now?
Come on.
Stay for another drink.
Come on.
Come on.
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.
Can we leave a carrot for the reindeer!
- Should we?
- Yeah.
Kevin!
Didn't I see you at the bookstore today?
No.
Oh, I could have sworn.
By the way, are you doing anything on Friday?
Why?
I just thought we might do something together.
For fun.
Like, do what?
Maybe take you for dinner.
Or play around with miniature golf?
Okay.
Why didn't you bring a coat?
You just can't get uncomfortable enough, can you?
Uncomfortable?
With my own mother?
Whenever I see fat people, they are always eating.
Dont' give me any of this "slower metabolism thyroid gland" crap.
It's food.
They are fat because they eat the wrong food.
Too much of it, and all the time.
You know, you can be kind of harsh sometimes.
You're one to talk.
Yeah, I am.
I wonder where I got it.
Well, you won.
So.
What next, momsy?
We're gonna go home.
You're gonna get changed into something reasonable.
And I take you to dinner.
Great.
We're going to dinner.
I was hungry.
I'm a growing boy, you know.
I'll have a calorie salad, steak, medium rare, and a bottle of Merlot.
Very well.
So, how is school going?
It's going.
on a course schedule.
How about the teachers?
Are there any of them ...
Right, right, what bands am I listening to these days?
Next you can read all about if there isn't some cute little cunt in the front row who's got me itchy.

Give it a little squeeze.
Fuck!
- Your computer is fucked, isn't it?
- Yeah.
It's fucked.
And so are all the ones at work.
I guess I deserved it.
- Why would you let out something like that?
- I collect them.
Isn't that a weird thing to collect?
I don't like stamps.
But what is the point?
There is no point.
That's the point.
No, it really hasn't been any trouble at all.
Everybody is bringing a dish.
Oh.
That's him now.
I got to go.
You have a great day.
Bye, mom.
Merry Christmas.
Alright, Kev.
You're next.
Can you guess what it is?
That's a series 7.
The guy in the store said it was the best one.
- Gee, dad.
Thank you so much.
- Merry Christmas.
What did you have for breakfast?
Had a good day, Snuffles?
Did you hear that thump?
That's a powerful thing, man.
Celia!
Come on, honey.
Time for bed Here we go.
I thought I closed the door.
Kevin said I was stupid, and he was right.
You're not stupid, honey.
Don't you worry.
We'll find him.
Now you scoop down.
Come on.
Cozy?
I'm sure Snuffles has gone to the big pet store in the sky.
- Don't say that!
Don't say that!
- Yes.
It's the truth!
Dearly beloved,
We are gathered here to mourn mr.
Snuffles ...
Stop it!
Who will ... tragically early ...
So daddy and mommy were looking for him the whole night.
And you know why we couldn't find him?
Because Snuffles has gone to live in the garden.
He's living in the garden now, with a whole bunch of new animal friends.
Celia.
Okay, give me the spoon.
So, they're having a big party tonight... with the chipmunks, and the squarrels, and the racoons ... and they're eating nuts, and berries, and they're gonna have a whole bunch ...
Why did you leave the drain stuff out?
I didn't.
- I put it way.
- Then how did it get out?
Ask Kevin.
Kevin did it.
You need to go talk to someone.
Uhm Kev.
Mom has something else she wanted to tell you.
I wanted to ... thank you for calling the ambulance.
And?
And ...
I was concerned that you might be feeling responsible.
Why is that?
Because you was supposed to be looking after her.
We just don't want you to blame yourself.
No.
I don't ...
I never said I did.
She's gonna need a glass eye, Kevin.
So, we would appreciate you looking after her, and any namecalling ...
You don't really remember being a kid much do you, dad?
Celia is just gonna have to suck it up.
I thought you didn't like those.
Well, they're a ...
Now what do you call it ... an acquired taste.
I'm so sorry.
There you go.
Okay.
Thank you, mommy.
- Hey kiddo.
You're going to practice?
- Yeah, you know it.
- Hey Celia, you wanna come collect arrows?
- No!
So ...
What do you want to do?
Let's wait for the school year to end, and make arrangements for this summer.
At least the custody is a no-brainer.
Is it?
You've decided?
Eva, there's nothing left to decide.
It already happened.
- I needed a drink of water.
- Hi, Kev.
Listen, buddy, it's easy to misunderstand something if you hear it out of context.
Why would I not know the "context"?
I am the context.
- You have to appeal to reject punitive damage.
- No.
You'll lose everything.
The business, your house.
I hate the house.
I always have.
You'll rot in hell!
A personal for Kevin Khatcha ...
dourian?
- Careful, it's heavy.
- It is?
- Have a nice day.
- You too.
What are these for?
You never ride your bike.
I got these for a song of the web.
You make a bundle on them at school.
Like Donald Trump, huh.
I'll take you back to my ship.
1, 2, 3.

I'm charmed to meet you, young lady
- Yeah.
- Did you eat all your cereal?
- Yes.
- Did you eat all your cereal?
Alright.
You're a little clammy.
Are you okay?
Never better.
Hey.
Only three days to go till you're 16.
We should do something.
How about Sunday?
I don't know.
I might be tied up.
Come clean up some of this mess and then we're gonna get dressed and go.
I do not want to go to school.
I know, but daddy have to take a shower and then we'll go.
Say goodbye!
Do you think we could make some time later to talk.
Just the two of us, without the kids?
I really wanna work this thing out.
Doesn't Kevin go to Gladstone High?
Franklin ...
Pick up the god damn phone!
Franklin ...
I have my son in here.
Kevin?
Kevin!
Kevin!
Kevin!
Lauren!
Franklin?
Celia?
Franklin?
Celia?
You don't look happy.
Have I ever?
I'm almost 18, aren't I?
What is it?
Going to the big school making you nervous?
Nervous?
Do you know anything about those places?
Well.
You managed it all so well.
A child of a minor.
Out of your head on prozac.
You'll be out of here in a couple of years.
Do you know what day it is today?
Why the let me come see you on a monday?
Sure.
It's my anniversary.
Two years.
Plenty of time to think about it.
I want you to tell me why.
I used to think I knew.
Now I'm not so sure.
Time is up.

Don't move or I'll blow your head off.
Who else is here?
Who owns that car outside?
I do.
But it's really more like a lease...
Toss the keys over here.
- Okay, okay.
- Come on!
Empty the cash register.
- Start filling this bag.
Cigarettes, pack-
- Excuse me.
I also have this gun, you'll probably be needing that.
- Put it down!
Right now!
- Put it down!
Put it down!
Okay, don't want any trouble.
Toss the piece over here then.
I prefer not to throw it and risk the gun accidently going off...
Maybe I could slide it over?
Yes, slide it over to my feet, don't try anything funny.
Okay.
I'm just gonna move over to this aisle, and I slide it over to you.
Okay.
Sorry for the mess.
I couldn't decide.
Keep the change.
Wait!
What should I tell the police?
Tell the those Tae-Bo tapes really paid off.
Hands up, don't move!
Don't move or I'll blow your head off.

Previously on 90210:
- When did this start?
- After my accident,
I figured out that getting high helps with my stress.
- You have cancer?
- The doctors say I have three, maybe four years.
- Are you okay?
- I think I have the hots for a nerd.
Look, we're gonna have to keep this on the down-Iow.
I was thinking the exact same thing.
Give me a call.
It was me.
I'm the one who cheated with Navid.
I know.
Sent.
Yeah.
Really, with the Mexican radio?
Hey, before Christmas, I listen to carols.
So before spring break in Cabo, I'm gonna listen to Latino...
Okay.
I can't believe that in less than 24 hours, we're gonna be eating churros, dancing with mariachi bands and swimming with the dolphins.
Well, hopefully not at the same time.
Come on, get excited.
I already have a plan for all of us to go to El Squid Roe.
Oh, sushi in Mexico, that ends badly.
It's not sushi.
It's the coolest club in Cabo.
They have foam parties.
- Foam party?
- You dance in giant pits of foam.
Is that even sanitary?
Come on.
It's the last chance for all of us to party together in high school.
You're gonna dance in foam and you're gonna love it.
Mm-hm.
What's the matter?
Nothing we haven't seen before.
Hey, babe.
Would you leave the country with me?
I was thinking, uh, maybe Mexico?
Yeah, sure.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Just some jerks ogling me because they saw Adrianna's picture that she sent out.
Yeah.
Every time I walk down the hall,
I feel like I'm in one of those airport scanner x-ray things.
- Silver, I'm sorry...
- I hate her.
I mean it, I actually hate her.
- Okay.
You know what we should do?
- What?
We should leave the country.
You and me, let's go.
Yeah.
Teddy.
- Marco.
Remember me?
- Oh, sure.
Hey.
- How you been?
- Been all right.
You?
Good.
I mean, I'm blind in the eye you hit, but I can still play soccer.
Don't feel bad or anything.
I'd only feel bad if you lost sight in both eyes.
So, what about that tennis lesson you owe me?
- How about tomorrow?
- How about tonight?
Got a court in the backyard.
My dad's out of town.
I have a game tonight.
Right.
Just come by after.
We'll have the place to ourselves.
You know what?
I'm not looking for just a hookup.
- Okay.
- See you around.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey there.
I hadn't heard from you in a while.
I wanted to make sure you didn't move or accidentally skate off a cliff or something.
Uh, nope.
Nope, I'm still here.
Well, that's a relief.
You wanna come skate?
Uh...
Yeah...
You know, actually, I'm pretty busy.
I decided to take your advice and try to focus on school and stuff.
Yeah, yeah.
No, um, it's cool.
I get it.
It's probably a good idea, so...
Um, yeah, I'll see you around.
Yup, okay.
I'll see you.
Bye.
- Are we?
- Should we?
I have prophylactics.
Condoms.
- Are you sure you're ready?
- l...
I'm ready if you're ready.
Oh, I'm ready.
Prepare to have your world rocked.
Wow.
Wow.
Yeah.
- You're like a prodigy.
- Well, thank you.
Yeah.
No, seriously.
I mean, that would have been incredible even if you weren't a virgin.
Oh, I'm not a virgin.
Nor was I one prior to this wonderful experience.
- You've had sex before?
- Yeah, I have.
- With how many people?
- Oh, come on.
I don't wanna kiss and tell.
Tell me.
Max, how many?
All right, fine.
Let's just say less than the square root of 64.
You've had sex with 64 people?
Seven.
Math isn't your speciality, is it?
Apparently, it's not yours either.
I'm gonna miss you over break.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss this.
Yeah.
Me too.
Wow, a private jet.
Dude, this is gonna be the best vacation ever.
Now, this is the way to travel.
No lines, no security, no crying babies in the seat next to you.
It's an international flight, so there'll be lines and security on the other end.
- Really?
- Yeah.
At least you're clear of crying babies in the next seat.
- Right.
- Unless you sit next to Navid.
Oh!
Oh, burn.
Vamos a Mexico, bitches.
Whoo!
Is that Max Miller?
What is he doing here?
Hi, everyone.
My math tutor, Max.
- You brought a math tutor?
- Hey.
Oh, I'm failing precalc and there's a huge test when we get back.
If I don't do well, I won't get off the wait list for CU.
Guess you've never been one to pack lightly.
Really?
Who reads those things?
Me, I read these things.
Yeah, you should always be prepared, just in case of...
- Oh, my God.
- Disaster.
Why is she here?
- Okay, Silver's coming?
- Not if you're coming.
Yeah, Silver, sit down.
Yes, you are.
- You know what?
It's fine.
I'll leave.
- Okay.
- I can't believe you guys invited her.
- Stop it, both of you, all right?
You both have done horrible things to each other.
Really horrible things.
And we get why you're upset, but you're gonna have to get over it because you're both our friends, okay?
Whatever.
Hello, folks, and welcome aboard.
Please buckle your seat belts and prepare for the flight.
Watch out, Mexico, here we come.
- All right.
- Yeah.
Welcome to the Burro Encantado.
That means Enchanted Donkey.
- I see someone read our website.
- Ha, ha.
The spa is just down the hall.
And, of course, the beach is just a short walk across the dunes, where you will find parasailing, snorkelling, surfing, even swimming with the delfines.
See?
I told you there'd be delfines.
A few warnings.
The riptides here are stronger than they are in California, so be careful.
And do not drink the tap water, unless you want to spend your vacation in your hotel room.
Well, who needs water when we have margaritas?
All right.
You all right back there?
Your suitcase is bigger than my closet.
I like to have clothing options.
Never pegged you as a over-packer.
Like an onion, baby.
Layer after layer.
Yeah, layer after layer of clothing options.
Okay, 103.
Uh...
Silver?
This is a great room.
Oh, guac.
Oh, yes.
- I'm starving.
- Ha, ha.
Yeah, it's pretty nice.
The bedspread's really not my taste but, luckily, I brought a spare.
- What?
- Tell me you're kidding.
I'm kidding.
Mm.
Right?
Mm.
So good.
You're really digging that guacamole, huh?
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, my God, Navid.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes, yes, yes.
It's 7:32.
Exactly.
Which means we're already behind schedule.
It's our first day in Cabo, we have so much to do.
Like zip-line in the jungle and shopping in the mercado.
Oh, and it would be so great if we could squeeze in lunch at this amazing little café that I read about.
Hey, come on.
Oh, okay, all right.
I'm up.
I just thought the whole point of vacation was to sleep and relax.
Which is why I have "relaxing by the pool"
scheduled for later this afternoon.
You scheduled time to relax?
I may have.
But I also set aside a little time tonight for skinny-dipping.
But, you know, if you don't like schedules,
I can forget about it all.
It's really not...
What are you talking about?
I love schedules.
Hey, shower now.
Kiss later.
- But let us...
- Nope, nope, nope.
Up, up, up.
Let's go.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Thank you.
There are some very cute boys around here.
Yeah, but they're all straight.
Well, regardless, I'm really glad you're ready to get back on the horse.
Or the burro, as it were.
- That is a horrible expression.
- You know what I mean.
Come on, there's gotta be some prospects around here for you.
Last Friday, I did run into that guy, you know, from Malibu, that I hit with the tennis ball.
You ran into cute black-eye guy?
And?
And he asked me out.
That's great.
No, not so much.
I just wanna have a good time, you know?
Just keep things light, fun.
No strings attached.
Nothing wrong with that.
Well, he seemed to think differently.
Montgomery?
- Tripp Willinson.
- Hey, man.
What...?
What are you doing here?
I'm on spring break with my buddies from Princeton.
Us too.
Hey, this is Silver.
Silver, this is Tripp.
He was my roommate at Exeter.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
- This is crazy.
It's been forever.
- Yeah.
Okay, you and me, we're grabbing beers tonight.
What do you say?
- Sounds good.
- Okay, cool.
- I'll find you.
- All right.
Nice to meet you.
That's wild, you running into him.
Yeah.
It's weird.
Good weird or another kind of weird?
Well, I mean, he was my roommate, but...
He was also the first guy I ever had feelings for.
Yeah, I was so freaked out, I had to drop out of Exeter.
Wow.
I mean, ahem, I'm happy to see him and all, it's just I'm not exactly looking forward to a night of pretending to be straight.
That's amazing.
- Sorry.
Sorry.
- Ha, ha.
Oh, my God.
Dixon, I'm pretty sure that is not how that is supposed to work.
Yeah, the guys at the bar made it seem so easy.
Yo, we're cool and everything, right?
I mean, there's like...
There's no weirdness after that time I asked you out in the cafeteria?
Yeah, we're cool.
Good.
Okay, because I...
I don't even know what I was thinking, but I just...
You know, I'd really like us to be friends again.
- Yeah, me too.
- Good.
Okay, so, uh, how about surfing tomorrow?
You know, as friends?
Yeah, okay.
Um...
There's just one thing I got to take care of.
Yeah, you go take care of your one thing and I'll see you in the water.
- Sounds good.
- All right.
- I'm gonna go, uh, clean up.
- You do that.
I love the service at this hotel.
Thanks.
I love it more.
Hi.
Excuse me.
I was wondering if you could do me a favour.
You see that short-haired girl over there?
The one with the ugly bathing suit?
Okay.
So I'm thinking about going and exploring the town later this afternoon.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
But I heard it was kind of far.
Yeah, right?
So I'm gonna hire a pool boy to carry me on his back.
Sounds good.
Hey, are you okay?
Oh, yeah.
Sorry.
Max is just giving me a look.
What look?
I'm not giving you a look.
Yes, you are.
And I know what it means.
Time to study.
Well, you know, I can't really tolerate this slacking off much longer.
Fine.
You guys have fun.
I'll see you later.
Would you like a bottle of water?
Yes.
Thank you.
What did I tell you?
I love the service at this hotel.
Tell me about it.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm not wearing a hat.
If you're not gonna wear the shirt, then you gotta wear the hat.
I'm really okay wearing my own clothes.
Just trying to have a little fun, jeez.
Oh, my gosh.
We so have to get a photo.
Absolutely not.
Yes, come on.
Someday we'll look back at it and think about how we were young and in love in Mexico.
I'm not taking a photo with that overgrown tree rat.
It's adorable.
It's wearing people clothes.
You know how I feel about animals in people clothes.
Please?
Okay, fine, one photo.
Yay!
- Okay.
Okay.
- Okay.
Stand together.
Closer to the mono, okay?
Say, "Best spring break ever."
Best spring break ever.
Ow!
Oh, my God.
Any chance you wanna relaunch that rocket?
I can't believe that your friends are actually buying this whole thing.
Mm.
What whole thing?
The whole...
You're failing math, so you need to bring a tutor to Mexico thing.
Oh, well, it's not that far-fetched.
I mean, I actually am failing math.
You're failing math?
- Is a 59 average failing?
- Yes.
So I'm not so good with numbers.
Naomi... I...
You realise that if you fail math, not only can't you get off the wait list at CU, you probably can't graduate.
I know, I know, okay?
But I just...
I guess I've been distracted by a handsome man with a big...
- Naomi.
- IQ.
I was gonna say IQ.
You know what?
I'm not gonna pretend to be your tutor anymore.
- No, we can't let people know.
- I really am gonna be your tutor.
I'm gonna make sure that you pass math.
Oh, Max.
Fine, but later.
No.
We're studying now.
We can have sex once you pass the practise test.
Oh, my God.
You are so twisted.
And I don't mean in a sexy S M kind of way.
- Hey.
- Hi.
I couldn't help but overhear that someone was sick.
Yeah, Silver's not feeling that great, so...
And now I'm feeling even worse.
Gosh, I hope you didn't drink any tap water.
That could really mess up your stomach.
Anyway, take care of yourself.
Oh, my God.
She did this to me.
She tricked me into drinking the tap water.
- Oh, she's going down.
- Hey, come here.
She's looking for a fight, okay?
- And if you wanna hurt her...
- I do.
Then ignore her, Silver.
Don't give her the reaction she wants.
That's the best way to hurt her.
I promise you.
Hey.
Uh...
Okay.
Uh...
Okay.
No.
Sorry.
No, no, no.
I don't want a pharmacy.
Um... I...
I want drogas illegales.
Marijuana?
You want pot?
Dude, why didn't you just say that?
- I can hook you up.
- Really?
Oh, that would be awesome.
- Thank you.
Yeah?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Sweet.
Another round?
Sure.
Oh, man, you know who I ran into last time I was in the city?
- Freedburger.
- Babyface Freedburger.
- How's that guy doing?
- Fantastic.
He's dating a set of twins.
Like, millionaire identical twins.
- Get out of here.
- No, gorgeous too.
I met one of them.
Or both?
I'm not sure.
Hey, speaking of gorgeous, is that Silver your girlfriend?
Silver, uh, no.
Well, she was.
We dated for a while, but we broke up.
Still up to your old tricks, huh?
Once a player, always a player.
Yeah, I guess.
You guess?
You're a legend, Montgomery.
I swear, after you left school,
I had half a mind to petition the Exeter Historical Society, see if they'd wanna preserve your bed.
You know, as a historical artefact?
Right.
So you and Silver are no more.
Are you seeing anyone now?
No.
You're not the relationship type, man.
I hear that.
I'm gay, Tripp.
You're kidding, right?
Teddy Montgomery's gay?
Look, I'm sorry if I made this night awkward...
Ugh.
Your shoulder still hurt?
- No.
No, I can barely feel it.
- That's good.
Because the pain in my abdomen from the rabies shot is making it hard for me to feel anything else.
Is there anything I could do to help?
You're very sweet, but, no, I'll be fine.
You should go and have fun, though.
Go swimming, relax.
Seriously, go.
Go.
I don't wanna ruin your vacation just because I'm stuck in here.
Okay.
Get some rest.
I will.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- How are you?
- Great.
Last night was amazing.
Yeah, it was.
There you are.
Hey, I'm Will.
Tripp's boyfriend.
I'm Teddy.
So this is who you hooked up with last night.
- Mm-hm.
- You're right.
He is hot.
I'm gonna get us some drinks, I'll be right back.
Okay.
You have a boyfriend?
No, boyfriend is a loose term.
Will and I have an open relationship.
It's cool.
I mean, come on.
Guys like you and me aren't the relationship type.
Hey, look who decided to show up.
Yeah, that's fine.
Hey.
It is sick out there.
You hear me?
Ha, ha.
They said the tide's coming in in about a half an hour so the waves are gonna be crazy.
- Hey, dude, aren't you freezing?
- What?
I'm freezing and you just came from the water, so I thought you'd be, you know, freezing.
Ivy, it's like a hundred degrees out here.
Are you okay?
Look, I might have smoked some pot.
You smoke?
Since when?
Since I realised that it really helps me get back into the water, you know, after my accident.
And then I met a guy and he smokes too, so...
Well, not like how you're thinking of.
He has to smoke for, like, medicine, you know, because he's sick or...
He's dying, actually.
I totally blew him off the other day, he...
I don't know, I feel like I'm not, like, ready to deal with that, you know?
Like, death, because it...
It's so final.
You know what I mean?
And I...
It kind of just really weirds me out and makes me really sad, actually, and...
I'm feeling really weird, dude.
I'm tweaking out.
I feel like that pot was probably laced with something.
Okay, okay.
Um...
Look...
This is what we're gonna do, okay?
We're just gonna chill out here, how's that sound?
Good?
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Okay.
- Just relax.
- Yeah.
Everything's gonna be fine, all right?
We're just gonna sit here, ride this out, all right?
Everything is okay.
Don't worry about nothing.
Everything's gonna be okay, all right?
This sun is strong.
Does anyone wanna borrow some sunblock?
Oh, right here.
Sunblock me.
Adrianna, you're welcome to use some if you want.
No, thanks, Silver.
I think I'll use my own.
You've been gone a while.
Yeah.
Sorry.
What is going on?
Just because you're stuck in bed doesn't mean you can't go on spring break.
Oh, my God.
Oh, you bought me churros?
After a dinner of enchiladas, you gotta have churros for dessert.
Okay, not that I'm complaining, but bubble bath wasn't really part of the itinerary.
No.
But foam parties was and so was skinny-dipping.
Thought maybe we could combine the two.
I don't understand, I thought you hated all of this stuff.
Well, I might not be a guy who loves churros and swimming with dolphins, but, uh, I'm a guy who loves a girl who loves churros and swimming with dolphins.
Oh, one more thing.
One day we could look back and remember being young and in love in Mexico.
Oh...
Best spring break ever.
Ever, ever.
One more sip.
I don't know what's worse, the bad high, or the bloated stomach from all the water you're pushing on me.
Aha.
Wow, was that an attempt at humour?
Someone's feeling better.
I am.
Thank you.
For sitting with me and stuff.
Hey, thank me by never smoking again.
Done.
Hey, uh, you hungry?
It'd probably be a good idea to get some food in your system.
Man, you are being way too nice to me, Dixon.
I mean, after what I did with Oscar and, you know, I just ruined it all.
Hey, I messed up too, all right?
Not as much as you, of course, but I messed up.
You know, I should've never lied to you about liking Sasha.
Yeah.
But, you know, not everything was ruined.
We definitely had a lot of fun together.
Yeah, we did.
I mean, I don't know about you, but I don't regret anything.
I mean, it's definitely going down as six months of my life that I'll always treasure.
Me too.
He has a boyfriend?
Yeah, but they have an open relationship.
Well, that's kind of perfect, then, right?
I mean, nothing says "no strings attached" like a guy who has a boyfriend.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
- Do you wanna date Tripp?
- No.
I mean, not after seeing him with that guy.
Yeah.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think I'm becoming one of those relationship people.
Whoo!
- Oh, my God, I'm lame.
- You are not lame.
You're just a good guy who's ready to get back on the relationship burro.
- Still a horrible expression, but...
- Well, I...
Yeah.
I think I am.
That's really great.
To getting back on the burro.
All right.
I'm finished.
And?
I knew you could do it.
Yay!
Ha, ha.
And you didn't miss a single one on the binomial section.
It's very, very impressive.
You really care about me, don't you?
Of course.
I mean, you care a lot.
Enough to give up having sex.
With me.
I am not in this relationship for sex, Naomi.
If I wanted to have sex, there are plenty of band girls who want me.
I mean, the flautists are practically nymphos.
But I'm with you because I like you.
I really like you.
I really like you too.
And you're smart.
I mean, the way you learned all that math so fast.
That was damn sexy.
We have to hurry.
It's almost time for the fiesta.
Oh, I'll show you a fiesta.
You like that?
You know that every guy here is jealous of me?
What?
Why?
Because I'm with you.
Well, you are the prettiest girl here.
You've had one too many margaritas, my boy.
Oh, I'm serious.
I'm really happy.
That's because of you.
Well, I'm really happy too.
Let's get this party started.
Where is the food?
I am starving.
Get a room.
I have one.
Silver!
Why is she so red?
You did this.
What are you talking about?
How can I give you a sunburn?
You messed with my sunscreen.
What'd you do, swap it for moisturiser?
Oh, my God.
I knew it.
You did.
You asked for it, Ade.
You made me drink tap water and I was sick all night.
- And what about the e-mail?
- An e-mail?
An e-mail is not quite up there with stealing my boyfriend.
- Ade.
- You bitch.
Hey, guys.
Oh, my God.
Do something.
I'm sorry.
I screwed up.
You think?
No, I should have been honest with you, Ade.
And, Silver, you bore the brunt of this.
And I should have taken more responsibility.
Hey, you...
You've both been friends a really, really long time.
I hope you don't let some idiot like me ruin that.
You really hurt me.
I'm so sorry.
I feel sick about what I did.
I'm torn up inside.
I betrayed you.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
I'm sorry I sent out that picture.
Yeah.
I hated that you hated me that much.
Does that even makes sense?
Yeah.
No, that makes sense.
I've missed being friends with you.
Honestly, Ade, I want our friendship back.
Me too.
Me too.
How do we make it better?
Break up with him.
Anything but that.
I'm...
I can't.
Why not?
Because I'm falling in love with him.
Okay.
Hello?
- Hey, Marco?
- Yeah.
It's Teddy Montgomery.
You know, the jerk from the other day.
Oh, hey.
Look, I'm sorry about how I acted and I was hoping well, maybe that you might still be up for that tennis lesson?
Yeah.
I'd like that.
All right, cool.
Cool.
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing?
You know, I've been better.
- You?
- Been worse.
Look, I'm sorry.
It's just that I've never really known anyone who's, you know...
Is as handsome as me?
Who's gonna die.
- Ivy, everyone's gonna die, you know.
- No, I know, Raj.
Just...
You're just...
You're really young, and...
Look, I get it.
It freaks you out.
It freaks me out.
And I totally understand if you're not up for being together with me.
No, but I am up for it.
Okay, look, I realised something when I was down in Mexico.
I realised that even if we're not gonna be together for very long,
I think that we really should just treasure the time that we do have together.
You know, whether that's six weeks or...
Whether I break up with you next week.
- Raj...
- Ha, ha.
I'm kidding.
Ivy, I can't imagine breaking up with you.
I'm really happy.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
Can I come in?
Of course.
So...
I was pretty thrown when I heard how serious you were about Navid.
I know.
But I've been thinking about it.
And...
Well, we've been friends for too long to let a guy come in between us.
Really?
- Ade.
- Silver.
I missed you.
I missed you too.
Oh, God, I'm such a mess.
Can I use your bathroom?
Of course.
Previously on 90210:
When did this start?
After my accident, I figured out
That getting high helps with my stress.
You have cancer?
The doctors say I have three...
Maybe four years.
Are you okay?
I think I have the hots for a nerd.
Look, we're gonna have to keep this on the down-low.
I was thinking the exact same thing.
Give me a call.
It was me.
I'm the one who cheated with navid.
I know.
He sent... (phones ringing)
Radio d.J.:
Buenos dias, los angeles!
Estan escuchando a...
Both:
Latino 109.7!
Really, with the mexican radio?
Hey, before christmas, I listen to carols,
So before spring break in cabo,
I'm gonna listen to latino 109.7.
Okay.
Oh!
I can't believe that in less than 24 hours
We're gonna be eating churros,
Dancing with mariachi bands and swimming with the dolphins.
Hopefully, not at the same time.
Come on.
Get excited.
I already have a plan for all of us
To go to "el squid roe."
Ooh, sushi in mexico-- that ends badly.
It's not sushi.
It's the coolest club in cabo.
They have foam parties.
Foam parties?
You dance in giant pits of foam.
Is that even sanitary?
Come on!
It's the last chance
For all of us to party together in high school.
You're gonna dance in foam
And you're gonna love it.
Mm-hmm.
(guy wolf whistles)
What's the matter?
Nothing we haven't seen before.
Hey, babe!
(chuckles)
Would you leave the country with me?
I was thinking, uh, maybe mexico.
Yeah, sure.
You okay?
I'm fine.
Just some jerks ogling me because they saw
Adrianna's picture that she sent out.
Yeah.
Every time I walk down the hall,
I feel like I'm in one of those
Airport scanner x-ray things.
Silver, I'm sorry...
I hate her.
I mean, I actually hate her.
Okay.
You know what we should do?
What?
We should leave the country.
You and me, let's go.
(school bell rings)
Teddy!
Marco.
Remember me?
Oh, sure.
Hey!
How you been?
Been all right.
You?
Good.
I mean, I'm blind in the eye you hit,
But I can still play soccer.
Don't feel bad or anything.
I'd only feel bad if you lost sight in both eyes.
So what about that tennis lesson you owe me?
How about tomorrow?
How about tonight?
Got a court in the backyard.
My dad's out of town.
Um...
I-I have a game tonight.
Right.
Just come by after.
We'll have the place to ourselves.
You know what?
I'm not looking for just a hookup.
Okay.
See you around.
Ivy:
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, there, stranger.
I haven't heard from you in a while.
I wanted to make sure you didn't move
Or accidentally skate off a cliff or something.
Uh, nope.
Nope, I'm still here.
Well, that's a relief.
You wanna come skate?
Uh, you know, actually, I'm, I'm pretty busy.
I-I decided to take your advice
And try to focus on school and stuff.
Yeah, yeah.
No, um, it's cool.
I get it.
It's probably a good idea, so...
Um, yeah, I'll see you around.
Yeah, okay.
I'll see ya.
Bye.
Are we...?
Should we?
I have prophylactics.
Condoms.
Are you sure you're ready?
I'm ready if you're ready.
Oh, I'm ready.
Prepare to have your world rocked.
Wow.
(chuckles)
Yeah...
You're like a prodigy.
Well, thank you.
No, seriously.
I mean, that would
Have been incredible even if you weren't a virgin.
Oh, I'm not a virgin.
Nor was I one prior to this wonderful experience.
You've had sex before?
I have.
With how many people?
Oh, come on.
I don't want to kiss and tell.
Tell me!
Max, how many?
!
All right, fine.
Let's just say less than the square root of 64.
You've had sex with 64 people?
(chuckles) seven.
Math isn't your specialty, is it?
Apparently, it's not yours either.
(laughs)
I'm going to miss you over break.
Yeah.
I'm going to miss you.
I'm gonna miss this...
Yeah, me, too.
(chuckles)
Dixon:
Wow, private jet.
Dude,
This is gonna be the best vacation ever.
Now this is the way to travel:
No lines, no security,
No crying babies in the seat next to you.
It's an international flight, so there'll be
Lines and security on the other end.
Really?
Yeah.
But, hey, at least you're clear of crying babies
In the next seat.
Right.
Unless you sit next to navid.
(all laugh)
Ooh.
(horn honking)
Vamos a mexico, bitches!
Whoo!
Is that max miller?
What is he doing here?
Hi, everyone.
My math tutor max.
You brought a math tutor?
I'm failing pre calc,
And there's a huge test when we get back.
If I don't do well, I won't get off the wait list for cu.
Guess you've never been one to pack lightly.
(chuckles)
Really?
(snorts) who reads those things?
Me.
I read these things.
You should always be prepared just in case of...
Oh, my god!
Disaster.
Why is she here?
!
Okay, silver's coming?
Uh, not if you're coming.
Yes, sliver, sit down.
Yes, you are.
You know what?
It's fine.
I'll leave.
Okay.
I can't believe you guys invited her.
Stop it, both of you, all right?
You both have done
Really horrible things to each other.
Really horrible things.
And we get why you're upset,
But you're gonna have to get over it
Because you're both our friends, okay?
Whatever.
Man (over p.A.):
Hello, folks, and welcome aboard.
The cabin doors are closing.
Please buckle your seat belts
And prepare for the flight.
Watch out, mexico, here we come!
(all cheering, whooping)
Welcome to the burro encantado.
That means "enchanted donkey."
I see someone read our web site.
The spa is just down the hall.
And of course, the beach is just a short walk
Across the dunes, where you will find parasailing,
Snorkeling, surfing,
Even swimming with the dolfinas.
See?
I told you there'd be dolfinas!
Host:
A few warnings.
The riptides here are stronger
Than they are in california, so be careful.
And do not drink the tap water,
Unless you want to spend your vacation in your hotel room.
Well, who needs water when we have margaritas?
!
Whoo!
Host:
Bienvenidos.
Bienvenido a mexico!
(all whoop)
You all right back there?
Your suitcase is bigger than my closet.
I like to have clothing options.
Never pegged you as a over-packer.
Like an onion, baby.
Layer after layer.
Yeah, layer after layer of clothing options.
Okay, 103.
(door slams)
Uh... (door slams)
Uh...
Silver?
This is a great room.
(gasps) guac!
Oh, yes!
I'm starving.
(chuckles)
Yeah, it's pretty nice.
The bedspread's really not my taste,
But, luckily, I brought a spare.
What?
Tell me you're kidding.
I'm kidding.
Mmm!
Right?
!
Mmm!
So good!
You're really digging that guacamole, huh?
Mmm-mm!
Mmm-hmm!
Mmm-hmm!
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god, yeah!
Yeah-yeah-yeah!
Oh, my god, navid!
Yeah!
(muffled):
Oh, yeah!
Oh, my god!
(thumping) oh, god!
Yes, yes!
Oh!
Buenos dias, novio guapo!
It's 7:32.
Exactly.
Which means we're already behind schedule.
It's our first day in cabo and we have so much to do:
Like zipline in the jungle and shopping in the mercado.
Oh, and it would be so great
If we could squeeze in lunch at this
Amazing little cafe that I read about.
Hey, come on!
Ah!
Okay, all right.
I'm up.
I just thought
The whole point of vacation was to sleep and relax.
Which is why I have "relaxing by the pool"
Scheduled for later this afternoon.
You scheduled time to relax?
I may have. (chuckles)
But I also set aside a little time tonight for skinny dipping.
Mmm?
!
But, you know, but if you don't like schedules
I can just forget about it all.
It's really not...
What are you talking about?
I love schedules...
Hey, shower now.
Kiss later.
But...
Let us...
Let...
No, no, no.
Up, up, up.
Let's go.
¶ ¶
Hey.
Hey.
Thank you.
There are some very cute boys around here.
Yeah, but they're all straight.
Well, regardless, I really glad
You're ready to get back on the horse.
Or the burro, as it were.
That is a horrible expression.
You know what I mean.
Come on, there's got to be some prospects around here for you.
Last Friday, I did run into that guy, you know, from malibu,
That I hit with the tennis ball.
You ran into cute black eye guy?
And?
And he asked me out.
That's great!
Not so much.
I just want to have a good time, you know.
Just keep things light, fun.
No strings attached.
Nothing wrong with that.
Well, he seemed to think differently.
Tripp:
Montgomery?
Tripp willenson.
Hey, man.
What-- what are you doing here?
I'm on spring break with some of my buddies from princeton.
Us, too.
This is silver.
Silver, this is tripp.
He was my roommate at exeter.
Nice to meet you.
You, too.
This is crazy.
Yeah.
It's been forever.
Okay, dude,
You and me, we're grabbing beers tonight.
What do you say?
Sounds good.
Okay, cool.
All right.
I'll find you.
All right.
Nice to meet you.
That's wild, you running into him.
Yeah.
It's weird.
Good weird, or another kind of weird?
Well, I mean, he was my roommate, but...
He was also the first guy I ever had feelings for.
Oh.
Yeah, I was so freaked out, I had to drop out of exeter.
Wow.
I mean, I'm happy to see him and all,
It's just I'm not exactly looking forward
To a night of pretending to be straight.
(laughing)
Sorry.
Sorry.
Oh, my god!
Dixon, I'm pretty sure that is not how that is supposed to work.
Yeah, the guys at the bar made it seem so easy.
Yo, we're cool and everything, right?
I mean there's, like, there's no weirdness
After that time I asked you out in the cafeteria?
Yeah, we're cool.
Good.
Good.
Okay, 'cause I...
I don't even know what I was thinking.
I just...
I'd really like us to be friends again.
Yeah, me, too.
Cool.
Okay, so, uh, how about surfing tomorrow?
You know, as friends?
Yeah, okay.
Um, there's just one thing I got to take care of.
You go take care
Of your one thing
And I'll see you in the water.
Sounds good.
All right.
I'm gonna go clean up.
(both laughing)
I love the service at this hotel.
Thanks.
I love it more.
¶ ¶
Hi.
Excuse me.
I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
You see that short-haired girl over there?
The one with the ugly bathing suit?
So I'm thinking of going and exploring the town later this afternoon.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
But I heard it was kind of far.
Yeah.
Right?
Silver:
So I'm going to hire a pool boy to carry me on his back.
Sounds good.
Hey, are you okay?
Oh, yeah.
Sorry.
Max is just giving me a look.
What look?
I'm not giving you a look.
Yes, you are.
And I know what it means.
Time to study.
Well, you know, I can't really tolerate
This slacking off much longer.
Ugh!
Fine.
(sighs) you guys have fun.
I'll see you later.
Hey, would you like a bottle of water?
Yes.
Thank you.
What did I tell you.
I love the service at this hotel.
Tell me about it.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Ah, I'm not wearing a hat.
Oh, come on.
If you're not gonna wear the shirt,
Then you gotta wear the hat.
I'm really okay wearing my own clothes.
Just trying to have a little fun.
Geez.
(gasps) oh, my gosh.
We so have to get a photo.
Absolutely not.
Yes.
Come on.
Someday we'll look back at it
And think about how we were young and in love in mexico.
I'm not taking a photo with that overgrown tree rat.
He's adorable.
He's wearing people clothes.
You know how I feel about animals in people clothes.
Please.
(sighs)
Okay, fine, one photo.
Yay.
Hola.
Por favor,
Queremos un photo con el monkey.
Okay.
Okay.
Stand together.
(squealing)
Guapa.
Closer to the mono, okay?
Say, "best
Spring break ever."
Both:
Best spring break ever.
(squealing) ow!
Oh, my god.
Ow!
Any chance you want to relaunch that rocket?
I can't believe that your friends are actually buying this whole thing.
What whole thing?
The whole...
You're failing math,
So you need to bring a tutor to mexico thing.
Well, it's not that far-fetched.
I mean, I actually am failing math.
You're failing math?
Is a 59 average failing?
Yes.
So I'm not so good with numbers.
Naomi, I...
You realize that if you fail math,
Not only can't you get off the wait list
At cu, you probably can't graduate.
I know, I know, okay?
But I just...
I guess I've been distracted
By a handsome man with a big...
Naomi...
Iq.
I was going to say iq.
You know what?
I'm not going to pretend to be your tutor anymore.
No, you have to.
We can't let people know.
I really am going to be your tutor.
I'm going to make sure that you pass math.
Oh, max.
Fine, but later.
No.
We're studying now.
We can have sex once you pass the practice test.
Oh, my god.
You are so twisted.
And I don't mean in a sexy sm kind of way.
(muffled retching)
(muffled retching, coughing)
(chuckles)
(toilet flushing)
Hey.
Hi.
I couldn't help but overhear that someone was sick.
Yeah, silver's not feeling that great, so...
And now I'm feeling even worse.
Ugh.
Gosh.
I hope you didn't drink any tap water.
That could really mess up your stomach.
Anyway, take care of yourself.
Oh, my god!
She did this to me!
She-- she tricked me into drinking the tap water.
Oh, she's going down.
Come here.
She's looking for a fight, okay?
And if you really want to hurt her...
I do.
Then ignore her, silver.
Don't give her the reaction she wants.
That's the best way to hurt her.
I promise you.
¶ ¶
Hey, um, perdona.
Hola.
Hola.
Como puedo ayudarte?
Uh...
Okay...
Uno momento...
Okay, estoy
Buscar para...
Um...
Uh, drogas.
Drogas.
Si.
Si.
Drogas.
Bueno.
Hay una farmacia en el hotel.
Tienen aspirin y cough syrup y--
Sorry.
No, no, no.
I don't want a pharmacy.
Um, I...
I want
Drogas ilegales.
Marijuana.
(chuckles)
You want pot?
Dude, why didn't you just say that?
I can hook you up.
Really?
Oh, that would be awesome.
Thank you.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Okay, yeah.
Thank you.
Sweet.
(both laughing)
Bartender:
Another round?
Sure.
Oh, man, you know who I ran into last summer when I was in the city?
Freeberger.
Babyface freeberger.
How's that guy doing?
Fantastic.
He's dating a set of twins.
Like, millionaire identical twins.
Get out of here.
Gorgeous, too.
I met one of them.
Or both?
I'm not sure.
(both laughing)
Hey, speaking of gorgeous,
Is that silver your girlfriend?
Hmm.
Silver-- um, no.
She was.
We dated for awhile, but we broke up.
So up to your old tricks, huh?
Once a player, always a player.
Yeah, I guess.
You guess?
You're a legend, montgomery.
I swear, after you left school, I had half a mind
To petition the exeter historical society--
See if they'd want to preserve your bed.
You know, as a historical artifact?
Right.
So you and silver are no more;
you seeing anyone now?
(clears throat) no.
You're not the relationship type, man.
I hear that.
I'm gay, tripp.
You're kidding, right?
Teddy montgomery's gay?
Look, I'm sorry if I made this night awkward...
¶ ¶
Ugh.
Your shoulder still hurt?
Uh, no.
No, I can barely feel it.
That's good.
Because the pain in my abdomen from the rabies shot
Is making it hard for me to feel anything else.
(sighs)
Is there anything I could do to help?
You're very sweet, but no, I'll be fine.
You should go and have fun, though.
Go swimming, relax.
(sighs)
Seriously, go.
Go!
I don't want to ruin your vacation
Just because I'm stuck in here.
Okay.
Get some rest.
I will.
(yelling, splashing in distance)
Tripp:
Hey.
How are you?
Great.
Last night was amazing.
Yeah, it was.
Man:
There you are!
Hey.
I'm will.
Tripp's boyfriend.
I'm teddy.
So...
This is who you hooked up with last night.
Mm-hmm.
You're right.
He is hot.
All right.
I'm gonna get us some drinks, I'll be right back.
Okay.
You have a boyfriend?
Nah, "boyfriend" is a loose term.
Will and I have an open relationship; it's cool.
I mean, come on.
Guys like you and me aren't the relationship type.
Look who decided to show up!
Hey.
Hey.
It is sick out there.
You hear me?
They said the tide's coming in
In about a half an hour...
So the waves are gonna be crazy.
Hey, dude,
Aren't you freezing?
What?
Well, I mean, I'm freezing and you just came from the water,
So I thought you'd be...
You know, freezing.
Uh...
Ivy, it's like 100 degrees out here.
Are you okay?
Look, I might've...
Smoked some pot.
You smoke?
Since when?
Since...
I realized that it really helps me
Get back into the water, you know, after my accident.
And then I met a guy and he smokes, too, so...
Well, not like how you're thinking of.
He has to...
Smoke, for, like medicine, you know, 'cause he's sick, or...
He's dying, actually.
And, like, I totally blew him off the other day, he...
I don't know, I feel like I'm not, like, ready...
To deal with that, you know?
Like, death, 'cause it...
It's so...
Final.
You know what I mean?
And I...
It kind of just really weirds me out, and...
Makes me s...
Really sad, actually, and... (breathes deeply)
I'm feeling really weird, dude.
I'm, I'm...
Tweaking out.
I feel like that pot was probably laced with something.
Okay, okay.
Um...
Look...
This is what we're going to do, okay?
We're just going to chill out here, how's that sound?
Good?
Okay.
Okay.
Just relax.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Mm-hmm.
We're just gonna sit here, ride this out, all right?
Mm-hmm.
Everything is okay.
Don't worry about nothing.
Everything's going to be okay, all right?
¶ ¶
Silver:
Whoo!
This sun is strong.
Does anyone want to borrow some sunblock?
Oh.
Right here.
Sunblock me.
Adrianna...
You're welcome to use some if you want.
No, thanks, silver.
I think I'll use my own.
(door opens)
You've been gone a while.
Yeah.
Sorry.

(laughs)
What is going on?
Just because you're stuck in bed
Doesn't mean you can't go on spring break.
(laughs)
Oh, my god.
Oh, you bought me churros?
Well, after a dinner of enchiladas,
You gotta have churros for dessert.
(laughing)
Uh, okay, not that I'm complaining, but
Uh, bubble bath wasn't really
Part of the itinerary.
Uh, no.
But foam parties was, and so was skinny dipping.
Thought maybe we could combine the two.
I-I don't understand, I thought you hated all of this stuff.
Well, I might not be a guy
Who loves churros and swimming with dolphins,
But, uh, I'm a guy who loves a girl
Who loves churros and swimming with dolphins.
Aw...
Oh!
One more thing.
Uh-huh...
So one day we could look back
And remember being young and in love in mexico.
Oh...
Best...
Spring break ever.
Ever, ever.
(singing in spanish)
Dixon:
One more sip.
Ugh.
I don't know what's worse, the bad high,
Or the bloated stomach from all the water you're pushing on me.
(gasp)
Wow, was that an attempt at humor?
(laughs)
Someone's feeling better.
I am.
Thank you.
For sitting with me and stuff.
Hey.
Thank me by never smoking again.
Done.
Hey, um, you hungry?
It'd probably be a good idea to get some food in your system.
Man, you are being way too nice to me, dixon.
(laughs)
I mean, after what I did with oscar, and...
I just ruined it all.
Hey, I messed up, too, all right?
True.
Not as much as you,
Of course, but...
I messed up.
You know...
I should've never lied to you about liking sasha.
Yeah.
But, you know, not everything was ruined.
We definitely had a lot of fun together.
Yeah, we did.
I mean, I don't know about you, but...
I don't regret anything.
I mean, it's definitely going down as six months of my life
That I'll always treasure.
Me, too.
He has a boyfriend?
Yeah, but they have an "open relationship."
Oh, that's kind of perfect, then, right?
I mean, nothing says "no strings attached"
Like a guy who has a boyfriend.
I'm not so sure.
Do you want to date tripp?
No.
I mean, not after seeing him with that guy.
Yeah.
I can't believe I'm saying this,
But I think I'm becoming one of those relationship people.
Whoo!
Oh, my god, I'm lame.
You are not lame.
You're just a good guy who's
Ready to get back on the relationship burro.
(laughs) still a horrible expression.
Right.
Yeah.
I think I am.
That's really great.
To getting back on the burro.
(laughs)
All right.
I'm finished.
And?
I knew you could do it.
Yay!
Yeah.
And...
You didn't miss a single one
On the binomial section.
It's very, very impressive.
You really care about me, don't you?
Of course.
I mean, you care a lot.
Enough to give up having sex.
With me.
I am not in this relationship for sex, naomi.
I mean, if I wanted to have sex,
There are plenty of band girls who want me.
I mean, the flautists are practically nymphos.
But I'm with you because I like you.
I really like you.
I really like you, too.
And you're smart.
I mean, the way you learned all that math so fast.
That was damn sexy.
Oh!
What?
We have to hurry.
It's almost time for the fiesta.
Oh, I'll show you a fiesta.
(singing in spanish)
You like that?
(laugh)
(giggles)
You know, every guy here is jealous of me.
What?
Why?
Because I'm with you.
You are the prettiest girl here.
You've had one too many margaritas, my boy.
No, I'm serious.
I'm really happy.
That's because of you.
Well, I'm really happy, too.
Let's get this party started.
Where is the food?
I am starving.
Get a room.
Adrianna:
Silver!
Why is she so red?
You did this.
What are you talking about?
How can I give you a sunburn?
You messed with my sunscreen.
What'd you do, swap it for moisturizer?
Oh, my god!
I knew it!
You did!
Silver:
You asked for it, ade.
You made me drink tap water and I was sick all night.
And what about the e-mail?
An e-mail?
Yeah.
An e-mail is not quite up there
With stealing my boyfriend.
Ade...
You bitch!
I'm sorry.
I screwed up.
You think?
I should have...
Been honest with you, ade.
And, silver, you bore the brunt of this.
And I should have--
I should have taken more responsibility.
Hey, you...
You've both been friends a really, really long time.
I hope you don't
Let some idiot like me ruin that.
(sniffs)
You really hurt me.
I'm so sorry.
I feel sick about what I did.
I'm torn up inside.
I betrayed you.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
I'm sorry
I sent out that picture.
Yeah.
I hated that you hated me that much.
If that even makes sense.
Yeah.
No, it makes sense.
I've missed being friends with you.
Honestly, ade, I want our friendship back.
Me, too.
Me, too.
How do we make it better?
Break up with him.
Anything but that.
I'm-
- I can't.
Why not?
Because I'm falling in love with him.
Okay.

Marco:
Hello.
Hey, marco.
Yeah.
It's teddy montgomery.
You know, the jerk from the other day.
Oh, hey.
Look, I'm sorry about how I acted.
And I was hoping-- well, that maybe you might still be up
For that tennis lesson?
Yeah, I'd like that.
All right, cool.
Cool.
Whew!
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing?
You know, I've been better.
You?
Been worse.
Look, I'm sorry.
It's just that I've never really known anyone who's,
You know, like...
Is as handsome as me?
Who's gonna die.
Ivy, everyone's gonna die, you know...
No, I know, raj.
You're just, you're really young, and...
Look, I get it.
It freaks you out.
It freaks me out.
And I totally understand
If you're not up for being together with me.
No, but I am...
Up for it.
Okay, look, I realized something
When I was down in mexico.
I realized that
Even if we're not going to be together for very long,
I think that we really should just treasure
The time that we do have together.
You know, whether that's six weeks, or...
Whether I break up with you next week.
Raj...
(chuckles)
I'm kidding.
Ivy, I can't imagine breaking up with you.
I'm really happy.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Come here.
¶ ¶
(knocking on door)
Hi.
Can I come in?
Of course.
So...
I was pretty thrown
When I heard how serious you were about navid.
I know.
But I've been thinking about it.
And...
Well, we've been friends for too long
To let a guy come in between us.
Really?
Ade...
Silver.
I've missed you.
I've missed you, too.
Oh, god, I'm such a mess.
(sniffs)
Um, can I use you bathroom?
Of course.

There are some things we can hide from... things we can leave behind.
and there are other things that are inside us, carried with us, wherever we go.
Things that are a part of us, before we've even left the womb.
Philip!
Philip!
Don't worry, Cathy.
Everything's going to be all right!
I suppose every family has its own share of quirks.
But the Furlongs were always a little more peculiar than most.
Just like Philip's father,
Charlie Furlong.
One day, Charlie saw something he never wanted to see.
Something that had a profound effect on him.
Ever since then, whenever he thought about sex
Charlie Furlong went blind for 37 minutes.
Mr. Charlie Furlong?
Yes, Mrs. Charlotte Furlong?
I'm ready for you.
It caused him a lifetime of problems, not least on his wedding night.
Their son,
Philip, also had an ability.
Like Charlie...
Open your mouth.
and all the Furlong men before him... he, too, had a strange gift.
Whenever he got frightened it knocks out everything electrical around him.
This should not have been a problem for him.
Except...
Cathy, you still with me, Love?
Oh my God!
Help me, Philip.
Cathy Furlong passed away before she even saw her baby.
But she had already chosen a name:
Marianne, if it was a girl.
And if it was a boy...
James Furlong.
By the time he was ten years old,
James Furlong had lost his grandfather, too.
Charlie Furlong died in a car accident.
He passed an advertisement for a Wonderbra... then crashed straight into a tree.
Look, but don't touch, you'll ruin his makeup.
Look, here is the first time I saw you in a photograph.
Having lost her husband and daughter-in-law,
James' grandmother regarded the Furlong Condition as nothing short of a curse.
And she was worried about its potential for James.
It was she who tried to warn him about his family history.
She moved in and home schooled James, keeping a close eye on him.
Come on, James, it's easy!
But instead of listening to her,
James secretly wished that he, too, had an ability.
Like walking through walls,
or bionic strength,
or, the ability to fly.
Where the hell have you been?
James.
I got kicked.
Kicked?
But who?
There's something wrong with the cow.
James, what happened?
What did you do, poison 'em?
Calm down, Philip.
Don't tell me to calm down!
Half the herd is lyin' dead out there.
Even the fuckin' grass is dead!
What are you talking about?
I knew there was something wrong with you from the day you were born!
- Come back here!
- Oh, Philip, Philip.
Get out of the car!
How dare you even set foot in there!
You ruined everything!
What did you do?
Oh, don't worry, James, it's only temporary, until we find a nice family for you.
C'mon, kids.
Keep it going!
Keep it going!
Ah, don't be scared, that's just Tinker,
He's a sweetie.
He'll be fine once he get to know you.
This is the dormitory and that is going to be your bed, where I'm sure you'll be very comfortable.
And why aren't you boys at hurling practice, huh?
Liam!
This is James.
and I want you to make him feel very welcome here.
Okay?
Yes, Mrs. Moore.
Good!
Liam!
Could you please take our new friend down to the laundry room and make sure he's given something good and warm to wear.
Yes, Mrs. Moore.
Now, run along!
Here, you can wear this.
It looks good.
Where's your clothes go?
Hey, gorgeous, where you hidden your cunny?
Come on, let's go.
Come on, Liam, then.
They're so stupid!
They always hide them in the same place.
Thank you.
Look who's robbing the kitchen again?
You want some jelly?
Go get them, fagot!
Hurry up, Furlong!
Move your ass!
- Liam!
Run!
- Shut your fucking mouth.
Last night an incident took place.
A very serious incident, that involved the death of one of our family here at St. Jude's.
Coach Hanley's beloved dog Tinker.
Quiet, Boys!
This is no laughing matter, believe you me!
I wish to speak to each and every single one of you individually today to find out exactly what happened.
And Kevin, you can take that smirk off you face and come with me.
I think I'll start with you.
You little fucker.
I should have squealed on you.
Why did you let him go?
Fuck!
- Kill him!
- You killed that dog for me.
You're gonna pay for it!
Stay out of it!
Kick the life out of him, Kevin!
Yeah!
Kevin?
James...
Okay, now, we're just gonna take a look at these stitches.
So if you want to, just hold this back for me there.
Okay.
It's all right, Baby, it's the last one.
Stitches look good!
Gorgeous, aren't they?
Mountain people think I had a cesarean section.
What do you think?
I'm afraid the incision's rather bigger than we normally do for a cesarean.
Well, I'll just say I had a giant baby, then!
Be serious for a second, will you!
What the verdict, Doctor?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Would you excuse us for a moment, Mae?
I don't think she's going to recover.
How long, Doctor?
Well, it's really anybody's guess.
Could be 3 weeks, could be 3 months.
The most important thing we can do is make her feel as comfortable as possible.
Oh, my God!
- Hi, Liam.
- Oh, hi.
You're looking better today.
The wonders of makeup!
So, um...
What did the doctor say?
They gonna operate again.
No, he says I've made a miraculous recovery, and I can go home whenever I want.
Then what are you still doing here, then?
Good question, Liam.
Are... are you going for a walk?
Hey, Mae, you know you're not supposed to leave the grounds!
What are you gonna do, tell on me?
Hey, Mae, where are you going?
Every family has its own legacy.
Good or bad, we inherit it all.
From allergies, to bad eyesight, big noses, to cancer,
which is what I got.
Not the big nose, but the cancer.
I would have preferred a big nose, or a weak heart, or a humped back.
But my father didn't have any of those, either.
In each generation, going right back, from prostate to bowel, throat to brain tumor, we've had every flavor of cancer there is.
Mine was in my intestines.
So I decided it was okay to keep smoking.
Shit!
Hello!
Is someone there?
Thanks.
I'm not contagious, you know.
Don't let the clothes fool you.
I'll go as soon as the rain stops.
You'll never even know I was here.
Can you pass my bra?
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ which is Greek to me.
I'm Mae, by the way.
West.
Mae...
Mae West?
O'Mara.
My mother named me after the film star.
What's your name?
James.
Just James?
Did you make these, James?
You're a real chatterbox, you know that?
It's my music.
You want to listen?
I'll trade you.
This is spectacular.
Is it duck?
Is it duck?
It's... pheasant.
And squirrel.
Did you like it?
Of course you did, it's Motown.
Of course...
Motown.
I don't think it's a place.
It's a record label, from the '60s.
Diana Ross and the Supremes...
Motown!
My dad used to play it.
So, what happened out here?
It looks like a nuclear bomb went off.
It's been like that for a while.
Must be something wrong with the soil.
So, what's the story with you, James?
Are you some kind of woodsman or something?
How long have you lived here?
A few years.
And you like it?
I've never eaten an owl before.
There's owl in this, too.
How many other, cute, little animals am I eating here?
Well...
Thanks for breakfast.
Is there anywhere I can wash?
You head that way, until you reach the stream, and then you follow it to the river.
Well...
Goodbye, then.
Thank you for the food... and everything.
You're welcome.
Thought you might need that for the swim.
Thanks.
It's beautiful.
I haven't been swimming in ages.
- You probably go all the time.
- No.
Why not?
I never learned how.
You can't swim?
Well, it's easy.
I could teach you!
You shouldn't stare.
I had a cesarean section.
What's that?
It's when you have a baby.
You had a baby?
You're very gullible, James!
I have a tumor in there.
Is it bad?
If you like being alive...
yes... bad.
They cut me open a couple of times to dig it out.
So it's gone.
They got some of it... but it's spread further now.
So they can't operate anymore.
So that's one good thing at least.
So, what happens now?
Good question.
Did you run away?
You make it sound so dramatic.
You've no family?
Just me and my Mum.
My Dad died a few years ago.
That's where I got it from, his side of the family.
But I got his smile, too.
So, it all balances out.
Right?
Will she come here looking for you?
Maybe.
You can sit beside me if you want.
That's great!
How did you do it?
- Where?
Here?
- Blow hard!
- You're eating it.
- It's wild garlic.
I think I could find my way back from here.
Thank you, James.
I had a really nice time.
I would hope.
Well, I'll see you around.
Mae West O'Mara!
Mae!
We've checked every inch of the building and grounds.
So, I think it's time we widened the search.
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ which is Greek to me.
Think we should dredge the river?
No, she didn't kill herself.
Mae is not the kind of angsty teenager who's going to do herself in.
She loves life!
And that's the problem;
that's why she left.
Maybe you should go home, get some rest.
I'm not going anywhere until you find my daughter and bring her back safe.
Liam?
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry I didn't say anything before, it's that...
I didn't want to get Mae into trouble.
What are you talking about, Liam?
I know which way she went.
James?
Are you okay?
What happened here?
You're bleeding.
I'm sorry.
What?
Are you okay?
We've got a lot of ground to cover before dark.
Mae!
Mae!
That's enough for tonight.
We'll start back here in the morning.
Sergeant!
Can't we just...
just another hour?
Is that your mother?
Why didn't you go out to her?
And just leave you here?
You should have.
It's okay.
You shouldn't be here.
You should have gone long ago.
You said you'd... go as you said.
I'd never even know you were here.
You're the one who came after me.
I can't have people coming here.
You need to go back.
They're not going to hurt you, James.
What are you afraid of?
You're not safe here.
You think I'm in danger?
Why?
Why do you want me to go?
'Cause... no one can be around me.
Because I can't stop it.
I can never stop it... not here... not at the farm... not at the Reformatory.
People have been dying around me all my life.
No one knew what had happened.
But it happened again at the Reformatory.
And..
I could...
I could feel it welling up in me...
I could hardly breathe.
I tried to fight it back, but... it was too late.
The lads... closest to me were already...
Couldn't hide from it anymore.
It was my fault.
All I could think of was to run.
At the far end of the grounds, I saw Liam.
And he was slumped on the ground, right on the edge of the yellow grass.
He called me.
But I knew I couldn't be around anyone anymore.
I ran into the woods as fast as I could.
I ran for hours.
Got lost.
I was so scared.
I was only small.
I was tiny, really.
I found some berries.
And I finally ate something.
It made me so sick.
I must have...
I passed out sore.
I was sure I was going to die there in the woods.
Alone.
And then this man... came out of nowhere.
And he... picked me up and
carried me out.
When I opened my eyes...
I was here.
This is his home.
I didn't know what was happening.
And, in the night... the pain had got worse.
And I begged him to go...
I begged him to go, to leave me, because I knew what would happen.
But he stayed.
A few hours later...
I woke up and...
I tried to leave.
I walked out the door,
and there he was, half buried in yellow leaves.
Mister!
Mister!
Please, get up!
It was over.
He'd taken me into his home.
He'd saved me.
But now he was dead, just like all the others.
Then what?
You killed them all?
Is that what you want me to believe?
I know it's going to kill me, James.
It's not you.
I'm not afraid of you.
Are you going to pass this thing down to all your sons and daughters, too?
The girls won't get it.
I don't know why.
It just goes from son to son.
Furlong to Furlong.
Are you okay?
Can't they do anything to make you better?
Anything they can do, they've already done.
And you're a palm ready now?
It says you're going to live a long and healthy life.
And have lots of babies.
And give them all weird names.
- You're cold.
- A little.
I have to go back soon.
Stay.
Stay a little while longer.
Mae?
Can we leave the interrogation there, Sergeant?
She needs her rest.
Just one more question, please.
A couple of my men ran into a young man in the woods.
About 18.
Looks like he might be living there.
Did you come across him?
Are you sure?
Look!
I already old you everything.
I ran away and got lost.
It was a stupid thing to do, and I'm sorry I caused so much trouble, but...
I'm here now.
All right.
Of course.
Well.
The important thing is that you're safe.
I hope you feel better soon, Mae!
She never even met the guy.
Call the lads back, we're done here.
Thank you for not being angry with me.
What makes you think I'm not angry?
I'm fucking furious!
Do not ever do that to me again, Babe.
My God, I love you.
I love you to Mom.
Well, you must be hungry.
Well, I'll bring you some food.
Thanks.
That was fast.
Hi, Liam.
Hi!
You've found, didn't you?
I thought he was dead, but you found that fucking murderer, didn't you?
You know who he is?
Do you know what he did?
James didn't mean to hurt anyone.
He didn't mean to hurt anyone?
What are you saying?
He didn't mean to fuck up my life?
He didn't mean to ruin my lungs, and turn me into a freak?
He ruined everything!
It wasn't his fault.
Well, then who's fault was it, huh?
!
Get off!
Why are you acting like he's some kind of a friend?
Why are you defending him?
I'm your friend.
I'm the one who wants to protect you,
I...
I love you.
Get off!
Liam.
Are you okay?
You're leaving?
Haven't you heard?
Your girlfriend is no longer missing.
She's not my girlfriend.
Maybe you should ask her out.
She's lying!
She met someone out there.
You have to go after him.
This was a missing person case, Liam, and as I just told you, she is no longer missing.
But, you don't understand, that guy in the woods, he was in the Reformatory.
- He was here, he killed everyone.
- Liam, we've been through this before.
- Well, you can't just do nothing!
- Liam!
I saw him!
He killed the dog.
He made the grass burn.
He's like the Devil.
He killed them, he killed everyone!
Let go!
Let go!
Don't touch me!
Come on!
Come on!
It's all right, it's all right!
Good night, Sweetheart.
Mrs. O'Mara?
I don't want to get your hopes up, but there's definitely been an improvement in the last couple of days, and to be honest, this is very unexpected... it's quite a turnaround really.
But she seems to be showing early signs of remission despite her little excursion.
That's great news, Doctor!
We're going to run some more tests in the morning.
Why it...
Thank you, Doctor.
James.
I...
I'm...
I'm looking for someone.
Mae West O'Mara.
Can you help me?
She's not on this floor.
Two floors up.
Thank you.
Mae.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you.
You're soaking wet.
It's raining.
I'm sorry I left without saying goodbye.
It's the only way I could do it.
I didn't you to see me die.
I've got something for you.
You made them better.
There were buds on every branch... and birds everywhere.
I don't think I can take credit for that.
It was a late Spring.
But at least it will be prettier there now.
Just when there's no one to see it?
You're not going back?
I don't know.
You don't belong out there, James.
I don't know where I belong, Mae.
I wanted to see you.
I can't stay here.
You're not going to hurt anyone.
Not while you're with me.
I won't let you.
Stay with me.
Everyone!
Make your way to the main stairwell!
No running, please!
Nurse!
Nurse!
I can't walk!
It's pretty chilly outside, Michael.
So you're going to need a good, warm coat.
Michael!
Michael!
Michael!
Come on, let's go!
It's okay.
I promise,
No one's going to hurt you, James.
I know what you've done, and you're going to have to pay for it.
You were my friend.
Liam, no!
Get off me!
Stop!
Stay away from him!
You don't know what you're doing.
You should have never come back here!
I won't let you do it again!
You're not going to hurt anyone!
I'm not hurting you.
I'm not here to hurt anyone!
You were my friend, I helped you.
I stopped Kevin, he was going to kill you.
- Me and Mae...
- You're a liar!
You're never going to see her again.
She doesn't know who you are, but I do.
James!
James!
Are you hurt?
Stay back, Mae!
Don't come any closer!
James!
Wait!
Then a few months later, I saw his eyes again.
And his smile.
What about the leaves?
I don't make them die, do I?
You only inherited the good stuff... the best of them.
The leaves die because it's part of life.
To make room for new leaves.
Which is what you are.
A whole new branch of the family.
A Furlong-O'Mara.
Diana Ross Furlong O'Mara.
The long line of Furlongs had come to an end.
Their strange gifts died out with James.
But I don't know if he ever really understood what was inside him.
He thought it was just a curse.
But love brought out something else.
And he gave me a future again.

Something that had a profound effect on him.
Ever since then, whenever he thought about sex
Charlie Furlong went blind for 37 minutes.
Mr. Charlie Furlong?
Yes, Mrs. Charlotte Furlong?
I'm ready for you.
It caused him a lifetime of problems, not least on his wedding night.
Their son,
Philip, also had an ability.
Like Charlie...
Open your mouth.
and all the Furlong men before him... he, too, had a strange gift.
Whenever he got frightened it knocks out everything electrical around him.
This should not have been a problem for him.
Except...
Cathy, you still with me, Love?
Oh my God!
Help me, Philip.
Cathy Furlong passed away before she even saw her baby.
But she had already chosen a name:
Marianne, if it was a girl.
And if it was a boy...
James Furlong.
By the time he was ten years old,
James Furlong had lost his grandfather, too.
Charlie Furlong died in a car accident.
He passed an advertisement for a Wonderbra... then crashed straight into a tree.
Look, but don't touch, you'll ruin his makeup.
Look, here is the first time I saw you in a photograph.
Having lost her husband and daughter-in-law,
James' grandmother regarded the Furlong Condition as nothing short of a curse.
And she was worried about its potential for James.
It was she who tried to warn him about his family history.
She moved in and home schooled James, keeping a close eye on him.
Come on, James, it's easy!
But instead of listening to her,
James secretly wished that he, too, had an ability.
Like walking through walls,
or bionic strength,
or, the ability to fly.
Where the hell have you been?
James.
I got kicked.
Kicked?
But who?
There's something wrong with the cow.
James, what happened?
What did you do, poison 'em?
Calm down, Philip.
Don't tell me to calm down!
Half the herd is lyin' dead out there.
Even the fuckin' grass is dead!
What are you talking about?
I knew there was something wrong with you from the day you were born!
- Come back here!
- Oh, Philip, Philip.
Get out of the car!
How dare you even set foot in there!
You ruined everything!
What did you do?
Oh, don't worry, James, it's only temporary, until we find a nice family for you.
C'mon, kids.
Keep it going!
Keep it going!
Ah, don't be scared, that's just Tinker,
He's a sweetie.
He'll be fine once he get to know you.
This is the dormitory and that is going to be your bed, where I'm sure you'll be very comfortable.
And why aren't you boys at hurling practice, huh?
Liam!
This is James.
and I want you to make him feel very welcome here.
Okay?
Yes, Mrs. Moore.
Good!
Liam!
Could you please take our new friend down to the laundry room and make sure he's given something good and warm to wear.
Yes, Mrs. Moore.
Now, run along!
Here, you can wear this.
It looks good.
Where's your clothes go?
Hey, gorgeous, where you hidden your cunny?
Come on, let's go.
Come on, Liam, then.
They're so stupid!
They always hide them in the same place.
Thank you.
Look who's robbing the kitchen again?
You want some jelly?
Go get them, fagot!
Hurry up, Furlong!
Move your ass!
- Liam!
Run!
- Shut your fucking mouth.
Last night an incident took place.
A very serious incident, that involved the death of one of our family here at St. Jude's.
Coach Hanley's beloved dog Tinker.
Quiet, Boys!
This is no laughing matter, believe you me!
I wish to speak to each and every single one of you individually today to find out exactly what happened.
And Kevin, you can take that smirk off you face and come with me.
I think I'll start with you.
You little fucker.
I should have squealed on you.
Why did you let him go?
Fuck!
- Kill him!
- You killed that dog for me.
You're gonna pay for it!
Stay out of it!
Kick the life out of him, Kevin!
Yeah!
Kevin?
James...
Okay, now, we're just gonna take a look at these stitches.
So if you want to, just hold this back for me there.
Okay.
It's all right, Baby, it's the last one.
Stitches look good!
Gorgeous, aren't they?
Mountain people think I had a cesarean section.
What do you think?
I'm afraid the incision's rather bigger than we normally do for a cesarean.
Well, I'll just say I had a giant baby, then!
Be serious for a second, will you!
What the verdict, Doctor?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Would you excuse us for a moment, Mae?
I don't think she's going to recover.
How long, Doctor?
Well, it's really anybody's guess.
Could be 3 weeks, could be 3 months.
The most important thing we can do is make her feel as comfortable as possible.
Oh, my God!
- Hi, Liam.
- Oh, hi.
You're looking better today.
The wonders of makeup!
So, um...
What did the doctor say?
They gonna operate again.
No, he says I've made a miraculous recovery, and I can go home whenever I want.
Then what are you still doing here, then?
Good question, Liam.
Are... are you going for a walk?
Hey, Mae, you know you're not supposed to leave the grounds!
What are you gonna do, tell on me?
Hey, Mae, where are you going?
Every family has its own legacy.
Good or bad, we inherit it all.
From allergies, to bad eyesight, big noses, to cancer,
which is what I got.
Not the big nose, but the cancer.
I would have preferred a big nose, or a weak heart, or a humped back.
But my father didn't have any of those, either.
In each generation, going right back, from prostate to bowel, throat to brain tumor, we've had every flavor of cancer there is.
Mine was in my intestines.
So I decided it was okay to keep smoking.
Shit!
Hello!
Is someone there?
Thanks.
I'm not contagious, you know.
Don't let the clothes fool you.
I'll go as soon as the rain stops.
You'll never even know I was here.
Can you pass my bra?
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ which is Greek to me.
I'm Mae, by the way.
West.
Mae...
Mae West?
O'Mara.
My mother named me after the film star.
What's your name?
James.
Just James?
Did you make these, James?
You're a real chatterbox, you know that?
It's my music.
You want to listen?
I'll trade you.
This is spectacular.
Is it duck?
Is it duck?
It's... pheasant.
And squirrel.
Did you like it?
Of course you did, it's Motown.
Of course...
Motown.
I don't think it's a place.
It's a record label, from the '60s.
Diana Ross and the Supremes...
Motown!
My dad used to play it.
So, what happened out here?
It looks like a nuclear bomb went off.
It's been like that for a while.
Must be something wrong with the soil.
So, what's the story with you, James?
Are you some kind of woodsman or something?
How long have you lived here?
A few years.
And you like it?
I've never eaten an owl before.
There's owl in this, too.
How many other, cute, little animals am I eating here?
Well...
Thanks for breakfast.
Is there anywhere I can wash?
You head that way, until you reach the stream, and then you follow it to the river.
Well...
Goodbye, then.
Thank you for the food... and everything.
You're welcome.
Thought you might need that for the swim.
Thanks.
It's beautiful.
I haven't been swimming in ages.
- You probably go all the time.
- No.
Why not?
I never learned how.
You can't swim?
Well, it's easy.
I could teach you!
You shouldn't stare.
I had a cesarean section.
What's that?
It's when you have a baby.
You had a baby?
You're very gullible, James!
I have a tumor in there.
Is it bad?
If you like being alive...
yes... bad.
They cut me open a couple of times to dig it out.
So it's gone.
They got some of it... but it's spread further now.
So they can't operate anymore.
So that's one good thing at least.
So, what happens now?
Good question.
Did you run away?
You make it sound so dramatic.
You've no family?
Just me and my Mum.
My Dad died a few years ago.
That's where I got it from, his side of the family.
But I got his smile, too.
So, it all balances out.
Right?
Will she come here looking for you?
Maybe.
You can sit beside me if you want.
That's great!
How did you do it?
- Where?
Here?
- Blow hard!
- You're eating it.
- It's wild garlic.
I think I could find my way back from here.
Thank you, James.
I had a really nice time.
I would hope.
Well, I'll see you around.
Mae West O'Mara!
Mae!
We've checked every inch of the building and grounds.
So, I think it's time we widened the search.
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ which is Greek to me.
Think we should dredge the river?
No, she didn't kill herself.
Mae is not the kind of angsty teenager who's going to do herself in.
She loves life!
And that's the problem;
that's why she left.
Maybe you should go home, get some rest.
I'm not going anywhere until you find my daughter and bring her back safe.
Liam?
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry I didn't say anything before, it's that...
I didn't want to get Mae into trouble.
What are you talking about, Liam?
I know which way she went.
James?
Are you okay?
What happened here?
You're bleeding.
I'm sorry.
What?
Are you okay?
We've got a lot of ground to cover before dark.
Mae!
Mae!
That's enough for tonight.
We'll start back here in the morning.
Sergeant!
Can't we just...
just another hour?
Is that your mother?
Why didn't you go out to her?
And just leave you here?
You should have.
It's okay.
You shouldn't be here.
You should have gone long ago.
You said you'd... go as you said.
I'd never even know you were here.
You're the one who came after me.
I can't have people coming here.
You need to go back.
They're not going to hurt you, James.
What are you afraid of?
You're not safe here.
You think I'm in danger?
Why?
Why do you want me to go?
'Cause... no one can be around me.
Because I can't stop it.
I can never stop it... not here... not at the farm... not at the Reformatory.
People have been dying around me all my life.
No one knew what had happened.
But it happened again at the Reformatory.
And..
I could...
I could feel it welling up in me...
I could hardly breathe.
I tried to fight it back, but... it was too late.
The lads... closest to me were already...
Couldn't hide from it anymore.
It was my fault.
All I could think of was to run.
At the far end of the grounds, I saw Liam.
And he was slumped on the ground, right on the edge of the yellow grass.
He called me.
But I knew I couldn't be around anyone anymore.
I ran into the woods as fast as I could.
I ran for hours.
Got lost.
I was so scared.
I was only small.
I was tiny, really.
I found some berries.
And I finally ate something.
It made me so sick.
I must have...
I passed out sore.
I was sure I was going to die there in the woods.
Alone.
And then this man... came out of nowhere.
And he... picked me up and
carried me out.
When I opened my eyes...
I was here.
This is his home.
I didn't know what was happening.
And, in the night... the pain had got worse.
And I begged him to go...
I begged him to go, to leave me, because I knew what would happen.
But he stayed.
A few hours later...
I woke up and...
I tried to leave.
I walked out the door,
and there he was, half buried in yellow leaves.
Mister!
Mister!
Please, get up!
It was over.
He'd taken me into his home.
He'd saved me.
But now he was dead, just like all the others.
Then what?
You killed them all?
Is that what you want me to believe?
I know it's going to kill me, James.
It's not you.
I'm not afraid of you.
Are you going to pass this thing down to all your sons and daughters, too?
The girls won't get it.
I don't know why.
It just goes from son to son.
Furlong to Furlong.
Are you okay?
Can't they do anything to make you better?
Anything they can do, they've already done.
And you're a palm ready now?
It says you're going to live a long and healthy life.
And have lots of babies.
And give them all weird names.
- You're cold.
- A little.
I have to go back soon.
Stay.
Stay a little while longer.
Mae?
Can we leave the interrogation there, Sergeant?
She needs her rest.
Just one more question, please.
A couple of my men ran into a young man in the woods.
About 18.
Looks like he might be living there.
Did you come across him?
Are you sure?
Look!
I already old you everything.
I ran away and got lost.
It was a stupid thing to do, and I'm sorry I caused so much trouble, but...
I'm here now.
All right.
Of course.
Well.
The important thing is that you're safe.
I hope you feel better soon, Mae!
She never even met the guy.
Call the lads back, we're done here.
Thank you for not being angry with me.
What makes you think I'm not angry?
I'm fucking furious!
Do not ever do that to me again, Babe.
My God, I love you.
I do, too.
Well, you must be hungry.
Well, I'll bring you some food.
Thanks.
That was fast.
Hi, Liam.
Hi!
You've found, didn't you?
I thought he was dead, but you found that fucking murderer, didn't you?
You know who he is?
Do you know what he did?
James didn't mean to hurt anyone.
He didn't mean to hurt anyone?
What are you saying?
He didn't mean to fuck up my life?
He didn't mean to ruin my lungs, and turn me into a freak?
He ruined everything!
It wasn't his fault.
Well, then who's fault was it, huh?
!
Get off!
Why are you acting like he's some kind of a friend?
Why are you defending him?
I'm your friend.
I'm the one who wants to protect you,
I...
I love you.
Get off!
Liam.
Are you okay?
You're leaving?
Haven't you heard?
Your girlfriend is no longer missing.
She's not my girlfriend.
Maybe you should ask her out.
She's lying!
She met someone out there.
You have to go after him.
This was a missing person case, Liam, and as I just told you, she is no longer missing.
But, you don't understand, that guy in the woods, he was in the Reformatory.
- He was here, he killed everyone.
- Liam, we've been through this before.
- Well, you can't just do nothing!
- Liam!
I saw him!
He killed the dog.
He made the grass burn.
He's like the Devil.
He killed them, he killed everyone!
Let go!
Let go!
Don't touch me!
Come on!
Come on!
It's all right, it's all right!
Good night, Sweetheart.
Mrs. O'Mara?
I don't want to get your hopes up, but there's definitely been an improvement in the last couple of days, and to be honest, this is very unexpected... it's quite a turnaround really.
But she seems to be showing early signs of remission despite her little excursion.
That's great news, Doctor!
We're going to run some more tests in the morning.
Why it...
Thank you, Doctor.
James.
I...
I'm...
I'm looking for someone.
Mae West O'Mara.
Can you help me?
She's not on this floor.
Two floors up.
Thank you.
Mae.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you.
You're soaking wet.
It's raining.
I'm sorry I left without saying goodbye.
It's the only way I could do it.
I didn't you to see me die.
I've got something for you.
You made them better.
There were buds on every branch... and birds everywhere.
I don't think I can take credit for that.
It was a late Spring.
But at least it will be prettier there now.
Just when there's no one to see it?
You're not going back?
I don't know.
You don't belong out there, James.
I don't know where I belong, Mae.
I wanted to see you.
I can't stay here.
You're not going to hurt anyone.
Not while you're with me.
I won't let you.
Stay with me.
Everyone!
Make your way to the main stairwell!
No running, please!
Nurse!
Nurse!
I can't walk!
It's pretty chilly outside, Michael.
So you're going to need a good, warm coat.
Michael!
Michael!
Michael!
Come on, let's go!
It's okay.
I promise,
No one's going to hurt you, James.
I know what you've done, and you're going to have to pay for it.
You were my friend.
Liam, no!
Get off me!
Stop!
Stay away from him!
You don't know what you're doing.
You should have never come back here!
I won't let you do it again!
You're not going to hurt anyone!
I'm not hurting you.
I'm not here to hurt anyone!
You were my friend, I helped you.
I stopped Kevin, he was going to kill you.
- Me and Mae...
- You're a liar!
You're never going to see her again.
She doesn't know who you are, but I do.
James!
James!
Are you hurt?
Stay back, Mae!
Don't come any closer!
James!
Wait!
Then a few months later, I saw his eyes again.
And his smile.
What about the leaves?
I don't make them die, do I?
You only inherited the good stuff... the best of them.
The leaves die because it's part of life.
To make room for new leaves.
Which is what you are.
A whole new branch of the family.
A Furlong-O'Mara.
Diana Ross Furlong O'Mara.
The long line of Furlongs had come to an end.
Their strange gifts died out with James.
But I don't know if he ever really understood what was inside him.
He thought it was just a curse.
But love brought out something else.
And he gave me a future again..
So, Kevin, tell us what you want when you grow up.
When I grow up, this is what I want:
I want to have so much money,
I can't even fit it all in my house.
I want my own jet plane.
I want a mansion.
And I want, like, a whole bunch of really awesome things to play with.
Happy birthday, Kevin!
Friends... they say the past is prologue, and who would have guessed that that skinny kid would grow into the man standing before you today?
Yet beyond the bank account and the billion-push-up body and all of my other extracurricular achievements inside, I'm still that ten-year-old boy.
And really... aren't we all?
Mind if I join the party?
Oh, my God!
Our battered birthday boy is Kevin Fetzer.
It was a private affair-- all the guests are his friends.
Well, with a possible exception or two.
Foots this bill, a guy's got to have some bucks.
Yeah, he was an entrepreneur, started a franchise called Joystick Jungle, something like that.
The king of drunken Donkey Kong.
Joystick Jungle, it's a video arcade for adults-- pinball, Pac-Man, pizza, lots and lots of booze.
Letting intoxicated adults act like little kids.
It's a surefire investment.
Well... the new American Dream-- perpetual adolescence, right?
Maybe that explains the underwear.
They're on backwards!
Got dressed in a hurry, or drunk?
Or... killer put them on him.
Wanted to turn him into a... little boy.
Specifically... an eight-year-old.
Look at this.
Gravitational blood drops where the other candles have been deliberately removed.
Candles, redressing.
Killer took some time.
After he took his life.

When did you last see Kevin?
Ten minutes before the big reveal.
Said he had to go behind the curtain, light the candles.
Anybody go back there with him?
No.
Kev liked to handle things himself.
Little bit of a control freak.
Didn't like surprises.
Russell.
Hey, Doc.
When I heard "tycoon,"
I was picturing top hat and monocle, or at least pants.
Obvious blunt-force trauma.
Oh, he lost his two front teeth.
Not so cute at his age.
Yeah, I couldn't find any teeth around here, but judging by the medium-velocity sprinkles on the cake, this is where the beating took place.
Something's stuck between the cuspid and incisor.
Could be dinner.
Huh.
Surveillance is pretty thin throughout the club, no eyes in this area.
The bouncer did say that there was one ugly incident earlier.
Kevin got into it with an uninvited guest, had him tossed out.
Anyone have a name for this uninvited guest?
Kevin called him "Dad."
Oh.
Son gives dad the heave-ho.
Maybe dad comes back to remind him who's the grownup.
Sure, Doc, take the awesome club scene, classic arcade games, beautiful women... why would I be interested in that?
Are you whining?
That's not very Super Dave of you.
Maybe we should remember that some people have it worse.
- Yeah.
Like this poor John Doe.
If there ever was a candidate for stop, drop and roll.
Jimmy, let's go.
We have work to do.
He inhaled fumes at the scene.
Mm.
Okay, so what's this guy's deal?
Officer drove up on a fire blazing, open end of an alley, found him.
Burning tire around the body probably slipped down from his throat.
Necklacing--
South African thugs and cartels south of the border both do this.
It's sad the things that the world can agree on.
Not good seeing this in Vegas.
Same principle as being burned at the stake.
Takes a while for the CO and the smoke inhalation to kill you.
Until then, hell on earth.
Gang neighborhood,
Snakebacks versus La Tijeras.
Ah, let me guess-- no witnesses.
Didn't hear the screaming, didn't even smell the bonfire.
These tires are two different treads.
They're probably from a junkyard.
They're not gonna give us anything.
Hope of any trace or prints from the outside of the tires is up in smoke.
Well... let's try to get an I.D. on this guy.
I say... we strip the Michelin from the man.
Well, one C.O.D.--
Cause Of De-pantsing,-- is still a mystery.
No evidence of sexual activity.
Mm.
So the pants around his ankles was more message than make-out.
And the other C.O.D.?
Asphyxiation via fatal vanity.
His two front porcelain veneers were broken and inhaled.
Lacerated the bronchi, caused a bronchial spasm.
Teeth weren't the only body-mods.
Pec implants, hair plugs.
Geek makes money, remakes himself.
You take your new pride and joy for a spin, inevitably somebody dings it up.
Weapon was a round implement, roughly spherical.
Didn't find anything like that at the scene.
Booze flowing, games blasting, plenty of opportunity for the killer to sneak out with a weapon.
You throw a good enough party, people think they can get away with anything.
Who do you think you are, Kevin?
Think tossing me from your party makes you a man?
You're a weak and scared little boy!
Not exactly a Hallmark greeting.
But then you're not exactly a father, are you, Rick?
Abandoned him when he was ten, didn't pay a dime in child support, son of a deadbeat, beat dead.
You think I had something to do with that?
Well, I think that's a lot of rage to show a half an hour before he was killed.
And I think a trucker with a repo'd rig has got nothing to haul but a greedy grudge against his millionaire son.
You crash the party, you hit him up, he shoots you down, so you really hit him up.
And then you leave him a reminder-- don't get too big for your britches.
There was something wrong with him, even when he was little.
Sick and twisted little something.
The way he'd look at people.
As he got older, made you not want to be around him.
So I'm not surprised someone would see fit to... beat the hell out of him.
Just wasn't me.
Well, you got an alibi or just your sunshiny attitude?
Soon as he made clear I wasn't getting paid,
I left that party.
Check the cameras at that casino next to the club.
I had better luck yanking those levers.
Spun a jackpot, won enough to get my truck back.
Happy birthday to me.
Unless your birthday vic was part beaver... the weapon was wooden.
Trace from his teeth is varnished oak.
Baseball bat?
Hmm, well... the wounds are spherical, not cylindrical.
Rough extrapolation of the curvature, we're looking at something with a diameter of four to five inches?
Wooden ball.
Arcade tycoon, right?
- Yeah.
- Ah...
Arcade Bowl Ball.
Excuse me?
From the classic game of luck and skill beloved by children of all ages-- my guess, that's what bashed your vic's face into a bloody pulp.
Arcade Bowl is not one of the games at the club, so the killer would have had to bring the ball in.
Making the weapon of choice significant, no?
Disgruntled arcade employee.
That's a good place to start.
Hey, how did swab-a-palooza go?
Uh, 200 party guests, all swabbed, printed and checked for spatter, all clean.
Well, maybe you'll have more luck at your next case.
I want you to restock your kit, and go meet Morgan at the Park Motel.
It's a scene, not a date, you wacky kid, you.
Hey, I heard you're looking for unhappy arcade clerks who might have played Whack-A-Boss.
I didn't find any.
And Fetzer's franchises don't carry Arcade Bowl.
But the weapon is so unusual that I searched online for any connection between Kevin Fetzer and the game.
Check this out.
In 1991, an eight-year-old boy named Mikey Moran was celebrating his birthday at an arcade.
He goes missing.
His body is found behind the place.
His pants are off;
he's been beaten to death.
The weapon, a bloody arcade ball, is lying next to him.
Unbelievable.
"Arcade worker Kevin Fetzer, age 15,
"said it was a day that nobody in the arcade would ever forget."
And guess what acne-faced future millionaire was questioned as a person of interest?
Kevin Fetzer.
Yeah.
I pulled the case file.
There was never an arrest made for the boy's murder.
Somebody turned Kevin's birthday into his judgment day.
Motel guest heard a disturbance, phoned it in, officers responded and found her.
Her name's Darlene Crocker.
Motel manager said she's been staying here a few weeks.
- Alone?
- Not really.
She's been known to have various male guests...
For an hour at a time.
But witnesses said nobody left during or after the attack.
Snuck out a window...?
Huh-- no getting through those bars.
Bathroom windows would be tight, even for a lightweight, and this damage is Ali-Foreman.
Some sort of crystals--
Cocaine?
Maybe meth?
Got a little powder near her mouth.
I don't think it's drug trace.
So... she's using with some lucky man of the hour.
Somehow, session goes sideways.
And what, he just kills her and leaves without anybody noticing?
These punctures have irregular jagged edges.
That's inconsistent with a single, sharp blade.
Messy stabbing... messy scene... clean getaway.
Like the killer just vanished.
Bloody Mary.
Well, yeah, there's an empty bottle of vodka on the bed.
No, not the drink, the ghost.
You stand in front of a mirror, lights out, you say your name three times.
And she bursts through the glass and kills you.
Are we at a crime scene, or a seventh-grade sleepover?
Just a theory.
Someone beat Kevin Fetzer's face in with an arcade ball.
There's some justice in that.
I've got the case file from the original arcade ball murder--
Mikey Moran-- just to jog your memory.
Yeah, that was one of the first murders I ever worked.
A scene like that, your memory gets plenty of miles on its own.
We found the body behind the arcade.
The weapon was right there.
And for my money, so was the killer.
That Fetzer kid struck me strange the instant I saw him.
He's hanging around the scene, and then he leaves for an hour, and comes back carrying two little shoes.
Ugh.
Mikey's?
He said that he found them ditched a half block away.
He just happened to be looking over there.
But there was no physical evidence found that connected Kevin Fetzer to the crime.
Well, we did find a pubic hair on the little boy-- blond, like Fetzer-- but DNA testing was new, and we didn't get a result.
And it wasn't re-tested with improved technology?
The, uh, sample was consumed on the first test and... that was my call.
I was new on the job.
I went all in, and I crapped out.
That was the first time that I learned that the job isn't fair.
You know, you could have the killer standing right in front of you, know that he did it and... you know, it feels like the cuffs are on your own wrists.
We've all been there, Lou.
So, do you have any suspects on Kevin Fetzer's murder?
No.
Brass talked to Fetzer's dad, who had an alibi.
We got him on casino surveillance.
He should be talking to Mikey Moran's family.
After what Fetzer did to that little boy, if that were my kid, I wouldn't have waited 20 years.
Considering where and how we found him, we figured our John Doe was a Snakeback or a La Tijera.
There was nothing to help get more specific, except his arms pinned to his sides left small portions of unburnt flesh and an old battle wound.
I've been searching for similar scars in the gang database.
Our burning man is a La Tijera named Ramon Castillo, street name Espectro.
Yeah, it means "Ghost."
Big baller with La Tijeras some years back.
Made my early days in the gang task force a real joy.
Earned you some overtime, did he, Sam?
Yeah, he and a Snakeback rival, Diego Barra, they were a regular Itchy and Scratchy.
Shots traded back and forth, killing each other's friends.
- Barra's still on the street?
- No.
Been locked up for almost a decade now.
He could have ordered the hit from inside, no?
Let's put him on a bus and bring his ass down here and talk to him.
How's your Spanish these days?
No bueno.
But you can help me out there, bud.
Tu?
Nunca.
Vamos.
Your motel vic's organs are pale as a result of exsanguination due to severing of the carotid jugular complex.
Her throat was slashed.
Someone did a number on her.
Hello.
Maybe Darlene Crocker looked her killer in the eye and didn't like what she saw.
Weapon was a shard of broken mirror.
Hers were the only prints on it.
No one was seen leaving the motel room, so we're thinking she killed herself.
Brutality like this is unusual.
Suicide is resignation.
These wounds are rage.
Did you and Morgan find any drugs at the scene?
Uh, just some kind of crystal trace.
Smell this.
Ugh!
Room service in Hell doesn't smell that bad.
What is it?
A distinct ether-like odor.
Pretty rare these days.
PCP.
Oh, bad trip.
That would explain the self-mutilation.
Hallucinatory state.
She thinks she's fighting off untold dark forces.
Not self-destruction... in her mind, self-defense.
Well, Henry's running tox right now.
If it is PCP, we'll get confirmation.
Detective Vega.
I know you.
You put me in the joint and never come to visit.
I was waiting for a special occasion, like the day they'd flip the switch.
You must be confusing me with some other innocent vato.
I'm only doing 25 to life.
Not if you had anything to do with killing Espectro.
Serious?
Damn right I'm serious.
Someone ghosted him for real?
I'm shocked you didn't know.
You best believe I wanted to kill him.
But the punk vanished underground before I had a chance to stick him there.
So whoever took him out, how'd they do it?
Must have been a lucky shot, because there was no getting close to Espectro.
That wasn't luck.
Marta.
Marta?
Who-Who's Marta?
No man did that.
For a sinner like Espectro, there's forces in the universe more powerful than man.
Marta Arterro,
Diego Barra's girlfriend from back in '02.
Now, the hood grapevine says that Espectro was the one who set her ablaze.
And now somebody kills Espectro in the same fiery manner.
Nine years later?
That's some serious felony procrastination.
Well, it's 11 years quicker than it took
Kevin Fetzer to catch his retribution.
Okay...
Two crimes...
Both blasts from the past.
Do we think there's a connection?
Crime scene photo doesn't do the trace justice.
You're right.
It's lovely.
What the heck is it?
The trace you got from your motel vic's face is pollen.
From the flame lily.
The particles, not unlike one David Hodges, exhibit a highly-sculptured outer shell.
Helps them cling to passing bodies in desperate hopes of propagation.
There were no flowers in the motel room.
And we didn't see anything outside.
Possible pollen transfer from the killer.
Morgan, I got those results.
Thanks for the flowers but I got a date with Henry.
Doc Robbins' nose knows drugs.
Motel vic's tox panel showed a lethal level of PCP in her system.
Angel dust?
!
Thought that stuff went out in the early '90s.
Well, you're right.
And the sample she ingested appears to be from a vintage batch of the drug.
See, there's a trace of a component,
PCC, in her blood-- it was a compound used to manufacture PCP until the early '90s when PCC became heavily controlled.
Nobody uses that recipe anymore.
Why would somebody hold on to an old dose of PCP?
With age, it acquires delicious notes of a woodsy vanilla.
No, it stays the same toxic, stinking nightmare fuel it started as.
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Hm.
Holed up in that hotel room, dosed with a blast from the past.
Did you just say "blast from the past"?
Our motel room vic, Darlene Crocker, ingested a lethal load of vintage formula PCP.
Okay, Henry, check out the LIMS database to see if Darlene Crocker has any prior criminal record or any connection to old crimes.
Doesn't have to be recent.
Today, the past is present.
Whoa.
Happened again...
again.
Morgan and Greg's case.
A Darlene Crocker.
1989, her 12-and-a-half- year-old daughter Chelsea died a pretty gruesome death on PCP, just like her mother did today.
A little girl with that kind of drug?
Junkie older brother, Ken Crocker, confessed to having fed it to her and then got sent away.
22 years later, Mom self-destructs on the same drug?
Yeah.
See, I'm not so sure that she just happened to choose today to take that dose.
Somebody forced her to take it-- murder.
Just like the burning tires and the arcade ball.
Death by deja vu.
Tonight, you will be visited by the spirits of three old cases...
Uh, sorry, I haven't had much sleep lately.
The question is, why these three cases, and why now?
And who's this mysterious Jacob Marley summoning their spirits?
There's no obvious connections, and there's years between the murders.
It's three different areas of Vegas, tire-fire Marta in a Northside hood,
PCP Chelsea in a trailer park, and Birthday Mikey in the burbs.
Two child vics, one adult.
One big difference.
Espectro and Fetzer both escaped justice, at least the first time around, but the Crocker case was solved.
Brother was convicted.
So why's Darlene paying for that now?
Maybe someone thinks the wrong person paid for it back then.
Yeah.
All right, there's got to be more to that story.
Chelsea Crocker-- she had little plastic flower barrettes in her hair.
The strands of it she ripped out at the scalp as the PCP ripped through her, scratched her arms to threads.
She was 12 years old, 70 pounds.
Gram of PCP shoved down her throat.
Dumped like trash.
What ab-- what about the brother?
Ken Crocker.
19, user.
We found him a day later in an alleyway on the nod, right?
He confessed.
Said his little sister was getting on his nerves, so he fed her the dust, just wanted to see what would happen.
Wow.
All right.
And where-where was Mom Darlene during all of this?
She was at home asleep, taking a nap.
Gave off a weird vibe, though.
It was something we should've taken a closer look at.
Why?
What do you mean?
Well, about two years into his sentence, brother Ken hires a P.I.
He said he was so messed up on the night of his sister's death that he forgot he had an alibi.
So, the P.I. checks it out, proves it, gets Ken off.
But the kid blew his luck two days later on a motorcycle.
So, the mom was the only one at home the night that Chelsea died.
The cup used to dose her had the fingerprints of both Darlene and Ken on it.
So with Ken out of the picture,
Darlene was the last suspect standing.
But the DA refused to indict, based upon
Ken's wrongful conviction, because he said it
"muddied the waters."
Well, I guess the waters are a lot cleaner now that justice is served.
Well, you know, whether or not she was guilty back then,
Darlene Crocker was murdered.
- And I need...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
The little girl was murdered.
Darlene got what was coming to her.
Hey... are we done here?
Because I got a lot of work to do.
Chromatogram of the by-products and impurities in the PCP sample from Darlene Crocker's motel room this morning, and the same analysis of the PCP that killed Chelsea Crocker in '89.
Mother and daughter didn't just die on PCP.
They died on PCP from the exact same batch.
Well, no dealer or user would hold on to the same drug batch for 22 years.
But I know someplace that does.
All right, a PCP sample from Chelsea's death was checked out of the police evidence vault last November.
By who?
Detective Stan Richardson?
Sample was never returned.
Richardson?
He retired a year back.
Did you work with him much?
No, I used to drink with him.
A bunch of us did.
Bar called the Blue Rail.
Richardson would buy rounds and listen to us bitch about the job.
If you had a case that was really bothering you, you'd talk to him about it.
He had a way of putting things in perspective.
Make you feel better.
Did you talk to him about the Mikey Moran case?
About Kevin Fetzer?
It was 20 years ago.
You know, I might have.
Talk to him recently?
Not since I stopped drinking, so... 11 years, seven months and 14 days.
We've been trying to reach him, and his address and number on file are no good.
Like I said, you know, it's been years.
I mean, last I heard, there were still a few guys who'd tip 'em back with Richardson.
Who?
Hey, what do you drink, Jim?
Are you a scotch man?
I'm more picky about the company than the drink.
Did you forget something?
I heard that you used to drink with Stan Richardson.
Yeah, and...?
Well, I was just hoping you could tell me anything you could about him?
He's a good detective.
Wore the job hard.
Hopefully on a houseboat somewhere.
Did something happen to him?
Do you know where that houseboat might be?
This about the revenge murders?
Do you think he's involved?
We have reason to believe, yeah.
You're wrong.
It's a fantasy.
Every cop keeps a hit list of loose cases and unfinished business running around in his head.
Nobody ever acts on it.
Stan Richardson checked out drug evidence two days before he retired.
It was used this morning in the murder of Darlene Crocker.
Richardson is not a murderer.
Well, maybe he calls it justice.
You know?
They get what they have coming, right?
Excuse me.
Yeah?
Okay, listen up, boss.
The Pension Office said Richardson's funds are direct deposit to some bank.
He said that automatic payments for rent are to 600 Oak Street.
Catherine and I are headed there right now.
Okay.
Make sure you bring backup.
Mr. Richardson doesn't get many visitors.
Exactly how long has Mr. Richardson been residing here?
Six weeks.
He'll be missed when he departs.
Mr. Richardson, some friends are here to see you.
Detective...
Richardson?
You finally caught up to me.
What more do you want?
.
You've got my confession.
I made those people pay for their crimes.
I'm ready to settle up.
Well, we've talked to your hospice nurses, Stan.
End-stage pancreatic cancer.
You haven't been out of bed in a month.
When something must be done, the universe has a way of granting power.
Oh, we're in agreement that you had help;
it was just more of the human variety.
Well, since you're so at peace with the universe, you wouldn't mind us taking a look around your little corner of it?
No.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
If you see anything you like...
I have no need for it anymore.
Nick.
There was trace of lily pollen on Darlene Crocker.
Soil's been disturbed.
Avenging angel's buried treasure?
Mm-hmm.
Angel's got to have somebody out there doing the killing for him.
That same killer tracked pollen into the motel scene, and the pollen led us to this lockbox.
Sara?
It's the evidence tag from the PCP that killed Chelsea and Darlene.
Hidden compartment.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Evidence from another cold case?
Maybe Richardson's got more names on his list.
Revenge.
Cool and serve.
I hope you got something.
Nick and Sara couldn't find any prints on Richardson's strongbox or its contents, so whoever's doing this is being careful.
Did you find any potential victims?
Talked with a dozen officers who worked with Richardson.
They got any ideas who else was in his bucket list, they're not saying.
And skimming the cases he worked, nothing stands out.
There's plenty of unsolveds, but no obvious ones that got away.
Sheriff Liston.
Stan Richardson was my first partner.
Taught me everything when I was a rookie.
Taught a lot of cops.
I don't know who he's working with now, but I got a bad feeling that's his next target.
Rex Camford?
15 years back,
Camford's wife filed for divorce.
Vanished the next night.
Same night Camford takes his boat out for a midnight cruise on Lake Mead.
All we had was a handful of circumstantial and a DA who shied from no-body cases.
No charges.
No doubt in my mind Camford killed his wife.
What about Richardson, did he feel the same way?
Well, after I talked his ear off about it for six whiskies straight at the Blue Rail, he was madder than I was.
Which is why I've been trying to get ahold of Camford.
His housekeeper said he didn't make it home from work.
Okay, why don't you...
Sheriff.
Ah, Catherine, Sheriff's got a hunch about another possible target.
What do you have?
Richardson's phone records from the hospice.
The only recent calls were made from a disposable cell.
Check out the times of the calls.
They line up with the times of the murders.
Yeah.
Someone has been keeping Richardson updated on his progress.
I was able to ping the disposable cell.
Signal hit tower 114 from a southerly direction, about five minutes ago.
So...
Richardson's wingman is at Lake Mead.
Good work.
And what are the chances Rex Camford's along for the ride?
Detective Vega!
Show me your hands!
Son of a bitch!
Sam!
We all know what Camford did, and we're gonna make sure he pays for it.
- Let us handle it.
- System had its chance, Jim!
It didn't do jack!
You know, if it was just you and me, you'd be down here helping me out.
I'm trying to help you.
Lose the piece, and we're all good.
Drop the gun, Sam.
Hey, guys, he's not moving.
- Sam...
- Come on, Sammy, we've been through too much together, man.
Let us help you out.
Sure.
You can help me out.
No!
Vega!
Vega!
I got him!
Get him up to the bank!
Pull him up here!
Come on, Vega, stay with me.
Stay with me, brother.
Get him on his side.
Come on, now.
- Here we go...
- Vega!
Yeah, we got a pulse.
Go get an ambu-bag.
Go on.
He's gonna make it.
No...
He's gone.
Control, this is Brass.
We have an officer down, 419.
Hey, hurry up!
All right, here we go, buddy.
Russell.
Why don't you back off of him?
Let-let them handle it.
They got it.
One additional.
Middle-aged man.
Requires medical.
Okay, Bud, Denali's all packed up.
It's been a long night.
You want to hit the road?
Yeah, we probably should.
But let me ask you something.
There are miles of secluded shoreline on this lake, so why did Vega bring Rex here?
Why this spot in particular?
Maybe with a gun to his head, Rex was compelled to lead Vega to the very spot where he dumped his wife.
Now, that's interesting.
What do you say we wake somebody up.
That looks like a skull.
- Oh, yeah.
Thank you, fellas.
Look at that.
Sharp orbital margins.
Female.
Shot in the back of the head-- look at that.
Probably dead before she hit the water.
You want to know what I remember most about that Camford case I worked back then?
This gorgeous Colt revolver sitting on that arrogant bastard's desk.
We still have it;
it's in evidence.
Richardson's not the only one that holds on to stuff.
To my colleagues, who have shared the burden of the badge.
Many of you won't agree with my methods, but all of you will understand what it's like to have all the pieces set before you the picture painted broad and clear and watch the killer walk away to live the life they tore from others.
Well, I could not let that continue.
I made a list.
Five names.
Those most deserving of vengeance.
And now, as I embark into life's last mystery,
I do so in peace.
Detective Stanley Richardson,
Las Vegas Police Department.
I heard about the letter.
Guy certainly knew how to get his message across.
Well, cops can be refreshingly frank sometimes, right?
Listen...
I know you and I aren't gonna buy a summer house together anytime soon, but I have a lot of respect for you.
Let's not forget, we did put away a wife-killer.
Okay.
Good talk.
Hold on a minute.
Richardson's letter mentioned five names.
Yeah, Vega was the fifth.
There was a knife inside of Richardson's lockbox.
Sara found a little blood inside of it, and it was a match to a murdered informant that Vega had been working a few years past.
Sam Vega could always be a little, um... overzealous, especially if he thought someone was holding out on him.
You want my theory?
Richardson knew that Vega was dirty.
Kept the murder weapon.
Because he wanted Vega to pay for his sins just like the rest of them.
You know, it turns out both funerals are on the same day.
Vega and Richardson.
Well...
I thought I'd get up early, get on a motorcycle, and get very far out of town.
I think that's a very good idea.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
So, Kevin, tell us what you want when you grow up.
When I grow up, this is what I want:
I want to have so much money,
I can't even fit it all in my house.
I want my own jet plane.
I want a mansion.
And I want, like, a whole bunch of really awesome things to play with.
Happy birthday, Kevin!
Friends... they say the past is prologue, and who would have guessed that that skinny kid would grow into the man standing before you today?
Yet beyond the bank account and the billion-push-up body and all of my other extracurricular achievements inside, I'm still that ten-year-old boy.
And really... aren't we all?
Mind if I join the party?
Oh, my God!
Our battered birthday boy is Kevin Fetzer.
It was a private affair-- all the guests are his friends.
Well, with a possible exception or two.
Foots this bill, a guy's got to have some bucks.
Yeah, he was an entrepreneur, started a franchise called Joystick Jungle, something like that.
The king of drunken Donkey Kong.
Joystick Jungle, it's a video arcade for adults-- pinball, Pac-Man, pizza, lots and lots of booze.
Letting intoxicated adults act like little kids.
It's a surefire investment.
Well... the new American Dream-- perpetual adolescence, right?
Maybe that explains the underwear.
They're on backwards!
Got dressed in a hurry, or drunk?
Or... killer put them on him.
Wanted to turn him into a... little boy.
Specifically... an eight-year-old.
Look at this.
Gravitational blood drops where the other candles have been deliberately removed.
Candles, redressing.
Killer took some time.
After he took his life.

When did you last see Kevin?
Ten minutes before the big reveal.
Said he had to go behind the curtain, light the candles.
Anybody go back there with him?
No.
Kev liked to handle things himself.
Little bit of a control freak.
Didn't like surprises.
Russell.
Hey, Doc.
When I heard "tycoon,"
I was picturing top hat and monocle, or at least pants.
Obvious blunt-force trauma.
Oh, he lost his two front teeth.
Not so cute at his age.
Yeah, I couldn't find any teeth around here, but judging by the medium-velocity sprinkles on the cake, this is where the beating took place.
Something's stuck between the cuspid and incisor.
Could be dinner.
Huh.
Surveillance is pretty thin throughout the club, no eyes in this area.
The bouncer did say that there was one ugly incident earlier.
Kevin got into it with an uninvited guest, had him tossed out.
Anyone have a name for this uninvited guest?
Kevin called him "Dad."
Oh.
Son gives dad the heave-ho.
Maybe dad comes back to remind him who's the grownup.
Sure, Doc, take the awesome club scene, classic arcade games, beautiful women... why would I be interested in that?
Are you whining?
That's not very Super Dave of you.
Maybe we should remember that some people have it worse.
- Yeah.
Like this poor John Doe.
If there ever was a candidate for stop, drop and roll.
Jimmy, let's go.
We have work to do.
He inhaled fumes at the scene.
Mm.
Okay, so what's this guy's deal?
Officer drove up on a fire blazing, open end of an alley, found him.
Burning tire around the body probably slipped down from his throat.
Necklacing--
South African thugs and cartels south of the border both do this.
It's sad the things that the world can agree on.
Not good seeing this in Vegas.
Same principle as being burned at the stake.
Takes a while for the CO and the smoke inhalation to kill you.
Until then, hell on earth.
Gang neighborhood,
Snakebacks versus La Tijeras.
Ah, let me guess-- no witnesses.
Didn't hear the screaming, didn't even smell the bonfire.
These tires are two different treads.
They're probably from a junkyard.
They're not gonna give us anything.
Hope of any trace or prints from the outside of the tires is up in smoke.
Well... let's try to get an I.D. on this guy.
I say... we strip the Michelin from the man.
Well, one C.O.D.--
Cause Of De-pantsing,-- is still a mystery.
No evidence of sexual activity.
Mm.
So the pants around his ankles was more message than make-out.
And the other C.O.D.?
Asphyxiation via fatal vanity.
His two front porcelain veneers were broken and inhaled.
Lacerated the bronchi, caused a bronchial spasm.
Teeth weren't the only body-mods.
Pec implants, hair plugs.
Geek makes money, remakes himself.
You take your new pride and joy for a spin, inevitably somebody dings it up.
Weapon was a round implement, roughly spherical.
Didn't find anything like that at the scene.
Booze flowing, games blasting, plenty of opportunity for the killer to sneak out with a weapon.
You throw a good enough party, people think they can get away with anything.
Who do you think you are, Kevin?
Think tossing me from your party makes you a man?
You're a weak and scared little boy!
Not exactly a Hallmark greeting.
But then you're not exactly a father, are you, Rick?
Abandoned him when he was ten, didn't pay a dime in child support, son of a deadbeat, beat dead.
You think I had something to do with that?
Well, I think that's a lot of rage to show a half an hour before he was killed.
And I think a trucker with a repo'd rig has got nothing to haul but a greedy grudge against his millionaire son.
You crash the party, you hit him up, he shoots you down, so you really hit him up.
And then you leave him a reminder-- don't get too big for your britches.
There was something wrong with him, even when he was little.
Sick and twisted little something.
The way he'd look at people.
As he got older, made you not want to be around him.
So I'm not surprised someone would see fit to... beat the hell out of him.
Just wasn't me.
Well, you got an alibi or just your sunshiny attitude?
Soon as he made clear I wasn't getting paid,
I left that party.
Check the cameras at that casino next to the club.
I had better luck yanking those levers.
Spun a jackpot, won enough to get my truck back.
Happy birthday to me.
Unless your birthday vic was part beaver... the weapon was wooden.
Trace from his teeth is varnished oak.
Baseball bat?
Hmm, well... the wounds are spherical, not cylindrical.
Rough extrapolation of the curvature, we're looking at something with a diameter of four to five inches?
Wooden ball.
Arcade tycoon, right?
- Yeah.
- Ah...
Arcade Bowl Ball.
Excuse me?
From the classic game of luck and skill beloved by children of all ages-- my guess, that's what bashed your vic's face into a bloody pulp.
Arcade Bowl is not one of the games at the club, so the killer would have had to bring the ball in.
Making the weapon of choice significant, no?
Disgruntled arcade employee.
That's a good place to start.
Hey, how did swab-a-palooza go?
Uh, 200 party guests, all swabbed, printed and checked for spatter, all clean.
Well, maybe you'll have more luck at your next case.
I want you to restock your kit, and go meet Morgan at the Park Motel.
It's a scene, not a date, you wacky kid, you.
Hey, I heard you're looking for unhappy arcade clerks who might have played Whack-A-Boss.
I didn't find any.
And Fetzer's franchises don't carry Arcade Bowl.
But the weapon is so unusual that I searched online for any connection between Kevin Fetzer and the game.
Check this out.
In 1991, an eight-year-old boy named Mikey Moran was celebrating his birthday at an arcade.
He goes missing.
His body is found behind the place.
His pants are off;
he's been beaten to death.
The weapon, a bloody arcade ball, is lying next to him.
Unbelievable.
"Arcade worker Kevin Fetzer, age 15,
"said it was a day that nobody in the arcade would ever forget."
And guess what acne-faced future millionaire was questioned as a person of interest?
Kevin Fetzer.
Yeah.
I pulled the case file.
There was never an arrest made for the boy's murder.
Somebody turned Kevin's birthday into his judgment day.
Motel guest heard a disturbance, phoned it in, officers responded and found her.
Her name's Darlene Crocker.
Motel manager said she's been staying here a few weeks.
- Alone?
- Not really.
She's been known to have various male guests...
For an hour at a time.
But witnesses said nobody left during or after the attack.
Snuck out a window...?
Huh-- no getting through those bars.
Bathroom windows would be tight, even for a lightweight, and this damage is Ali-Foreman.
Some sort of crystals--
Cocaine?
Maybe meth?
Got a little powder near her mouth.
I don't think it's drug trace.
So... she's using with some lucky man of the hour.
Somehow, session goes sideways.
And what, he just kills her and leaves without anybody noticing?
These punctures have irregular jagged edges.
That's inconsistent with a single, sharp blade.
Messy stabbing... messy scene... clean getaway.
Like the killer just vanished.
Bloody Mary.
Well, yeah, there's an empty bottle of vodka on the bed.
No, not the drink, the ghost.
You stand in front of a mirror, lights out, you say your name three times.
And she bursts through the glass and kills you.
Are we at a crime scene, or a seventh-grade sleepover?
Just a theory.
Someone beat Kevin Fetzer's face in with an arcade ball.
There's some justice in that.
I've got the case file from the original arcade ball murder--
Mikey Moran-- just to jog your memory.
Yeah, that was one of the first murders I ever worked.
A scene like that, your memory gets plenty of miles on its own.
We found the body behind the arcade.
The weapon was right there.
And for my money, so was the killer.
That Fetzer kid struck me strange the instant I saw him.
He's hanging around the scene, and then he leaves for an hour, and comes back carrying two little shoes.
Ugh.
Mikey's?
He said that he found them ditched a half block away.
He just happened to be looking over there.
But there was no physical evidence found that connected Kevin Fetzer to the crime.
Well, we did find a pubic hair on the little boy-- blond, like Fetzer-- but DNA testing was new, and we didn't get a result.
And it wasn't re-tested with improved technology?
The, uh, sample was consumed on the first test and... that was my call.
I was new on the job.
I went all in, and I crapped out.
That was the first time that I learned that the job isn't fair.
You know, you could have the killer standing right in front of you, know that he did it and... you know, it feels like the cuffs are on your own wrists.
We've all been there, Lou.
So, do you have any suspects on Kevin Fetzer's murder?
No.
Brass talked to Fetzer's dad, who had an alibi.
We got him on casino surveillance.
He should be talking to Mikey Moran's family.
After what Fetzer did to that little boy, if that were my kid, I wouldn't have waited 20 years.
Considering where and how we found him, we figured our John Doe was a Snakeback or a La Tijera.
There was nothing to help get more specific, except his arms pinned to his sides left small portions of unburnt flesh and an old battle wound.
I've been searching for similar scars in the gang database.
Our burning man is a La Tijera named Ramon Castillo, street name Espectro.
Yeah, it means "Ghost."
Big baller with La Tijeras some years back.
Made my early days in the gang task force a real joy.
Earned you some overtime, did he, Sam?
Yeah, he and a Snakeback rival, Diego Barra, they were a regular Itchy and Scratchy.
Shots traded back and forth, killing each other's friends.
- Barra's still on the street?
- No.
Been locked up for almost a decade now.
He could have ordered the hit from inside, no?
Let's put him on a bus and bring his ass down here and talk to him.
How's your Spanish these days?
No bueno.
But you can help me out there, bud.
Tu?
Nunca.
Vamos.
Your motel vic's organs are pale as a result of exsanguination due to severing of the carotid jugular complex.
Her throat was slashed.
Someone did a number on her.
Hello.
Maybe Darlene Crocker looked her killer in the eye and didn't like what she saw.
Weapon was a shard of broken mirror.
Hers were the only prints on it.
No one was seen leaving the motel room, so we're thinking she killed herself.
Brutality like this is unusual.
Suicide is resignation.
These wounds are rage.
Did you and Morgan find any drugs at the scene?
Uh, just some kind of crystal trace.
Smell this.
Ugh!
Room service in Hell doesn't smell that bad.
What is it?
A distinct ether-like odor.
Pretty rare these days.
PCP.
Oh, bad trip.
That would explain the self-mutilation.
Hallucinatory state.
She thinks she's fighting off untold dark forces.
Not self-destruction... in her mind, self-defense.
Well, Henry's running tox right now.
If it is PCP, we'll get confirmation.
Detective Vega.
I know you.
You put me in the joint and never come to visit.
I was waiting for a special occasion, like the day they'd flip the switch.
You must be confusing me with some other innocent vato.
I'm only doing 25 to life.
Not if you had anything to do with killing Espectro.
Serious?
Damn right I'm serious.
Someone ghosted him for real?
I'm shocked you didn't know.
You best believe I wanted to kill him.
But the punk vanished underground before I had a chance to stick him there.
So whoever took him out, how'd they do it?
Must have been a lucky shot, because there was no getting close to Espectro.
That wasn't luck.
Marta.
Marta?
Who-Who's Marta?
No man did that.
For a sinner like Espectro, there's forces in the universe more powerful than man.
Marta Arterro,
Diego Barra's girlfriend from back in '02.
Now, the hood grapevine says that Espectro was the one who set her ablaze.
And now somebody kills Espectro in the same fiery manner.
Nine years later?
That's some serious felony procrastination.
Well, it's 11 years quicker than it took
Kevin Fetzer to catch his retribution.
Okay...
Two crimes...
Both blasts from the past.
Do we think there's a connection?
Crime scene photo doesn't do the trace justice.
You're right.
It's lovely.
What the heck is it?
The trace you got from your motel vic's face is pollen.
From the flame lily.
The particles, not unlike one David Hodges, exhibit a highly-sculptured outer shell.
Helps them cling to passing bodies in desperate hopes of propagation.
There were no flowers in the motel room.
And we didn't see anything outside.
Possible pollen transfer from the killer.
Morgan, I got those results.
Thanks for the flowers but I got a date with Henry.
Doc Robbins' nose knows drugs.
Motel vic's tox panel showed a lethal level of PCP in her system.
Angel dust?
!
Thought that stuff went out in the early '90s.
Well, you're right.
And the sample she ingested appears to be from a vintage batch of the drug.
See, there's a trace of a component,
PCC, in her blood-- it was a compound used to manufacture PCP until the early '90s when PCC became heavily controlled.
Nobody uses that recipe anymore.
Why would somebody hold on to an old dose of PCP?
With age, it acquires delicious notes of a woodsy vanilla.
No, it stays the same toxic, stinking nightmare fuel it started as.
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Hm.
Holed up in that hotel room, dosed with a blast from the past.
Did you just say "blast from the past"?
Our motel room vic, Darlene Crocker, ingested a lethal load of vintage formula PCP.
Okay, Henry, check out the LIMS database to see if Darlene Crocker has any prior criminal record or any connection to old crimes.
Doesn't have to be recent.
Today, the past is present.
Whoa.
Happened again...
again.
Morgan and Greg's case.
A Darlene Crocker.
1989, her 12-and-a-half- year-old daughter Chelsea died a pretty gruesome death on PCP, just like her mother did today.
A little girl with that kind of drug?
Junkie older brother, Ken Crocker, confessed to having fed it to her and then got sent away.
22 years later, Mom self-destructs on the same drug?
Yeah.
See, I'm not so sure that she just happened to choose today to take that dose.
Somebody forced her to take it-- murder.
Just like the burning tires and the arcade ball.
Death by deja vu.
Tonight, you will be visited by the spirits of three old cases...
Uh, sorry, I haven't had much sleep lately.
The question is, why these three cases, and why now?
And who's this mysterious Jacob Marley summoning their spirits?
There's no obvious connections, and there's years between the murders.
It's three different areas of Vegas, tire-fire Marta in a Northside hood,
PCP Chelsea in a trailer park, and Birthday Mikey in the burbs.
Two child vics, one adult.
One big difference.
Espectro and Fetzer both escaped justice, at least the first time around, but the Crocker case was solved.
Brother was convicted.
So why's Darlene paying for that now?
Maybe someone thinks the wrong person paid for it back then.
Yeah.
All right, there's got to be more to that story.
Chelsea Crocker-- she had little plastic flower barrettes in her hair.
The strands of it she ripped out at the scalp as the PCP ripped through her, scratched her arms to threads.
She was 12 years old, 70 pounds.
Gram of PCP shoved down her throat.
Dumped like trash.
What ab-- what about the brother?
Ken Crocker.
19, user.
We found him a day later in an alleyway on the nod, right?
He confessed.
Said his little sister was getting on his nerves, so he fed her the dust, just wanted to see what would happen.
Wow.
All right.
And where-where was Mom Darlene during all of this?
She was at home asleep, taking a nap.
Gave off a weird vibe, though.
It was something we should've taken a closer look at.
Why?
What do you mean?
Well, about two years into his sentence, brother Ken hires a P.I.
He said he was so messed up on the night of his sister's death that he forgot he had an alibi.
So, the P.I. checks it out, proves it, gets Ken off.
But the kid blew his luck two days later on a motorcycle.
So, the mom was the only one at home the night that Chelsea died.
The cup used to dose her had the fingerprints of both Darlene and Ken on it.
So with Ken out of the picture,
Darlene was the last suspect standing.
But the DA refused to indict, based upon
Ken's wrongful conviction, because he said it
"muddied the waters."
Well, I guess the waters are a lot cleaner now that justice is served.
Well, you know, whether or not she was guilty back then,
Darlene Crocker was murdered.
- And I need...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
The little girl was murdered.
Darlene got what was coming to her.
Hey... are we done here?
Because I got a lot of work to do.
Chromatogram of the by-products and impurities in the PCP sample from Darlene Crocker's motel room this morning, and the same analysis of the PCP that killed Chelsea Crocker in '89.
Mother and daughter didn't just die on PCP.
They died on PCP from the exact same batch.
Well, no dealer or user would hold on to the same drug batch for 22 years.
But I know someplace that does.
All right, a PCP sample from Chelsea's death was checked out of the police evidence vault last November.
By who?
Detective Stan Richardson?
Sample was never returned.
Richardson?
He retired a year back.
Did you work with him much?
No, I used to drink with him.
A bunch of us did.
Bar called the Blue Rail.
Richardson would buy rounds and listen to us bitch about the job.
If you had a case that was really bothering you, you'd talk to him about it.
He had a way of putting things in perspective.
Make you feel better.
Did you talk to him about the Mikey Moran case?
About Kevin Fetzer?
It was 20 years ago.
You know, I might have.
Talk to him recently?
Not since I stopped drinking, so... 11 years, seven months and 14 days.
We've been trying to reach him, and his address and number on file are no good.
Like I said, you know, it's been years.
I mean, last I heard, there were still a few guys who'd tip 'em back with Richardson.
Who?
Hey, what do you drink, Jim?
Are you a scotch man?
I'm more picky about the company than the drink.
Did you forget something?
I heard that you used to drink with Stan Richardson.
Yeah, and...?
Well, I was just hoping you could tell me anything you could about him?
He's a good detective.
Wore the job hard.
Hopefully on a houseboat somewhere.
Did something happen to him?
Do you know where that houseboat might be?
This about the revenge murders?
Do you think he's involved?
We have reason to believe, yeah.
You're wrong.
It's a fantasy.
Every cop keeps a hit list of loose cases and unfinished business running around in his head.
Nobody ever acts on it.
Stan Richardson checked out drug evidence two days before he retired.
It was used this morning in the murder of Darlene Crocker.
Richardson is not a murderer.
Well, maybe he calls it justice.
You know?
They get what they have coming, right?
Excuse me.
Yeah?
Okay, listen up, boss.
The Pension Office said Richardson's funds are direct deposit to some bank.
He said that automatic payments for rent are to 600 Oak Street.
Catherine and I are headed there right now.
Okay.
Make sure you bring backup.
Mr. Richardson doesn't get many visitors.
Exactly how long has Mr. Richardson been residing here?
Six weeks.
He'll be missed when he departs.
Mr. Richardson, some friends are here to see you.
Detective...
Richardson?
You finally caught up to me.
What more do you want?
.
You've got my confession.
I made those people pay for their crimes.
I'm ready to settle up.
Well, we've talked to your hospice nurses, Stan.
End-stage pancreatic cancer.
You haven't been out of bed in a month.
When something must be done, the universe has a way of granting power.
Oh, we're in agreement that you had help;
it was just more of the human variety.
Well, since you're so at peace with the universe, you wouldn't mind us taking a look around your little corner of it?
No.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
If you see anything you like...
I have no need for it anymore.
Nick.
There was trace of lily pollen on Darlene Crocker.
Soil's been disturbed.
Avenging angel's buried treasure?
Mm-hmm.
Angel's got to have somebody out there doing the killing for him.
That same killer tracked pollen into the motel scene, and the pollen led us to this lockbox.
Sara?
It's the evidence tag from the PCP that killed Chelsea and Darlene.
Hidden compartment.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Evidence from another cold case?
Maybe Richardson's got more names on his list.
Revenge.
Cool and serve.
I hope you got something.
Nick and Sara couldn't find any prints on Richardson's strongbox or its contents, so whoever's doing this is being careful.
Did you find any potential victims?
Talked with a dozen officers who worked with Richardson.
They got any ideas who else was in his bucket list, they're not saying.
And skimming the cases he worked, nothing stands out.
There's plenty of unsolveds, but no obvious ones that got away.
Sheriff Liston.
Stan Richardson was my first partner.
Taught me everything when I was a rookie.
Taught a lot of cops.
I don't know who he's working with now, but I got a bad feeling that's his next target.
Rex Camford?
15 years back,
Camford's wife filed for divorce.
Vanished the next night.
Same night Camford takes his boat out for a midnight cruise on Lake Mead.
All we had was a handful of circumstantial and a DA who shied from no-body cases.
No charges.
No doubt in my mind Camford killed his wife.
What about Richardson, did he feel the same way?
Well, after I talked his ear off about it for six whiskies straight at the Blue Rail, he was madder than I was.
Which is why I've been trying to get ahold of Camford.
His housekeeper said he didn't make it home from work.
Okay, why don't you...
Sheriff.
Ah, Catherine, Sheriff's got a hunch about another possible target.
What do you have?
Richardson's phone records from the hospice.
The only recent calls were made from a disposable cell.
Check out the times of the calls.
They line up with the times of the murders.
Yeah.
Someone has been keeping Richardson updated on his progress.
I was able to ping the disposable cell.
Signal hit tower 114 from a southerly direction, about five minutes ago.
So...
Richardson's wingman is at Lake Mead.
Good work.
And what are the chances Rex Camford's along for the ride?
Detective Vega!
Show me your hands!
Son of a bitch!
Sam!
We all know what Camford did, and we're gonna make sure he pays for it.
- Let us handle it.
- System had its chance, Jim!
It didn't do jack!
You know, if it was just you and me, you'd be down here helping me out.
I'm trying to help you.
Lose the piece, and we're all good.
Drop the gun, Sam.
Hey, guys, he's not moving.
- Sam...
- Come on, Sammy, we've been through too much together, man.
Let us help you out.
Sure.
You can help me out.
No!
Vega!
Vega!
I got him!
Get him up to the bank!
Pull him up here!
Come on, Vega, stay with me.
Stay with me, brother.
Get him on his side.
Come on, now.
- Here we go...
- Vega!
Yeah, we got a pulse.
Go get an ambu-bag.
Go on.
He's gonna make it.
No...
He's gone.
Control, this is Brass.
We have an officer down, 419.
Hey, hurry up!
All right, here we go, buddy.
Russell.
Why don't you back off of him?
Let-let them handle it.
They got it.
One additional.
Middle-aged man.
Requires medical.
Okay, Bud, Denali's all packed up.
It's been a long night.
You want to hit the road?
Yeah, we probably should.
But let me ask you something.
There are miles of secluded shoreline on this lake, so why did Vega bring Rex here?
Why this spot in particular?
Maybe with a gun to his head, Rex was compelled to lead Vega to the very spot where he dumped his wife.
Now, that's interesting.
What do you say we wake somebody up.
That looks like a skull.
- Oh, yeah.
Thank you, fellas.
Look at that.
Sharp orbital margins.
Female.
Shot in the back of the head-- look at that.
Probably dead before she hit the water.
You want to know what I remember most about that Camford case I worked back then?
This gorgeous Colt revolver sitting on that arrogant bastard's desk.
We still have it;
it's in evidence.
Richardson's not the only one that holds on to stuff.
To my colleagues, who have shared the burden of the badge.
Many of you won't agree with my methods, but all of you will understand what it's like to have all the pieces set before you the picture painted broad and clear and watch the killer walk away to live the life they tore from others.
Well, I could not let that continue.
I made a list.
Five names.
Those most deserving of vengeance.
And now, as I embark into life's last mystery,
I do so in peace.
Detective Stanley Richardson,
Las Vegas Police Department.
I heard about the letter.
Guy certainly knew how to get his message across.
Well, cops can be refreshingly frank sometimes, right?
Listen...
I know you and I aren't gonna buy a summer house together anytime soon, but I have a lot of respect for you.
Let's not forget, we did put away a wife-killer.
Okay.
Good talk.
Hold on a minute.
Richardson's letter mentioned five names.
Yeah, Vega was the fifth.
There was a knife inside of Richardson's lockbox.
Sara found a little blood inside of it, and it was a match to a murdered informant that Vega had been working a few years past.
Sam Vega could always be a little, um... overzealous, especially if he thought someone was holding out on him.
You want my theory?
Richardson knew that Vega was dirty.
Kept the murder weapon.
Because he wanted Vega to pay for his sins just like the rest of them.
You know, it turns out both funerals are on the same day.
Vega and Richardson.
Well...
I thought I'd get up early, get on a motorcycle, and get very far out of town.
I think that's a very good idea.

WOMAN:
So, Kevin, tell us what you want when you grow up.
When I grow up, this is what I want:
I want to have so much money,
I can't even fit it all in my house.
I want my own jet plane.
I want a mansion.
And I want, like, a whole bunch of really awesome things to play with.
(laughter, whooping)
(cheering)
WOMEN:
Happy birthday, Kevin!
(cheering, whooping)
Friends... they say the past is prologue, and who would have guessed that that skinny kid would grow into the man standing before you today?
Yet beyond the bank account and the billion-push-up body and all of my other extracurricular achievements... (crowd whooping, laughing) ...inside, I'm still that ten-year-old boy.
(guests laughing)
And really... aren't we all?
Mind if I join the party?
(champagne cork pops, guests cheer)
(screaming)
(screams, gasps, murmuring)
Oh, my God!
Our battered birthday boy is Kevin Fetzer.
It was a private affair-- all the guests are his friends.
Well, with a possible exception or two.
Foots this bill, a guy's got to have some bucks.
Yeah, he was an entrepreneur, started a franchise called Joystick Jungle, something like that.
The king of drunken Donkey Kong.
Joystick Jungle, it's a video arcade for adults-- pinball, Pac-Man, pizza, lots and lots of booze.
Letting intoxicated adults act like little kids.
It's a surefire investment.
Well... the new American Dream-- perpetual adolescence, right?
Maybe that explains the underwear.
They're on backwards!
Got dressed in a hurry, or drunk?
RUSSELL:
Or... killer put them on him.
Wanted to turn him into a... little boy.
Specifically... an eight-year-old.
Look at this.

When did you last see Kevin?
Ten minutes before the big reveal.
Said he had to go behind the curtain, light the candles.
Anybody go back there with him?
No.
Kev liked to handle things himself.
Little bit of a control freak.
Didn't like surprises.
ROBBINS:
Russell.
Hey, Doc.
When I heard "tycoon,"
I was picturing top hat and monocle, or at least pants.
Obvious blunt-force trauma.
Oh, he lost his two front teeth.
Not so cute at his age.
Yeah, I couldn't find any teeth around here, but judging by the medium-velocity sprinkles on the cake, this is where the beating took place.
ROBBINS:
Something's stuck between the cuspid and incisor.
Could be dinner.
Huh.
SANDERS:
Surveillance is pretty thin throughout the club, no eyes in this area.
The bouncer did say that there was one ugly incident earlier.
Kevin got into it with an uninvited guest, had him tossed out.
Anyone have a name for this uninvited guest?
Kevin called him "Dad."
Oh.
WILLOWS:
Son gives dad the heave-ho.
Maybe dad comes back to remind him who's the grownup.
Sure, Doc, take the awesome club scene, classic arcade games, beautiful women... why would I be interested in that?
Are you whining?
That's not very Super Dave of you.
SIDLE:
Maybe we should remember that some people have it worse.
- Yeah.
Like this poor John Doe.
If there ever was a candidate for stop, drop and roll.
Jimmy, let's go.
We have work to do.
He inhaled fumes at the scene.
Mm.
Okay, so what's this guy's deal?
Officer drove up on a fire blazing, open end of an alley, found him.
Burning tire around the body probably slipped down from his throat.
Necklacing--
South African thugs and cartels south of the border both do this.
It's sad the things that the world can agree on.
Not good seeing this in Vegas.
Same principle as being burned at the stake.
(shouting)
SIDLE:
Takes a while for the CO and the smoke inhalation to kill you.
Until then, hell on earth.
Gang neighborhood,
Snakebacks versus La Tijeras.
Ah, let me guess-- no witnesses.
Didn't hear the screaming, didn't even smell the bonfire.
These tires are two different treads.
They're probably from a junkyard.
They're not gonna give us anything.
SIDE:
Hope of any trace or prints from the outside of the tires is up in smoke.
Well... let's try to get an I.D. on this guy.
I say... we strip the Michelin from the man.
Well, one C.O.D.--
Cause Of De-pantsing,-- is still a mystery.
No evidence of sexual activity.
Mm.
So the pants around his ankles was more message than make-out.
And the other C.O.D.?
Asphyxiation via fatal vanity.
His two front porcelain veneers were broken and inhaled.
(screams)
ROBBINS:
Lacerated the bronchi, caused a bronchial spasm.
Teeth weren't the only body-mods.
Pec implants, hair plugs.
Geek makes money, remakes himself.
You take your new pride and joy for a spin, inevitably somebody dings it up.
Weapon was a round implement, roughly spherical.
Didn't find anything like that at the scene.
Booze flowing, games blasting, plenty of opportunity for the killer to sneak out with a weapon.
You throw a good enough party, people think they can get away with anything.
MAN (on voicemail):
Who do you think you are, Kevin?
Think tossing me from your party makes you a man?
You're a weak and scared little boy!
Not exactly a Hallmark greeting.
But then you're not exactly a father, are you, Rick?
Abandoned him when he was ten, didn't pay a dime in child support, son of a deadbeat, beat dead.
You think I had something to do with that?
Well, I think that's a lot of rage to show a half an hour before he was killed.
And I think a trucker with a repo'd rig has got nothing to haul but a greedy grudge against his millionaire son.
You crash the party, you hit him up, he shoots you down, so you really hit him up.
And then you leave him a reminder-- don't get too big for your britches.
There was something wrong with him, even when he was little.
Sick and twisted little something.
The way he'd look at people.
As he got older, made you not want to be around him.
So I'm not surprised someone would see fit to... beat the hell out of him.
Just wasn't me.
Well, you got an alibi or just your sunshiny attitude?
Soon as he made clear I wasn't getting paid,
I left that party.
Check the cameras at that casino next to the club.
I had better luck yanking those levers.
Spun a jackpot, won enough to get my truck back.
(sighs)
Happy birthday to me.
Unless your birthday vic was part beaver... the weapon was wooden.
WILLOWS:
Trace from his teeth is varnished oak.
Baseball bat?
Hmm, well... the wounds are spherical, not cylindrical.
Rough extrapolation of the curvature, we're looking at something with a diameter of four to five inches?
Wooden ball.
Arcade tycoon, right?
- Yeah.
- Ah...
Arcade Bowl Ball.
Excuse me?
From the classic game of luck and skill beloved by children of all ages-- my guess, that's what bashed your vic's face into a bloody pulp.
WILLOWS:
Arcade Bowl is not one of the games at the club, so the killer would have had to bring the ball in.
Making the weapon of choice significant, no?
Disgruntled arcade employee.
That's a good place to start.
RUSSELL:
Hey, how did swab-a-palooza go?
Uh, 200 party guests, all swabbed, printed and checked for spatter, all clean.
Well, maybe you'll have more luck at your next case.
I want you to restock your kit, and go meet Morgan at the Park Motel.
It's a scene, not a date, you wacky kid, you.
Hey, I heard you're looking for unhappy arcade clerks who might have played Whack-A-Boss.
I didn't find any.
And Fetzer's franchises don't carry Arcade Bowl.
But the weapon is so unusual that I searched online for any connection between Kevin Fetzer and the game.
Check this out.
In 1991, an eight-year-old boy named Mikey Moran was celebrating his birthday at an arcade.
He goes missing.
His body is found behind the place.
His pants are off;
he's been beaten to death.
The weapon, a bloody arcade ball, is lying next to him.
Unbelievable.
RUSSELL: "Arcade worker Kevin Fetzer, age 15,
"said it was a day that nobody in the arcade would ever forget."
And guess what acne-faced future millionaire was questioned as a person of interest?
Kevin Fetzer.
Yeah.
I pulled the case file.
There was never an arrest made for the boy's murder.
Somebody turned Kevin's birthday into his judgment day.
(woman screaming)
BRODY:
Motel guest heard a disturbance, phoned it in, officers responded and found her.
Her name's Darlene Crocker.
Motel manager said she's been staying here a few weeks.
- Alone?
- Not really.
She's been known to have various male guests...
For an hour at a time.
But witnesses said nobody left during or after the attack.
Snuck out a window...?
Huh-- no getting through those bars.
Bathroom windows would be tight, even for a lightweight, and this damage is Ali-Foreman.
Some sort of crystals--
Cocaine?
Maybe meth?
Got a little powder near her mouth.
I don't think it's drug trace.
So... she's using with some lucky man of the hour.
Somehow, session goes sideways.
And what, he just kills her and leaves without anybody noticing?
These punctures have irregular jagged edges.
That's inconsistent with a single, sharp blade.
Messy stabbing... messy scene... clean getaway.
Like the killer just vanished.
Bloody Mary.
Well, yeah, there's an empty bottle of vodka on the bed.
No, not the drink, the ghost.
You stand in front of a mirror, lights out, you say your name three times.
And she bursts through the glass and kills you.
Are we at a crime scene, or a seventh-grade sleepover?
(sighs)
Just a theory.
Someone beat Kevin Fetzer's face in with an arcade ball.
There's some justice in that.
I've got the case file from the original arcade ball murder--
Mikey Moran-- just to jog your memory.
Yeah, that was one of the first murders I ever worked.
A scene like that, your memory gets plenty of miles on its own.
We found the body behind the arcade.
The weapon was right there.
And for my money, so was the killer.
That Fetzer kid struck me strange the instant I saw him.
He's hanging around the scene, and then he leaves for an hour, and comes back carrying two little shoes.
Ugh.
Mikey's?
He said that he found them ditched a half block away.
He just happened to be looking over there.
But there was no physical evidence found that connected Kevin Fetzer to the crime.
Well, we did find a pubic hair on the little boy-- blond, like Fetzer-- but DNA testing was new, and we didn't get a result.
And it wasn't re-tested with improved technology?
The, uh, sample was consumed on the first test and... that was my call.
I was new on the job.
I went all in, and I crapped out.
That was the first time that I learned that the job isn't fair.
You know, you could have the killer standing right in front of you, know that he did it and... you know, it feels like the cuffs are on your own wrists.
We've all been there, Lou.
So, do you have any suspects on Kevin Fetzer's murder?
No.
Brass talked to Fetzer's dad, who had an alibi.
We got him on casino surveillance.
He should be talking to Mikey Moran's family.
After what Fetzer did to that little boy, if that were my kid, I wouldn't have waited 20 years.
SIDLE:
Considering where and how we found him, we figured our John Doe was a Snakeback or a La Tijera.
There was nothing to help get more specific, except his arms pinned to his sides left small portions of unburnt flesh and an old battle wound.
SIDLE:
I've been searching for similar scars in the gang database.
Our burning man is a La Tijera named Ramon Castillo, street name Espectro.
Yeah, it means "Ghost."
VEGA:
Big baller with La Tijeras some years back.
Made my early days in the gang task force a real joy.
Earned you some overtime, did he, Sam?
Yeah, he and a Snakeback rival, Diego Barra, they were a regular Itchy and Scratchy.
Shots traded back and forth, killing each other's friends.
- Barra's still on the street?
- No.
Been locked up for almost a decade now.
He could have ordered the hit from inside, no?
Let's put him on a bus and bring his ass down here and talk to him.
How's your Spanish these days?
No bueno.
But you can help me out there, bud.
Tu?
Nunca.
Vamos.
Your motel vic's organs are pale as a result of exsanguination due to severing of the carotid jugular complex.
STOKES:
Her throat was slashed.
Someone did a number on her.
Hello.
Maybe Darlene Crocker looked her killer in the eye and didn't like what she saw.
Weapon was a shard of broken mirror.
Hers were the only prints on it.
No one was seen leaving the motel room, so we're thinking she killed herself.
(screaming)
Brutality like this is unusual.
Suicide is resignation.
These wounds are rage.
(inhales)
Did you and Morgan find any drugs at the scene?
Uh, just some kind of crystal trace.
Smell this.
Ugh!
Room service in Hell doesn't smell that bad.
What is it?
A distinct ether-like odor.
Pretty rare these days.
PCP.
Oh, bad trip.
That would explain the self-mutilation.
(trembling laughter)
Hallucinatory state.
She thinks she's fighting off untold dark forces.
(eerie laughter)
ROBBINS:
Not self-destruction... in her mind, self-defense.
Well, Henry's running tox right now.
If it is PCP, we'll get confirmation.
Detective Vega.
I know you.
You put me in the joint and never come to visit.
I was waiting for a special occasion, like the day they'd flip the switch.
(laughs)
You must be confusing me with some other innocent vato.
I'm only doing 25 to life.
Not if you had anything to do with killing Espectro.
Serious?
Damn right I'm serious.
Someone ghosted him for real?
I'm shocked you didn't know.
You best believe I wanted to kill him.
But the punk vanished underground before I had a chance to stick him there.
So whoever took him out, how'd they do it?
Must have been a lucky shot, because there was no getting close to Espectro.
That wasn't luck.
(whispering):
Marta.
Marta?
Who-Who's Marta?
No man did that.
For a sinner like Espectro, there's forces in the universe more powerful than man.
STOKES:
Marta Arterro,
Diego Barra's girlfriend from back in '02.
Now, the hood grapevine says that Espectro was the one who set her ablaze.
And now somebody kills Espectro in the same fiery manner.
Nine years later?
That's some serious felony procrastination.
Well, it's 11 years quicker than it took
Kevin Fetzer to catch his retribution.
RUSSELL:
Okay...
Two crimes...
Both blasts from the past.
Do we think there's a connection?
HODGES:
Crime scene photo doesn't do the trace justice.
BRODY:
You're right.
It's lovely.
What the heck is it?
The trace you got from your motel vic's face is pollen.
From the flame lily.
The particles, not unlike one David Hodges, exhibit a highly-sculptured outer shell.
Helps them cling to passing bodies in desperate hopes of propagation.
There were no flowers in the motel room.
And we didn't see anything outside.
Possible pollen transfer from the killer.
Morgan, I got those results.
Thanks for the flowers but I got a date with Henry.
Doc Robbins' nose knows drugs.
Motel vic's tox panel showed a lethal level of PCP in her system.
Angel dust?
!
Thought that stuff went out in the early '90s.
Well, you're right.
And the sample she ingested appears to be from a vintage batch of the drug.
See, there's a trace of a component,
PCC, in her blood-- it was a compound used to manufacture PCP until the early '90s when PCC became heavily controlled.
Nobody uses that recipe anymore.
Why would somebody hold on to an old dose of PCP?
With age, it acquires delicious notes of a woodsy vanilla.
No, it stays the same toxic, stinking nightmare fuel it started as.
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Hm.
Holed up in that hotel room, dosed with a blast from the past.
Did you just say "blast from the past"?
Our motel room vic, Darlene Crocker, ingested a lethal load of vintage formula PCP.
Okay, Henry, check out the LIMS database to see if Darlene Crocker has any prior criminal record or any connection to old crimes.
Doesn't have to be recent.
Today, the past is present.
Whoa.
Happened again...
again.
Morgan and Greg's case.
A Darlene Crocker.
1989, her 12-and-a-half- year-old daughter Chelsea died a pretty gruesome death on PCP, just like her mother did today.
(groans) A little girl with that kind of drug?
Junkie older brother, Ken Crocker, confessed to having fed it to her and then got sent away.
22 years later, Mom self-destructs on the same drug?
Yeah.
See, I'm not so sure that she just happened to choose today to take that dose.
Somebody forced her to take it-- murder.
Just like the burning tires and the arcade ball.
Death by deja vu.
RUSSELL:
Tonight, you will be visited by the spirits of three old cases...
Uh, sorry, I haven't had much sleep lately.
The question is, why these three cases, and why now?
And who's this mysterious Jacob Marley summoning their spirits?
There's no obvious connections, and there's years between the murders.
It's three different areas of Vegas, tire-fire Marta in a Northside hood,
PCP Chelsea in a trailer park, and Birthday Mikey in the burbs.
Two child vics, one adult.
SIDLE:
One big difference.
Espectro and Fetzer both escaped justice, at least the first time around, but the Crocker case was solved.
Brother was convicted.
So why's Darlene paying for that now?
Maybe someone thinks the wrong person paid for it back then.
Yeah.
All right, there's got to be more to that story.
Chelsea Crocker-- she had little plastic flower barrettes in her hair.
The strands of it she ripped out at the scalp as the PCP ripped through her, scratched her arms to threads.
She was 12 years old, 70 pounds.
Gram of PCP shoved down her throat.
Dumped like trash.
What ab-- what about the brother?
Ken Crocker.
19, user.
We found him a day later in an alleyway on the nod, right?
He confessed.
Said his little sister was getting on his nerves, so he fed her the dust, just wanted to see what would happen.
Wow.
All right.
And where-where was Mom Darlene during all of this?
She was at home asleep, taking a nap.
Gave off a weird vibe, though.
It was something we should've taken a closer look at.
Why?
What do you mean?
Well, about two years into his sentence, brother Ken hires a P.I.
He said he was so messed up on the night of his sister's death that he forgot he had an alibi.
So, the P.I. checks it out, proves it, gets Ken off.
But the kid blew his luck two days later on a motorcycle.
So, the mom was the only one at home the night that Chelsea died.
The cup used to dose her had the fingerprints of both Darlene and Ken on it.
So with Ken out of the picture,
Darlene was the last suspect standing.
But the DA refused to indict, based upon
Ken's wrongful conviction, because he said it
"muddied the waters."
Well, I guess the waters are a lot cleaner now that justice is served.
Well, you know, whether or not she was guilty back then,
Darlene Crocker was murdered.
- And I need...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
The little girl was murdered.
Darlene got what was coming to her.
Hey... are we done here?
Because I got a lot of work to do.
Chromatogram of the by-products and impurities in the PCP sample from Darlene Crocker's motel room this morning, and the same analysis of the PCP that killed Chelsea Crocker in '89.
Mother and daughter didn't just die on PCP.
They died on PCP from the exact same batch.
Well, no dealer or user would hold on to the same drug batch for 22 years.
But I know someplace that does.
All right, a PCP sample from Chelsea's death was checked out of the police evidence vault last November.
By who?
Detective Stan Richardson?
Sample was never returned.
VARTANN:
Richardson?
He retired a year back.
Did you work with him much?
No, I used to drink with him.
A bunch of us did.
Bar called the Blue Rail.
Richardson would buy rounds and listen to us bitch about the job.
If you had a case that was really bothering you, you'd talk to him about it.
He had a way of putting things in perspective.
Make you feel better.
Did you talk to him about the Mikey Moran case?
About Kevin Fetzer?
It was 20 years ago.
You know, I might have.
Talk to him recently?
Not since I stopped drinking, so... 11 years, seven months and 14 days.
We've been trying to reach him, and his address and number on file are no good.
Like I said, you know, it's been years.
(sighs)
I mean, last I heard, there were still a few guys who'd tip 'em back with Richardson.
Who?
Hey, what do you drink, Jim?
Are you a scotch man?
I'm more picky about the company than the drink.
Did you forget something?
I heard that you used to drink with Stan Richardson.
Yeah, and...?
Well, I was just hoping you could tell me anything you could about him?
He's a good detective.
Wore the job hard.
Hopefully on a houseboat somewhere.
Did something happen to him?
Do you know where that houseboat might be?
This about the revenge murders?
Do you think he's involved?
We have reason to believe, yeah.
You're wrong.
It's a fantasy.
Every cop keeps a hit list of loose cases and unfinished business running around in his head.
Nobody ever acts on it.
Stan Richardson checked out drug evidence two days before he retired.
It was used this morning in the murder of Darlene Crocker.
Richardson is not a murderer.
Well, maybe he calls it justice.
You know?
They get what they have coming, right?
(phone rings)
Excuse me.
Yeah?
STOKES:
Okay, listen up, boss.
The Pension Office said Richardson's funds are direct deposit to some bank.
He said that automatic payments for rent are to 600 Oak Street.
Catherine and I are headed there right now.
Okay.
Make sure you bring backup.
(phone beeps off)
Mr. Richardson doesn't get many visitors.
Exactly how long has Mr. Richardson been residing here?
Six weeks.
He'll be missed when he departs.
Mr. Richardson, some friends are here to see you.
Detective...
Richardson?
You finally caught up to me.
RICHARDSON:
What more do you want?
.
You've got my confession.
I made those people pay for their crimes.
I'm ready to settle up.
Well, we've talked to your hospice nurses, Stan.
End-stage pancreatic cancer.
You haven't been out of bed in a month.
When something must be done, the universe has a way of granting power.
Oh, we're in agreement that you had help;
it was just more of the human variety.
(muffled cough) Well, since you're so at peace with the universe, you wouldn't mind us taking a look around your little corner of it?
No.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
If you see anything you like...
I have no need for it anymore.
(Richardson coughs)
Nick.
(whispering):
There was trace of lily pollen on Darlene Crocker.
Soil's been disturbed.
(muffled coughing)
Avenging angel's buried treasure?
Mm-hmm.
Angel's got to have somebody out there doing the killing for him.
That same killer tracked pollen into the motel scene, and the pollen led us to this lockbox.
Sara?
It's the evidence tag from the PCP that killed Chelsea and Darlene.
Hidden compartment.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Evidence from another cold case?
Maybe Richardson's got more names on his list.
Revenge.
Cool and serve.
I hope you got something.
Nick and Sara couldn't find any prints on Richardson's strongbox or its contents, so whoever's doing this is being careful.
Did you find any potential victims?
(sighs) Talked with a dozen officers who worked with Richardson.
They got any ideas who else was in his bucket list, they're not saying.
And skimming the cases he worked, nothing stands out.
There's plenty of unsolveds, but no obvious ones that got away.
RUSSELL:
Sheriff Liston.
Stan Richardson was my first partner.
Taught me everything when I was a rookie.
Taught a lot of cops.
I don't know who he's working with now, but I got a bad feeling that's his next target.
Rex Camford?
15 years back,
Camford's wife filed for divorce.
Vanished the next night.
Same night Camford takes his boat out for a midnight cruise on Lake Mead.
All we had was a handful of circumstantial and a DA who shied from no-body cases.
No charges.
No doubt in my mind Camford killed his wife.
What about Richardson, did he feel the same way?
Well, after I talked his ear off about it for six whiskies straight at the Blue Rail, he was madder than I was.
Which is why I've been trying to get ahold of Camford.
His housekeeper said he didn't make it home from work.
Okay, why don't you...
WILLOWS:
Sheriff.
Ah, Catherine, Sheriff's got a hunch about another possible target.
What do you have?
Richardson's phone records from the hospice.
The only recent calls were made from a disposable cell.
Check out the times of the calls.
RUSSELL:
They line up with the times of the murders.
Yeah.
Someone has been keeping Richardson updated on his progress.
I was able to ping the disposable cell.
Signal hit tower 114 from a southerly direction, about five minutes ago.
So...
Richardson's wingman is at Lake Mead.
Good work.
And what are the chances Rex Camford's along for the ride?
(sirens wailing)
Detective Vega!
Show me your hands!
Son of a bitch!
BRASS:
Sam!
We all know what Camford did, and we're gonna make sure he pays for it.
- Let us handle it.
- System had its chance, Jim!
It didn't do jack!
You know, if it was just you and me, you'd be down here helping me out.
BRASS:
I'm trying to help you.
Lose the piece, and we're all good.
Drop the gun, Sam.
Hey, guys, he's not moving.
Sam...
STOKES:
Come on, Sammy, we've been through too much together, man.
Let us help you out.
Sure.
You can help me out.
BRASS:
No!
Vega!
Vega!
I got him!
STOKES:
Get him up to the bank!
Pull him up here!
Come on, Vega, stay with me.
Stay with me, brother.
Get him on his side.
Come on, now.
Here we go...
STOKES:
Vega!
Yeah, we got a pulse.
Go get an ambu-bag.
Go on.
OFFICER:
He's gonna make it.
No...
He's gone.
Control, this is Brass.
We have an officer down, 419.
Hey, hurry up!
All right, here we go, buddy.
Russell.
Why don't you back off of him?
Let-let them handle it.
They got it.
One additional.
Middle-aged man.
Requires medical.
Okay, Bud, Denali's all packed up.
It's been a long night.
You want to hit the road?
Yeah, we probably should.
But let me ask you something.
There are miles of secluded shoreline on this lake, so why did Vega bring Rex here?
Why this spot in particular?
Maybe with a gun to his head, Rex was compelled to lead Vega to the very spot where he dumped his wife.
Now, that's interesting.
What do you say we wake somebody up.
STOKES:
That looks like a skull.
- Oh, yeah.
Thank you, fellas.
Look at that.
Sharp orbital margins.
Female.
Shot in the back of the head-- look at that.
Probably dead before she hit the water.
You want to know what I remember most about that Camford case I worked back then?
This gorgeous Colt revolver sitting on that arrogant bastard's desk.
We still have it;
it's in evidence.
Richardson's not the only one that holds on to stuff.
(sighs)
RICHARDSON:
To my colleagues, who have shared the burden of the badge.
Many of you won't agree with my methods, but all of you will understand what it's like to have all the pieces set before you the picture painted broad and clear and watch the killer walk away to live the life they tore from others.
Well, I could not let that continue.
I made a list.
Five names.
Those most deserving of vengeance.
And now, as I embark into life's last mystery,
I do so in peace.
Detective Stanley Richardson,
Las Vegas Police Department.
I heard about the letter.
Guy certainly knew how to get his message across.
Well, cops can be refreshingly frank sometimes, right?
(sighs):
Listen...
I know you and I aren't gonna buy a summer house together anytime soon, but I have a lot of respect for you.
Let's not forget, we did put away a wife-killer.
Okay.
Good talk.
Hold on a minute.
Richardson's letter mentioned five names.
Yeah, Vega was the fifth.
There was a knife inside of Richardson's lockbox.
Sara found a little blood inside of it, and it was a match to a murdered informant that Vega had been working a few years past.
(sighs) Sam Vega could always be a little, um... overzealous, especially if he thought someone was holding out on him.
You want my theory?
Richardson knew that Vega was dirty.
Kept the murder weapon.
Because he wanted Vega to pay for his sins just like the rest of them.
You know, it turns out both funerals are on the same day.
Vega and Richardson.
Well...
I thought I'd get up early, get on a motorcycle, and get very far out of town.
I think that's a very good idea.

WOMAN:
So, Kevin, tell us what you want when you grow up.
When I grow up, this is what I want:
I want to have so much money,
I can't even fit it all in my house.
I want my own jet plane.
I want a mansion.
And I want, like, a whole bunch of really awesome things to play with.
(laughter, whooping)
(cheering)
WOMEN:
Happy birthday, Kevin!
(cheering, whooping)
Friends... they say the past is prologue, and who would have guessed that that skinny kid would grow into the man standing before you today?
Yet beyond the bank account and the billion-push-up body and all of my other extracurricular achievements... (crowd whooping, laughing) ...inside, I'm still that ten-year-old boy.
(guests laughing)
And really... aren't we all?
Mind if I join the party?
(champagne cork pops, guests cheer)
(screaming)
(screams, gasps, murmuring)
Oh, my God!
Our battered birthday boy is Kevin Fetzer.
It was a private affair...
all the guests are his friends.
Well, with a possible exception or two.
Foots this bill, a guy's got to have some bucks.
Yeah, he was an entrepreneur, started a franchise called Joystick Jungle, something like that.
The king of drunken Donkey Kong.
Joystick Jungle, it's a video arcade for adults... pinball, Pac-Man, pizza, lots and lots of booze.
Letting intoxicated adults act like little kids.
It's a surefire investment.
Well... the new American Dream... perpetual adolescence, right?
Maybe that explains the underwear.
They're on backwards!
Got dressed in a hurry, or drunk?
RUSSELL:
Or... killer put them on him.
Wanted to turn him into a... little boy.
Specifically...
an eight-year-old.
Look at this.
WILLOWS:
Gravitational blood drops where the other candles have been deliberately removed.
Candles, redressing.
Killer took some time.
After he took his life.

CSI S12E08 "Crime After Crime"
By Mikhel for Subtitulos.es ==SPREAD THE WORD==
So you're the victim's best friend.
When did you last see Kevin?
Ten minutes before the big reveal.
Said he had to go behind the curtain, light the candles.
- Anybody go back there with him?
- No.
Kev liked to handle things himself.
Little bit of a control freak.
Didn't like surprises.
ROBBINS:
Russell.
Hey, Doc.
When I heard "tycoon,"
I was picturing top hat and monocle, or at least pants.
Obvious blunt-force trauma.
Oh, he lost his two front teeth.
Not so cute at his age.
Yeah, I couldn't find any teeth around here, but judging by the medium-velocity sprinkles on the cake, this is where the beating took place.
ROBBINS:
Something's stuck between the cuspid and incisor.
Could be dinner.
Huh.
SANDERS:
Surveillance is pretty thin throughout the club, no eyes in this area.
The bouncer did say that there was one ugly incident earlier.
Kevin got into it with an uninvited guest, had him tossed out.
Anyone have a name for this uninvited guest?
Kevin called him "Dad."
Oh.
WILLOWS:
Son gives dad the heave-ho.
Maybe dad comes back to remind him who's the grownup.
Sure, Doc, take the awesome club scene, classic arcade games, beautiful women... why would I be interested in that?
Are you whining?
That's not very Super Dave of you.
SIDLE:
Maybe we should remember that some people have it worse.
Yeah.
Like this poor John Doe.
If there ever was a candidate for stop, drop and roll.
Jimmy, let's go.
We have work to do.
He inhaled fumes at the scene.
Mm.
Okay, so what's this guy's deal?
Officer drove up on a fire blazing, open end of an alley, found him.
Burning tire around the body probably slipped down from his throat.
Necklacing...
South African thugs and cartels south of the border both do this.
It's sad the things that the world can agree on.
Not good seeing this in Vegas.
Same principle as being burned at the stake.
(shouting)
SIDLE:
Takes a while for the CO and the smoke inhalation to kill you.
Until then, hell on earth.
Gang neighborhood,
Snakebacks versus La Tijeras.
Ah, let me guess...
no witnesses.
Didn't hear the screaming, didn't even smell the bonfire.
These tires are two different treads.
They're probably from a junkyard.
They're not gonna give us anything.
SIDE:
Hope of any trace or prints from the outside of the tires is up in smoke.
Well... let's try to get an I.D. on this guy.
I say... we strip the Michelin from the man.
Well, one C.O.D....
Cause Of De-pantsing,...
is still a mystery.
No evidence of sexual activity.
Mm.
So the pants around his ankles was more message than make-out.
And the other C.O.D.?
Asphyxiation via fatal vanity.
His two front porcelain veneers were broken and inhaled.
(screams)
ROBBINS:
Lacerated the bronchi, caused a bronchial spasm.
Teeth weren't the only body-mods.
Pec implants, hair plugs.
Geek makes money, remakes himself.
You take your new pride and joy for a spin, inevitably somebody dings it up.
Weapon was a round implement, roughly spherical.
Didn't find anything like that at the scene.
Booze flowing, games blasting, plenty of opportunity for the killer to sneak out with a weapon.
You throw a good enough party, people think they can get away with anything.
MAN (on voicemail):
Who do you think you are, Kevin?
Think tossing me from your party makes you a man?
You're a weak and scared little boy!
Not exactly a Hallmark greeting.
But then you're not exactly a father, are you, Rick?
Abandoned him when he was ten, didn't pay a dime in child support, son of a deadbeat, beat dead.
You think I had something to do with that?
Well, I think that's a lot of rage to show a half an hour before he was killed.
And I think a trucker with a repo'd rig has got nothing to haul but a greedy grudge against his millionaire son.
You crash the party, you hit him up, he shoots you down, so you really hit him up.
And then you leave him a reminder... don't get too big for your britches.
There was something wrong with him, even when he was little.
Sick and twisted little something.
The way he'd look at people.
As he got older, made you not want to be around him.
So I'm not surprised someone would see fit to... beat the hell out of him.
Just wasn't me.
Well, you got an alibi or just your sunshiny attitude?
Soon as he made clear I wasn't getting paid,
I left that party.
Check the cameras at that casino next to the club.
I had better luck yanking those levers.
Spun a jackpot, won enough to get my truck back.
(sighs)
Happy birthday to me.
Unless your birthday vic was part beaver... the weapon was wooden.
WILLOWS:
Trace from his teeth is varnished oak.
Baseball bat?
Hmm, well... the unds are spherical, not cylindrical.
Rough extrapolation of the curvature, we're looking at something with a diameter of four to five inches?
Wooden ball.
Arcade tycoon, right?
Yeah.
Ah...
Arcade Bowl Ball.
Excuse me?
From the classic game of luck and skill beloved by children of all ages... my guess, that's what bashed your vic's face into a bloody pulp.
WILLOWS:
Arcade Bowl is not one of the games at the club, so the killer would have had to bring the ball in.
Making the weapon of choice significant, no?
Disgruntled arcade employee.
That's a good place to start.
RUSSELL:
Hey, how did swab-a-palooza go?
Uh, 200 party guests, all swabbed, printed and checked for spatter, all clean.
Well, maybe you'll have more luck at your next case.
I want you to restock your kit, and go meet Morgan at the Park Motel.
It's a scene, not a date, you wacky kid, you.
Hey, I heard you're looking for unhappy arcade clerks who might have played Whack-A-Boss.
I didn't find any.
And Fetzer's franchises don't carry Arcade Bowl.
But the weapon is so unusual that I searched online for any connection between Kevin Fetzer and the game.
Check this out.
In 1991, an eight-year-old boy named Mikey Moran was celebrating his birthday at an arcade.
He goes missing.
His body is found behind the place.
His pants are off;
he's been beaten to death.
The weapon, a bloody arcade ball, is lying next to him.
Unbelievable.
RUSSELL: "Arcade worker Kevin Fetzer, age 15,
"said it was a day that nobody in the arcade would ever forget."
And guess what acne-faced future millionaire was questioned as a person of interest?
Kevin Fetzer.
Yeah.
I pulled the case file.
There was never an arrest made for the boy's murder.
Somebody turned Kevin's birthday into his judgment day.
BRODY:
Motel guest heard a disturbance, phoned it in, officers responded and found her.
Her name's Darlene Crocker.
Motel manager said she's been staying here a few weeks.
Alone?
Not really.
She's been known to have various male guests for an hour at a time.
But witnesses said nobody left during or after the attack.
Snuck out a window...?
Huh... no getting through those bars.
Bathroom windows would be tight, even for a lightweight, and this damage is Ali-Foreman.
Some sort of crystals...
Cocaine?
Maybe meth?
Got a little powder near her mouth.
I don't think it's drug trace.
So... she's using with some lucky man of the hour.
Somehow, session goes sideways.
And what, he just kills her and leaves without anybody noticing?
These punctures have irregular jagged edges.
That's inconsistent with a single, sharp blade.
Messy stabbing... messy scene... clean getaway.
Like the killer just vanished.
Bloody Mary.
Well, yeah, there's an empty bottle of vodka on the bed.
No, not the drink, the ghost.
See, you stand in front of a mirror, lights out, you say her name three times... and then she bursts through the glass and kills you.
Are we at a crime scene or a seventh-grade sleepover?
(sighs)
Just a theory.
Someone beat Kevin Fetzer's face in with an arcade ball.
There's some justice in that.
I've got the case file from the original arcade ball murder...
Mikey Moran... just to jog your memory.
Yeah, that was one of the first murders I ever worked.
A scene like that, your memory gets plenty of miles on its own.
We found the body behind the arcade.
The weapon was right there.
And for my money, so was the killer.
That Fetzer kid struck me strange the instant I saw him.
He's hanging around the scene, and then he leaves for an hour, and comes back carrying two little shoes.
Ugh.
Mikey's?
He said that he found them ditched a half block away.
He just happened to be looking over there.
But there was no physical evidence found that connected Kevin Fetzer to the crime.
Well, we did find a pubic hair on the little boy...
blond, like Fetzer... but DNA testing was new, and we didn't get a result.
And it wasn't re-tested with improved technology?
The, uh, sample was consumed on the first test and... that was my call.
I was new on the job.
I went all in, and I crapped out.
That was the first time that I learned that the job isn't fair.
You know, you could have the killer standing right in front of you, know that he did it and... you know, it feels like the cuffs are on your own wrists.
We've all been there, Lou.
So, do you have any suspects on Kevin Fetzer's murder?
No.
Brass talked to Fetzer's dad, who had an alibi.
We got him on casino surveillance.
He should be talking to Mikey Moran's family.
After what Fetzer did to that little boy, if that were my kid, I wouldn't have waited 20 years.
SIDLE:
Considering where and how we found him, we figured our John Doe was a Snakeback or a La Tijera.
There was nothing to help get more specific, except his arms pinned to his sides left small portions of unburnt flesh and an old battle wound.
SIDLE:
I've been searching for similar scars in the gang database.
Our burning man is a La Tijera named Ramon Castillo, street name Espectro.
Yeah, it means "Ghost."
VEGA:
Big baller with La Tijeras some years back.
Made my early days in the gang task force a real joy.
Earned you some overtime, did he, Sam?
Yeah, he and a Snakeback rival, Diego Barra, they were a regular Itchy and Scratchy.
Shots traded back and forth, killing each other's friends.
Barra's still on the street?
No.
Been locked up for almost a decade now.
He could have ordered the hit from inside, no?
Let's put him on a bus and bring his ass down here and talk to him.
How's your Spanish these days?
No bueno.
But you can help me out there, bud.
Tu?
Nunca.
Vamos.
Your motel vic's organs are pale as a result of exsanguination due to severing of the carotid jugular complex.
STOKES:
Her throat was slashed.
Someone did a number on her.
Hello.
Maybe Darlene Crocker looked her killer in the eye and didn't like what she saw.
Weapon was a shard of broken mirror.
Hers were the only prints on it.
No one was seen leaving the motel room, so we're thinking she killed herself.
(screaming)
Brutality like this is unusual.
Suicide is resignation.
These wounds are rage.
(inhales)
Did you and Morgan find any drugs at the scene?
Uh, just some kind of crystal trace.
Smell this.
Ugh!
Room service in Hell doesn't smell that bad.
What is it?
A distinct ether-like odor.
Pretty rare these days.
PCP.
Oh, bad trip.
That would explain the self-mutilation.
(trembling laughter)
Hallucinatory state.
She thinks she's fighting off untold dark forces.
(eerie laughter)
ROBBINS:
Not self-destruction... in her mind, self-defense.
Well, Henry's running tox right now.
If it is PCP, we'll get confirmation.
Detective Vega.
I know you.
You put me in the joint and never come to visit.
I was waiting for a special occasion, like the day they'd flip the switch.
(laughs)
You must be confusing me with some other innocent vato.
I'm only doing 25 to life.
Not if you had anything to do with killing Espectro.
Serious?
Damn right I'm serious.
Someone ghosted him for real?
I'm shocked you didn't know.
You best believe I wanted to kill him.
But the punk vanished underground before I had a chance to stick him there.
So whoever took him out, how'd they do it?
Must have been a lucky shot, because there was no getting close to Espectro.
That wasn't luck.
(whispering):
Marta.
Marta?
Who-Who's Marta?
No man did that.
For a sinner like Espectro, there's forces in the universe more powerful than man.
STOKES:
Marta Arterro,
Diego Barra's girlfriend from back in '02.
Now, the hood grapevine says that Espectro was the one who set her ablaze.
And now somebody kills Espectro in the same fiery manner.
Nine years later?
That's some serious felony procrastination.
Well, it's 11 years quicker than it took
Kevin Fetzer to catch his retribution.
RUSSELL:
Okay...
Two crimes...
Both blasts from the past.
Do we think there's a connection?
HODGES:
Crime scene photo doesn't do the trace justice.
BRODY:
You're right.
It's lovely.
What the heck is it?
The trace you got from your motel vic's face is pollen.
From the flame lily.
The particles, not unlike one David Hodges, exhibit a highly-sculptured outer shell.
Helps them cling to passing bodies in desperate hopes of propagation.
There were no flowers in the motel room.
And we didn't see anything outside.
Possible pollen transfer from the killer.
Morgan, I got those results.
Thanks for the flowers but I got a date with Henry.
Doc Robbins' nose knows drugs.
Motel vic's tox panel showed a lethal level of PCP in her system.
Angel dust?
!
Thought that stuff went out in the early '90s.
Well, you're right.
And the sample she ingested appears to be from a vintage batch of the drug.
See, there's a trace of a component,
PCC, in her blood...
it was a compound used to manufacture PCP until the early '90s when PCC became heavily controlled.
Nobody uses that recipe anymore.
Why would somebody hold on to an old dose of PCP?
With age, it acquires delicious notes of a woodsy vanilla.
No, it stays the same toxic, stinking nightmare fuel it started as.
Doesn't make any sense.
Hm.
Holed up in that hotel room, dosed with a blast from the past.
Did you just say "blast from the past"?
Our motel room vic, Darlene Crocker, ingested a lethal load of vintage formula PCP.
Okay, Henry, check out the LIMS database to see if Darlenene Crocker has any prior criminal record or any connection to old crimes.
Doesn't have to be recent.
Today, the past is present.
Whoa.
Happened again...
again.
Morgan and Greg's case.
A Darlene Crocker.
1989, her 12-and-a-half- year-old daughter Chelsea died a pretty gruesome death on PCP, just like her mother did today.
(groans) A little girl with that kind of drug?
Junkie older brother, Ken Crocker, confessed to having fed it to her and then got sent away.
22 years later, Mom self-destructs on the same drug?
Yeah.
See, I'm not so sure that she just happened to choose today to take that dose.
Somebody forced her to take it... murder.
Just like the burning tires and the arcade ball.
Death by deja vu.
L:
Tonight, you will, be visited by the spirits of three old cases...
Uh, sorry, I haven't had much sleep lately.
The question is, why these three cases, and why now?
And who's this mysterious Jacob Marley summoning their spirits?
There's no obvious connections, and there's years between the murders.
It's three different areas of Vegas, tire-fire Marta in a Northside hood,
PCP Chelsea in a trailer park, and Birthday Mikey in the burbs.
Two child vics, one adult.
SIDLE:
One big difference.
Espectro and Fetzer both escaped justice, at least the first time around, but the Crocker case was solved.
Brother was convicted.
So why's Darlene paying for that now?
Maybe someone thinks the wrong person paid for it back then.
Yeah.
All right, there's got to be more to that story.
Chelsea Crocker... she had little plastic flower barrettes in her hair.
The strands of it she ripped out at the scalp as the PCP ripped through her, scratched her arms to threads.
She was 12 years old, 70 pounds.
Gram of PCP shoved down her throat.
Dumped like trash.
What ab... what about the brother?
Ken Crocker.
19, user.
We found him a day later in an alleyway on the nod, right?
He confessed.
Said his little sister was getting on his nerves, so he fed her the dust, just wanted to see what would happen.
Wow.
All right.
And where-where was Mom Darlene during all of this?
She was at home asleep, taking a nap.
Gave off a weird vibe, though.
It was something we should've taken a closer look at.
Why?
What do you mean?
Well, about two years into his sentence, brother Ken hires a P.I.
He said he was so messed up on the night of his sister's death that he forgot he had an alibi.
So, the P.I. checks it out, proves it, gets Ken off.
But the kid blew his luck two days later on a motorcycle.
So, the mom was the only one at home the night that Chelsea died.
The cup used to dose her had the fingerprints of both Darlene and Ken on it.
So with Ken out of the picture,
Darlene was the last suspect standing.
But the DA refused to indict, based upon
Ken's wrongful conviction, because he said it
"muddied the waters."
Well, I guess the waters are a lot cleaner now that justice is served.
Well, you know, whether or not she was guilty back then,
Darlene Crocker was murdered.
And I need...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
The little girl was murdered.
Darlene got what was coming to her.
Hey... are we done here?
Because I got a lot of work to do.
Chromatogram of the by-products and impurities in the PCP sample from Darlene Crocker's motel room this morning, and the same analysis of the PCP that killed Chelsea Crocker in '89.
Mother and daughter didn't just die on PCP.
They died on PCP from the exact same batch.
Well, no dealer or user would hold on to the same drug batch for 22 years.
But I know someplace that does.
All right, a PCP sample from Chelsea's death was checked out of the police evidence vault last November.
By who?
Detective Stan Richardson?
Sample was never returned.
VARTANN:
Richardson?
He retired a year back.
Did you work with him much?
No, I used to drink with him.
A bunch of us did.
Bar called the Blue Rail.
Richardson would buy rounds and listen to us bitch about the job.
If you had a case that was really bothering you, you'd talk to him about it.
He had a way of putting things in perspective.
Make you feel better.
Did you talk to him about the Mikey Moran case?
About Kevin Fetzer?
It was 20 years ago.
You know, I might have.
Talk to him recently?
Not since I stopped drinking, so... 11 years, seven months and 14 days.
We've been trying to reach him, and his address and number on file are no good.
Like I said, you know, it's been years.
(sighs)
I mean, last I heard, there were still a few guys who'd tip 'em back with Richardson.
Who?
Hey, what do you drink, Jim?
Are you a scotch man?
I'm more picky about the company than the drink.
Did you forget something?
I heard that you used to drink with Stan Richardson.
Yeah, and...?
Well, I was just hoping you could tell me anything you could about him?
He's a good detective.
Wore the job hard.
Hopefully on a houseboat somewhere.
Did something happen to him?
Do you know where that houseboat might be?
This about the revenge murders?
Do you think he's involved?
We have reason to believe, yeah.
You're wrong.
It's a fantasy.
Every cop keeps a hit list of loose cases and unfinished business running around in his head.
Nobody ever acts on it.
Stan Richardson checked out drug evidence two days before he retired.
It was used this morning in the murder of Darlene Crocker.
Richardson is not a murderer.
Well, maybe he calls it justice.
You know?
They get what they have coming, right?
(phone rings)
Excuse me.
Yeah?
STOKES:
Okay, listen up, boss.
The Pension Office said Richardson's funds are direct deposit to some bank.
He said that automatic payments for rent are to 600 Oak Street.
Catherine and I are headed there right now.
Okay.
Make sure you bring backup.
(phone beeps off)
Mr. Richardson doesn't get many visitors.
Exactly how long has Mr. Richardson been residing here?
Six weeks.
He'll be missed when he departs.
Mr. Richardson, some friends are here to see you.
Detective...
Richardson?
You finally caught up to me.
RICHARDSON:
What more do you want?
You've got my confession.
I made those people pay for their crimes.
I'm ready to settle up.
Well, we've talked to your hospice nurses, Stan.
End-stage pancreatic cancer.
You haven't been out of bed in a month.
When something must be done, the universe has a way of granting power.
Oh, we're in agreement that you had help;
it was just more of the human variety.
(muffled cough) Well, since you're so at peace with the universe, you wouldn't mind us taking a look around your little corner of it?
No.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
If you see anything you like...
I have no need for it anymore.
(Richardson coughs)
Nick.
(whispering):
There was trace of lily pollen on Darlene Crocker.
Soil's been disturbed.
(muffled coughing)
Avenging angel's buried treasure?
Mm-hmm.
Angel's got to have somebody out there doing the killing for him.
That same killer tracked pollen into the motel scene, and the pollen led us to this lockbox.
Sara?
It's the evidence tag from the PCP that killed Chelsea and Darlene.
Hidden compartment.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Evidence from another cold case?
Maybe Richardson's got more names on his list.
Revenge.
Cool and serve.
I hope you got something.
Nick and Sara couldn't find any prints on Richardson's strongbox or its contents, so whoever's doing this is being careful.
Did you find any potential victims?
(sighs)
Talked with a dozen officers who worked with Richardson.
They got any ideas who else was in his bucket list, they're not saying.
And skimming the cases he worked, nothing stands out.
There's plenty of unsolveds, but no obvious ones that got away.
RUSSELL:
Sheriff Liston.
Stan Richardson was my first partner.
Taught me everything when I was a rookie.
Taught a lot of cops.
I don't know who he's working with now, but I got a bad feeling that's his next target.
Rex Camford?
15 years back,
Camford's wife filed for divorce.
Vanished the next night.
Same night Camford takes his boat out for a midnight cruise on Lake Mead.
All we had was a handful of circumstantial and a DA who shied from no-body cases.
No charges.
No doubt in my mind Camford killed his wife.
What about Richardson, did he feel the same way?
Well, after I talked his ear off about it for six whiskies straight at the Blue Rail, he was madder than I was.
Which is why I've been trying to get ahold of Camford.
His housekeeper said he didn't make it home from work.
Okay, why don't you...
WILLOWS:
Sheriff.
Ah, Catherine, Sheriff's got a hunch about another possible target.
What do you have?
Richardson's phone records from the hospice.
The only recent calls were made from a disposable cell.
Check out the times of the calls.
RUSSELL:
They line up with the times of the murders.
Yeah.
Someone has been keeping Richardson updated on his progress.
I was able to ping the disposable cell.
Signal hit tower 114 from a southerly direction, about five minutes ago.
So...
Richardson's wingman is at Lake Mead.
Good work.
And what are the chances Rex Camford's along for the ride?
(sirens wailing)
Detective Vega!
Show me your hands!
Son of a bitch!
BRASS:
Sam!
We all know what Camford did, and we're gonna make sure he pays for it.
Let us handle it.
System had its chance, Jim!
It didn't do jack!
You know, if it was just you and me, you'd be down here helping me out.
BRASS:
I'm trying to help you.
Lose the piece, and we're all good.
Drop the gun, Sam.
Hey, guys, he's not moving.
Sam...
STOKES:
Come on, Sammy, we've been through too much together, man.
Let us help you out.
Sure.
You can help me out.
BRASS:
No!
Vega!
Vega!
I got him!
STOKES:
Get him up to the bank!
Pull him up here!
Come on, Vega, stay with me.
Stay with me, brother.
Get him on his side.
Come on, now.
Here we go...
STOKES:
Vega!
Yeah, we got a pulse.
Go get an ambu-bag.
Go on.
OFFICER:
He's gonna make it.
No...
He's gone.
Control, this is Brass.
We have an officer down, 419.
Hey, hurry up!
All right, here we go, buddy.
Russell.
Why don't you back off of him?
Let-let them handle it.
They got it.
One additional.
Middle-aged man.
Requires medical.
Okay, bud, Denali's all packed up.
It's been a long night.
You want to hit the road?
Yeah, we probably should.
But let me ask you something.
There are miles of secluded shoreline on this lake, so why did Vega bring Rex here?
Why this spot in particular?
Maybe with a gun to his head, Rex was compelled to lead Vega to the very spot where he dumped his wife.
Now, that's interesting.
What do you say we wake somebody up.
- That looks like a skull.
- Oh, yeah.
Thank you, fellas.
Look at that.
Sharp orbital margins.
Female.
Shot in the back of the head...
look at that.
Probably dead before she hit the water.
You want to know what I remember most about that Camford case I worked back then?
This gorgeous Colt revolver sitting on that arrogant bastard's desk.
We still have it;
it's in evidence.
Richardson's not the only one that holds on to stuff.
(sighs)
RICHARDSON:
To my colleagues, who have shared the burden of the badge.
Many of you won't agree with my methods, but all of you will understand what it's like to have all the pieces set before you the picture painted broad and clear and watch the killer walk away to live the life they tore from others.
Well, I could not let that continue.
I made a list.
Five names.
Those most deserving of vengeance.
And now, as I embark into life's last mystery,
I do so in peace.
Detective Stanley Richardson,
Las Vegas Police Department.
I heard about the letter.
Guy certainly knew how to get his message across.
Well, cops can be refreshingly frank sometimes, right?
(sighs):
Listen...
I know you and I aren't gonna buy a summer house together anytime soon, but I have a lot of respect for you.
Let's not forget, we did put away a wife-killer.
Okay.
Good talk.
Hold on a minute.
Richardson's letter mentioned five names.
Yeah, Vega was the fifth.
There was a knife inside of Richardson's lockbox.
Sara found a little blood inside of it, and it was a match to a murdered informant that Vega had been working a few years past.
(sighs) Sam Vega could always be a little, um... overzealous, especially if he thought someone was holding out on him.
You want my theory?
Richardson knew that Vega was dirty.
Kept the murder weapon.
Because he wanted Vega to pay for his sins just like the rest of them.
You know, it turns out both funerals are on the same day.
Vega and Richardson.
Well...
I thought I'd get up early, get on a motorcycle, and get very far out of town.
I think that's a very good idea.
By Mikhel for Subtitulos.es ==SPREAD THE WORD==
So, Kevin, tell us what you want when you grow up.
When I grow up, this is what I want:
I want to have so much money,
I can't even fit it all in my house.
I want my own jet plane.
I want a mansion.
And I want, like, a whole bunch of really awesome things to play with.
Happy birthday, Kevin!
Friends... they say the past is prologue, and who would have guessed that that skinny kid would grow into the man standing before you today?
Yet beyond the bank account and the billion-push-up body and all of my other extracurricular achievements... inside, I'm still that ten-year-old boy.
And really... aren't we all?
Mind if I join the party?
Oh, my God!
Our battered birthday boy is Kevin Fetzer.
It was a private affair...
all the guests are his friends.
Well, with a possible exception or two.
Foots this bill, a guy's got to have some bucks.
Yeah, he was an entrepreneur, started a franchise called Joystick Jungle, something like that.
The king of drunken Donkey Kong.
Joystick Jungle, it's a video arcade for adults... pinball, Pac-Man, pizza, lots and lots of booze.
Letting intoxicated adults act like little kids.
It's a surefire investment.
Well... the new American Dream... perpetual adolescence, right?
Maybe that explains the underwear.
They're on backwards!
Got dressed in a hurry, or drunk?
Or... killer put them on him.
Wanted to turn him into a... little boy.
Specifically...
an eight-year-old.
Look at this.
Gravitational blood drops where the other candles have been deliberately removed.
Candles, redressing.
Killer took some time.
After he took his life.
CSI S12E08 "Crime After Crime"
By Mikhel for Subtitulos.es ==SPREAD THE WORD==
So you're the victim's best friend.
When did you last see Kevin?
Ten minutes before the big reveal.
Said he had to go behind the curtain, light the candles.
- Anybody go back there with him?
- No.
Kev liked to handle things himself.
Little bit of a control freak.
Didn't like surprises.
Russell.
Hey, Doc.
When I heard "tycoon,"
I was picturing top hat and monocle, or at least pants.
Obvious blunt-force trauma.
Oh, he lost his two front teeth.
Not so cute at his age.
Yeah, I couldn't find any teeth around here, but judging by the medium-velocity sprinkles on the cake, this is where the beating took place.
Something's stuck between the cuspid and incisor.
Could be dinner.
Huh.
Surveillance is pretty thin throughout the club, no eyes in this area.
The bouncer did say that there was one ugly incident earlier.
Kevin got into it with an uninvited guest, had him tossed out.
Anyone have a name for this uninvited guest?
Kevin called him "Dad."
Oh.
Son gives dad the heave-ho.
Maybe dad comes back to remind him who's the grownup.
Sure, Doc, take the awesome club scene, classic arcade games, beautiful women... why would I be interested in that?
Are you whining?
That's not very Super Dave of you.
Maybe we should remember that some people have it worse.
Yeah.
Like this poor John Doe.
If there ever was a candidate for stop, drop and roll.
Jimmy, let's go.
We have work to do.
He inhaled fumes at the scene.
Mm.
Okay, so what's this guy's deal?
Officer drove up on a fire blazing, open end of an alley, found him.
Burning tire around the body probably slipped down from his throat.
Necklacing...
South African thugs and cartels south of the border both do this.
It's sad the things that the world can agree on.
Not good seeing this in Vegas.
Same principle as being burned at the stake.
Takes a while for the CO and the smoke inhalation to kill you.
Until then, hell on earth.
Gang neighborhood,
Snakebacks versus La Tijeras.
Ah, let me guess...
no witnesses.
Didn't hear the screaming, didn't even smell the bonfire.
These tires are two different treads.
They're probably from a junkyard.
They're not gonna give us anything.
Hope of any trace or prints from the outside of the tires is up in smoke.
Well... let's try to get an I.D. on this guy.
I say... we strip the Michelin from the man.
Well, one C.O.D...
Cause Of De-pantsing, ...
is still a mystery.
No evidence of sexual activity.
Mm.
So the pants around his ankles was more message than make-out.
And the other C.O.D.?
Asphyxiation via fatal vanity.
His two front porcelain veneers were broken and inhaled.
Lacerated the bronchi, caused a bronchial spasm.
Teeth weren't the only body-mods.
Pec implants, hair plugs.
Geek makes money, remakes himself.
You take your new pride and joy for a spin, inevitably somebody dings it up.
Weapon was a round implement, roughly spherical.
Didn't find anything like that at the scene.
Booze flowing, games blasting, plenty of opportunity for the killer to sneak out with a weapon.
You throw a good enough party, people think they can get away with anything.
Who do you think you are, Kevin?
Think tossing me from your party makes you a man?
You're a weak and scared little boy!
Not exactly a Hallmark greeting.
But then you're not exactly a father, are you, Rick?
Abandoned him when he was ten, didn't pay a dime in child support, son of a deadbeat, beat dead.
You think I had something to do with that?
Well, I think that's a lot of rage to show a half an hour before he was killed.
And I think a trucker with a repo'd rig has got nothing to haul but a greedy grudge against his millionaire son.
You crash the party, you hit him up, he shoots you down, so you really hit him up.
And then you leave him a reminder... don't get too big for your britches.
There was something wrong with him, even when he was little.
Sick and twisted little something.
The way he'd look at people.
As he got older, made you not want to be around him.
So I'm not surprised someone would see fit to... beat the hell out of him.
Just wasn't me.
Well, you got an alibi or just your sunshiny attitude?
Soon as he made clear I wasn't getting paid,
I left that party.
Check the cameras at that casino next to the club.
I had better luck yanking those levers.
Spun a jackpot, won enough to get my truck back.
Happy birthday to me.
Unless your birthday vic was part beaver... the weapon was wooden.
Trace from his teeth is varnished oak.
Baseball bat?
Hmm, well... the unds are spherical, not cylindrical.
Rough extrapolation of the curvature, we're looking at something with a diameter of four to five inches?
Wooden ball.
Arcade tycoon, right?
Yeah.
Ah...
Arcade Bowl Ball.
Excuse me?
From the classic game of luck and skill beloved by children of all ages... my guess, that's what bashed your vic's face into a bloody pulp.
Arcade Bowl is not one of the games at the club, so the killer would have had to bring the ball in.
Making the weapon of choice significant, no?
Disgruntled arcade employee.
That's a good place to start.
Hey, how did swab-a-palooza go?
Uh, 200 party guests, all swabbed, printed and checked for spatter, all clean.
Well, maybe you'll have more luck at your next case.
I want you to restock your kit, and go meet Morgan at the Park Motel.
It's a scene, not a date, you wacky kid, you.
Hey, I heard you're looking for unhappy arcade clerks who might have played Whack-A-Boss.
I didn't find any.
And Fetzer's franchises don't carry Arcade Bowl.
But the weapon is so unusual that I searched online for any connection between Kevin Fetzer and the game.
Check this out.
In 1991, an eight-year-old boy named Mikey Moran was celebrating his birthday at an arcade.
He goes missing.
His body is found behind the place.
His pants are off;
he's been beaten to death.
The weapon, a bloody arcade ball, is lying next to him.
Unbelievable.
"Arcade worker Kevin Fetzer, age 15,
"said it was a day that nobody in the arcade would ever forget."
And guess what acne-faced future millionaire was questioned as a person of interest?
Kevin Fetzer.
Yeah.
I pulled the case file.
There was never an arrest made for the boy's murder.
Somebody turned Kevin's birthday into his judgment day.
Motel guest heard a disturbance, phoned it in, officers responded and found her.
Her name's Darlene Crocker.
Motel manager said she's been staying here a few weeks.
Alone?
Not really.
She's been known to have various male guests for an hour at a time.
But witnesses said nobody left during or after the attack.
Snuck out a window...?
Huh... no getting through those bars.
Bathroom windows would be tight, even for a lightweight, and this damage is Ali-Foreman.
Some sort of crystals...
cocaine?
Maybe meth?
Got a little powder near her mouth.
I don't think it's drug trace.
So... she's using with some lucky man of the hour.
Somehow, session goes sideways.
And what, he just kills her and leaves without anybody noticing?
These punctures have irregular jagged edges.
That's inconsistent with a single, sharp blade.
Messy stabbing... messy scene... clean getaway.
Like the killer just vanished.
Bloody Mary.
Well, yeah, there's an empty bottle of vodka on the bed.
No, not the drink, the ghost.
See, you stand in front of a mirror, lights out, you say her name three times... and then she bursts through the glass and kills you.
Are we at a crime scene or a seventh-grade sleepover?
Just a theory.
Someone beat Kevin Fetzer's face in with an arcade ball.
There's some justice in that.
I've got the case file from the original arcade ball murder...
Mikey Moran... just to jog your memory.
Yeah, that was one of the first murders I ever worked.
A scene like that, your memory gets plenty of miles on its own.
We found the body behind the arcade.
The weapon was right there.
And for my money, so was the killer.
That Fetzer kid struck me strange the instant I saw him.
He's hanging around the scene, and then he leaves for an hour, and comes back carrying two little shoes.
Ugh.
Mikey's?
He said that he found them ditched a half block away.
He just happened to be looking over there.
But there was no physical evidence found that connected Kevin Fetzer to the crime.
Well, we did find a pubic hair on the little boy...
blond, like Fetzer... but DNA testing was new, and we didn't get a result.
And it wasn't re-tested with improved technology?
The, uh, sample was consumed on the first test and... that was my call.
I was new on the job.
I went all in, and I crapped out.
That was the first time that I learned that the job isn't fair.
You know, you could have the killer standing right in front of you, know that he did it and... you know, it feels like the cuffs are on your own wrists.
We've all been there, Lou.
So, do you have any suspects on Kevin Fetzer's murder?
No.
Brass talked to Fetzer's dad, who had an alibi.
We got him on casino surveillance.
He should be talking to Mikey Moran's family.
After what Fetzer did to that little boy, if that were my kid, I wouldn't have waited 20 years.
Considering where and how we found him, we figured our John Doe was a Snakeback or a La Tijera.
There was nothing to help get more specific, except his arms pinned to his sides left small portions of unburnt flesh and an old battle wound.
I've been searching for similar scars in the gang database.
Our burning man is a La Tijera named Ramon Castillo, street name Espectro.
Yeah, it means "Ghost."
Big baller with La Tijeras some years back.
Made my early days in the gang task force a real joy.
Earned you some overtime, did he, Sam?
Yeah, he and a Snakeback rival, Diego Barra, they were a regular Itchy and Scratchy.
Shots traded back and forth, killing each other's friends.
Barra's still on the street?
No.
Been locked up for almost a decade now.
He could have ordered the hit from inside, no?
Let's put him on a bus and bring his ass down here and talk to him.
How's your Spanish these days?
No bueno.
But you can help me out there, bud.
Tu?
Nunca.
Vamos.
Your motel vic's organs are pale as a result of exsanguination due to severing of the carotid jugular complex.
Her throat was slashed.
Someone did a number on her.
Hello.
Maybe Darlene Crocker looked her killer in the eye and didn't like what she saw.
Weapon was a shard of broken mirror.
Hers were the only prints on it.
No one was seen leaving the motel room, so we're thinking she killed herself.
Brutality like this is unusual.
Suicide is resignation.
These wounds are rage.
Did you and Morgan find any drugs at the scene?
Uh, just some kind of crystal trace.
Smell this.
Ugh!
Room service in Hell doesn't smell that bad.
What is it?
A distinct ether-like odor.
Pretty rare these days.
PCP.
Oh, bad trip.
That would explain the self-mutilation.
Hallucinatory state.
She thinks she's fighting off untold dark forces.
Not self-destruction... in her mind, self-defense.
Well, Henry's running tox right now.
If it is PCP, we'll get confirmation.
Detective Vega.
I know you.
You put me in the joint and never come to visit.
I was waiting for a special occasion, like the day they'd flip the switch.
You must be confusing me with some other innocent vato.
I'm only doing 25 to life.
Not if you had anything to do with killing Espectro.
Serious?
Damn right I'm serious.
Someone ghosted him for real?
I'm shocked you didn't know.
You best believe I wanted to kill him.
But the punk vanished underground before I had a chance to stick him there.
So whoever took him out, how'd they do it?
Must have been a lucky shot, because there was no getting close to Espectro.
That wasn't luck.
Marta.
Marta?
Who-Who's Marta?
No man did that.
For a sinner like Espectro, there's forces in the universe more powerful than man.
Marta Arterro,
Diego Barra's girlfriend from back in '02.
Now, the hood grapevine says that Espectro was the one who set her ablaze.
And now somebody kills Espectro in the same fiery manner.
Nine years later?
That's some serious felony procrastination.
Well, it's 11 years quicker than it took
Kevin Fetzer to catch his retribution.
Okay...
Two crimes...
Both blasts from the past.
Do we think there's a connection?
Crime scene photo doesn't do the trace justice.
You're right.
It's lovely.
What the heck is it?
The trace you got from your motel vic's face is pollen.
From the flame lily.
The particles, not unlike one David Hodges, exhibit a highly-sculptured outer shell.
Helps them cling to passing bodies in desperate hopes of propagation.
There were no flowers in the motel room.
And we didn't see anything outside.
Possible pollen transfer from the killer.
Morgan, I got those results.
Thanks for the flowers... but I got a date with Henry.
Doc Robbins' nose knows drugs.
Motel vic's tox panel showed a lethal level of PCP in her system.
Angel dust?
!
Thought that stuff went out in the early '90s.
Well, you're right.
And the sample she ingested appears to be from a vintage batch of the drug.
See, there's a trace of a component,
PCC, in her blood...
it was a compound used to manufacture PCP until the early '90s when PCC became heavily controlled.
Nobody uses that recipe anymore.
Why would somebody hold on to an old dose of PCP?
With age, it acquires delicious notes of a woodsy vanilla.
No, it stays the same toxic, stinking nightmare fuel it started as.
Doesn't make any sense.
Hm.
Holed up in that hotel room, dosed with a blast from the past.
Did you just say "blast from the past"?
Our motel room vic, Darlene Crocker, ingested a lethal load of vintage formula PCP.
Okay, Henry, check out the LIMS database to see if Darlenene Crocker has any prior criminal record or any connection to old crimes.
Doesn't have to be recent.
Today, the past is present.
Whoa.
Happened again...
again.
Morgan and Greg's case.
A Darlene Crocker.
1989, her 12-and-a-half- year-old daughter Chelsea died a pretty gruesome death on PCP, just like her mother did today.
A little girl with that kind of drug?
Junkie older brother, Ken Crocker, confessed to having fed it to her and then got sent away.
22 years later, Mom self-destructs on the same drug?
Yeah.
See, I'm not so sure that she just happened to choose today to take that dose.
Somebody forced her to take it... murder.
Just like the burning tires and the arcade ball.
Death by deja vu.
Tonight, you will, be visited by the spirits of three old cases...
Uh, sorry, I haven't had much sleep lately.
The question is, why these three cases, and why now?
And who's this mysterious Jacob Marley summoning their spirits?
There's no obvious connections, and there's years between the murders.
It's three different areas of Vegas, tire-fire Marta in a Northside hood,
PCP Chelsea in a trailer park, and Birthday Mikey in the burbs.
Two child vics, one adult.
One big difference.
Espectro and Fetzer both escaped justice, at least the first time around, but the Crocker case was solved.
Brother was convicted.
So why's Darlene paying for that now?
Maybe someone thinks the wrong person paid for it back then.
Yeah.
All right, there's got to be more to that story.
Chelsea Crocker... she had little plastic flower barrettes in her hair.
The strands of it she ripped out at the scalp as the PCP ripped through her, scratched her arms to threads.
She was 12 years old, 70 pounds.
Gram of PCP shoved down her throat.
Dumped like trash.
What ab... what about the brother?
Ken Crocker.
19, user.
We found him a day later in an alleyway on the nod, right?
He confessed.
Said his little sister was getting on his nerves, so he fed her the dust, just wanted to see what would happen.
Wow.
All right.
And where-where was Mom Darlene during all of this?
She was at home asleep, taking a nap.
Gave off a weird vibe, though.
It was something we should've taken a closer look at.
Why?
What do you mean?
Well, about two years into his sentence, brother Ken hires a P.I.
He said he was so messed up on the night of his sister's death that he forgot he had an alibi.
So, the P.I. checks it out, proves it, gets Ken off.
But the kid blew his luck two days later on a motorcycle.
So, the mom was the only one at home the night that Chelsea died.
The cup used to dose her had the fingerprints of both Darlene and Ken on it.
So with Ken out of the picture,
Darlene was the last suspect standing.
But the DA refused to indict, based upon
Ken's wrongful conviction, because he said it
"muddied the waters."
Well, I guess the waters are a lot cleaner now that justice is served.
Well, you know, whether or not she was guilty back then,
Darlene Crocker was murdered.
And I need...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
The little girl was murdered.
Darlene got what was coming to her.
Hey... are we done here?
Because I got a lot of work to do.
Chromatogram of the by-products and impurities in the PCP sample from Darlene Crocker's motel room this morning, and the same analysis of the PCP that killed Chelsea Crocker in '89.
Mother and daughter didn't just die on PCP.
They died on PCP from the exact same batch.
Well, no dealer or user would hold on to the same drug batch for 22 years.
But I know someplace that does.
All right, a PCP sample from Chelsea's death was checked out of the police evidence vault last November.
By who?
Detective Stan Richardson?
Sample was never returned.
Richardson?
He retired a year back.
Did you work with him much?
No, I used to drink with him.
A bunch of us did.
Bar called the Blue Rail.
Richardson would buy rounds and listen to us bitch about the job.
If you had a case that was really bothering you, you'd talk to him about it.
He had a way of putting things in perspective.
Make you feel better.
Did you talk to him about the Mikey Moran case?
About Kevin Fetzer?
It was 20 years ago.
You know, I might have.
Talk to him recently?
Not since I stopped drinking, so... 11 years, seven months and 14 days.
We've been trying to reach him, and his address and number on file are no good.
Like I said, you know, it's been years.
I mean, last I heard, there were still a few guys who'd tip 'em back with Richardson.
Who?
Hey, what do you drink, Jim?
Are you a scotch man?
I'm more picky about the company than the drink.
Did you forget something?
I heard that you used to drink with Stan Richardson.
Yeah, and...?
Well, I was just hoping you could tell me anything you could about him?
He's a good detective.
Wore the job hard.
Hopefully on a houseboat somewhere.
Did something happen to him?
Do you know where that houseboat might be?
This about the revenge murders?
Do you think he's involved?
We have reason to believe, yeah.
You're wrong.
It's a fantasy.
Every cop keeps a hit list of loose cases and unfinished business running around in his head.
Nobody ever acts on it.
Stan Richardson checked out drug evidence two days before he retired.
It was used this morning in the murder of Darlene Crocker.
Richardson is not a murderer.
Well, maybe he calls it justice.
You know?
They get what they have coming, right?
Excuse me.
Yeah?
Okay, listen up, boss.
The Pension Office said Richardson's funds are direct deposit to some bank.
He said that automatic payments for rent are to 600 Oak Street.
Catherine and I are headed there right now.
Okay.
Make sure you bring backup.
Mr. Richardson doesn't get many visitors.
Exactly how long has Mr. Richardson been residing here?
Six weeks.
He'll be missed when he departs.
Mr. Richardson, some friends are here to see you.
Detective...
Richardson?
You finally caught up to me.
What more do you want?
You've got my confession.
I made those people pay for their crimes.
I'm ready to settle up.
Well, we've talked to your hospice nurses, Stan.
End-stage pancreatic cancer.
You haven't been out of bed in a month.
When something must be done, the universe has a way of granting power.
Oh, we're in agreement that you had help;
it was just more of the human variety.
Well, since you're so at peace with the universe, you wouldn't mind us taking a look around your little corner of it?
No.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
If you see anything you like...
I have no need for it anymore.
Nick.
There was trace of lily pollen on Darlene Crocker.
Soil's been disturbed.
Avenging angel's buried treasure?
Mm-hmm.
Angel's got to have somebody out there doing the killing for him.
That same killer tracked pollen into the motel scene, and the pollen... led us to this lockbox.
Sara?
It's the evidence tag from the PCP that killed Chelsea and Darlene.
Hidden compartment.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Evidence from another cold case?
Maybe Richardson's got more names on his list.
Revenge.
Cool and serve.
I hope you got something.
Nick and Sara couldn't find any prints on Richardson's strongbox or its contents, so whoever's doing this is being careful.
Did you find any potential victims?
Talked with a dozen officers who worked with Richardson.
They got any ideas who else was in his bucket list, they're not saying.
And skimming the cases he worked, nothing stands out.
There's plenty of unsolveds, but no obvious ones that got away.
Sheriff Liston.
Stan Richardson was my first partner.
Taught me everything when I was a rookie.
Taught a lot of cops.
I don't know who he's working with now, but I got a bad feeling that's his next target.
Rex Camford?
15 years back,
Camford's wife filed for divorce.
Vanished the next night.
Same night Camford takes his boat out for a midnight cruise on Lake Mead.
All we had was a handful of circumstantial and a DA who shied from no-body cases.
No charges.
No doubt in my mind Camford killed his wife.
What about Richardson, did he feel the same way?
Well, after I talked his ear off about it for six whiskies straight at the Blue Rail, he was madder than I was.
Which is why I've been trying to get ahold of Camford.
His housekeeper said he didn't make it home from work.
Okay, why don't you...
Sheriff.
Ah, Catherine, Sheriff's got a hunch about another possible target.
What do you have?
Richardson's phone records from the hospice.
The only recent calls were made from a disposable cell.
Check out the times of the calls.
They line up with the times of the murders.
Yeah.
Someone has been keeping Richardson updated on his progress.
I was able to ping the disposable cell.
Signal hit tower 114 from a southerly direction, about five minutes ago.
So...
Richardson's wingman is at Lake Mead.
Good work.
And what are the chances Rex Camford's along for the ride?
Detective Vega!
Show me your hands!
Son of a bitch!
Sam!
We all know what Camford did, and we're gonna make sure he pays for it.
Let us handle it.
System had its chance, Jim!
It didn't do jack!
You know, if it was just you and me, you'd be down here helping me out.
I'm trying to help you.
Lose the piece, and we're all good.
Drop the gun, Sam.
Hey, guys, he's not moving.
Come on, Sammy, we've been through too much together, man.
Let us help you out.
Sure.
You can help me out.
No!
Vega!
Vega!
I got him!
Get him up to the bank!
Pull him up here!
Come on, Vega, stay with me.
Stay with me, brother.
Get him on his side.
Come on, now.
- Here we go...
- Vega!
Yeah, we got a pulse.
Go get an ambu-bag.
Go on.
He's gonna make it.
No...
He's gone.
Control, this is Brass.
We have an officer down, 419.
Hey, hurry up!
All right, here we go, buddy.
Russell.
Why don't you back off of him?
Let-let them handle it.
They got it.
One additional.
Middle-aged man.
Requires medical.
Okay, bud, Denali's all packed up.
It's been a long night.
You want to hit the road?
Yeah, we probably should.
But let me ask you something.
There are miles of secluded shoreline on this lake, so why did Vega bring Rex here?
Why this spot in particular?
Maybe with a gun to his head, Rex was compelled to lead Vega to the very spot where he dumped his wife.
Now, that's interesting.
What do you say we wake somebody up.
- That looks like a skull.
- Oh, yeah.
Thank you, fellas.
Look at that.
Sharp orbital margins.
Female.
Shot in the back of the head...
look at that.
Probably dead before she hit the water.
You want to know what I remember most about that Camford case I worked back then?
This gorgeous Colt revolver sitting on that arrogant bastard's desk.
We still have it;
it's in evidence.
Richardson's not the only one that holds on to stuff.
To my colleagues, who have shared the burden of the badge.
Many of you won't agree with my methods, but all of you will understand... what it's like to have all the pieces set before you... the picture painted broad and clear... and watch the killer walk away... to live the life they tore from others.
Well, I could not let that continue.
I made a list.
Five names.
Those most deserving of vengeance.
And now, as I embark into life's last mystery,
I do so in peace.
Detective Stanley Richardson,
Las Vegas Police Department.
I heard about the letter.
Guy certainly knew how to get his message across.
Well, cops can be refreshingly frank sometimes, right?
Listen...
I know you and I aren't gonna buy a summer house together anytime soon, but I have a lot of respect for you.
Let's not forget, we did put away a wife-killer.
Okay.
Good talk.
Hold on a minute.
Richardson's letter mentioned five names.
Yeah, Vega was the fifth.
There was a knife inside of Richardson's lockbox.
Sara found a little blood inside of it, and it was a match to a murdered informant that Vega had been working a few years past.
Sam Vega could always be a little, um... overzealous, especially if he thought someone was holding out on him.
You want my theory?
Richardson knew that Vega was dirty.
Kept the murder weapon.
Because he wanted Vega to pay for his sins just like the rest of them.
You know, it turns out both funerals are on the same day.
Vega and Richardson.
Well...
I thought I'd get up early, get on a motorcycle, and get very far out of town.
I think that's a very good idea.
By Mikhel for Subtitulos.es ==SPREAD THE WORD==
(music stops)
WOMAN:
So, Kevin, tell us what you want when you grow up.
When I grow up, this is what I want:
I want to have so much money,
I can't even fit it all in my house.
I want my own jet plane.
I want a mansion.
And I want, like, a whole bunch of really awesome things to play with.
(laughter, whooping)
(cheering)
WOMEN:
Happy birthday, Kevin!
(cheering, whooping)
Friends... they say the past is prologue, and who would have guessed that that skinny kid would grow into the man standing before you today?
Yet beyond the bank account and the billion-push-up body and all of my other extracurricular achievements... (crowd whooping, laughing) ...inside, I'm still that ten-year-old boy.
(guests laughing)
And really... aren't we all?
Mind if I join the party?
(champagne cork pops, guests cheer)
(screaming)
(screams, gasps, murmuring)
Oh, my God!
Our battered birthday boy is Kevin Fetzer.
It was a private affair-- all the guests are his friends.
Well, with a possible exception or two.
Foots this bill, a guy's got to have some bucks.
Yeah, he was an entrepreneur, started a franchise called Joystick Jungle, something like that.
The king of drunken Donkey Kong.
Joystick Jungle, it's a video arcade for adults-- pinball, Pac-Man, pizza, lots and lots of booze.
Letting intoxicated adults act like little kids.
It's a surefire investment.
Well... the new American Dream-- perpetual adolescence, right?
Maybe that explains the underwear.
They're on backwards!
Got dressed in a hurry, or drunk?
RUSSELL:
Or... killer put them on him.
Wanted to turn him into a... little boy.
Specifically... an eight-year-old.
Look at this.
WILLOWS:

When did you last see Kevin?
Ten minutes before the big reveal.
Said he had to go behind the curtain, light the candles.
Anybody go back there with him?
No.
Kev liked to handle things himself.
Little bit of a control freak.
Didn't like surprises.
ROBBINS:
Russell.
Hey, Doc.
When I heard "tycoon,"
I was picturing top hat and monocle, or at least pants.
Obvious blunt-force trauma.
Oh, he lost his two front teeth.
Not so cute at his age.
Yeah, I couldn't find any teeth around here, but judging by the medium-velocity sprinkles on the cake, this is where the beating took place.
ROBBINS:
Something's stuck between the cuspid and incisor.
Could be dinner.
Huh.
SANDERS:
Surveillance is pretty thin throughout the club, no eyes in this area.
The bouncer did say that there was one ugly incident earlier.
Kevin got into it with an uninvited guest, had him tossed out.
Anyone have a name for this uninvited guest?
Kevin called him "Dad."
Oh.
WILLOWS:
Son gives dad the heave-ho.
Maybe dad comes back to remind him who's the grownup.
Sure, Doc, take the awesome club scene, classic arcade games, beautiful women... why would I be interested in that?
Are you whining?
That's not very Super Dave of you.
SIDLE:
Maybe we should remember that some people have it worse.
- Yeah.
Like this poor John Doe.
If there ever was a candidate for stop, drop and roll.
Jimmy, let's go.
We have work to do.
He inhaled fumes at the scene.
Mm.
Okay, so what's this guy's deal?
Officer drove up on a fire blazing, open end of an alley, found him.
Burning tire around the body probably slipped down from his throat.
Necklacing--
South African thugs and cartels south of the border both do this.
It's sad the things that the world can agree on.
Not good seeing this in Vegas.
Same principle as being burned at the stake.
(shouting)
SIDLE:
Takes a while for the CO and the smoke inhalation to kill you.
Until then, hell on earth.
Gang neighborhood,
Snakebacks versus La Tijeras.
Ah, let me guess-- no witnesses.
Didn't hear the screaming, didn't even smell the bonfire.
These tires are two different treads.
They're probably from a junkyard.
They're not gonna give us anything.
SIDE:
Hope of any trace or prints from the outside of the tires is up in smoke.
Well... let's try to get an I.D. on this guy.
I say... we strip the Michelin from the man.
Well, one C.O.D.--
Cause Of De-pantsing,-- is still a mystery.
No evidence of sexual activity.
Mm.
So the pants around his ankles was more message than make-out.
And the other C.O.D.?
Asphyxiation via fatal vanity.
His two front porcelain veneers were broken and inhaled.
(screams)
ROBBINS:
Lacerated the bronchi, caused a bronchial spasm.
Teeth weren't the only body-mods.
Pec implants, hair plugs.
Geek makes money, remakes himself.
You take your new pride and joy for a spin, inevitably somebody dings it up.
Weapon was a round implement, roughly spherical.
Didn't find anything like that at the scene.
Booze flowing, games blasting, plenty of opportunity for the killer to sneak out with a weapon.
You throw a good enough party, people think they can get away with anything.
MAN (on voicemail):
Who do you think you are, Kevin?
Think tossing me from your party makes you a man?
You're a weak and scared little boy!
Not exactly a Hallmark greeting.
But then you're not exactly a father, are you, Rick?
Abandoned him when he was ten, didn't pay a dime in child support, son of a deadbeat, beat dead.
You think I had something to do with that?
Well, I think that's a lot of rage to show a half an hour before he was killed.
And I think a trucker with a repo'd rig has got nothing to haul but a greedy grudge against his millionaire son.
You crash the party, you hit him up, he shoots you down, so you really hit him up.
And then you leave him a reminder-- don't get too big for your britches.
There was something wrong with him, even when he was little.
Sick and twisted little something.
The way he'd look at people.
As he got older, made you not want to be around him.
So I'm not surprised someone would see fit to... beat the hell out of him.
Just wasn't me.
Well, you got an alibi or just your sunshiny attitude?
Soon as he made clear I wasn't getting paid,
I left that party.
Check the cameras at that casino next to the club.
I had better luck yanking those levers.
Spun a jackpot, won enough to get my truck back.
(sighs)
Happy birthday to me.
Unless your birthday vic was part beaver... the weapon was wooden.
WILLOWS:
Trace from his teeth is varnished oak.
Baseball bat?
Hmm, well... the wounds are spherical, not cylindrical.
Rough extrapolation of the curvature, we're looking at something with a diameter of four to five inches?
Wooden ball.
Arcade tycoon, right?
- Yeah.
- Ah...
Arcade Bowl Ball.
Excuse me?
From the classic game of luck and skill beloved by children of all ages-- my guess, that's what bashed your vic's face into a bloody pulp.
WILLOWS:
Arcade Bowl is not one of the games at the club, so the killer would have had to bring the ball in.
Making the weapon of choice significant, no?
Disgruntled arcade employee.
That's a good place to start.
RUSSELL:
Hey, how did swab-a-palooza go?
Uh, 200 party guests, all swabbed, printed and checked for spatter, all clean.
Well, maybe you'll have more luck at your next case.
I want you to restock your kit, and go meet Morgan at the Park Motel.
It's a scene, not a date, you wacky kid, you.
Hey, I heard you're looking for unhappy arcade clerks who might have played Whack-A-Boss.
I didn't find any.
And Fetzer's franchises don't carry Arcade Bowl.
But the weapon is so unusual that I searched online for any connection between Kevin Fetzer and the game.
Check this out.
In 1991, an eight-year-old boy named Mikey Moran was celebrating his birthday at an arcade.
He goes missing.
His body is found behind the place.
His pants are off;
he's been beaten to death.
The weapon, a bloody arcade ball, is lying next to him.
Unbelievable.
RUSSELL: "Arcade worker Kevin Fetzer, age 15,
"said it was a day that nobody in the arcade would ever forget."
And guess what acne-faced future millionaire was questioned as a person of interest?
Kevin Fetzer.
Yeah.
I pulled the case file.
There was never an arrest made for the boy's murder.
Somebody turned Kevin's birthday into his judgment day.
(woman screaming)
BRODY:
Motel guest heard a disturbance, phoned it in, officers responded and found her.
Her name's Darlene Crocker.
Motel manager said she's been staying here a few weeks.
- Alone?
- Not really.
She's been known to have various male guests...
For an hour at a time.
But witnesses said nobody left during or after the attack.
Snuck out a window...?
Huh-- no getting through those bars.
Bathroom windows would be tight, even for a lightweight, and this damage is Ali-Foreman.
Some sort of crystals--
Cocaine?
Maybe meth?
Got a little powder near her mouth.
I don't think it's drug trace.
So... she's using with some lucky man of the hour.
Somehow, session goes sideways.
And what, he just kills her and leaves without anybody noticing?
These punctures have irregular jagged edges.
That's inconsistent with a single, sharp blade.
Messy stabbing... messy scene... clean getaway.
Like the killer just vanished.
Bloody Mary.
Well, yeah, there's an empty bottle of vodka on the bed.
No, not the drink, the ghost.
You stand in front of a mirror, lights out, you say your name three times.
And she bursts through the glass and kills you.
Are we at a crime scene, or a seventh-grade sleepover?
(sighs)
Just a theory.
Someone beat Kevin Fetzer's face in with an arcade ball.
There's some justice in that.
I've got the case file from the original arcade ball murder--
Mikey Moran-- just to jog your memory.
Yeah, that was one of the first murders I ever worked.
A scene like that, your memory gets plenty of miles on its own.
We found the body behind the arcade.
The weapon was right there.
And for my money, so was the killer.
That Fetzer kid struck me strange the instant I saw him.
He's hanging around the scene, and then he leaves for an hour, and comes back carrying two little shoes.
Ugh.
Mikey's?
He said that he found them ditched a half block away.
He just happened to be looking over there.
But there was no physical evidence found that connected Kevin Fetzer to the crime.
Well, we did find a pubic hair on the little boy-- blond, like Fetzer-- but DNA testing was new, and we didn't get a result.
And it wasn't re-tested with improved technology?
The, uh, sample was consumed on the first test and... that was my call.
I was new on the job.
I went all in, and I crapped out.
That was the first time that I learned that the job isn't fair.
You know, you could have the killer standing right in front of you, know that he did it and... you know, it feels like the cuffs are on your own wrists.
We've all been there, Lou.
So, do you have any suspects on Kevin Fetzer's murder?
No.
Brass talked to Fetzer's dad, who had an alibi.
We got him on casino surveillance.
He should be talking to Mikey Moran's family.
After what Fetzer did to that little boy, if that were my kid, I wouldn't have waited 20 years.
SIDLE:
Considering where and how we found him, we figured our John Doe was a Snakeback or a La Tijera.
There was nothing to help get more specific, except his arms pinned to his sides left small portions of unburnt flesh and an old battle wound.
SIDLE:
I've been searching for similar scars in the gang database.
Our burning man is a La Tijera named Ramon Castillo, street name Espectro.
Yeah, it means "Ghost."
VEGA:
Big baller with La Tijeras some years back.
Made my early days in the gang task force a real joy.
Earned you some overtime, did he, Sam?
Yeah, he and a Snakeback rival, Diego Barra, they were a regular Itchy and Scratchy.
Shots traded back and forth, killing each other's friends.
- Barra's still on the street?
- No.
Been locked up for almost a decade now.
He could have ordered the hit from inside, no?
Let's put him on a bus and bring his ass down here and talk to him.
How's your Spanish these days?
No bueno.
But you can help me out there, bud.
Tu?
Nunca.
Vamos.
Your motel vic's organs are pale as a result of exsanguination due to severing of the carotid jugular complex.
STOKES:
Her throat was slashed.
Someone did a number on her.
Hello.
Maybe Darlene Crocker looked her killer in the eye and didn't like what she saw.
Weapon was a shard of broken mirror.
Hers were the only prints on it.
No one was seen leaving the motel room, so we're thinking she killed herself.
(screaming)
Brutality like this is unusual.
Suicide is resignation.
These wounds are rage.
(inhales)
Did you and Morgan find any drugs at the scene?
Uh, just some kind of crystal trace.
Smell this.
Ugh!
Room service in Hell doesn't smell that bad.
What is it?
A distinct ether-like odor.
Pretty rare these days.
PCP.
Oh, bad trip.
That would explain the self-mutilation.
(trembling laughter)
Hallucinatory state.
She thinks she's fighting off untold dark forces.
(eerie laughter)
ROBBINS:
Not self-destruction... in her mind, self-defense.
Well, Henry's running tox right now.
If it is PCP, we'll get confirmation.
Detective Vega.
I know you.
You put me in the joint and never come to visit.
I was waiting for a special occasion, like the day they'd flip the switch.
(laughs)
You must be confusing me with some other innocent vato.
I'm only doing 25 to life.
Not if you had anything to do with killing Espectro.
Serious?
Damn right I'm serious.
Someone ghosted him for real?
I'm shocked you didn't know.
You best believe I wanted to kill him.
But the punk vanished underground before I had a chance to stick him there.
So whoever took him out, how'd they do it?
Must have been a lucky shot, because there was no getting close to Espectro.
That wasn't luck.
(whispering):
Marta.
Marta?
Who-Who's Marta?
No man did that.
For a sinner like Espectro, there's forces in the universe more powerful than man.
STOKES:
Marta Arterro,
Diego Barra's girlfriend from back in '02.
Now, the hood grapevine says that Espectro was the one who set her ablaze.
And now somebody kills Espectro in the same fiery manner.
Nine years later?
That's some serious felony procrastination.
Well, it's 11 years quicker than it took
Kevin Fetzer to catch his retribution.
RUSSELL:
Okay...
Two crimes...
Both blasts from the past.
Do we think there's a connection?
HODGES:
Crime scene photo doesn't do the trace justice.
BRODY:
You're right.
It's lovely.
What the heck is it?
The trace you got from your motel vic's face is pollen.
From the flame lily.
The particles, not unlike one David Hodges, exhibit a highly-sculptured outer shell.
Helps them cling to passing bodies in desperate hopes of propagation.
There were no flowers in the motel room.
And we didn't see anything outside.
Possible pollen transfer from the killer.
Morgan, I got those results.
Thanks for the flowers but I got a date with Henry.
Doc Robbins' nose knows drugs.
Motel vic's tox panel showed a lethal level of PCP in her system.
Angel dust?
!
Thought that stuff went out in the early '90s.
Well, you're right.
And the sample she ingested appears to be from a vintage batch of the drug.
See, there's a trace of a component,
PCC, in her blood-- it was a compound used to manufacture PCP until the early '90s when PCC became heavily controlled.
Nobody uses that recipe anymore.
Why would somebody hold on to an old dose of PCP?
With age, it acquires delicious notes of a woodsy vanilla.
No, it stays the same toxic, stinking nightmare fuel it started as.
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Hm.
Holed up in that hotel room, dosed with a blast from the past.
Did you just say "blast from the past"?
Our motel room vic, Darlene Crocker, ingested a lethal load of vintage formula PCP.
Okay, Henry, check out the LIMS database to see if Darlene Crocker has any prior criminal record or any connection to old crimes.
Doesn't have to be recent.
Today, the past is present.
Whoa.
Happened again...
again.
Morgan and Greg's case.
A Darlene Crocker.
1989, her 12-and-a-half- year-old daughter Chelsea died a pretty gruesome death on PCP, just like her mother did today.
(groans) A little girl with that kind of drug?
Junkie older brother, Ken Crocker, confessed to having fed it to her and then got sent away.
22 years later, Mom self-destructs on the same drug?
Yeah.
See, I'm not so sure that she just happened to choose today to take that dose.
Somebody forced her to take it-- murder.
Just like the burning tires and the arcade ball.
Death by deja vu.
RUSSELL:
Tonight, you will be visited by the spirits of three old cases...
Uh, sorry, I haven't had much sleep lately.
The question is, why these three cases, and why now?
And who's this mysterious Jacob Marley summoning their spirits?
There's no obvious connections, and there's years between the murders.
It's three different areas of Vegas, tire-fire Marta in a Northside hood,
PCP Chelsea in a trailer park, and Birthday Mikey in the burbs.
Two child vics, one adult.
SIDLE:
One big difference.
Espectro and Fetzer both escaped justice, at least the first time around, but the Crocker case was solved.
Brother was convicted.
So why's Darlene paying for that now?
Maybe someone thinks the wrong person paid for it back then.
Yeah.
All right, there's got to be more to that story.
Chelsea Crocker-- she had little plastic flower barrettes in her hair.
The strands of it she ripped out at the scalp as the PCP ripped through her, scratched her arms to threads.
She was 12 years old, 70 pounds.
Gram of PCP shoved down her throat.
Dumped like trash.
What ab-- what about the brother?
Ken Crocker.
19, user.
We found him a day later in an alleyway on the nod, right?
He confessed.
Said his little sister was getting on his nerves, so he fed her the dust, just wanted to see what would happen.
Wow.
All right.
And where-where was Mom Darlene during all of this?
She was at home asleep, taking a nap.
Gave off a weird vibe, though.
It was something we should've taken a closer look at.
Why?
What do you mean?
Well, about two years into his sentence, brother Ken hires a P.I.
He said he was so messed up on the night of his sister's death that he forgot he had an alibi.
So, the P.I. checks it out, proves it, gets Ken off.
But the kid blew his luck two days later on a motorcycle.
So, the mom was the only one at home the night that Chelsea died.
The cup used to dose her had the fingerprints of both Darlene and Ken on it.
So with Ken out of the picture,
Darlene was the last suspect standing.
But the DA refused to indict, based upon
Ken's wrongful conviction, because he said it
"muddied the waters."
Well, I guess the waters are a lot cleaner now that justice is served.
Well, you know, whether or not she was guilty back then,
Darlene Crocker was murdered.
- And I need...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
The little girl was murdered.
Darlene got what was coming to her.
Hey... are we done here?
Because I got a lot of work to do.
Chromatogram of the by-products and impurities in the PCP sample from Darlene Crocker's motel room this morning, and the same analysis of the PCP that killed Chelsea Crocker in '89.
Mother and daughter didn't just die on PCP.
They died on PCP from the exact same batch.
Well, no dealer or user would hold on to the same drug batch for 22 years.
But I know someplace that does.
All right, a PCP sample from Chelsea's death was checked out of the police evidence vault last November.
By who?
Detective Stan Richardson?
Sample was never returned.
VARTANN:
Richardson?
He retired a year back.
Did you work with him much?
No, I used to drink with him.
A bunch of us did.
Bar called the Blue Rail.
Richardson would buy rounds and listen to us bitch about the job.
If you had a case that was really bothering you, you'd talk to him about it.
He had a way of putting things in perspective.
Make you feel better.
Did you talk to him about the Mikey Moran case?
About Kevin Fetzer?
It was 20 years ago.
You know, I might have.
Talk to him recently?
Not since I stopped drinking, so... 11 years, seven months and 14 days.
We've been trying to reach him, and his address and number on file are no good.
Like I said, you know, it's been years.
(sighs)
I mean, last I heard, there were still a few guys who'd tip 'em back with Richardson.
Who?
Hey, what do you drink, Jim?
Are you a scotch man?
I'm more picky about the company than the drink.
Did you forget something?
I heard that you used to drink with Stan Richardson.
Yeah, and...?
Well, I was just hoping you could tell me anything you could about him?
He's a good detective.
Wore the job hard.
Hopefully on a houseboat somewhere.
Did something happen to him?
Do you know where that houseboat might be?
This about the revenge murders?
Do you think he's involved?
We have reason to believe, yeah.
You're wrong.
It's a fantasy.
Every cop keeps a hit list of loose cases and unfinished business running around in his head.
Nobody ever acts on it.
Stan Richardson checked out drug evidence two days before he retired.
It was used this morning in the murder of Darlene Crocker.
Richardson is not a murderer.
Well, maybe he calls it justice.
You know?
They get what they have coming, right?
(phone rings)
Excuse me.
Yeah?
STOKES:
Okay, listen up, boss.
The Pension Office said Richardson's funds are direct deposit to some bank.
He said that automatic payments for rent are to 600 Oak Street.
Catherine and I are headed there right now.
Okay.
Make sure you bring backup.
(phone beeps off)
Mr. Richardson doesn't get many visitors.
Exactly how long has Mr. Richardson been residing here?
Six weeks.
He'll be missed when he departs.
Mr. Richardson, some friends are here to see you.
Detective...
Richardson?
You finally caught up to me.
RICHARDSON:
What more do you want?
.
You've got my confession.
I made those people pay for their crimes.
I'm ready to settle up.
Well, we've talked to your hospice nurses, Stan.
End-stage pancreatic cancer.
You haven't been out of bed in a month.
When something must be done, the universe has a way of granting power.
Oh, we're in agreement that you had help;
it was just more of the human variety.
(muffled cough) Well, since you're so at peace with the universe, you wouldn't mind us taking a look around your little corner of it?
No.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
If you see anything you like...
I have no need for it anymore.
(Richardson coughs)
Nick.
(whispering):
There was trace of lily pollen on Darlene Crocker.
Soil's been disturbed.
(muffled coughing)
Avenging angel's buried treasure?
Mm-hmm.
Angel's got to have somebody out there doing the killing for him.
That same killer tracked pollen into the motel scene, and the pollen led us to this lockbox.
Sara?
It's the evidence tag from the PCP that killed Chelsea and Darlene.
Hidden compartment.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Evidence from another cold case?
Maybe Richardson's got more names on his list.
Revenge.
Cool and serve.
I hope you got something.
Nick and Sara couldn't find any prints on Richardson's strongbox or its contents, so whoever's doing this is being careful.
Did you find any potential victims?
(sighs) Talked with a dozen officers who worked with Richardson.
They got any ideas who else was in his bucket list, they're not saying.
And skimming the cases he worked, nothing stands out.
There's plenty of unsolveds, but no obvious ones that got away.
RUSSELL:
Sheriff Liston.
Stan Richardson was my first partner.
Taught me everything when I was a rookie.
Taught a lot of cops.
I don't know who he's working with now, but I got a bad feeling that's his next target.
Rex Camford?
15 years back,
Camford's wife filed for divorce.
Vanished the next night.
Same night Camford takes his boat out for a midnight cruise on Lake Mead.
All we had was a handful of circumstantial and a DA who shied from no-body cases.
No charges.
No doubt in my mind Camford killed his wife.
What about Richardson, did he feel the same way?
Well, after I talked his ear off about it for six whiskies straight at the Blue Rail, he was madder than I was.
Which is why I've been trying to get ahold of Camford.
His housekeeper said he didn't make it home from work.
Okay, why don't you...
WILLOWS:
Sheriff.
Ah, Catherine, Sheriff's got a hunch about another possible target.
What do you have?
Richardson's phone records from the hospice.
The only recent calls were made from a disposable cell.
Check out the times of the calls.
RUSSELL:
They line up with the times of the murders.
Yeah.
Someone has been keeping Richardson updated on his progress.
I was able to ping the disposable cell.
Signal hit tower 114 from a southerly direction, about five minutes ago.
So...
Richardson's wingman is at Lake Mead.
Good work.
And what are the chances Rex Camford's along for the ride?
(sirens wailing)
Detective Vega!
Show me your hands!
Son of a bitch!
BRASS:
Sam!
We all know what Camford did, and we're gonna make sure he pays for it.
- Let us handle it.
- System had its chance, Jim!
It didn't do jack!
You know, if it was just you and me, you'd be down here helping me out.
BRASS:
I'm trying to help you.
Lose the piece, and we're all good.
Drop the gun, Sam.
Hey, guys, he's not moving.
Sam...
STOKES:
Come on, Sammy, we've been through too much together, man.
Let us help you out.
Sure.
You can help me out.
BRASS:
No!
Vega!
Vega!
I got him!
STOKES:
Get him up to the bank!
Pull him up here!
Come on, Vega, stay with me.
Stay with me, brother.
Get him on his side.
Come on, now.
Here we go...
STOKES:
Vega!
Yeah, we got a pulse.
Go get an ambu-bag.
Go on.
OFFICER:
He's gonna make it.
No...
He's gone.
Control, this is Brass.
We have an officer down, 419.
Hey, hurry up!
All right, here we go, buddy.
Russell.
Why don't you back off of him?
Let-let them handle it.
They got it.
One additional.
Middle-aged man.
Requires medical.
Okay, Bud, Denali's all packed up.
It's been a long night.
You want to hit the road?
Yeah, we probably should.
But let me ask you something.
There are miles of secluded shoreline on this lake, so why did Vega bring Rex here?
Why this spot in particular?
Maybe with a gun to his head, Rex was compelled to lead Vega to the very spot where he dumped his wife.
Now, that's interesting.
What do you say we wake somebody up.
STOKES:
That looks like a skull.
- Oh, yeah.
Thank you, fellas.
Look at that.
Sharp orbital margins.
Female.
Shot in the back of the head-- look at that.
Probably dead before she hit the water.
You want to know what I remember most about that Camford case I worked back then?
This gorgeous Colt revolver sitting on that arrogant bastard's desk.
We still have it;
it's in evidence.
Richardson's not the only one that holds on to stuff.
(sighs)
RICHARDSON:
To my colleagues, who have shared the burden of the badge.
Many of you won't agree with my methods, but all of you will understand what it's like to have all the pieces set before you the picture painted broad and clear and watch the killer walk away to live the life they tore from others.
Well, I could not let that continue.
I made a list.
Five names.
Those most deserving of vengeance.
And now, as I embark into life's last mystery,
I do so in peace.
Detective Stanley Richardson,
Las Vegas Police Department.
I heard about the letter.
Guy certainly knew how to get his message across.
Well, cops can be refreshingly frank sometimes, right?
(sighs):
Listen...
I know you and I aren't gonna buy a summer house together anytime soon, but I have a lot of respect for you.
Let's not forget, we did put away a wife-killer.
Okay.
Good talk.
Hold on a minute.
Richardson's letter mentioned five names.
Yeah, Vega was the fifth.
There was a knife inside of Richardson's lockbox.
Sara found a little blood inside of it, and it was a match to a murdered informant that Vega had been working a few years past.
(sighs) Sam Vega could always be a little, um... overzealous, especially if he thought someone was holding out on him.
You want my theory?
Richardson knew that Vega was dirty.
Kept the murder weapon.
Because he wanted Vega to pay for his sins just like the rest of them.
You know, it turns out both funerals are on the same day.
Vega and Richardson.
Well...
I thought I'd get up early, get on a motorcycle, and get very far out of town.
I think that's a very good idea.

Oh, my God.
Our battered birthday boy is Kevin Fetzer.
It was a private affair-- all the guests are his friends.
Well, with a possible exception or two.
Foots this bill, a guy's got to have some bucks.
Yeah, he was an entrepreneur.
Started a franchise called Joystick Jungle, something like that.
The king of drunken Donkey Kong.
Joystick Jungle.
It's a video arcade for adults-- pinball, Pac-Man, pizza, lots and lots of booze.
Letting intoxicated adults act like little kids.
It's a surefire investment.
Well... the new American Dream-- perpetual adolescence, right?
Maybe that explains the underwear.
They're on backwards.
Got dressed in a hurry, or drunk?
RUSSELL:
Or... killer put them on him.
Wanted to turn him into a... little boy.
Specifically... an eight-year-old.
Look at this.

When did you last see Kevin?
Ten minutes before the big reveal.
Said he had to go behind the curtain, light the candles.
- Anybody go back there with him?
- No.
Kev liked to handle things himself.
Little bit of a control freak.
Didn't like surprises.
ROBBINS:
Russell.
Hey, Doc.
When I heard "tycoon,"
I was picturing top hat and monocle, or at least pants.
Obvious blunt-force trauma.
Oh, he lost his two front teeth.
Not so cute at his age.
Yeah, I couldn't find any teeth around here, but judging by the medium-velocity sprinkles on the cake, this is where the beating took place.
ROBBINS:
Something's stuck between the cuspid and incisor.
Could be dinner.
Huh.
SANDERS:
Surveillance is pretty thin throughout the club.
No eyes in this area.
The bouncer did say that there was one ugly incident earlier.
Kevin got into it with an uninvited guest, had him tossed out.
Anyone have a name for this uninvited guest?
Kevin called him "Dad."
Oh.
WILLOWS:
Son gives dad the heave-ho.
Maybe dad comes back to remind him who's the grown-up.
Sure, Doc, take the awesome club scene, classic arcade games, beautiful women.
Why would I be interested in that?
Are you whining?
That's not very Super Dave of you.
SIDLE:
Maybe we should remember
-that some people have it worse.
- Yeah.
Like this poor John Doe.
If there ever was a candidate for stop, drop and roll.
Jimmy, let's go.
We have work to do.
He inhaled fumes at the scene.
Mmm.
Okay, so what's this guy's deal?
Officer drove up on a fire blazing, open end of an alley, found him.
STOKES:
Burning tire around the body probably slipped down from his throat.
Necklacing--
South African thugs and cartels south of the border both do this.
It's sad the things that the world can agree on.
Not good seeing this in Vegas.
Same principle as being burned at the stake.
(grunting and groaning)
SIDLE:
Takes a while for the CO and the smoke inhalation to kill you.
Until then, hell on Earth.
Gang neighborhood,
Snakebacks versus La Tijeras.
Ah, let me guess-- no witnesses.
Didn't hear the screaming, didn't even smell the bonfire.
These tires are two different treads.
They're probably from a junkyard.
They're not going to give us anything.
SIDLE:
Hope of any trace or prints from the outside of the tires is up in smoke.
Well... let's try to get an I.D. on this guy.
L Say... we strip the Michelin from the man.
Well, one C.O.D.-- cause of de-pantsing-- is still a mystery.
No evidence of sexual activity.
Mmm.
So the pants around his ankles was more message than make-out.
And the other C.0.D.?
Asphyxiation via fatal vanity.
His two front porcelain veneers were broken and inhaled.
(screams)
ROBBINS:
Lacerated the bronchi, caused a bronchial spasm.
Teeth weren't the only body mods.
Pec implants, hair plugs.
Geek makes money, remakes himself.
You take your new pride and joy for a spin, inevitably, somebody dings it up.
Weapon was a round implement, roughly spherical.
Didn't find anything like that at the scene.
Booze flowing, games blasting, plenty of opportunity for the killer to sneak out with a weapon.
You throw a good enough party, people think they can get away with anything.
MAN:
Who do you think you are, Kevin?
(over voice mail):
Think tossing me from your party makes you a man?
You're a weak and scared little boy!
Not exactly a Hallmark greeting.
But then, you're not exactly a father, are you, Rick?
Abandoned him when he was ten, didn't pay a dime in child support.
Son of a deadbeat, beat dead.
You think I had something to do with that?
Well, I think that's a lot of rage to show a half an hour before he was killed.
And I think a trucker with a repo'd rig has got nothing to haul but a greedy grudge against his millionaire son.
You crash the party, you hit him up, he shoots you down, so you really hit him up.
And then you leave him a reminder-- don't get too big for your breeches.
There was something wrong with him even when he was little.
Sick and twisted little something.
The way he'd look at people.
As he got older, made you not want to be around him.
So I'm not surprised someone would see fit to... beat the hell out of him.
Just wasn't me.
Well, you got an alibi or just your sunshiny attitude?
Soon as he made clear I wasn't getting paid,
I left that party.
Check the cameras at that casino next to the club.
I had better luck yanking those levers.
Spun a jackpot, won enough to get my truck back.
(chuckles)
Happy birthday to me.
Unless your birthday vic was part beaver... the weapon was wooden.
WILLOWS:
Trace from his teeth is varnished oak.
Baseball bat?
Hmm, well... the wounds are spherical, not cylindrical.
Rough extrapolation of the curvature, we're looking at something with a diameter of... four to five inches?
Wooden ball.
Arcade tycoon, right?
- Yeah.
- Ah.
Arcade Bowl ball.
Excuse me?
From the classic game of luck and skill beloved by children of all ages-- my guess, that's what bashed your vic's face into a bloody pulp.
WILLOWS:
Arcade Bowl is not one of the games at the club, so the killer would have had to bring the ball in.
Making the weapon of choice significant, no?
Disgruntled arcade employee.
That's a good place to start.
RUSSELL:
Hey.
How did Swab-A-Palooza go?
Ugh, 200 party guests, all swabbed, printed and checked for spatter, all clean.
Well, maybe you'll have more luck at your next case.
I want you to restock your kit and go meet Morgan at the Park Motel.
It's a scene, not a date, you wacky kid, you.
Hey.
I heard you're looking for unhappy arcade clerks who might have played Whack-A-Boss.
I didn't find any.
And Fetzer's franchises don't carry Arcade Bowl.
But the weapon is so unusual that I searched online for any connection between Kevin Fetzer and the game.
Check this out.
In 1991, an eight-year-old boy named Mikey Moran was celebrating his birthday at an arcade.
He goes missing.
His body is found behind the place.
His pants are off;
he's been beaten to death.
The weapon, a bloody arcade ball, is lying next to him.
Unbelievable.
RUSSELL: "Arcade worker Kevin Fetzer, age 15,
"said it was a day that nobody in the arcade would ever forget."
And guess what acne-faced future millionaire was questioned as a person of interest.
Kevin Fetzer.
Yeah.
I pulled the case file.
There was never an arrest made for the boy's murder.
Somebody turned Kevin's birthday into his judgment day.
(woman screaming)
BRODY:
Motel guest heard a disturbance, phoned it in.
Officers responded and found her-- name's Darlene Crocker.
Motel manager said she's been staying here a few weeks.
- Alone?
-Not really.
She's been known to have various male guests for an hour at a time.
But witnesses said nobody left during or after the attack.
Snuck out a window?
Huh-- no getting through those bars.
Bathroom windows would be tight, even for a lightweight, and this damage is Ali-Foreman.
Some sort of crystals.
Cocaine?
Maybe meth?
Got a little powder near her mouth.
I don't think it's drug trace.
So... she's using with some lucky man of the hour.
Somehow, session goes sideways.
And what, he just kills her and leaves without anybody noticing?
These punctures have irregular jagged edges.
That's inconsistent with a single, sharp blade.
Messy stabbing... messy SCENE... clean getaway.
Like the killer just vanished.
- Bloody Mary.
- Well, yeah.
There's an empty bottle of vodka on the bed.
No, not the drink;
the ghost.
See, you stand in front of a mirror, lights out, you say her name three times... and then she bursts through the glass and kills you.
Are we at a crime scene or a seventh-grade sleepover?
(sighs)
Just a theory.
Someone beat Kevin Fetzer's face in with an arcade ball.
There's some justice in that.
I've got the case file from the original arcade ball murder--
Mikey Moran-- just to jog your memory.
Yeah, that was one of the first murders I ever worked.
A scene like that... your memory gets plenty of miles on its own.
We found the body behind the arcade.
The weapon was right there.
And for my money, so was the killer.
That Fetzer kid struck me strange the instant I saw him.
He's hanging around the scene, and then he leaves for an hour and comes back carrying two little shoes.
(groans) Mikey's?
He said that he found them ditched a half block away.
He just happened to be looking over there.
But there was no physical evidence found that connected Kevin Fetzer to the crime.
Well, we did find a pubic hair on the little boy-- blond, like Fetzer-- but DNA testing was new and we didn't get a result.
And it wasn't retested with improved technology?
The, uh, sample was consumed on the first test and... that was my call.
I was new on the job, I went all in, and I crapped out.
That was the first time that I learned that the job isn't fair.
You know, you could have the killer standing right in front of you, know that he did it and... you know, it feels like the cuffs are on your own wrists.
We've all been there, Lou.
So, do you have any suspects on Kevin Fetzer's murder?
No.
Brass talked to Fetzer's dad, who had an alibi.
We got him on casino surveillance.
He should be talking to Mikey Moran's family.
After what Fetzer did to that little boy, if that were my kid...
I wouldn't have waited 20 years.
SIDLE:
Considering where and how we found him, we figured our John Doe was a Snakeback or a La Tijera.
There was nothing to help get more specific, except his arms pinned to his sides left small portions of unburnt flesh and an old battle wound.
SIDLE:
I've been searching for similar scars in the gang database.
Our burning man is a La Tijera named Ramon Castillo, street name Espectro.
Yeah, it means "Ghost."
VEGA:
Big baller with La Tijeras some years back.
Made my early days in the gang task force a real joy.
Earned you some overtime, did he, Sam?
Yeah, he and a Snakeback rival, Diego Barra, they were a regular Itchy and Scratchy.
Shots traded back and forth, killing each other's friends.
- Barra's still on the street?
- No.
Been locked up for almost a decade now.
He could have ordered the hit from inside, no?
Let's put him on a bus and bring his ass down here and talk to him.
How's your Spanish these days?
No bueno.
But you can help me out there, bud.
Tú?
Nunca.
Vamos.
Your motel vic's organs are pale as a result of exsanguination due to severing of the carotid jugular complex.
STOKES:
Her throat was slashed.
Someone did a number on her.
Hello.
Maybe Darlene Crocker looked her killer in the eye and didn't like what she saw.
Weapon was a shard of broken mirror.
Hers were the only prints on it.
No one was seen leaving the motel room, so we're thinking she killed herself.
(yelling)
Brutality like this is unusual.
Suicide is resignation.
These wounds are rage.
(Sniffs)
Did you and Morgan find any drugs at the scene?
Uh, just some kind of crystal trace.
Smell this.
(sniffs) Ugh,
Room service in hell doesn't smell that bad.
What is it?
A distinct ether-like odor.
Pretty rare these days.
PCP.
Oh, bad trip.
That would explain the self-mutilation.
(trembling laughter)
Hallucinatory state.
She thinks she's fighting off untold dark forces.
(eerie laughter)
ROBBINS:
Not self-destruction.
In her mind, self-defense.
Well, Henry's running tox right now.
If it is PCP, we'll get confirmation.
Detective Vega.
I know you.
You put me in the joint and never come to visit.
I was waiting for a special occasion, like the day they'd flip the switch.
(laughs)
You must be confusing me with some other innocent vato.
I'm only doing 25 to life.
Not if you had anything to do with killing Espectro.
Serious?
Damn right, I'm serious.
Someone ghosted him for real?
I'm shocked you didn't know.
You best believe I wanted to kill him.
But the punk vanished underground before I had a chance to stick him there.
So, whoever took him out, how'd they do it?
Must have been a lucky shot, because there was no getting close to Espectro.
That wasn't luck.
(whispering):
Marta.
Marta?
Who-who's Marta?
No man did that.
For a sinner like Espectro, there's forces in the universe more powerful than man.
STOKES:
Marta Arterro,
Diego Barra's girlfriend from back in '02.
Now, the hood grapevine says that Espectro was the one who set her ablaze.
And now somebody kills Espectro in the same fiery manner.
Nine years later?
That's some serious felony procrastination.
Well, it's 11 years quicker than it took
Kevin Fetzer to catch his retribution.
RUSSELL:
Okay.
Two crimes.
Both blasts from the past.
Do we think there's a connection?
HODGES:
Crime scene photo doesn't do the trace justice.
BRODY:
You're right.
It's lovely.
What the heck is it?
The trace you got from your motel vic's face is pollen.
From the flame lily.
The particles, not unlike one David Hodges, exhibit a highly-sculptured outer shell.
Helps them cling to passing bodies in desperate hopes of propagation.
There were no flowers in the motel room.
And we didn't see anything outside.
Possible pollen transfer from the killer.
Morgan, I got those results.
Thanks for the flowers.
But I got a date with Henry.
Doc Robbins' nose knows drugs.
Motel vic's tox panel showed a lethal level of PCP in her system.
Angel dust?
Thought that stuff went out in the early '90s.
Well, you're right.
And the sample she ingested appears to be from a vintage batch of the drug.
See, there's a trace of a component,
PCC, in her blood-- it was a compound used to manufacture PCP until the early '90s when PCC became heavily controlled.
Nobody uses that recipe anymore.
Why would somebody hold on to an old dose of PCP?
With age, it acquires delicious notes of a woodsy vanilla.
No, it stays the same toxic, stinking nightmare fuel it started as.
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Hmm.
Holed up in that hotel room, dosed with a blast from the past.
Did you just say "blast from the past"?
Our motel room vic, Darlene Crocker, ingested a lethal load of vintage formula PCP.
Okay, Henry, check out the LIMS database to see if Darlene Crocker has any prior criminal record or any connection to old crimes.
Doesn't have to be recent.
Today, the past is present.
Whoa.
Happened again... again.
Morgan and Greg's case.
A Darlene Crocker.
1989, her 12-and-a-half-year-old daughter,
Chelsea, died a pretty gruesome death on PCP, just like her mother did today.
(groans) A little girl with that kind of drug?
Junkie older brother, Ken Crocker, confessed to having fed it to her, and then got sent away.
22 years later, Mom self-destructs on the same drug?
Yeah.
See, I'm not so sure that she just happened to choose today to take that dose.
Somebody forced her to take it-- murder.
Just like the burning tires and the arcade ball.
Death by déjà vu.
RUSSELL:
Tonight, you will be visited by the spirits of three old cases.
Uh, sorry.
I...
I haven't had much sleep lately.
The question is, why these three cases, and why now?
And who's this mysterious Jacob Marley summoning their spirits?
There's no obvious connections, and there's years between the murders.
It's three different areas of Vegas- tire-fire Marta in a Northside hood,
PCP Chelsea in a trailer park and Birthday Mikey in the burbs.
Two child vics, one adult.
SIDLE:
One big difference.
Espectro and Fetzer both escaped justice, at least the first time around, but the Crocker case was solved.
Brother was convicted.
So, why is Darlene paying for that now?
Maybe someone thinks the wrong person paid for it back then.
Yeah.
All right, there's got to be more to that story.
BRASS:
Chelsea Crocker-- she had little plastic flower barrettes in her hair.
The strands of it, she ripped out at the scalp as the PCP ripped through her.
Scratched her arms to threads.
She was 12 years old, 70 pounds.
Gram of PCP shoved down her throat.
Dumped like trash.
What a...
what about the brother?
- Ken Crocker.
- Yeah.
19, user.
We found him a day later in an alleyway on the nod, right?
He confessed.
Said his little sister was getting on his nerves, so he fed her the dust, just wanted to see what would happen.
Wow.
All right.
And where-where was Mom Darlene during all of this?
She was at home asleep, taking a nap.
Gave off a weird vibe, though.
It was something we should've taken a closer look at.
Why?
What-what do you mean?
Well, about two years into his sentence, brother Ken hires a P.I.
He said he was so messed up on the night of his sister's death that he forgot he had an alibi.
So, the P.I. checks it out, proves it, gets Ken off.
But the kid blew his luck two days later on a motorcycle.
So, the mom was the only one at home the night that Chelsea died.
The cup used to dose her had the fingerprints of both Darlene and Ken on it.
So, with Ken out of the picture,
Darlene was the last suspect standing.
But the DA refused to indict, based upon
Ken's wrongful conviction, because he said it
"muddied the waters."
Well, I guess the waters are a lot cleaner now that justice is served.
Well, you know, whether or not she was guilty back then,
Darlene Crocker was murdered.
- And I-I need to...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
The little girl was murdered.
Darlene got what was coming to her.
Hey.
Are we done here?
Because I got a lot of work to do.
Chromatogram of the by-products and impurities in the PCP sample from Darlene Crocker's motel room this morning, and the same analysis of the PCP that killed Chelsea Crocker in '89.
Mother and daughter didn't just die on PCP.
They died on PCP from the exact same batch.
Well, no dealer or user would hold on to the same drug batch for 22 years.
But I know someplace that does.
All right, a PCP sample from Chelsea's death was checked out of the police evidence vault last November.
By Who?
Detective Stan Richardson?
Sample was never returned.
VARTANN:
Richardson?
He retired a year back.
Did you work with him much?
No.
I used to drink with him.
Bunch of us did.
Bar called the Blue Rail.
Richardson would buy rounds and listen to us bitch about the job.
If you had a case that was really bothering you, you'd talk to him about it.
He had a way of putting things in perspective.
Make you feel better.
Did you talk to him about the Mikey Moran case?
About Kevin Fetzer?
It was 20 years ago.
I...
You know, I might have.
Talk to him recently?
Not since I stopped drinking, so... 11 years, seven months and 14 days.
We've been trying to reach him, and his address and number on file are no good.
Like I said, you know, it's been years.
(sighs)
I mean, last I heard, there were still a few guys who'd tip them back with Richardson.
Who?
Hey, what...
what do you drink, Jim?
Are you a scotch man?
I'm more picky about the company than the drink.
Did you forget something or...?
I heard that you used to drink with Stan Richardson.
Yeah, and...?
Well, I was just hoping you could tell me anything you could about him.
He was a good detective.
Wore the job hard.
Hopefully, on a houseboat somewhere.
Did something happen to him?
Do you know where that houseboat might be?
This about the revenge murders?
Do you think he's involved?
We have reason to believe, yeah.
You're wrong.
It's a fantasy.
Every cop keeps a hit list of loose cases and unfinished business running around in his head.
Nobody ever acts on it.
Stan Richardson checked out drug evidence two days before he retired.
It was used this morning in the murder of Darlene Crocker.
Richardson is not a murderer.
Well, maybe he calls it justice.
You know?
They get what they have coming, right?
(phone rings)
Excuse me.
Yeah?
STOKES:
Okay, listen up, boss.
The Pension Office said Richardson's funds are direct deposit to some bank.
He said that automatic payments for rent are to 600 Oak Street.
Catherine and I are headed there right now.
Okay.
Make sure you bring backup.
(phone beeps off)
Mr. Richardson doesn't get many visitors.
Exactly how long has Mr. Richardson been residing here?
Six weeks.
He'll be missed when he departs.
Mr. Richardson, some friends are here to see you.
STOKES:
Detective...
Richardson?
You finally caught up to me.
RICHARDSON:
What more do you want?
You've got my confession.
I made those people pay for their crimes.
I'm ready to settle up.
Well, we've talked to your hospice nurses, Stan.
End-stage pancreatic cancer.
You haven't been out of bed in a month.
Well, when something must be done, the universe has a way of granting power.
STOKES:
Oh, we're in agreement that you had help; it was just more of the human variety.
-(muffled cough)
- WILLOWS:
Well... since you're so at peace with the universe, you wouldn't mind us taking a look around your little corner of it?
No.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
If you see anything you like...
I have no need for it anymore.
(Richardson coughs)
Nick.
There was trace of lily pollen on Darlene Crocker.
Soil's been disturbed.
(muffled coughing)
Avenging angel's buried treasure?
Mm-hmm.
Angel's got to have somebody out there doing the killing for him.
That same killer tracked pollen into the motel scene, and the pollen led us to this lockbox.
Sara.
It's the evidence tag from the PCP that killed Chelsea and Darlene.
Hidden compartment.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Evidence from another cold case?
Maybe Richardson's got more names on his list.
Revenge.
Cool and serve.
I hope you got something.
Nick and Sara couldn't find any prints on Richardson's strongbox or its contents.
Whoever's doing this is being very careful.
- Did you find any potential victims?
-(sighs)
Talked with a dozen officers who worked with Richardson.
They got any ideas who else was in his bucket list, they're not saying.
And skimming the cases he worked, nothing stands out.
There's plenty of unsolveds, but no obvious ones that got away.
RUSSELL:
Sheriff Liston.
Stan Richardson was my first partner.
Taught me everything when I was a rookie.
Taught a lot of cops.
I don't know who he's working with now, but I got a bad feeling that's his next target.
- Rex Camford?
-15 years back,
Camford's wife filed for divorce.
Vanished the next night.
Same night Camford takes his boat out for a midnight cruise on Lake Mead.
All we had was a handful of circumstantial and a DA who shied from no-body cases.
No charges.
No doubt in my mind Camford killed his wife.
What-what about Richardson?
Did he feel the same way?
Well, after I talked his ear off about it for six whiskies straight at the Blue Rail, he was madder than I was.
Which is why I've been trying to get a hold of Camford.
His housekeeper said he didn't make it home from work.
Okay, why-why don't you...
WILLOWS:
Sheriff.
Ah, Catherine, Sheriffs got a hunch about another possible target.
What do you have?
Richardson's phone records from the hospice.
The only recent calls were made from a disposable cell.
Check out the times of the calls.
RUSSELL:
They line up with the times of the murders.
Yeah.
Someone has been keeping Richardson updated on his progress.
I was able to ping the disposable cell.
Signal hit tower 114 from a southerly direction about five minutes ago.
So...
Richardson's wingman is at Lake Mead.
Good work.
And what are the chances
Rex Camford's along for the ride?
(sirens wailing)
Detective Vega!
Show me your hands!
Son of a bitch!
BRASS:
Sam.
We all know what Camford did, and we're going to make sure he pays for it.
- Let us handle it.
- System had its chance, Jim.
It didn't do jack!
You know, if it was just you and me, you'd be down here helping me out.
BRASS:
I'm trying to help you.
Lose the piece, and we're all good.
Drop the gun, Sam.
Hey, guys, he's not moving.
- Sam...
-STOKES:
Come on, Sammy, we've been through too much together, man.
Let us help you out.
Sure.
You can help me out.
BRASS:
No!
'Vega!
'Vega!
I got him!
STOKES:
Get him up to the bank.
Pull him up here.
Come on, Vega, stay with me.
Stay with me, brother.
- Get him on his side.
- Come on, now.
- Here we go.
- STOKES:
Vega!
Yeah, we got a pulse.
Go get an ambu-bag.
Go on.
OFFICER:
He's going to make it.
- He's gone.
- No.
Control, this is Brass.
We have an officer down-- 419.
Hey, hurry UP-
All right, here we go, buddy.
Russell.
Why don't you back off of him?
Let-let them handle it.
They got it.
One additional.
Middle-aged man.
Requires medical.
Okay, bud, Denali's all packed up.
It's been a long night.
You want to hit the road?
Yeah, we probably should.
But let me ask you something.
There are miles of secluded shoreline on this lake, so why did Vega bring Rex here?
Why this spot in particular?
Maybe, with a gun to his head, Rex was compelled to lead Vega to the very spot where he dumped his wife.
Now, that's interesting.
What do you say we wake somebody up?
- That looks like a skull.
- Oh, yeah.
Thank you, fellas.
Look at that.
Sharp orbital margins.
Female.
Shot in the back of the head-- look at that.
Probably dead before she hit the water.
You want to know what I remember most about that Camford case I worked back then?
This gorgeous Colt revolver sitting on that arrogant bastard's desk.
We still have it-- it's in evidence.
Richardson's not the only one that holds on to stuff.
(sighs)
RICHARDSON:
To my colleagues, who have shared the burden of the badge.
Many of you won't agree with my methods, but all of you will understand what it's like to have all the pieces set before you the picture painted broad and clear and watch the killer walk away to live the life they tore from others.
Well, I could not let that continue.
I made a list.
Five names.
Those most deserving of vengeance.
And now, as I embark into life's last mystery,
I do so in peace.
Detective Stanley Richardson,
Las Vegas Police Department.
I heard about the letter.
Guy certainly knew how to get his message across.
Well, cops can be refreshingly frank sometimes, right?
(sighs) Listen.
I know you and I aren't going to buy a summer house together anytime soon, but I have a lot of respect for you.
Let's not forget, we did put away a wife killer.
Okay.
Good talk.
Hold on a minute.
Richardson's letter mentioned five names.
Yeah.
Vega was the fifth.
There was a... a knife inside of Richardson's lockbox.
Sara found a little blood inside of it, and it was a match to a murdered informant that Vega had been working a few years past.
(sighs)
Sam Vega could always be a little, um... overzealous, especially if he thought someone was holding out on him.
You want my theory?
Richardson knew that Vega was dirty.
Kept the murder weapon because he wanted Vega to pay for his sins just like the rest of them.
You know, it turns out both funerals are on the same day.
Vega and Richardson.
Well...
I thought I'd get up early, get on a motorcycle and get very far out of town.
I think that's a very good idea.
Hey.
I'm here.
I have the money.
Shh.
Act cool, all right?
Professor Dugan's password is "password"?
Yeah, for a creative writing teacher, he's not very creative.
Just log in and change your grade to an "A."
You're the man, Cameron.
So I've been told.
Eagle One returning to the nest.
Have a seat there, champ.
Gah!
Who the hell are you?
I'm the guy telling you to sit your ass down.
That's who I am.
Uh, you know, if you're looking to score some weed, Rasta Ron just lives down the hall.
Name's Oz.
I own a company called Contra Security.
This is Melanie, our team's lovely lock-picker.
You should upgrade to a dead bolt.
And lock your porno drawer.
We test security systems...
homes, business.
We do it all.
People hire us to break into their companies before the criminals do.
Your museum definitely needs better security.
But I get why she's a masterpiece.
The woman's got four boobs and no mouth.
Good news, senator.
I managed to secure your e-mail.
Bad news...
Your wife knows you're into dudes.
Well, what does that have to do with me?
Well, the university hired us to see if we could find any holes in their computer network.
Guess what we found hiding in one of those holes... you.
Oh, God.
It's quite genius, actually.
You hacked your way into admissions, got yourself a full scholarship, faculty parking, and somehow managed to get two rooms all to yourself.
Yeah, I registered as twins.
Equally impressive...
You selling midterms to earn beer money.
Thank you, but... you've got no proof.
Well, you're out of toilet paper and now the last four pages of "Chamber of Secrets."
Believe you two have met.
This is Josh Armstrong, my intel man.
Intel?
No, that's Duncan.
He's in my French class.
Bonjour.
I'm a transfer student.
Name's Duncan.
Duncan Manutts.
Manutts.
Damn it!
I got a proposition for ya.
It seems that I am, uh, suddenly in need of a new intern.
You mean, like, filing and xeroxing?
And hacking into the world's most impenetrable security systems.
All right, well, lots to chew on, but I have to say no.
Do I look like your prom date?
"No" is not an option.
Here's how it's gonna go...
You're either gonna come work for me, or I'm gonna turn you over to the college, and you're gonna go to jail.
You a cuddler, Cam?
You look cuddly.
I mean, not in jail-y kinda way.
Cookie puss.
Cookie...
Puss.
Ice cream cake.
Intern's always in charge of the office birthday, and there's one on Friday.
Yeah, I know.
- You've been telling me for the last two weeks, Carol.
- Mm.
I'll get to it.
Look, I'm gonna, you know...
Okay.
Yo, new.
Bam!
Han Solo costume for Dragon Con. I know you're a fan of the Wars.
You got any interest in being my Chewbacca?
I don't...
I don't think so.
What, newbie?
A black man can only play Lando Calrissian?
Is that it?
Obama!
No, it's just...
You're setting me up for another one of your office pranks.
My desk?
Who the hell...
Boom goes the dynamite!
I'm serious, my wookiee.
Think about it while I get my shunky on.
We have a team meeting.
We don't have time for candy.
You're gonna have to wait.
My mouth is about to have sex with this candy bar.
Ooh, girl!
Ooh, what?
Give me some of that fine sugar.
Mmm!
Ooh, yeah.
That really doesn't look consensual.
She's over 18, so, you know...
Hmm?
Mayfair Motors...
They specialize in Ferraris, Lamborghinis, your basic 4-wheel, Italian panty-droppers.
The dealership wants to make sure that their security's impenetrable, so they've hired us to see if we can get in there, steal one of their cars off the showroom floor.
It's go time, people.
Team leader needs to bring the heat!
That's good because I am flaming.
As much as I appreciate the, uh, razzmatazz,
I'm going with eeny, meeny, miny, you.
Me?
Uh, I don't know the first thing about stealing a car.
You spend all day in your cubicle playing "Grand Theft Auto." You should be fine.
It's a video game.
It doesn't mean I know how to kill prostitutes.
I gotta take this.
I'm closing that security contract for the airport in Vizplazikstan.
Is that a country?
Not yet, but if all goes according to plan, it will be in ten months.
Hey!
Bahut bahut shukriya.
Phir milaiyin ge.
Was he speaking "Avatar"?
I know it's not Klingon, 'cause I speak that fluently.
Hey, found your scissors, college boy.
You know, so you can stab 'em in my back.
Yeah, I'll aim for your girlie butterfly tattoo.
It's a dragonfly, and the chicks dig it.
Oh, my God.
We have the same butterfly tattoo.
I am top dog in this office.
The Mayfield Motors job was mine.
Great.
And you can have it.
I have to study for midterms.
I was gonna go tell Oz to put you in charge.
Oh.
So that's how you're gonna play it.
No, you're clearly the best, and I'm in no way debating that.
You know what this is?
It's a gun rack.
Watch yourself.
Hey, Cam the man, come on in.
Hey, listen, uh...
Got some fantastic news.
My personalized B.B.Q. branding iron just arrived.
Lord, I love Skymall.
It's like a mall, but in the sky.
Got a bunch of stuff on the plane ride to Dubai last night.
Dubai?
Weren't you here last night?
I was, until I went to Dubai.
Goober?
Uh, yeah.
Thanks.
Whoa!
Looks just like Kirk's chair from "Star Trek"!
It is.
Shatner gave it to us when we helped secure his home from a fanboy stalker.
That's how we met cash.
Captain Kirk, it's me again.
Did you get my friend request?
You gon' beam me up?
Beam me up.
Not today, ensign psycho.
Beam a brother up!
Get up!
Only team leader gets to sit in the chair, and you're here to bail on the carjacking.
It's only because I...
You'd rather stay in college where you're king pimp?
Kinda.
And I just...
Afraid that working for me means popping your safe little college bubble and entering the real world?
How are you...
Doing that?
I'm in your head.
Look, stealing a car was never part of the deal.
The deal's what I say it is.
Unless you'd like to pay back your college tuition right now.
No.
I...
Yikes!
Seven years.
That's pretty pricey.
$350,000?
That's...
I'll just...
I'll disappear.
I'll go off the grid.
This grid?
That goober you ate was a tracking device.
Looks to me like you're no longer the smartest kid in class, Cam.
I'd like a silver Lamborghini, please.
Oh, and, uh, get that cookie puss and one of those giant novelty cards.
They're funny 'cause they're big.
So you just met with Oz.
Yes.
And you ate a goober.
Yes.
So you're still our team leader.
Yes, and I don't understand why he's putting me in charge.
Well, you'll never know.
Oz always has a plan.
Well, my plan was to stay in college until I die of happiness.
Well,
I think you should give this place a chance.
I think you'll find we're pretty good people here.
And... boom!
Goes the dynamite.
Sorry, but gotta haze the new guy.
That's how every office works.
No.
No, that's how this office works.
In the real world, it's a felony.
You want a ride home?
Yeah, that'd be great.
Can you do that?
I got you.
You may want to move it, though.
They tow on Tuesdays.
You're late, Kirk Cameron.
Yeah, 'cause cash keeps pranking me and ruining my life.
I'll allow it.
Oh, come on, newbie, Tuesdays?
You can't hate on a guy for pulling a little office prank.
A little office prank is xeroxing your butt.
You have 161 I.Q. You don't know how to do little.
You my boy, okay, the Chewie to my Solo.
Let me explain how this works.
Prank a brother back.
Earn my respect, and the hazing stops.
It's not rush week.
I have to break into a car dealership and bust out of this job.
And buy a cake.
And buy a cake.
Come to papa.
No.
No, no, no, no.
Team meeting in ten.
So you want to dance.
Let's dance.
So let me get this straight...
You gathered us all here in your douche-icle so you could tell us you have no idea what the hell you're doing.
Look, I'm team leader, all right?
So listen up.
Cash, uh, can you plot our route to the car?
Cool?
Yeah, I'll work on it.
First, I gotta get me that shunky.
Bernice in accounting?
Chocolate bar.
But for the record...
Tempted ?
Okay.
Uh, Josh, I'll leave the intel up to you.
Think you can smooth-talk the receptionist?
I don't have time to rob Mayfield Motors.
I've got three dates tonight.
How is that even possible?
Don't call me.
I'll be multi-assing.
Peace.
This meeting's adjourned, right?
Now let's go crack a safe.
You're really good at this stuff.
Well, people always expected me to do beauty pageants and bake cookies and all that crap, but I kinda went the other way.
So... talk to me, Goose.
What's your deal, huh?
Gotta be more to you than pimp parties and beer bongs.
No, I'm just your average 27-year-old college student with 12 majors, living the dream.
Really?
So how long you think that dream's gonna last?
Probably another ten years, and then I'll hack my way into grad school.
Sounds like a great plan.
Trust me, college is heaven compared to how I grew up.
Coccyx.
The spelling is c-o-c...
No one's gonna pants you here.
No, just, uh, cement my desk to the ceiling.
Let's not forget the crazy man with the pitching wedge blackmailing me to steal a car.
Well, you do realize that's all happening because we like you, right?
Hey, listen, you want to maybe grab...
Dutch!
Get over here and give Papa Smurf some sugar.
Oh!
Cam, this is my boyfriend Dutch.
What's up?
Hey, you look smart.
Can I have some urine?
Ex-excuse me?
Yeah, Dutch sells clean urine on eBay so people can pass their drug tests.
Huh?
Sounds... illegal.
Ah, it's a moral gray area, but it's totally paid for gold thunder over there.
Yeah.
No, it's really cool, dude.
Come with the racing stripe?
Why don't you ask your underpants that question?
Face!
I'm calling you about that nerd pee, all right, my man?
Hey.
Got you a little somethin' somethin'.
What is this?
I've taken a matchbook from every restaurant we've ever been to.
Look, I know you moved around a lot as a kid, so I want you to feel like you always have a home, in my arms.
It's highly flammable.
I love the crap out of this woman!
My God.
I mean, usually my boyfriends are such tools, but Dutch...
He's... not.
I mean, he's really made this the best birthday ever.
It's... it's your birthday?
Yeah.
I'm on cake duty.
Okay, anything but a cookie puss.
I'm lactose-intolerant.
Yeah, me, too.
Me, too.
Hey, buttercup.
Nowhere on that computer screen do I see the words "lamb" or "ghini."
Looks like you're hacking Mel's life.
What gives?
The least I could do is get her the perfect cake, right?
Take a piece of advice from the boss man.
Melanie's our safecracker because that chick is wild.
How wild we talkin'?
You bought a bike?
Nope.
Cool.
Trust me.
That's one roller coaster you do not want to ride.
Now holster your pistol there, quick draw.
I need you to focus on what's important.
All right, here's the plan.
I'll walk you through it in 30 short minutes.
You have 60 seconds.
Go.
Uh, oh...
Webster's defines "security"
as "the quality or state of being"...
55 seconds.
Skip the preamble.
Right.
Okay.
The plan starts with our intel man Josh.
Josh will pose as a prospective buyer.
I have 20 car, but this could be good 21st.
Would you be so kind as to print travel itinerary?
I have jet to take to Prague.
It's no big deal.
Oh, absolutely, Baron.
The U.S.B. will install a back door onto their network so I can then shut down their exterior alarms.
You got 45 seconds.
Go.
Move.
Move.
Once we're in, we'll have to deactivate a series of lasers.
Let's light up the "falcon." Go.
Go.
Go.
Move.
Cam, watch those lasers.
We hit a beam, and we're done.
Okay, Cam, bank left.
Dock the bird, Cam.
Steady.
Steady.
Yes!
Car keys are kept in a multi-lock safe.
That's all Melanie.
All right, subside.
What you got for me, huh?
Silver Lamborghini, as requested.
In and out in five minutes flat.
I believe that's our first.
Yeah!
Yes, it is.
You were supposed to...
Steal a car from Mayfair Motors.
This car...
Is from Mayfield motors!
We... stole the wrong car?
You stole the wrong car, sweetheart.
Missed you at work today.
I've still got a stolen car in my garage, and someone needs to fix that.
Do it yourself.
Oopsy Daisy.
Looks like someone broke your toy!
That was so uncool.
You know what else isn't cool?
Sitting in your home, where it's all safe and cozy.
Life is about either trying to dodge a bullet or hit a bull's-eye, and trust me, kid, this job is the bull's-eye.
But why me?
I used to be a thief...
Counterfeiting, breaking and entering.
I spent my 21st birthday in jail for that one.
That's why they call you "Oz," after that prison show with male frontal nudity and adult situations?
Or my last name is Osbourne.
That also makes sense.
Point is, I can't be caught anywhere near a hot car.
I've got an ex-wife and kids looking for any excuse to cut me out of their lives.
I can't help you with that car.
Josh was right.
I really suck at this job.
Don't let that man get into your head.
He can manipulate anyone.
I don't have time to rob Mayfield Motors.
The Mayfield Motors job was mine.
Hey, do you need any help with the Mayfield Motors job?
That floppy-haired son of a bitch!
Hey, Josh, I was wondering if maybe, uh...
Oh, dude!
That's Armani!
I know it was you, Josh.
You got in my head and made me steal the wrong car.
In my defense, you fell for it.
Oz, help.
I'll allow it.
Boop.
All right, here's the deal.
You have to help me put back the hot car and steal the right one.
Help you?
I despise you.
You know, before you showed up,
I was Oz's golden boy.
Listen, I didn't want any of this.
Exactly.
You don't even want to be here.
Look, if you help me fix this, there's a chance Oz would let me go.
Then we both win.
Fix it how?
The dealership's gonna be crawling with cops.
It's impossible.
It'll be a piece of cake.
Not now, please, God.
Okay.
This idiot's Eddie Gold.
His dad owns Mayfield Motors.
I hacked into his Flickr account, found out he's a frat boy at State.
You're not my weed dealer.
'Sup, frat daddy.
Name's Weezer.
I'm a Beta Pi over at Kansas U.
I was on a little frat-cation when I had a total frat-astrophe.
Stop saying "frat."
Any-rape, I was wondering if maybe I could crash here for the night.
Depends.
If you really are a Beta, what's the secret handshake?
Our handshake.
My favorite...
Uh, wait.
Hold on.
Just stall him.
Part about being in a frat.
All right, got it.
It's, uh, fist bump, fist bump, pinkie lock, patty cake, ass smack, cabbage patch to double high-five.
Bro!
Ho ho ho ho!
Bro!
Bro!
Get your beta butt in here.
Let's play some beer pong.
Actually, I was thinking more tequila pong?
Nasty!
You know, I never thought I'd say this, but we really make a good team.
You know, that's so funny, 'cause I was about to say, suck it.
We'll never be a team.
Hey, you stole this car, man.
I stole this car?
You stole this car.
I stole this car!
Edward!
Dad?
Hey.
You wanna get tacos?
Okay, so we returned the stolen car.
Whoop-dee-do.
You still can't get the car you were supposed to grab.
Face it, college boy, you're boned.
You know, they should really have a gate here.
Josh, go!
Go get the keys!
"It's your birthday... ...
Go bananas."
That's a big card.
You pulled it off.
Never doubted you for a second.
You had a lot riding on this.
The last thing I wanted was for you to go back to jail.
I never went to jail.
You said when you were 21, you...
When I was 21, I went to Yale.
Guess you heard that wrong.
You totally manipulated me.
I'll allow it.
Hey.
Hey.
Happy Birthday.
And you got the underpants on that one.
Who the hell put a pin up in the...
Boom goes the dynamite.
Newbie.
TonightonAfterthe
Runway...
It'ssayin'thatyou 'rereal and you're not, you're a fraud.
I'mdefinitelythatreal, but--
Sayitto me .
Itoldyoutoyour face .
Putthatenergyout there, that's what you're gonna get back.
Myheart'sracingalittle bit.

I really did just learn.
After the Runway 1x02 Let's Hear It for the Girls Original Air Date on October 6, 2011
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Welcome,everyone,to After the Runway.
I'm your host, Zanna Roberts
Rassi.
This is where we will dish with the designers about tonight's episode, and get to the bottom of some unresolved issues.
Hi, everyone, how are we all?
Are we good?
That was quite the episode.
High drama.
Itwasveryhigh--
Ireallyfeltfor you all throughout that whole thing, and obviously it was really special because it was the finale, the last runway, and then you found out who is moving forward.
Mm-hmm.
Congratulations...
Thankyou.
Josh,Anya,Viktor,Kimberly.
Thankyou.
I'msorry!
I'msorry,I'mlike,"oh, can they not all go through?"
No,that'sokay.
Oh!
How do you feel about the whole thing?
Um,youknow,Imean ,like I said in the episode, it was a great experience...
Mm-hmm.
AndI onlythinkthatallof us will be strengthened by it, regardless of what--
Inwhatway?
Strengthenedasadesigner.
I mean, it tests your aesthetic.
Like you've got to know, and you've got to be certain.
Mm-hmm.
Doyouthinkyou shouldhave been eliminated?
Should you have been the one to go?
Imean,hell--okay,um, being honest, because I'm an honest person, I do feel that Kim should have gone over me.
I don't think that what she presented was as strong, as far as aesthetic, or technically.
Kimberly,howdo youfeel about that?
Um,I thinkshe'sentitledto her opinion.
It's just the opinions that came behind the scenes and not directly to me.
You know, just like her sittin' here sayin' that she's so real and honest, but yet there were a lot of things said behind the scenes that weren't--
Suchaswhat?
Itwasthisepisodewhere,
"Oh, Kim's stuff is this, that, and a third," whereas, she never said any of that stuff directly to me...
Right.
Andit'slike,ifyou'rethat real, say it to me.
I'mdefinitelythatreal,but
I know when to have tact, and there was no reason for me to interject my opinion on your clothes.
If you would have asked, I would have told you straight out.
Yourclaimin thiswhole thing was that, "Oh, I'm real, I keep--I'm honest," and stuff like that, and you were saying back at the apartment that, you know, I don't say anything about
you guys behind--you know, to the camera, behind closed doors, but yet you were, the entire season.
Imean,in thelastepisode, absolutely.
No,notjustthisepisode.
IthinkthatKim 'sstuffis really confusing.
Two of her garments look like they have goiters growing out of her legs, so I don't get that.
You don't wear, you know, plastic fabric.
How are you gonna wash that stuff, with a washcloth?
I think it's Kimberly, and I think Cecelia are in the bottom, for sure.
Well,don'tyouthink
Kimberly has a chance of being in the top, perhaps?
No,no,Ican 'tsee Ninain that at all, honestly, I'm like,
"whoa."
ItwastheNinaepisode,it was the sheep--
Itoldyoutoyour face ,and you know that, I did.
Yousaidto me ,yousaid--
No,I toldyoutoyour face .
Whatyousaidtomeduring the Nina challenge was, "Oh, I
"just said that I didn't think
Nina would wear a gold top."
You didn't say all of the stuff that was said and was shown on tv and behind-the-scenes stuff.
ItoldyouthatIcouldn't believe that Nina picked yours.
I said it to you, I did.
I'mnot--butthat'snot the only time, it's not only the
Nina challenge, it was the real woman challenge.
You were like, "Oh, she doesn't know how to design for real women, the list goes on and on.
I mean, it was like, so if you--
You'rereallyquite sensitive.
Well,yeah,becauseit'snot about your opinion about my stuff, because I don't--
Youclearlycarequiteabit .
Icarethatyou 'resayin' that you're real, and you're not, you're a fraud.
Ithinkit 'sunfairtopick on Laura for things that--
I'mnot.
Weallhavehad momentswhere we might have said something that we didn't mean to say, or we might have said that we had some kind of loyalty, and maybe it wasn't 100%, it's just human
nature.
I'veneversaidanything about the two of you to the camera.
The reason why you don't see it on the TV, is because it's not there.
Yeah,butis thatreally genuine, though?
I'mjustsayin'thatif-- whatever you felt, you should have just said it to me, 'cause
I wouldn't--
IfI wasever--
She'sgoit ,allright.
IfI waseveraskedtosay it.
Quit!
IfI waseverasked,Isaid it.
Allright,guys.
And you definitely had intense situations.
Yeah,andit waslikea professional intense situation.
It was just great.
Well,that'sit .
I mean, speaking of professionals, you obviously had, you know, Nina talking to you a lot, and we heard...
Yeah.
Youknow,Timtellyouthat
Nina had questioned your taste level.
Yeah.
I'mnotsayingthiseitherto be mean or to hurt your feelings.
Mm-hmm.
Ninahasthisthingabout you, and she has her radar up when she sees your work.
Iknow.
Ijustwantyou toknow that she gets bristly about your taste level.
IfNinasaysno, there'sno way I can push past that.
Now,howdo youfeelabout that?
IthinkthatNinadidhaveit out for me.
I could tell from the initial casting, before Tim even said anything I go, "Nina doesn't like me."
No,I thoughtshewas paranoid.
I really didn't understand where it was coming from, but she just, she just knew, it was instinct.
Icouldseeit, Icouldjust see it.
It was--and it's fine, because
I was like, "Okay, she can be, if anything, more tough on me--"
Mm-hmm.
Andthat'llonlymakeme better.
IworkwithNinaonadaily basis, and, uh, she has impeccable taste...
Sure.
Andifshesays,"it'sa problem," it means you have a problem, be scared, be nervous.
You know, and she does know what she's talking about, beyond--
Sure.
AndI thinkyouwererightto say, "this is what it's about, and I have to please them."
Absolutely,yeah,yeah,yeah.
Youallhadhelpanywayon this challenge from your fabulous assistants.
Well, let's bring two of those very able assistants back out.
Oh.
BeckyandOlivier,comeon out.
Hi!
Comeon.
Hello!
Youguys,I'mgonnago straight into you two.
How was it working back with
Viktor, then?
How is is, being on a team with him?
Bringit,sister,bringit.
Imean,like,helping
Viktor--Viktor was very, um, he gave me a lot of freedom to do what--not really, but like, yeah.
Like, it's easy to work with him, and work for him in that case.
Becky,youwerethe firstone to be picked by Kimberly here.
Yes.
Youwereobviously super-happy about that.
Well,I 'dworkedwith
Kimberly before, and we'd worked really well together, and there was good communication, so that's exactly what I was hoping for.
Ifithadcometoit ,would you have worked with Joshua?
Well,I wouldn'thavehad a choice.
That's also very true, however, we did hear some strong words between the two of you over the course of a few episodes.
Ugh.
Indeed.
Let'stakealittlelook .
Idon'twanttopoint fingers, but I will say that
Josh did start us off very badly.
Whodoyouthinkisthe weakest link?
Onthisteam,itwasBecky .
You know, I just don't see much design within the outfit.
Ithinkhe wantsBertandI to go home, so he can have his fun with the rest of you.
Becky,thisis notabout having fun, this is about creating a product that people are going to want.
I know what I want to deliver to someone, and I feel that you don't.
Ido.
Sothatis probablywhy I should be here, and you should not be here.
Willyouletmedesignthe top for the skirt?
Becky,youdo dowdydresses, you know that.
Yourdemographicis like40 to death.
Excuseme?
You told me to make a princess seam dress, so you can't blame me for the dress being dumpy or not cool.
Iamnothavingdramawith you, Becky, so you can cry and do whatever you need to do to get over it.
Becky, if you're tired, take a nap, 'cause I don't have time for it, I'll do it myself.
Aw.
Oh,I don'twanttoseeyou cry!
AndI 'msureit 'snotfun to relive or watch that again.
That's okay.
Tellme--
Actuallymyheart'sracinga little bit.
Isit?
Butyoulookrested.
Why,becauseyoufeelbad?
Did you take a nap?
'Cause you look good.
Thankyou.
Imean,youknow,ifwe just keep living in this bubble of this drama, it just isn't gonna help our careers or just our energy, you know, and I think it's all about energy for all of
us up here, it's like--
ButI dowanttosay, Joshua, that when you put bad energy and negative energy out there, that's what you're gonna get back.
Iagreewithyou .
I'mnotusedtopeoplebeing that hostile to me, or that aggressive towards me, and I was already not feeling like I had a place within the group...
Right.
Andthatprettymuchkilled it, and I don't think I ever recovered, and that's why I went home when I did.
Thathurtsme to hearthat.
AndI thinkI'malotmore sensitive than I realize.
Okay,weneedtotake a little break, but we will finish this up when we get back.
Welcomeback,everyone.
I'm Zanna Roberts Rassi, and
I'm here talking about this season of Project Runway with some of the fabulous designers.
Joshua,whatwereyou thinking then?
Ididnothandleitin the best--in the best way, and I just would love to put this in a little box, hide it in the ground, and let it just dissolve into the earth, into something
new, you know?
Puta little,pinkbow onit, maybe.
I'mgoodwiththat.
AndI--Ijusthopeyouknow, chances are I'm completely more insecure than you are, I just can hide it better at certain points.
Wow.
Wow, okay.
Youknow,I'masoftie.
Ibelievethat.
Well,I 'msorrythatyou felt it necessary to be like that, you know?
Itwasforthatcha- -
It'ssad.
Iwantedus to win,and we ultimately won, that's not only my dress, it's her dress, and your dress, so--
Yeah.
Consideryourselfpartofa victory and part of a win.
Okay,it'stimefor that little segment I like to call,
"Clearing the Air."
I want to know more about this
"girl pact."
We didn't actually see this girl pact form, tell--
Mm-hmm,itwasbehindthe scenes.
Itwasin ourroom.
Tellme,howdid ithappen?
Ithinkit waswhenitwas, you know, when Tim walked in at one point and was like, "it's 70 to 30," percentage-wise, and we were like, "oh, my gosh--"
Battle.
Andsowe said,we'vegotto even the score, and that if we felt that anything of the girls was not up to par, that we needed to say something.
Let'stakeaquicklook .
Oh,no.
What'sKimdoing?
ThefabricthatKim has chosen is not current, there's nothing that's really popping about it.
Shouldwetalktoher?
Idon'tthinkyou should, number one.
Wemadeapact.
Idon'tcareifyou're friends.
Wemadeapact.
Therearethreeofthegirls left, and we have made a pact that we will be honest when we see something of our work going off-track.
If we tell her it's bad, then she's not gonna believe in it.
Okay,well,yeah,Imean ,I think the pact probably wasn't a good idea, because there also comes a point where like we do need to start worrying about ourselves.
Andwecan'tall staytill the end.
Yeah.
What'sup,girls?
What'sup?
Hi.
Theunsuspectingfool.
Ah,whywhenyou guysboth thought that Kimberly's designs were less than beautiful, didn't you tell her?
Well,whatif we wouldhave said something to her?
She was safe, so our feelings were off, clearly.
Do you know what I mean?
Mmm.
It'sopinion,Imean--
It'sopinion.
Imean,at thatpoint,it's taste.
Shewasfine,and ,Imean , you saw me.
Whataboutthepact,girls?
What about girl power?
Yousawme snapbackat
Viktor, I said, "we had a pact!"
You know?
Kimberly,whatdo youthink about that fact they didn't tell you.
Ifeltlike--
I clearly was the only one that didn't know that we weren't upholding the pact, and that was the only thing, I mean, why--you just, like--
Oh,I 'mjustsayingthatI should be blamed for this, I was the one that was mostly like,
"we need to tell her."
No,I 'mnotblaminganybody, that's the thing.
Like,areyougonnatalk about--
WhatI 'msaying--
Maybewhatwe shouldhave done, in retrospect, is said,
"listen, now we're in
"competition, let's just all be doing what we're doing."
Right.
That'sprobablywhatwe should have done.
WhatI 'mupsetaboutisthat
I was the only one that did not know that we weren't upholding-- you know, forget the pact, it was just, you know, I just--
Justhavebeenhonestand said, "this is over now, let's just compete."
Imean,Ijustwant tosay that I felt sick watching some of the episodes, like physically, 'cause I don't like that I said some of the things that I said, and I just--I mean,
it's hard to go back and do anything about it...
Right.
ButI reallydo apologizeand
I feel very compassionate to everybody for the things that were said to me, too, you know, it just is what it is, it's done.
Ijustthinkyou shouldn't--I mean, you should do whatever you want, but you shouldn't apologize for doing what you felt at that moment, because we're human beings, and we all explore...
Right,right.
Soyouknow,welearnfrom that, if it wasn't because of that, you would not be here right now.
Well,isthereanythingelse that's niggling anyone, and they want to get it out on the table?
Josh?
Just,I amlearningalot about myself as a person through this whole experience, and watching it, and, you know, I'm
25 and I'm growing with age, as a designer, as a human being, and I just want people to know that, you know, I'm learning, and that's what life's about, is
to learn who you are, and learn from other people, so this has been the most amazing learning experience, as well, you know, and for situations like this, that I have to now watch it or
document it, I'm like, "you can't be doing that."
You know, Becky, I hit on the fact that she's sensitive, I want people to know that I am extremely sensitive...
Weknow.
Anda lotof thiscomesout as a wall that I throw up, in order to defend who I am.
Mm-hmm.
BecauseI havebeencomeat my whole life.
I've been bullied, so it even hurts me to hear people calling me a bully now.
Mm-hmm.
Becauseultimately,Iwould never want to do what someone has done to me for years, and that--it's so hurtful to hear that.
I have apologized to Becky on the show, and if that didn't seem sincere to viewers watching it, you know, I hope Becky knows within her heart, and I apologize to you, and I hope
that we can move forward from this.
Becky,doyouacceptthis apology?
Ido.
Oh,I 'mgonnacry!
Oh, it seems that's really genuine, as well.
Yeah.
Okay,therewillbemuch more of this coming up.
Sorry.
Staywithus .
Welcomebackto Afterthe
Runway.
I'm your host, Zanna Roberts
Rossi.
Now designers, we're gonna bring out a special guest.
He's been following you all season, and knows a thing or two about what you've been going through.
Let's welcome Season Two designer, Nick Verreos.
Hello, baby!
I'm so glad you're here.
How are you?
Thankyouso muchfor coming!
Oh,thankyou,ofcourse.
Oh,howexciting.
Iwouldn'tmissthisforthe world.
Are you kidding me?
It'sso--
Darlin'.
Whatdidyouthinkofthis season?
Ireallythoughtitwasan exciting season, I have to say.
I love the show.
I'm part of the brand.
Thefamily.
Ofcourse,I'mpartofthe family, papa Nick.
SoI loveseeingall the different creative designs, from everybody.
And of course, the drama.
So I love, you know, seeing other people go through it.
I don't know if I would go back.
It'strue.
Yes.
So I have some questions, actually.
Please,goforit, goforit!
Go, ask questions, please.
I'mgonnaplaythe voiceof the viewers, you know, and things that we've been dying to know, and I'm gonna go to...
Olivier.
A lot of my readers...
Mm-hmm.
Uh,whoreadmyblog ,andas well as myself, have been wondering about your accent.
Okay.
It'ssotrue.
I'm like, where--I'm British, and I've never heard anything quite like it.
Youhaven't,okay.
Yeah.
Iknowyouwereborn inOhio, right?
Yeah,I wasborninOhio .
Tellme,tellme.
AndthenImovedaway when I was two, two years old.
I was raised in Taiwan, I lived on the West Coast for a little while, and I went to London when
I was 16, and I went to Milan for university, and I moved back to London after that.
Okay.
AndthenImovedfrom London to here, to New York, this
February, and a lot of people have been asking me, like they're being--accusing me of copying a British accent, but like, I think Zanna knows, it's not a British accent.
It'sjustamix breed.
It's a real, like, hybrid of different accents.
It's definitely not like the northern accent that I've got, like North England.
It'smore--it'sawell-to-do accent, we'd say.
Allright,so nowwe've established where the accent comes from, right, I have a second question.
Yes.
Itseemsthatpossiblyyou had a problem with the sistas.
Do you know what I'm talkin' about?
Theydo.
I mean, he doesn't know.
Thegirls.
WiththedoubleDs.
Okay,oh,withthe boobs?
Wecallthemthe sistas, right?
Thank you.
Do you still have that issue, and why?
And why did you have that--
Idon'thavethatproblem with any... of our body parts.
Withthesethings.
Herbreastsarelike ginormous.
Is that correct?
Big,yeah,big.
Youknow,Idon 'tlikewomen having boobs, I just want them to be flat, like when I come up with the design.
I think that distracts the whole line.
Tim,amIallowedtoaskyou what double D means, like breast size?
WhatdoIknowaboutit?
I just know it's a bra size.
I don't have any personal experience with it, Olivier.
Thoseboobsto me are trouble.
Those were problems when it comes to design, but not a problem in general, like...
Why would I have a problem with any body parts?
You can have boobs as big as you want, I don't really care.
YouknowwhatdoubleDis?
Iwasn'tlikehavingnoclue about--that's a bra, like a bra cup size, I was wondering why it didn't go from A-B-C-D to E, but double D, 'cause you don't see double C, double B,
double A, you know?
Oh,God!
Ithinkwe 'regood,right?
Ithinkwe 'regood,wegot the boobs down.
Iloveit .
That'smyquestion.
Thankyou,Olivier,thank you, darling.
We'regonnahavealittle lesson after this, right?
Yes.
Oh,myGod.
Allright,Iwanttodiscuss now, let's see, Laura.
Thanks,thanks.
Allright,Iwanttotalkto you about money.
Okay.
Nowinthislastchallenge you had $300.
Ooh,I wasangry.
Miss Laura, she had $300, and she done been spending like
$700, right?
Oh,ImeldaMarcosoverhere .
Whoo!
IthinkwhatIdo , withthe limited amount of time, I never wanted to be stuck up at the counter, being like, "I wish I would've cut that."
Right,right.
Mmm.
AndsoI'mlike,"justcutit all, I want it all, I'll take it," and then for like the one challenge where Bert was very generous to give me money for the group rocker challenge, um,
I actually bought enough fabric to make two different looks, and
I didn't even use a whole batch of it, but it was because I was like, "well, what if," you know?
Right,right.
Imean,Ididn'twant torun into an issue.
I will be no stranger to saying that I love to spend money.
Youheardit here,she loves to spend money.
Ido.
Mom's like, "oh, gosh--"
Iknow.
"There's my girl!"
Yeah,right?
IthinknowI'm gonna,like , do the little "spin the bottle with Nick," and it's gonna go to...
Anya.
Oh,howdidIknow ?
Allright,so withyou ,I think the main, important thing that a lot of the viewers want to know is, the sewing.
You just learned how to sew.
Mm-hmm.
Andthenyoucreatedsome amazing things, and everybody's like, "where did that come from?"
And I remember that a lot of the viewers, a lot of people, you know, I talked to said, "well, was she lying?"
Right.
Right?
Yes.
Becauseallof asuddenit's like...
"And I have a gown."
Yes.
Ican'tmakeajacket,I'll just put it out there.
I don't feel bad.
We don't wear jackets in the
Caribbean, so I don't feel bad about that.
I'll learn, but, um, you know, when the people question me about the sewing, I feel it's kind of an underhanded compliment, because I really did just learn, and it's sort of
like, well, I did the best that
I could, and it really shocks me as much as it shocked anybody else.
I was always last.
Mm-hmm.
Iwasalwayssewingpeople in, I mean, those are the part of the "make it work" moments.
Right.
The people with more experience,
I understand the frustration of not--
Right.
Of being further ahead, and then
I still won some of the challenges.
Right.
You know?
So--but I guess all I can say to my defense is that I worked as hard as anybody else...
Mm-hmm.
WiththetoolsthatIhad .
Andyoustillmadeitwork, and I have to say, it just showed that you were and are a talented designer.
Thankyou.
AndI alwayssaythat,you know, it isn't--it isn't Project
Seamstress, it does help to have that experience, but in the end, that's why the tagline comes in, "Make it Work."
Exactly.
Youknow,andyou have extremely innate sense of style.
Finally, I just want to say that
I want to give you a hug for being part of the five crew.
Thefivecrew?
'CauseI wasnumberfiveon
Season Two.
Oh,wellthen,we'renumber--
Oh.
Sowelcometo numberfive!
Itwillbe anew show,
"Five."
It'sgood,becauseyou 're like, I mean, I made it far, but--
Yes,yes!
Oh.
Allright,guys,thankyou so much.
Well, that's all we have time for tonight.
I want to thank Nick so much for coming in.
Oh,ofcourse.
Andallyouguys,fabulously styled out designers, you look amazing, and thank you so much again, for joining us.
And we will be back next week.
Cheerio.

I'mdefinitelythatreal, but--
Sayitto me .

Myheart'sracingalittle bit.

[Laughter]
Idon'tfeelbad .
I really did just learn.
After the Runway 1x02 Let's Hear It for the Girls Original Air Date on October 6, 2011
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Welcome,everyone,to After the Runway.
I'm your host, Zanna Roberts
Rassi.
This is where we will dish with the designers about tonight's episode, and get to the bottom of some unresolved issues.
Hi, everyone, how are we all?
[General assent]
Are we good?
That was quite the episode.
High drama.
Itwasveryhigh--
Ireallyfeltfor you all throughout that whole thing, and obviously it was really special because it was the finale, the last runway, and then you found out who is moving forward.
Mm-hmm.
Congratulations...
Thankyou.
Josh,Anya,Viktor,Kimberly.
Thankyou.
I'msorry!
[Laughs]
I'msorry,I'mlike,"oh, can they not all go through?"
[Laughing]No,that'sokay.
Oh!
How do you feel about the whole thing?
Um,youknow,Imean ,like I said in the episode, it was a great experience...
Mm-hmm.
AndI onlythinkthatallof us will be strengthened by it, regardless of what--
Inwhatway?
Strengthenedasadesigner.
I mean, it tests your aesthetic.
Like you've got to know, and you've got to be certain.
Mm-hmm.
Doyouthinkyou shouldhave been eliminated?
Should you have been the one to go?
Imean,hell--okay,um, being honest, because I'm an honest person, I do feel that Kim should have gone over me.
I don't think that what she presented was as strong, as far as aesthetic, or technically.
Kimberly,howdo youfeel about that?
Um,I thinkshe'sentitledto her opinion.
It's just the opinions that came behind the scenes and not directly to me.
You know, just like her sittin' here sayin' that she's so real and honest, but yet there were a lot of things said behind the scenes that weren't--
Suchaswhat?
Itwasthisepisodewhere,
"Oh, Kim's stuff is this, that, and a third," whereas, she never said any of that stuff directly to me...
Right.
Andit'slike,ifyou'rethat real, say it to me.
I'mdefinitelythatreal,but
I know when to have tact, and there was no reason for me to interject my opinion on your clothes.
If you would have asked, I would have told you straight out.
Yourclaimin thiswhole thing was that, "Oh, I'm real, I keep--I'm honest," and stuff like that, and you were saying back at the apartment that, you know, I don't say anything about
you guys behind--you know, to the camera, behind closed doors, but yet you were, the entire season.
Imean,in thelastepisode, absolutely.
No,notjustthisepisode.
IthinkthatKim 'sstuffis really confusing.
Two of her garments look like they have goiters growing out of her legs, so I don't get that.
You don't wear, you know, plastic fabric.
How are you gonna wash that stuff, with a washcloth?
I think it's Kimberly, and I think Cecelia are in the bottom, for sure.
Well,don'tyouthink
Kimberly has a chance of being in the top, perhaps?
No,no,Ican 'tsee Ninain that at all, honestly, I'm like,
"whoa."
ItwastheNinaepisode,it was the sheep--
Itoldyoutoyour face ,and you know that, I did.
Yousaidto me ,yousaid--
No,I toldyoutoyour face .
Whatyousaidtomeduring the Nina challenge was, "Oh, I
"just said that I didn't think
Nina would wear a gold top."
You didn't say all of the stuff that was said and was shown on tv and behind-the-scenes stuff.
ItoldyouthatIcouldn't believe that Nina picked yours.
I said it to you, I did.
I'mnot--butthat'snot the only time, it's not only the
Nina challenge, it was the real woman challenge.
You were like, "Oh, she doesn't know how to design for real women, the list goes on and on.
I mean, it was like, so if you--
You'rereallyquite sensitive.
Well,yeah,becauseit'snot about your opinion about my stuff, because I don't--
Youclearlycarequiteabit .
Icarethatyou 'resayin' that you're real, and you're not, you're a fraud.
Ithinkit 'sunfairtopick on Laura for things that--
I'mnot.
Weallhavehad momentswhere we might have said something that we didn't mean to say, or we might have said that we had some kind of loyalty, and maybe it wasn't 100%, it's just human
nature.
I'veneversaidanything about the two of you to the camera.
The reason why you don't see it on the TV, is because it's not there.
Yeah,butis thatreally genuine, though?
I'mjustsayin'thatif-- whatever you felt, you should have just said it to me, 'cause
I wouldn't--
IfI wasever--
She'sgoit ,allright.
IfI waseveraskedtosay it.
Quit!
[Laughs]
IfI waseverasked,Isaid it.
Allright,guys.
And you definitely had intense situations.
Yeah,andit waslikea professional intense situation.
It was just great.
Well,that'sit .
I mean, speaking of professionals, you obviously had, you know, Nina talking to you a lot, and we heard...
Yeah.
Youknow,Timtellyouthat
Nina had questioned your taste level.
Yeah.
I'mnotsayingthiseitherto be mean or to hurt your feelings.
Mm-hmm.
Ninahasthisthingabout you, and she has her radar up when she sees your work.
Iknow.
Ijustwantyou toknow that she gets bristly about your taste level.
IfNinasaysno, there'sno way I can push past that.
Now,howdo youfeelabout that?
IthinkthatNinadidhaveit out for me.
I could tell from the initial casting, before Tim even said anything I go, "Nina doesn't like me."
No,I thoughtshewas paranoid.
I really didn't understand where it was coming from, but she just, she just knew, it was instinct.
Icouldseeit, Icouldjust see it.
It was--and it's fine, because
I was like, "Okay, she can be, if anything, more tough on me--"
Mm-hmm.
Andthat'llonlymakeme better.
IworkwithNinaonadaily basis, and, uh, she has impeccable taste...
Sure.
Andifshesays,"it'sa problem," it means you have a problem, be scared, be nervous.
[Laughter]
You know, and she does know what she's talking about, beyond--
Sure.
AndI thinkyouwererightto say, "this is what it's about, and I have to please them."
Absolutely,yeah,yeah,yeah.
Youallhadhelpanywayon this challenge from your fabulous assistants.
[General agreement]
Well, let's bring two of those very able assistants back out.
[Laughter]
Oh.
BeckyandOlivier,comeon out.
[Applause]
Hi!
Comeon.
Hello!
Youguys,I'mgonnago straight into you two.
How was it working back with
Viktor, then?
How is is, being on a team with him?
Bringit,sister,bringit.
[Laughter]
Imean,like,helping
Viktor--Viktor was very, um, he gave me a lot of freedom to do what--not really, but like, yeah.
[Laughter]
Like, it's easy to work with him, and work for him in that case.
Becky,youwerethe firstone to be picked by Kimberly here.
Yes.
Youwereobviously super-happy about that.
Well,I 'dworkedwith
Kimberly before, and we'd worked really well together, and there was good communication, so that's exactly what I was hoping for.
[Laughs]
Ifithadcometoit ,would you have worked with Joshua?
Well,I wouldn'thavehad a choice.
[Laughter]
That's also very true, however, we did hear some strong words between the two of you over the course of a few episodes.
Ugh.
Indeed.
Let'stakealittlelook .
Idon'twanttopoint fingers, but I will say that
Josh did start us off very badly.
Whodoyouthinkisthe weakest link?
Onthisteam,itwasBecky .
You know, I just don't see much design within the outfit.
Ithinkhe wantsBertandI to go home, so he can have his fun with the rest of you.
Becky,thisis notabout having fun, this is about creating a product that people are going to want.
I know what I want to deliver to someone, and I feel that you don't.
Ido.
Sothatis probablywhy I should be here, and you should not be here.
Willyouletmedesignthe top for the skirt?
Becky,youdo dowdydresses, you know that.
Yourdemographicis like40 to death.
Excuseme?
You told me to make a princess seam dress, so you can't blame me for the dress being dumpy or not cool.
Iamnothavingdramawith you, Becky, so you can cry and do whatever you need to do to get over it.
Becky, if you're tired, take a nap, 'cause I don't have time for it, I'll do it myself.
[Sniffles]
[Sobs]
Aw.
Oh,I don'twanttoseeyou cry!
[Overlapping chatter]
AndI 'msureit 'snotfun to relive or watch that again.
That's okay. [Laughs]
Tellme--
Actuallymyheart'sracinga little bit.
Isit?
Butyoulookrested.
Why,becauseyoufeelbad?
[Laughter]
Did you take a nap?
'Cause you look good.
Thankyou.
Imean,youknow,ifwe just keep living in this bubble of this drama, it just isn't gonna help our careers or just our energy, you know, and I think it's all about energy for all of
us up here, it's like--
ButI dowanttosay, Joshua, that when you put bad energy and negative energy out there, that's what you're gonna get back.
Iagreewithyou .
I'mnotusedtopeoplebeing that hostile to me, or that aggressive towards me, and I was already not feeling like I had a place within the group...
Right.
Andthatprettymuchkilled it, and I don't think I ever recovered, and that's why I went home when I did.
Thathurtsme to hearthat.
AndI thinkI'malotmore sensitive than I realize.
Okay,weneedtotake a little break, but we will finish this up when we get back.
Welcomeback,everyone.
I'm Zanna Roberts Rassi, and
I'm here talking about this season of Project Runway with some of the fabulous designers.
Joshua,whatwereyou thinking then?
Ididnothandleitin the best--in the best way, and I just would love to put this in a little box, hide it in the ground, and let it just dissolve into the earth, into something
new, you know?
Puta little,pinkbow onit, maybe.
I'mgoodwiththat.
AndI--Ijusthopeyouknow, chances are I'm completely more insecure than you are, I just can hide it better at certain points.
Wow.
Wow, okay.
Youknow,I'masoftie.
Ibelievethat.
Well,I 'msorrythatyou felt it necessary to be like that, you know?
Itwasforthatcha- -
It'ssad.[Laughs]
Iwantedus to win,and we ultimately won, that's not only my dress, it's her dress, and your dress, so--
Yeah.
Consideryourselfpartofa victory and part of a win.
Okay,it'stimefor that little segment I like to call,
"Clearing the Air."
I want to know more about this
"girl pact."
[Laughter]
We didn't actually see this girl pact form, tell--
Mm-hmm,itwasbehindthe scenes.
Itwasin ourroom.
Tellme,howdid ithappen?
Ithinkit waswhenitwas, you know, when Tim walked in at one point and was like, "it's 70 to 30," percentage-wise, and we were like, "oh, my gosh--"
Battle.
Andsowe said,we'vegotto even the score, and that if we felt that anything of the girls was not up to par, that we needed to say something.
Let'stakeaquicklook .
Oh,no.
[Laughs]
What'sKimdoing?
[Gasps]
ThefabricthatKim has chosen is not current, there's nothing that's really popping about it.
Shouldwetalktoher?
Idon'tthinkyou should, number one.
Wemadeapact.
Idon'tcareifyou're friends.
Wemadeapact.
Therearethreeofthegirls left, and we have made a pact that we will be honest when we see something of our work going off-track.
If we tell her it's bad, then she's not gonna believe in it.
Okay,well,yeah,Imean ,I think the pact probably wasn't a good idea, because there also comes a point where like we do need to start worrying about ourselves.
Andwecan'tall staytill the end.
Yeah.
What'sup,girls?
What'sup?
Hi.
Theunsuspectingfool.
[Laughter]
Ah,whywhenyou guysboth thought that Kimberly's designs were less than beautiful, didn't you tell her?
Well,whatif we wouldhave said something to her?
She was safe, so our feelings were off, clearly.
Do you know what I mean?
Mmm.
It'sopinion,Imean--
It'sopinion.
Imean,at thatpoint,it's taste.
Shewasfine,and ,Imean , you saw me.
Whataboutthepact,girls?
What about girl power?
Yousawme snapbackat
Viktor, I said, "we had a pact!"
You know?
Kimberly,whatdo youthink about that fact they didn't tell you.
Ifeltlike--
I clearly was the only one that didn't know that we weren't upholding the pact, and that was the only thing, I mean, why--you just, like--
Oh,I 'mjustsayingthatI should be blamed for this, I was the one that was mostly like,
"we need to tell her."
No,I 'mnotblaminganybody, that's the thing.
Like,areyougonnatalk about--
WhatI 'msaying--
Maybewhatwe shouldhave done, in retrospect, is said,
"listen, now we're in
"competition, let's just all be doing what we're doing."
Right.
That'sprobablywhatwe should have done.
WhatI 'mupsetaboutisthat
I was the only one that did not know that we weren't upholding-- you know, forget the pact, it was just, you know, I just--
Justhavebeenhonestand said, "this is over now, let's just compete."
Imean,Ijustwant tosay that I felt sick watching some of the episodes, like physically, 'cause I don't like that I said some of the things that I said, and I just--I mean,
it's hard to go back and do anything about it...
Right.
ButI reallydo apologizeand
I feel very compassionate to everybody for the things that were said to me, too, you know, it just is what it is, it's done.
Ijustthinkyou shouldn't--I mean, you should do whatever you want, but you shouldn't apologize for doing what you felt at that moment, because we're human beings, and we all explore...
Right,right.
Soyouknow,welearnfrom that, if it wasn't because of that, you would not be here right now.
Well,isthereanythingelse that's niggling anyone, and they want to get it out on the table?
Josh?
Just,I amlearningalot about myself as a person through this whole experience, and watching it, and, you know, I'm
25 and I'm growing with age, as a designer, as a human being, and I just want people to know that, you know, I'm learning, and that's what life's about, is
to learn who you are, and learn from other people, so this has been the most amazing learning experience, as well, you know, and for situations like this, that I have to now watch it or
document it, I'm like, "you can't be doing that."
You know, Becky, I hit on the fact that she's sensitive, I want people to know that I am extremely sensitive...
Weknow.
Anda lotof thiscomesout as a wall that I throw up, in order to defend who I am.
Mm-hmm.
BecauseI havebeencomeat my whole life.
I've been bullied, so it even hurts me to hear people calling me a bully now.
Mm-hmm.
Becauseultimately,Iwould never want to do what someone has done to me for years, and that--it's so hurtful to hear that.
I have apologized to Becky on the show, and if that didn't seem sincere to viewers watching it, you know, I hope Becky knows within her heart, and I apologize to you, and I hope
that we can move forward from this.
Becky,doyouacceptthis apology?
Ido.
[Laughing]Oh,I'mgonnacry!
[Laughter]
Oh, it seems that's really genuine, as well.
Yeah.
[Muffledresponse]
Okay,therewillbemuch more of this coming up.
Sorry.
[Laughter]
[Laughing]Staywithus.

Ofcourse,I'mpartofthe family, papa Nick.
[Laughs]
SoI loveseeingall the different creative designs, from everybody.
And of course, the drama.
So I love, you know, seeing other people go through it.
I don't know if I would go back.
It'strue.
Yes.
So I have some questions, actually.
Please,goforit, goforit!
Go, ask questions, please.
I'mgonnaplaythe voiceof the viewers, you know, and things that we've been dying to know, and I'm gonna go to...
Olivier.
A lot of my readers...
Mm-hmm.
Uh,whoreadmyblog ,andas well as myself, have been wondering about your accent.
Okay.
[Laughing]It'sso true.
I'm like, where--I'm British, and I've never heard anything quite like it.
Youhaven't,okay.
Yeah.
Iknowyouwereborn inOhio, right?
Yeah,I wasborninOhio .
Tellme,tellme.
AndthenImovedaway when I was two, two years old.
I was raised in Taiwan, I lived on the West Coast for a little while, and I went to London when
I was 16, and I went to Milan for university, and I moved back to London after that.
Okay.
AndthenImovedfrom London to here, to New York, this
February, and a lot of people have been asking me, like they're being--accusing me of copying a British accent, but like, I think Zanna knows, it's not a British accent.
It'sjustamix breed.
It's a real, like, hybrid of different accents.
It's definitely not like the northern accent that I've got, like North England.
[Coughs]
It'smore--it'sawell-to-do accent, we'd say.
Allright,so nowwe've established where the accent comes from, right, I have a second question.
Yes.
Itseemsthatpossiblyyou had a problem with the sistas.
Do you know what I'm talkin' about?
[Laughter]
Theydo.
I mean, he doesn't know.
Thegirls.
WiththedoubleDs.
Okay,oh,withthe boobs?
Wecallthemthe sistas, right?
[Laughter]
Thank you.
Do you still have that issue, and why?
And why did you have that--
Idon'thavethatproblem with any... of our body parts.
[Laughter]
Withthesethings.
Herbreastsarelike ginormous.
Is that correct?
Big,yeah,big.
Youknow,Idon 'tlikewomen having boobs, I just want them to be flat, like when I come up with the design.
I think that distracts the whole line.
Tim,amIallowedtoaskyou what double D means, like breast size?
WhatdoIknowaboutit?
I just know it's a bra size.
[Laughter]
I don't have any personal experience with it, Olivier.
Thoseboobsto me are trouble.
Those were problems when it comes to design, but not a problem in general, like...
[Laughter]
Why would I have a problem with any body parts?
You can have boobs as big as you want, I don't really care.
[Laughter]
YouknowwhatdoubleDis?
Iwasn'tlikehavingnoclue about--that's a bra, like a bra cup size, I was wondering why it didn't go from A-B-C-D to E, but double D, 'cause you don't see double C, double B,
double A, you know?
[Laughter]
Oh,God!
Ithinkwe 'regood,right?
Ithinkwe 'regood,wegot the boobs down.
Iloveit .
That'smyquestion.
[Laughter]
Thankyou,Olivier,thank you, darling.
We'regonnahavealittle lesson after this, right?
Yes.
[Laughter]
Oh,myGod.
Allright,Iwanttodiscuss now, let's see, Laura.
Thanks,thanks.
Allright,Iwanttotalkto you about money.
[Laughing]Okay.
Nowinthislastchallenge you had $300.
[Laughs]
Ooh,I wasangry.
[Laughter]
Miss Laura, she had $300, and she done been spending like
$700, right?
Oh,ImeldaMarcosoverhere .
Whoo!
IthinkwhatIdo , withthe limited amount of time, I never wanted to be stuck up at the counter, being like, "I wish I would've cut that."
Right,right.
Mmm.
AndsoI'mlike,"justcutit all, I want it all, I'll take it," and then for like the one challenge where Bert was very generous to give me money for the group rocker challenge, um,
I actually bought enough fabric to make two different looks, and
I didn't even use a whole batch of it, but it was because I was like, "well, what if," you know?
Right,right.
Imean,Ididn'twant torun into an issue.
I will be no stranger to saying that I love to spend money.
Youheardit here,she loves to spend money.
[Laughing]I do.
Mom's like, "oh, gosh--"
[laughter]
Iknow.
"There's my girl!"
[Laughs]
Yeah,right?
IthinknowI'm gonna,like , do the little "spin the bottle with Nick," and it's gonna go to...
Anya.
Oh,howdidIknow ?
[Laughter]
Allright,so withyou ,I think the main, important thing that a lot of the viewers want to know is, the sewing.
You just learned how to sew.
Mm-hmm.
Andthenyoucreatedsome amazing things, and everybody's like, "where did that come from?"
And I remember that a lot of the viewers, a lot of people, you know, I talked to said, "well, was she lying?"
Right.
Right?
Yes.
Becauseallof asuddenit's like...
"And I have a gown."
[Laughter]
Yes.
Ican'tmakeajacket,I'll just put it out there.
[Laughter]
I don't feel bad.
We don't wear jackets in the
Caribbean, so I don't feel bad about that.
[Laughter]
I'll learn, but, um, you know, when the people question me about the sewing, I feel it's kind of an underhanded compliment, because I really did just learn, and it's sort of
like, well, I did the best that
I could, and it really shocks me as much as it shocked anybody else.
I was always last.
Mm-hmm.
Iwasalwayssewingpeople in, I mean, those are the part of the "make it work" moments.
Right.
The people with more experience,
I understand the frustration of not--
Right.
Of being further ahead, and then
I still won some of the challenges.
Right.
You know?
So--but I guess all I can say to my defense is that I worked as hard as anybody else...
Mm-hmm.
WiththetoolsthatIhad .
Andyoustillmadeitwork, and I have to say, it just showed that you were and are a talented designer.
Thankyou.
AndI alwayssaythat,you know, it isn't--it isn't Project
Seamstress, it does help to have that experience, but in the end, that's why the tagline comes in, "Make it Work."
Exactly.
Youknow,andyou have extremely innate sense of style.
Finally, I just want to say that
I want to give you a hug for being part of the five crew.
Thefivecrew?
'CauseI wasnumberfiveon

Oh,wellthen,we'renumber-- [overlapping chatter]
Oh.

[Laughter]
It'sgood,becauseyou 're like, I mean, I made it far, but--
Yes,yes!
All:
Oh.
Allright,guys,thankyou so much.
Well, that's all we have time for tonight.
I want to thank Nick so much for coming in.
Oh,ofcourse.
Andallyouguys,fabulously styled out designers, you look amazing, and thank you so much again, for joining us.
And we will be back next week.

My name is Bridget and I'm an addict.
GROUP:
Hi, Bridget.
I've been sober for six months.
Which is longer than some of the relationships that I've had.
(gentle laughter)
Things have been tense.
It's been really hard to stay clean.
But I am.
I finally got a response from my sister Siobhan.
She wants me to come visit, stay as long as I want.
I'm not sure I'm ready for that.
For family, I mean.
I'm okay, but I'm not that okay.
(gentle laughter)
I just keep reminding myself... mistakes aren't tragedies, but:
ALL:
Please, Higher Power, help me learn from them.
Shouldn't drink that so late.
You're gonna have trouble sleeping.
Mm.
I have trouble with or without the coffee.
(sighs)
Give me that.
Oh... now you want my cookies.
I should probably go.
My guy's waiting.
Are you sure you don't want me there tomorrow?
I'm sure.
Is that your boyfriend or sponsor?
Malcolm?
Sponsor, but...
Sponsor.
Here, Jimmy, I figured you could use it.
Thanks, hon.
Anything for you.
Uh... pick you up 7:30.
We're not having a sleepover?
If you need anything...
I know.
Jimmy's got my back.
You okay?
Not really.
Just get up on the stand, you tell the judge what you saw.
You were a witness to a crime.
You did nothing wrong, okay?
It'll be over before you know it.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Bridget... we'll protect you.
You don't get it.
If Bodaway wants me dead, I'm dead.
No one can protect me.
ANCHORMAN:
In other news, tomorrow begins the trial of Wind River Reservation crime boss Bodaway Macawi.
In 2009, Macawi was accused but eventually acquitted of the murder of a... (changing channel)
ANCHORMAN:
Macawi is being indicted for the dismemberment killing of Shaylene Briggs, a dancer in his Rock Springs strip club.

Excuse me!
Miss!
Forgot your wallet.
Thank you.
Is that all you brought?
Traveling light these days.
(sighs)
I was wondering how you'd look after six years.
Not nearly as good as you.
Come here.
I missed you so much.
This is our weekend place.
Make yourself at home.
Looks just like my house.
Except not at all.
Your life seems perfect.
Close to it.
But no one's life is perfect.
So... it's just the two of us this weekend.
Where's Andrew?
He's in London.
Working.
Then visiting Juliet at boarding school.
So... how long have you guys been married?
Almost five years.
Bridget, listen...
Andrew doesn't exactly know about you.
About my visiting?
He doesn't know I have a sister.

That's none of your business.
I find it hard to believe that Bridget would disappear without contacting you.
Well, she hasn't... and I'm really worried.
Well, you should be.
Because, without her testimony, Bodaway's a free man.

Hello?
WOMAN:
Hey, gorgeous!
Where are you?
!
You were supposed to meet me at the loft half an hour ago.
I was?
Don't tell me you didn't know.
I saw you write it in your little orange book.
Why were you still in bed?
If you skipped your trainer because I said you were too thin, that's just silly.
Siobhan, darling, did you fall back asleep?
No, Gemma.
Um, I'll be there.
Can you just give me 20 minutes?
Make it 30.
Now you owe me a latte.
(grinder rasping, rock music playing)
You look absolutely anorexic.
You must share your secret.
Good news.
Got the marble people coming in at 10:00 instead of 4:00.
The lighting guy can make it after lunch.
What do you think of the exposed brick?
It's great.
Told you it would be.
Just one question.
Why are we moving again?
Ask your crazy husband.
It took me a year and a half to finish Park Avenue, and now he wants to start over.
But it's the penthouse.
(gasps) Come see the terrace.
So?
It's pretty.
You don't seem that excited.
What's wrong?
I thought you lived for this stuff.
I do.
I'm just tired.
Andrew came home late last night.
You're skinny and you're having sex?
No, we didn't.
The last time I saw Henry naked was right before the twins turned three last year.
I think Henry's having an affair.
I can't stand to look at him, let alone sleep next to him.
Oh, I could so use you and a martini.
Say you'll go out with me tonight.
I would love to.
Oh, no, wait.
Don't you have that thing?
What thing?
The fund-raising thing?
Yes!
I totally forgot.
I'll be fine.
I'll just hook up with one of the workmen.
I'm sure contractors make more money than out-of-work novelists.
(woman singing aria)
(singing fades out)
(singing fades in)
(aria ends, applause)
Hey, Jim.
Andrew.
Hey, you know, it's been years since you've worn that dress.
Is it too much?
No, it's absolutely perfect.
Now, a glass of champagne?
Actually, could you make mine water?
I have a little bit of a headache.
Absolutely.
(gasps)
What the hell are you doing?
!
I just wanted to show you how much I missed you.
Gemma said you were gonna be here tonight.
Henry?
Relax.
Andrew can't see us.
This is too much.
No, what's too much is
I haven't seen you in a week.
So you got detained in the Hamptons.
Fine.
But then when you didn't show up at the hotel, I went to your place, and you just stared at me from the balcony like I was some kind of crazy person.
And now this.
I have to go.
No, no.
Not until you tell me what's going on.
We can't do this here.
Andrew's waiting for me.
Like you care.
Let him wait.
Henry, please.
Fine.
Meet me at the hotel on Thursday.
The nanny is taking the boys to the park at noon.
Um, uh, noon...
I could be late.
Traffic from the new apartment.
The apartment is two minutes away from the Dandridge.
You're making me nervous, Siobhan.
You won't even look at me.
Hey, I want to see you.
Okay.
I-I'll meet you there.
Nothing has changed on my end.
My hook is stuck.
Do you mind?
Is everything okay?
Fine.
It just...
I thought...
You thought what?
I don't know, that we were cool?
Cool?
What are we, 12?
Of course we're not cool.
But tonight at the gala, you-you seemed so happy.
That was an act.
This is your game, Siobhan.
I'm just playing by the rules.
What if I don't want to play games anymore?
Well, that would be a first.
I'm serious.
Why can't we just be nice to each other, for real?
Who are you?
What do you mean?
You're just so different.
Just relaxed and agreeable.
And you don't like it?
No.
I love it.
I just don't believe it.
(sniffs)
(sighs)
Mistakes aren't tragedies.
But please, Higher Power...
GROUP:
...help me learn from them.
This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but right now, it's the only choice that I have.
Sobriety is the only choice.
I feel like every time I clean up a mess,
I end up dirty.
(sniffs)
I never meant for any of this to happen.
It just did.
The important thing is for you to take responsibility for your actions.
In all this,
I lost someone who meant everything to me.
I just got her back.
Now she's gone.
(sniffs)
Maybe once things settle down, I can go back to my old life,
(elevator bell dings) be normal again.
But for now...
WOMAN:
Hey.
(man and woman laughing)
Andrew?
(woman laughing)
(man and woman laughing)
(rock music playing)
Juliet?
What the hell, Siobhan!
Don't you knock?
!
What's going on?
Wait, is that my scarf?
Send me the dry cleaning bill.
Did you go through my drawers?
Will you just leave already?
I'll text you.
Thanks a lot, Siobhan.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were coming home.
It's my house.
I can stop by any time I want.
Of course you can.
I just...
I wasn't expecting you.
I shouldn't have to be at boarding school anyway.
The only reason that Daddy sent me was because of you.
Juliet, I'm not trying to start a fight.
Since when?
(phone ringing)
Hello.
Yeah, whatever.
Some guy is coming up to see you.
Who?
Juliet, did they say who?
(sighs) (elevator bell dings)
Wow.
Far cry from Wyoming.
You ever been?
My name's Victor Machado.
I'm with the FBI.
Siobhan Martin.
How can I help you?
I'm here to talk to you about your sister.
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?
So you really have no idea where your sister is?
Not a clue.
Well, then I'm guessing you don't know what kind of trouble she's in.
Well, I assume you didn't come all the way out here because she was jaywalking.
(chuckles)
That's amazing.
The same pretty face, the same sarcastic attitude.
I'm sorry.
I'm just not exactly sure what this has to do with me.
My sister and I are not close.
We haven't spoken in years.
Bridget's a fugitive.
She assaulted a police officer and she stole his weapon.
Bridget wouldn't do that.
You sound pretty confident, and yet you're not close.
We're twins.
Bridget was the only eyewitness to a murder.
She'd been arrested for prostitution and possession.
We agreed to drop those charges if she'd testify.
But that never happened.
We're very concerned for her safety.
If she didn't talk, why are you so concerned?
Because the man she was supposed to testify against is now free and he's going to make sure he doesn't go back to prison.
Silencing your sister is his only insurance.
Mrs. Martin, if you know something, anything, you need to tell me.
She's facing arrest.
Or worse.
The bottom line... she's not going to get far either way.
♪ ♪
(sighs) Siobhan?
You scared me.
What are you doing here?
I thought I would check on the progress.
At 9:00?
I was in the area.
Huh.
Well, I was going to surprise you, but since you're already here, won't this look amazing on that wall over a black lacquered console table?
Don't worry, those holes will be covered by tomorrow.
Perfect.
You know, if it weren't for this pain-in-the-ass renovation, I'd be obsessing over who Henry's having an affair with.
Why else do you think I'm here at 9:00 at night?
At least you have a sense of humor about it.
Hmm.
Do you have any idea who it might be?
Well, I went through the list of usual suspects, but the trainer's gay, the maid's fat, the wife's best friend...
I'm joking.
Come on, you're so not his type.
(nervous chuckle)
(knocking on door)
I'm not here to sleep with you.
Why?
I'm here to sleep with you.
Henry, you're my best friend's husband.
That never bothered you before.
Well, it does now.
I don't get it.
What is it, Siobhan?
Gemma's on to us.
She told me that she thinks you're cheating on her.
With who?
- I suggested the nanny.
- Annafried's a lesbian.
Yeah, well, I really couldn't think of what else to say at the moment.
How about, Henry is a great guy, and he would never cheat on you?
We just need to lay low for a while.
- I've been trying to lay low.
- I'm serious.
If you really love me, you'll stay away.
ANDREW:
This is the third time.
I keep letting you get away with this crap, but I'm done.
Daddy, please, you don't know what happened...
No.
You could have gone to jail.
And did you ever stop to think for one second how your behavior is affecting this family?
What family?
Siobhan hates me.
And you're never around.
I'm going to Mom's.
You know that's not an option.
Great, Daddy.
Just throw it in my face that she doesn't want me, either.
Juliet, that's not what I meant.
Juliet.
What's going on?
Nothing.

Hello.
MAN:
Mrs. Martin, this is Dr. Marx.
Sorry to call so late, but you didn't show up for your appointment this afternoon.
I'm sorry.
I, um, I must've forgotten to write it in my book.
Well, reschedule when you can, because your blood work came back positive.
Oh, is that a bad thing?
No, a great thing.
Congratulations.
You're about four weeks along.
I-I'm pregnant?
(sighs softly)
Siobhan, what did you do?
GEMMA:
Pregnant?
You sneaky bitch!
So that's why you haven't been drinking.
- Isn't that great, Henry?
- Great.
Oh, he's just upset 'cause his editor doesn't like his new pages.
HENRY:
Thank you for sharing that.
What?
Don't let your bad mood get in the way of their good news.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
We're both very happy.
Well, I could use a refill.
Henry.
Uh, no, thanks.
Step this way.
I'm buying.
I'm sorry.
I didn't want it to come out that way.
You know that's my baby.
No, I don't.
Oh, come on, Siobhan.
We've slept together a thousand times, and you've thrown Andrew a bone, what, once, twice in the past few months?
That is my kid.
And I'm not just going to smile and pretend to be happy for Andrew.
What do you want me to do?
Leave him.
I can't.
If you don't leave him, we're over.
Make a choice.
Him or me.
I choose him.
ANDREW:
I know we negotiated that.
But I want out.
Look, the, uh, wife just walked in.
We'll finish this later.
Do you think Henry was acting strange last night?
You know those artist types.
They're temperamental.
What about Juliet?
I mean, she seemed pretty upset.
You both did.
She got kicked out of boarding school.
For what?
You're kidding me.
Tell me about it.
Well, she can't stay here.
Not with the baby coming.
Come on, Shiv.
She's got nowhere else to go.
So you found them breaking into the bus station lockers?
Four kids, easy target.
Didn't think much of it, till we found this.
Looks like your girl's been here.
Her sister Siobhan said they hadn't spoken in years.
Wonder what else she's lying about.

Hello?
MAN:
Siobhan, we have a problem.
It's 40 years since I first wrote about my time in Berlin, and the book I'm now writing is perhaps an attempt to set the record as straight.
Well, as straight it's possible to be.
I destroyed my Berlin diaries, you see, so have had to rely a good deal on memory.
As to why I went in the first place, my friend Wystan Auden was there and encouraged me to join him.
I could also say I went because of what was happening politically.
But, in fact, I went because of the boys.
To me, Berlin meant boys.
Danke schon, mein Liebling.
# One man has hands that are tender
# One man has hands that are strong
# If I should choose to surrender
# My choices are bound to be wrong
# I might find my ideal lover
# If I search both far and wide... #
But, my dear, that simply won't do.
You're the very last person who ought to go there.
Berlin isn't the right place for you at all.
What on Earth do you mean?
It's German, darling.
Wystan Auden thinks it's the most marvellous place.
Auden!
Such an untidy boy!
And, besides, what about medical school?
But, Mummy, I am not cut out for medical school.
That's exactly what you said about Cambridge!
Really, Christopher, you cannot go through life shirking it.
It's time you buckled to.
I'm a published novelist!
Of course you are, darling, but wouldn't it be so much nicer to be a doctor, as well?
It isn't a hobby, you know?
Any normal mother would be proud.
And I am proud, my sweetheart.
You know I found your novel most interesting.
I thought it was ingenious the way you used your antipathy towards me to such creative effect.
But you cannot expect life to be one long holiday.
I'm not going there on holiday, I'm going there to get away from you.
Couldn't you go somewhere a little closer, like the Isle of Wight?
Mother!
# I don't know to whom I belong
# It would be such a shame to end up on my own
# If I make myself true to one
# How another will surely be sad and alone
Of course, you must do as you wish.
I fully intend to.
It's only natural, I suppose, that you should want to flee the nest, just as I am bound to get more lonely.
When I think of what I went through to bring you into this world!
Months and months of feeling really quite seedy.
Oh well, so be it.
You won't forget, will you, darling, that the Germans killed your father?
MACHINE GUNS
Take me with you.
You have to stay and look after Mummy.
But for how long?
I'm afraid I can't answer that.
# If I make myself true to one
# How another will surely be sad and alone
# Should such a beauty belong to one person?
# No, surely, the sun and the stars
# They belong to us all
# I don't know
# To whom I belong
# I believe
# I only belong to myself. #
APPLAUSE Danke.
Vielen Dank.
I was wondering...
Oh, do forgive me, dear boy.
I didn't mean to startle you.
No, no.
Could I trouble you for a light?
Yes, of course.
I seem to have mislaid my lighter, I suspect it...
Thank you, dear boy.
It may have been...
Would you mind if I...?
No, no.
How kind!
It may have been stolen.
Oh dear.
One has to be so careful nowadays, don't you find?
Are you going all the way?
Excuse me?
To Berlin?
Yes.
Holiday?
I'm hoping for a little more than that.
Ah, yes.
Well, Berlin has so much to offer, in certain respects.
Do you live there?
For now.
One never knows what a new dawn may bring.
I hope you don't think I'm prying, dear boy, but do you have accommodation in Berlin?
I do, as it happens, yes.
The reason why I venture such impertinence is that my landlady, dear, sweet woman, is desperate for a reliable lodger.
Her landlords are ruthless and if they knew she didn't have the full quota, well, turf her out in an instant.
I have a feeling, and though perhaps I shouldn't say so myself,
I do have a nose for these things.
You might fit the bill perfectly.
My goodness, yes.
Well, that's most kind of you, but as I say...
I'll tell her, then, shall I?
Here's my card.
Mr Hamilton.
Oh, Gerald, please.
And who shall I tell her to expect?
Isherwood.
Christopher Isherwood.
ANNOUNCEMENT ON TANNOY
Wystan!
So, here I am!
Yes, here you are.
Good trip?
Fine, thanks.
Those seats are devilish.
I hardly noticed.
I thought we'd drop your case off, then I'd show you the sights.
Best start as one means to go on.
I decided the Brandenburg Gate could wait.
Don't worry, they won't bite, unless you want them to.
They're very accommodating if you have the cash, but it won't break the bank, the exchange rate is still very much in our favour.
Ah, Pieps!
Hallo.
IN GERMAN
Guten Abend.
Guten Abend.
Niedlich!
What are you saying?
What was that?
We've been something of a feature.
Well, maybe more of a B feature.
I have no illusions of the pitfalls of loving a whore.
Are they all on the game?
Most of them, yes.
You can't imagine what a state the economy's in.
They look very well on it.
Yeah, they like to keep themselves fit.
It's good for business, of course, and they're shamelessly vain.
The fact that we find them desirable only proves how very masculine they are.
What do you mean, "we"?
They're nearly all rampant heters and use our money to pay for cunt.
But don't let that put you off, they're frightfully good at it.
What name does he go under?
Caspar.
That's about the only thing I understood.
Perhaps you'd better help me trot out the odd German phrase, else I could get myself into the most frightful fix.
Perhaps I better had.
The question is, will you understand the answers?
I might have found somewhere to stay.
Oh, yes?
I got talking to this man on the train.
You little slut!
apparently his landlady's rather desperate for a lodger.
Something about filling her quota.
Anyway, I thought there'd be no harm in checking it out.
You're very welcome to stay here, you know.
In fact I'd very much like it if you did.
I need a room of my own, Wystan.
Once I start giving lessons, which I'm going to have to earn a bit of cash and subsidise my writing, well...
And you can't write poetry with me buzzing about.
Yes, you're right.
So, I expect you'll be seeing him again, this Caspar chappie?
Well, yes.
I hope so.
I have missed you.
I love English gentlemen, Herr Issyvoo.
Herr Hamilton, such a charming man!
And you, a writer!
What an honour!
You can write many famous novels here.
Oh, Herr Issyvoo, this room was made for you!
It's very nice, Fraulein Thurau.
Oh, Herr Issyvoo!
You English are so polite.
Well, you English men.
There is an English woman across the hall.
She treats me like a slave.
"Fraulein Ross,"
I tell her, "I was a lady.
I have not always scrubbed the floors. "
Ach, forgive me, Herr Issyvoo, that was the lodger before you.
I don't know what he'd eaten but it won't come out.
THEY SPEAK GERMAN
Morning, darling.
I have the most perfectly frightful head.
Who is it?
Isherwood.
Who?
Christopher Isherwood.
It's me, Christopher.
We met on the train.
I've taken the room.
Oh, Christopher!
Do forgive me, dear boy, one has to be so careful nowadays.
Since my release from Brixton
I've rather lost touch with the old country.
You were in prison?
Yes, for expressing anti-British sentiments, though how, I ask myself, could I be regarded as a traitor when I have rivers of Irish blood simply coursing through my veins?
So you're in business here?
One must have fingers in many pies, dear boy.
Such alarming times we live in.
Ah!
Heinrich!
A young stevedore I encountered in Hamburg.
And what were you doing in Hamburg?
What is one ever doing anywhere?
Passing through, dear boy.
That is our destiny, forever passing through.
He does make rather an impression, though, doesn't he?
Well, I...
I have found, Christopher, down the years, that I have never been able to relax sexually with a member of my own class.
That an affair with one's social and intellectual equal is well nigh impossible, mm?
I suppose.
You are in the right city, dear boy.
Quite the place to let your hair down with some eager young prole.
Oh, dear, is it crooked?
Just a tiny bit, perhaps.
Of course, one must take a little care.
We're still illegal, and should the Nazis come to power they'll stamp us out altogether.
What's the current Communist line?
Well, as far as I know, Lenin said nothing about buggery.
Dearest Heinrich!
Smelt exactly like a fox.
Delicious!
Haven't you gone yet, Ludo?
Oh, do put something on!
You'll frighten the horses.
He's Polish.
"He noticed I was staring at his wig and asked if it was crooked.
"'Just a little', I said, and he straightened it. "
You like, ja?
Ja.
Spot on.
GASPING
Window.
Good.
Good.
Ah.
And this?
Fish.
No, what is it?
Big fish?
No, this.
What is this?
Whale.
No.
It's a clock.
Clock!
Ja!
Yes, good.
And that's a dolphin.
Was?
Never mind.
That...
Fraulein Schmidt?
Well, what is that?
SHE LAUGHS
GASPING AND MOANING
Oh, Christoph!
Oh!
This is how I'd like to die.
Ist gut?
Ja?
Ja, ja!
Guten Morgen, Herr Hamilton!
Oh, Guten Morgen, Fraulein Mayr.
Guten Morgen.
Danke.
ROARING BEHIND DOOR
Guten Morgen, Herr Issyvoo.
Guten Morgen, Fraulein Thurau.
How sweet love must be!
Tonight, yes?
Jawohl.
Morning, darling.
Of course I don't know half the people who pass through this place, but you've been here simply generations.
I thought we really must say hello.
Would you like coffee or tea?
Well...
I don't recommend the tea much.
I don't know what Fraulein Thurau does to it, but it tastes just like slops.
Tell me, Chris, what do you do?
People tend not to call me Chris.
I'm an actress.
Not at the moment.
I'm singing in a night club.
But you absolutely must come and see me.
What about tonight?
I'm afraid tonight's rather difficult.
Was that your boyfriend in the hall or just a one off?
I find one offs so much less of a hassle, don't you, darling?
I've been here for centuries, getting on three months now.
I came here with a girlfriend who assured me we'd get film work, but then she was whisked off to Paris by a fat banker and left me utterly stranded.
How rotten.
Oh, I don't care.
I can stand on my own two feet.
But don't you mind being here alone?
One's always alone, duckie.
Surely you know that.
How old are you?
I'm practically antique.
I'm nearly 21.
I'm frightfully bright, you know.
I got myself expelled from school by saying I was pregnant.
There was the most terrible to do when they found out I wasn't.
I got myself sent down from Cambridge.
I say!
Flunked my Tripos.
What a hoot!
I'm meeting a man in The Adlon for lunch, but he'll have to wait.
He has the most revolting underpants, they're like camel hair or something.
It's the sort of thing John The Baptist might wear.
Oh, Mummy would nearly die if she knew what an old whore I am, but one has to keep that horrid wolf from the door, doesn't one?
Guten Tag!
Really!
How do you manage, darling?
I've started giving English lessons, but actually I'm a novelist.
A novelist!
How perfectly marvellous!
Are you published?
My first novel, yes.
I haven't yet found a publisher for the second.
Has it sold simply thousands?
About 300, actually.
The one you write about me shall sell by the million.
About you?
Of course, darling.
Jean Ross, woman of mystery!
I'm not sure you're that mysterious.
Do you know, I think we're going to get along famously.
You will write about me, won't you darling?
Maybe.
One can't afford to wait, sweetie.
This whole thing is about to collapse around our ears.
Carpe diem, darling!
Oh, damn!
I suppose I'd better meet the old goat.
He's promised to introduce me to Max Reinhardt, but I don't believe him for a second.
Why are men always such beasts, darling?
Chris, could you be an angel and lend me 10 marks?
I haven't got a bean for the taxi.
"She said his underpants were like camel hair,
"the sort of thing John The Baptist might wear. "
You're very quiet.
A touch of sunstroke.
You know, coming to Berlin is the first honest thing I've done in my life, and it's all thanks to you.
I doubt your mother sees it quite like that.
He's rather lovely, don't you think?
Caspar!
So tell me, Herr Isherwood, have you come to Berlin to sample the culture?
I wouldn't quite say that.
In fact, I'm rather anti-culture.
Like the Nazis?
Oh, no, not in that way.
It's just that I'm rather put off by culture worshippers.
I find them somewhat precious and prone to gushing.
Do you find me somewhat precious and prone to gushing?
No, I'm sure you're not, but the danger is that one can use culture worship as a substitute for engaging with the messy business of living.
You see, I find all this so very interesting, that you are a writer but do not like culture.
It is my belief that culture raises us from the beasts.
I wonder, Herr Landauer, why you have employed me to teach you English.
You seem to speak it perfectly well.
One has to...
How do you say?
.. keep in practice.
Good.
What exactly is it that you do?
I am a shopkeeper.
A shopkeeper?
That is precisely what I am.
As in Landauer's Department Store?
Yes.
That's where I buy my socks.
Do you engage with politics, Herr Isherwood?
Actually, no.
I'm not really a joiner.
I seem to be constitutionally incapable of bringing myself to the required... pitch of enthusiasm.
I have my sympathies, of course.
We can no longer afford the luxury of sympathy.
I rather suspect I'm best equipped to observe and record.
That will not be an option.
When the Nazis come to power, we must take to the streets.
Not only Jews like myself, but all of us, Herr Isherwood.
We must take to the streets and stay there, even when the Storm Troopers start firing.
I'm not sure I'd hack it as a street fighter.
Forgive me, but are you not then as guilty as your detested culture worshippers for refusing to engage with the whole messy business?
I think, maybe, we should all play to our strengths.
Perhaps we will practise the irregular verbs?
You like that, huh?
It's like silk.
If you go to gymnasium, Christoph, you be like me and Johnny Weissmuller.
I'm not so sure about that.
And then you do this, ja?
No!
No!
Caspar!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
You like, ja?
Nein!
Ja?
Nein!
Ja!
Ja!
Christoph?
Yes?
You got 10 marks?
Yes.
YODELLING
I pay you tonight, ja?
Of course you will.
Oh, dear!
Let us thank God, Christoph, that we are both normal.
Aren't boys marvellous?
Their shape and their voices, their smell and the way they move.
And they can be so... romantic, whereas girls...
No, I'm glad I'm like I am.
Thank God for public school!
He's not coming, is he?
As I've told you, my dear, intimacy's just business to them.
So you think if I stopped giving him money...?
No, no, Caspar and I, it's more than just business.
They're desperate for cash and they'll do anything for it.
But what he says to me...
He'll tell you anything you want to hear.
Still, what do I know about romance?
I'm a poet, not a fucking journalist.
I've booked my ticket back to England.
Already?
Father's allowance has dried up and I really must get this fissure in my rectum seen to.
I hope that wasn't me.
I'm touched by your concern, but really, Christopher, you mustn't flatter yourself.
# Can't imagine why I chose to leave him
# How could I have been so cruel?
# After all he loved me without question
# Still I left him like a fool
# If I woke him late at night complaining
# "I'm on my last cigarette"
# He'd say "I'll be over in a minute
# "Darling, please don't get upset"
# Peter, Peter... #
Gute Nacht.
Gute Nacht.
That's not what I was expecting at all.
I suspect that's a compliment, so thank you, darling.
Oh, I'm so thrilled you're here.
Bobby, sweetie.
Good job, hon!
Oh, I'm in heaven!
Chris darling, this is Bobby Gilbert.
He does something frantically important in something or other.
I'm in steel.
And this is Chris Isherwood.
Christopher.
Hey, Chris.
Any day now Bobby's going to whisk me off to Hollywood, aren't you, darling?
You bet!
And I've told him all about you.
Oh?
Chris is absolutely my best friend.
He's the writer.
Oh, yeah, right!
Would I have read anything of yours, Chris?
Oh, no, but I've told him if he really sticks at it, he could write something really great like Noel Coward or something.
Couldn't you, darling?
What's the matter, Christoph?
You don't like me tonight?
Eh, Christoph?
What's the matter?
I don't like being taken for an idiot, that's what's the matter.
You say you'll meet me, then don't turn up.
You take money off me and say you'll pay me back, but never do.
It's getting to the point where I can't believe anything you tell me.
Yes, I understand.
I understand.
Some of the girls I see, they are like that.
They say things, then let me down, and that makes me mad.
And when I see them, I always pay them and never hit them and still they let me down!
But you know, Christoph, some of them, they are so beautiful, and they make me so happy and I just forget how mad I am.
You bastard!
Your eyes, Christoph.
They shine so bright when you're hot for me.
Ah, Caspar.
He gave me a cheap gold-plated bracelet.
Probably an unwanted gift from some admirer.
He fastened it around my wrist.
A love token, I fondly thought, but then he disappeared.
I asked around, but no-one knew where he was.
I should've listened to Wystan.
Perhaps it was just a business transaction after all.
Zwei Minuten, meine Liebe.
It must be simply marvellous to be a novelist.
Why's that?
Because when people are utterly foul to you, you can sit down and write about them and tell the world how perfectly vile they are and make simply pots of money out of it.
It hasn't quite worked out like that yet.
Darling, be an angel and light my ciggie.
Actually, I've been offered the chance to earn a bit extra.
Take it.
Writing the occasional letter from Berlin and doing the odd book review.
Darling, that's marvellous!
Let's have champagne!
It's for a magazine called Action.
Oswald Mosley's rag?
Oh, you know it then?
Of course I know it.
I may wear green nail varnish, but I'm not completely vacuous.
Why DO you wear green nail varnish?
Have you said yes?
Not yet.
You won't.
I wouldn't write anything political.
Writing anything for that lot would be making a statement of sorts, even if it was the cookery column.
The money would come in awfully handy.
Christopher, you can't!
But, Jean...
I wouldn't talk to you again and that's an end to it.
I was just testing the water.
I wasn't really going to write anything for them.
Honestly, I wasn't.
I'm one to talk.
Gosh, you know the things I've done for money.
People here are so strange.
They've simply no idea, and the Nazis are getting more and more of a foothold and they just seem to accept it.
I've even heard some talk of a brighter future as if all this ghastliness were a price worth paying.
They're going to get the most awful shock unless they make a stand,
Which you and I must do.
We must not throw in the towel.
Why are you looking at me like that?
I don't really know.
WHIPPING, CRIES OF PAIN
Mein Gott!
Morning, darlings.
Gott im Himmel!
HE CRIES OUT
Oh, dear!
I do hope he won't do himself a mischief.
He ought to be more careful at his time of life.
HE CRIES OUT
Oh, Bobby darling!
You do that so well.
You must teach me one day how to catch it in my mouth.
You bet, honey.
Thank you.
To The Memorial.
The Memorial.
Yeah!
So, do you reckon I'd enjoy your book, Chris?
Well, I'm not sure what sort of books you like, Bobby.
What do you think, hon?
I haven't a clue, darling, but I expect it's astoundingly brilliant!
And the point is, it's published.
His second novel in print, and he's even had a letter of congratulation from EM Forester.
Forster.
Wow!
It won't be long till our Chris is just as famous.
Say, who's that guy in the wig?
BOTH:
Gerald.
Well, I could swear that Gerald was peeking through the keyhole while I was in the john.
When I came out, he didn't know where to look.
I expect he knew exactly where to look.
Yeah.
Right.
Bobby, darling.
I adore champagne.
We'll have it every day, won't we, once you' whisk me off to Hollywood?
Sure thing.
Bobby!
Naughty Bobby!
SHOUTING
GLASS SMASHES
Excuse me.
Entschuldigung, bitte.
I was in a cafe and you were...
Do you remember?
No.
Well, why should you?
Mein Name ist Christopher.
Perhaps you'd like to go for ein Bier?
No.
OK.
I'm sorry.
His name was Heinz.
He was innocent, vulnerable and uncritical.
A boy I could protect and cherish as my very own.
Jean thought it was all frightfully jolly and decided I was at last doing my bit for the class struggle.
And as Heinz and I drew closer,
I had no hesitation in falling in love.
SHE COUGHS
She need to be in hospital, but there is no bed.
Mutti...
SHE COUGHS
Gerald!
Come on out.
I know you are in there!
He's not here!
Where is he, then?
Hamburg.
Hamburg?
!
Well, when he's back, tell him if I don't get what I want, he knows what to expect.
Don't you, Gerald?
Some people seem to be utterly lacking in consideration.
Tell me what it's about, Gerald.
A business transaction, that's all, that went slightly awry.
What sort of business?
You know, Christopher, you're looking as joyous as the first day of spring.
Gerald!
I was offered a small fee to help someone get his hands on a police dossier.
Yes?
Actually, it was a positively glacial sum that would have paid off my debts at a stroke, and do you know what?
The wretched man simply vanished.
Disparu without paying me a single pfennig.
So who was that at the door?
A philistine, my dear.
Claiming interest on a little loan.
A loan for what?
Oh, do keep up, dear boy!
For the money I needed to bribe the police to get the dossier.
What on earth were you thinking of?
The trouble is everyone's so greedy nowadays.
And dishonest.
Simply can't trust a soul.
Gerald.
Yes?
Your wig's slipped.
Oh!
DOOR CREAKS
No!
THUMP
'My dear Christopher, I've had to leave Berlin at very short notice 'which made it impossible for me to communicate with you.
'Our friend at the door finally lost patience and matters got a little out of hand.
'Try not to think too hardly of me, dear boy.
'That would be more than I could bear.
'As always, your affectionate Gerald. '
They give her bed at last.
Ah, that's very good news, Frau Neddermayer.
She make dress to look nice in sanatorium.
Oh, I see.
Well, it would be, um...
SHE COUGHS
To see his Nazi friends.
SHE BREATHES DEEPLY
SHE COUGHS
The last Kaiser always mistrusted Berlin.
He saw it as a centre of, how do you say, dissidence?
Yes.
What with the leftist working class and the intellectual avant garde.
I'm wondering if the working class is as leftist as one imagines.
It was not that long ago, Herr Isherwood, that we came close to a communist revolution, but they lacked a strong leader.
This is where Adolf Hitler has been so very clever and exploited the situation.
Ever since the Treaty of Versaille and then the Depression brought the country to its knees with banks failing and savings disappearing, the poor and unemployed see him as their saviour.
And the Nazis organise everywhere - in bars and clubs and schools like a virus.
I see.
Ja.
Like a virus.
But I am sure that all this you know.
Or do you spend too much time at play?
Berlin can be very distracting.
We must all stand by our own kind, Christopher.
Whatever the cost.
# I can't give you anything but love
# Baby
# That's the only thing I've plenty of
# Baby
# Dream a while
# Scheme a while
# We're sure to find
# Happiness
# And I guess
# All those things you've always pined for... #
# I can't give you anything but love
# Baby!
#
Oh, bravo!
Did your mother teach you to cook?
Ja.
She's not very well, she is at the sanitorium.
I did say.
Yes, of course.
So tell me, what exactly is this?
Pig.
Oh, pork!
How lovely!
Ja.
It is, er...
Pork rib?
Delicious!
I think he means lung.
Ja!
Schweinelunge!
Oh.
Golly.
And then before my very eyes I saw him turn from prince to frog and I thought, "Did I really let that make love to me?"
This is my brother Gerhardt.
Gerhardt, it's a pleasure to meet you.
Won't you join us?
We're having the most perfect evening.
I think your brother is simply divine and he's cooked us a marvellous meal.
You are no longer welcome here, Herr Isherwood.
He doesn't mean it.
May I ask why?
Before our father went to the Western Front, he said to me,
"Gerhardt, look out for your mother and your brother. "
I have always tried to honour his memory, but with no work and no money, it's been difficult.
I'm sure it is.
Yes.
But now there is hope, Herr Isherwood, and Herr Hitler is the reason.
Oh, for goodness sake!
He understands men like me.
He wants to make us proud again, hold our heads up high again.
The Communists, they had their chance.
The Nazis are the people's party now.
This is your friends at night school talking, Gerhardt.
Did he just call me a tart?
We do not want you here, Herr Isherwood.
You and your kind.
Oh, how frightfully rude!
So take your pick, Heinz.
Make your father proud...
.. or shame us all.
But Gerhardt...
Honestly, darling, how you can leave poor Heinz with that monster?
I'm sure he can stand up for himself!
We'll probably find him hacked into little pieces at the bottom of a canal.
And you didn't help matters addressing Gerhardt like you were Queen Mary at an investiture.
And after all the trouble he went to with that pig lung hash.
You bastards, you bastards!
For Christ's sake, Jean!
Brutes!
Filthy rotten brutes!
Shut up!
For God's sake!
You're just as bad, every one of you!
Don't worry, darling...
It's over now.
Can we get a taxi?
Can somebody please get a taxi!
Cracken house, ja?
You get used to it, that's the danger.
The uniforms and the raids, the street-fights and the beatings...
We can't just stand by, can we?
No.
We can't, you know.
We really can't.
Gerhardt...
Such a pity, isn't it, that we don't make love?
After all, there's nothing else to do.
We could go to the movies.
I haven't got two pfennigs to rub together.
Jean?
Jean, what is it?
Hollywood's off.
Oh, Jean, I'm so sorry.
"Dear Jean, I have to go back to the States.
"Some emergency at HQ.
"It was fun, wasn't it?
"Bobby. "
What a complete bastard.
Typical bloody American.
Flaky as hell!
You fancied him rotten!
That's beside the point.
Come here.
And he was a most marvellous lover.
He was the best...
Oh, Jean.
Poor darling...
He did leave me a little something.
So he bloody should!
But I shan't be keeping it.
# Men say that they can be faithful
# Simply I smile to myself
# New love is always so novel
# Faithfulness is but pretence
# Now it is all but forgotten
# But yesterday I still possessed
# Love affords time that is blissful
# Loyalty still makes no sense
# I don't know to whom I belong
# It would be such a shame to end up on my own
# If I make myself true to one
# How another will surely be sad and alone
# Should such a beauty belong to one person
# No surely the sun and the stars
# They belong to us all
# I don't know to whom I belong
# I believe
# I only # belong to myself. #
They come, they go, and so it will always be.
Good morning, Herr Issyvoo.
Guten Morgan, Fraulein Thurau.
What a beautiful morning!
Even the sun seems to have come out for Herr Hitler.
Oh, Herr Issyvoo?
The police have been round.
The police?
They were asking about my lodgers.
What did they want to know?
"Routine", they said.
RECORDING OF HITLER PLAYS
Hein, un Moment.
Caspar!
I would remind you, sir, that this is a Jewish store and that there is now an official anti-Jewish boycott.
Where have you been?
I've been looking everywhere for you.
You disappeared.
I didn't know what had happened.
Caspar!
I need to buy a pair of socks.
Shame!
Shame!
Beruf?
"Street-sweeper"?
No.
Maybe...
"domestic servant", or...
Yes, why not? "Domestic servant".
Heinz?
I cannot come, Christoph.
But of course you can.
No, it is too dangerous...
for you, for me...
It's even more dangerous if you stay.
For Gerhardt.
Gerhardt?
He's one of them, for God's sake!
He's my brother!
We're brothers too,
Heinz, and more, much more besides!
And this is my country.
Not at the moment, it isn't.
It will be again one day, I've no doubt, but in the meantime...
You do not miss home?
I have no home.
This is home... wherever I am.
We should be where we belong.
We are where we belong - together.
We must stand together.
We're responsible for each other, as individuals.
Don't you see?
You have to come with me.
I want you to.
Now you do, but in a week?
A month?
I'll still want you Heinz.
Heinz.
Of course I will.
YODELLING
I am sure I do not know, Herr Issyvoo, what makes you want to leave Berlin.
How can I best put this, Fraulein?
Adolf Hitler.
Ach, the Fuhrer!
One day it's Bruning, then von Papen, the next von Schleicher, then it's Hitler.
We must all make the best of it, Herr Issyvoo.
I am staying.
Most Germans are staying.
And besides, where else would we go?
Well, this is your homeland, Fraulein.
I understand that.
But Heinz and I, we want to get out.
We want to...
Travel.
But why?
To go here?
To go there?
What is the point?
Soon no-one will be left.
Herr Hamilton has gone, Fraulein Ross, now you...
You get used to it.
You get used to anything.
CLOCK TICKS
Is your room... satisfactory?
Mummy, he's not retarded.
Where you sleep, is good, yes?
Yes.
I sleep good.
Yes.
Good.
Thank you.
How long have you known Christopher?
Mummy...
Shush!
I know Christopher one year and one half.
Oh, that long, and he's hardly mentioned you, if at all.
And how long are you staying in our country?
Two weeks.
I'm sure Heinz can answer for himself, can't you, Heinz?
Two weeks.
You see?
What a shame it's not longer.
Two weeks is as long as his permit allows.
Then maybe another time.
What is that?
Oh, now...
Christopher!
That, Heinz, is Wyberslegh Hall, part of the family estate.
It's in Cheshire in the north of England.
I painted it, as a matter of fact.
You paint it?
Yes.
It's very good.
Thank you, Heinz.
That is the house where I gave birth to Christopher.
Yes?
And very difficult it was too.
I was in labour for 18 hours.
18 hours!
Imagine that!
Mummy, please!
Oh, dear, that was rather modern of me, wasn't it?
But it was worth it.
He was the most delightful baby.
I'm sure Heinz isn't remotely interested.
He had the loveliest skin and long slitty eyes... just like a Jap.
You see, of course he's interested.
You live in the past, Mummy.
Perhaps I do, Christopher, because it's always there and never lets me down.
Do you have a mummy, Heinz?
She's dead.
Oh.
Oh, I am sorry.
Oh, dear.
Christopher's daddy's dead.
He was killed in the war.
He was my daddy too.
Yes, dear, but you hardly knew him.
He was killed by the Germans.
What are you thinking of, hmm!
I'm not blaming Heinz, darling.
I'm simply filling him in.
And for your information, Heinz's daddy was also killed on the Western Front.
Well, there you are, you see.
That's what wars do - kill people.
Toast?
He's a nice boy.
Well-mannered.
A street-cleaner, you say?
There's no reason a street-cleaner can't be well-mannered.
No, dear.
No reason at all.
How lovely to have a job like ordinary people.
But who'd have you, my darling?
You seem to be inept at pretty much everything.
Don't speak to him like that!
It's entirely your fault he's like he is.
Like what?
Richard, dear, we're talking.
It's terrible he has to go back, and now Germany's withdrawn from the League Of Nations.
Yes, that is rather troubling.
I must think of a way of getting him out for good.
But why should that be your responsibility?
Surely he knows people who can help.
He has absolutely no-one, Mummy, except for a brother who's disowned him, and, besides, I want it to be my responsibility.
So what will you do?
Get him another permit?
Or even another nationality.
Of course, you could always adopt him.
Darling!
I don't think so!
Are you sure he wouldn't be happier in Germany?
It is his home, after all.
It's where he belongs.
And he isn't a Jew or anything.
You've no idea.
It's Nazi Germany we're talking about.
It's not just the Jews who are being victimised.
I do read the papers, darling.
I'm fully aware that the Nazis have done some bad things.
Although one hears that Herr Hitler's done some good things too.
Dear God!
If it weren't for that wretched boy Auden, dragging you off there...
I assure you, he didn't need to drag me.
But you must do as you wish, Christopher, as you always do... so long as you realise what you might be taking on.
Right.
We're going to have to mail money to him in Berlin... "We"?
.. So he can support himself until he comes back here, and if you write a letter inviting him to stay...
Christopher!
..
Then I'm sure they'll give him a much longer permit, maybe even for keeps.
You can't do that!
You'll find that I can.
But you haven't proved your case!
Mr Isherwood, your mother invites a foreign servant to her home without the requisite permit, you send the boy money telling him to claim it was a bequest, which could be construed as an attempt to deceive His Majesty's Immigration Service,
but then we have the letter you wrote.
May I?
"I am counting the days until your arrival.
"I've been so lonely without you. "
A bit curious, don't you think, the way it's written?
A bit... what's the word?
Queer?
Thank you, Mr Auden.
What a boon to have a poet on hand!
You can't send him back!
Christopher...
No!
God knows what they might do!
Not my responsibility.
So an alien has no rights whatsoever in this democracy that men have laid down their lives for.
I hope, should the moment come, that you too will be ready to make the sacrifice.
Make no mistake, I shall appeal!
You can write to the Home Secretary for all the good it will do.
Come on.
As soon as I saw that rat, I knew we were done for.
They're all the bloody same!
Oh no, he's one of us.
It stands out a mile.
I'm sorry.
You seem out of sorts.
Do I?
It's Heinz, isn't it?
Goodbyes are always sad.
As sad as dying.
I'll be seeing him soon enough.
That's right.
Yeah.
No need to be sad.
I suppose being a writer, you want to tidy everything up and make it make sense.
But things never do quite make sense, do they?
Not really.
No.
This Sally Bowles character... is she based on anyone?
Yes, in a manner of speaking.
And what about Mr Norris?
Yes, I suppose he is too.
I thought we might first meet him on a train.
Oh, yes.
Trains are always good.
You can't go wrong with a train.
Where were we?
Full stop, close quotation marks.
Good.
It must be very polarising, this Nazi business.
Hard to sit on the fence, I'd imagine.
Yes, it is.
Berlin's fairly seething, what with all the poverty and wounded pride.
I'd say communism was the best hope for peace.
Then why not stay here and join the Party?
I can't do that!
I have Heinz to consider.
Yes, Heinz.
Of course.
So where will you go?
Amsterdam, probably.
For the time being.
That's all one can say, isn't it?
"For the time being. "
It always breaks my heart a little to see you leave.
You should be used to it by now.
Oh, no, I'll never get used to it... .. And how awful if I did.
I'll be back.
I always am.
'And so once again I cast off from England and threw in my lot with Heinz.
'Two lost souls wandering around Europe on the brink...
'I have to admit I felt a little guilty flitting from country to country to save a single man, 'whilst others were preparing to save the world.
'But then our luck ran out and Heinz was arrested by the Gestapo, 'and that was that. '
Daily Worker, ladies?
No appeasement!
Fight the fascists!
Excuse me, Miss...
I'm exercising my democratic right!
Only you would choose to sell The Daily Worker in Knightsbridge.
I have no say in the matter.
I go where the Party tells me.
You're looking impossibly young.
Are you ever going to age?
I do hope not.
My God!
The varnish!
I somehow felt that red was more appropriate.
I must confess I carry it with me everywhere.
Isn't it funny, darling, that you're the one that became famous?
And you know I must say I'm rather enjoying it, and meanwhile poor Heinz...
Well...
I dread to think what he's being subjected to.
A year labouring for the state followed by two years in the army.
It's frightfully harsh.
It could be worse - he might have got carted off to a concentration camp.
You did all you could.
I wonder if I did?
I wonder if I did, really?
And what's worse, I even feel relieved.
Hmm.
Do you ever miss Berlin?
Oh, no.
I never miss anything.
Sometimes I wonder if I shouldn't have had that kid.
I think I'd just about have cut the mustard as a mother.
I'd tuck him in, and I'd sing to him.
And then I'd go out and fuck filthy old men to pay for the brat!
Then why not marry and have another?
Because I've lost my faith in men.
Well, that's a shame.
I have simply no use for them any more.
Not even you, darling.
Oh, well, back to the revolution.
Might we see each other again?
Goodbye, Chris.
Goodbye.
'It seems everyone's caught communism like flu. '
I think it's fair to say that the closest we've come to solidarity with the workers is sleeping with them.
Well, that's a cause of sorts.
The only cause you really care about, Christopher, is yourself.
Isn't that rather unkind?
Hmm.
But you've turned it into an art form - rather successfully, as it happens.
I used to be a little in love with you.
You knew that, didn't you?
Yes, I thought you did.
You're lucky - you're not burdened by the concept of sin.
And it is a sin, Christopher... although I fully intend to carry on sinning.
Please, don't start on about God!
You're going to have such a conversion one of these days, my dear.
I do loathe the sea.
It's so wet and sloppy.
I don't belong here.
I'm not sure I belong anywhere.
I rather like being a foreigner.
I wonder where we might end up?
'Wystan was right.
'I've never known about anybody except me.
You see,
'I was never able to commit
- I only ever sort of added to the chorus.
'And now, of course, politics are more and more about the individual.
'The gay liberation movement seems to have taken me to its heart.
'It's very nice of them, really.
'A cause at last!
'But then I think it always was my cause.
And somehow, you know... 'it makes sense of what I was trying to do for Heinz.
'All those years ago... '
Christoph?
You write again about Berlin?
Yes, for a British newspaper.
A lot has changed, ja?
What's left of it.
When the city was cut in pieces, we end up in the Russian sector.
Rotten luck, eh?
We all hate the Russians, Christoph.
We would much rather be here in the West Zone.
Maybe one day.
My friend Christoph, the famous writer.
I suppose you could say that.
Tell me, there are skyscrapers in America?
Oh, yes.
And you see Hollywood?
I live near there, actually.
And the Grand Canyon?
You see that?
Yes.
It's... very big.
And cowboys?
No, I haven't seen too many of them.
I feel guilty, Heinz.
All that I made you suffer.
I should never have taken you out of Germany.
But Christoph, you change my life.
What we had, what we did,
I would not miss for the world.
Look, Christoph...
My wife, Hilde.
Well, she looks... very nice!
She's a good girl.
And she doesn't ask questions.
That's all right then.
And this is my son...
.. Christoph.
Christoph?
Ja.
Well.
You know, Christoph, you are not getting younger.
That's the way it tends to go.
You live alone, yes?
At the moment.
That is not good, to live alone.
You need a family around you, to keep you company, to look after you when you are sick.
Heinz, I'm not decrepit!
But listen, Christoph, we could be your family.
What?
Hilde, Christoph and I.
Out there in...
California.
Ah, well...
Erm, I'm not so sure about that.
You see, the life I lead...
My, my plans are so uncertain.
I'd have to think it over.
Look, we'll see.
See how it goes.
And I'll write you, we'll keep in touch.
You do understand, don't you, Heinz?
You do... don't you?
Yes.
I...
I understand.
Fraulein!
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Oh!
When the city was divided, we got the Americans.
Oh, I am so happy!
We are all so happy!
I thank God the Russians didn't get us.
Communism!
Oh, Herr Issyvoo, you look like a child!
It's lovely to see you, Fraulein.
Herr Issyvoo, Herr Issyvoo!
Ach, the last year of the war, Herr Issyvoo!
Yes.
It was terrible.
We were in the cellar nearly all the time, holding each other.
We prayed so much, we got quite religious!
Ah!
Is the yodeller still there?
No, thank God!
The Nazis shot her.
It's the one good thing they did!
Another survivor, eh, Fraulein?
Another survivor.
It was damaged a little, but I mended it.
For you.
No, I couldn't.
Take it, please, and when you look at it, you will think of Berlin, and Fraulein Thurau, and smile.
Thank you.

It's 40 years since I first wrote about my time in Berlin.
And the book I'm now writing is perhaps an attempt to set the record straight - well, as straight as its possible to be.
I destroyed my Berlin diaries, you see, so I've had to rely a good deal on memory.
As to why I went in the first place, my friend Wystan Auden was there and encouraged me to join him.
I could also say I went because of what was happening politically.
But in fact, I went because of the boys.
To me...
Berlin meant boys.
(Ticking)
(Applause)
Danke schön, mein Liebling.
♪ One man has hands that are tender
♪ One man has hands that are strong
♪ If I should choose to surrender
♪ My choices are bound to be wrong
♪ I might find my ideal lover
♪ If I search both far and wide...
WOMAN:
My dear, that simply won't do.
You're the very last person who ought to go there.
Berlin isn't the right place for you at all.
What on earth do you mean?
It's German, darling.
Wystan Auden thinks it's the most marvellous place.
Auden!
Such an untidy boy.
Besides, what about medical school?
But, Mummy, I am not out out for medical school.
That's exactly what you said about Cambridge.
Christopher, you cannot go through life shirking it.
It's time you buckled to.
- I'm a published novelist.
- Of course you are, darling.
But wouldn't it be so much nicer to be a doctor as well?
It isn't a hobby, you know.
Any normal mother would be proud.
And I am proud, my sweetheart
You know I found your novel most interesting.
I thought it was ingenious the way you used your antipathy to me to such creative effect.
But you cannot expect life to be one long holiday.
I'm not going there on holiday.
I'm going there to get away from you.
Couldn't you go somewhere a little closer - like the Isle of Wight?

MOTHER:
Of course you must do as you wish.
I fully intend to.
It's only natural that you should want to flee the nest just as I'm bound to get more lonely.
What I went through to bring you into this world.
Months and months of feeling really quite seedy.
(Sighs) Oh, well.
So be it.
You won't forget, will you, darling that the Germans killed your father?
Take me with you.
You have to stay and look after Mummy.
But for how long?
I'm afraid I can't answer that.
♪ I make myself true to one
♪ How another will surely be sad and alone

♪ No, surely, the sun and the stars

Danke.
Vielen Dank.
I was wondering...
Do forgive me, dear boy, I didn't mean to startle you.
- No, no.
- Could I trouble you for a light?
Yes, of course.
I seem to have mislaid my lighter...
Oh, thank you, dear boy.
It may have been...
Would you mind if I...
- No, no.
- How kind.
It may have been stolen.
Oh, dear.
One has to be so careful nowadays, don't you find?
Are you going all the way?
- Excuse me?
- To Berlin.
Oh, yes.
- Holiday?
- I'm hoping for a little more than that.
Ah, yes, well.
Berlin has so much to offer in certain respects.
- Do you live there?
- For now.
One never knows what a new dawn may bring.
I hope you don't think I'm prying, dear boy, but do you have accommodation in Berlin?
I do, as it happens.
The reason why I venture such impertinence is that my landlady, dear sweet woman, is desperate for a reliable lodger.
Her landlords are ruthless, and if they knew that she didn't have the full quota, they'd tun' her out in an instant.
I have a feeling - though perhaps I shouldn't say so myself,
I do have a nose for these things - you might fit the bill perfectly.
My goodness, yes.
- That's most kind of you but...
- I'll tell her, then, shall I?
Here's my card.
Mr Hamilton.
Oh, Gerald.
Please.
And who shall I tell her to expect?
Isherwood.
Christopher Isherwood.
(Engine drowns announcement)
(Train's whistle)
WK/Stan!
So here I am.
Yes, here you are.
Good trip?
Fine, thanks.
Those seats are devilish.
I hardly noticed.
I thought we'd drop your case off, then I'd show you the sights.
Best start as one means to go on.
I decided the Brandenburg Gate could wait.
(Chuckles)
Don't worry, they won't bite...
unless you want them to.
They're very accommodating if you have the cash.
It won't break the bank - the exchange rate is still very much in our favour.
- Pete.
- Hello.
- Guten Abend.
- Guten Abend.
What are you saying?
What was that?
We've been something of a feature.
Well, maybe more of a B-feature.
I have no illusions of the pitfalls of loving a whore.
Are they all on the game?
Most of them.
You can't imagine what a state the economy's in.
They look very well on it.
They like to keep themselves fit.
It's good for business, of course, and they're shamelessly vain.
The fact that we find them desirable only proves how masculine they are.
What do you mean, "we"?
They're nearly all rampant heters and use our money to pay for cunt.
But don't let that put you off.
They're frightfully good at it.
- What name does he go under?
- Caspar.
It's about the only thing I understood.
Perhaps you'd better help me trot out the odd German phrase, else I could get myself into the most frightful fix.
Mm, perhaps I better had.
The question is, will you understand the answers?
I might have found somewhere to stay.
- I got talking to this man on the train.
- Little slut.
Apparently his landlady's desperate for a lodger, something about filling her quota.
I thought there'd be no harm in checking it out.
You're very welcome to stay here, you know.
In fact, I'd very much like it if you did.
I need a room of my own, Wys.
If I start giving lessons, which I'm going to have to to earn a bit of cash, and subsidise my writing...
Well, you can't write poetry with me buzzing about.
Yes, you're right.
So I expect you'll be seeing him again, this Caspar chappie?
Oh, yes.
I hope so.
I have missed you.
(Hums softly)
I love English gentlemen, Herr Isherwood.
Herr Hamilton such a charming man.
And you a writer!
What an honour.
You can write many famous novels here.
Oh.
(Blows)
Herr Isherwood, this room was made for you.
It's very nice, Fräulein Thurau.
Herr Isherwood, you English are so polite.
Well, you English men.
There is an English woman across the hall.
She treats me like a slave.
"Fräulein Ross," I tell her, "I was a lady.
I have not always scrubbed floors."
Forgive me, Herr Isherwood.
That was the lodger before you.
I don't know what he'd eaten but it won't come out.
Wie schön Sie wieder zu sehen.
Morning, darling.
I have the most perfectly frightful head.
(Gramophone plays in background)
Who is it?
Isherwood.
Who?
Christopher Isherwood.
It's me, Christopher.
We met on the train.
I've taken the room.
Oh...
Christopher.
Do forgive me, dear boy.
One has to be so careful nowadays.
Since my release from Brixton, I've um I've rather lost touch with the old country.
- You were in prison?
- Yes.
For expressing anti-British sentiments.
Though how, I ask, could I be regarded as a traitor, when I have rivers of Irish blood simply coursing through my veins?
So you're in business here?
One must have fingers in many pies, dear boy.
Such alarming times we live in.
Heinrich.
A young stevedore I encountered in Hamburg.
And what were you doing in Hamburg?
What is one ever doing anywhere?
Passing through, dear boy.
That is our destiny.
Forever passing through.
He does make rather an impression, though.
Well, I um...
I have found, Christopher, down the years, that I've never been able to relax sexually with a member of my own class.
That an affair with one's social and intellectual equal is well-nigh impossible.
Hm?
I suppose.
You're in the right city, dear boy.
Quite the place to let your hair down with some eager young prole.
Oh, dear.
Is it crooked?
Just a tiny bit, perhaps.
One must take a little care.
We're still illegal.
And should the Nazis come to power, they'll stamp us out altogether.
What's the current Communist line?
As far as I know, Lenin said nothing about buggery.
Dearest Heinrich.
He smelt exactly like a fox.
Delicious.
Haven't you gone yet, Ludo?
Do put something on.
You'll frighten the horses.
He's Polish.
He noticed I was staring at his wig and asked if it was crooked.
"Just a little," I said.
And he straightened it.
(Laughter and conversation)
(Grunting)
- You like, ja?
- Ja, spot on.
- Window.
- Good.
Good.
Hm?
And this?
- Fish.
- No.
What is it?
Big fish?
No, no, this.
What is this?
Whale?
No, it's a clock.
Clock.
Ja.
Yes, good.
And that's a dolphin.
- Was?
- Never mind.
That?
Fräulein Schmidt?
Well?
What is that?
(Giggles)
(Sexual moaning)
(Clattering)
Oh, Christoph.
This is how I'd like to die!
(Moaning and grunting)
Guten Morgen, Herr Hamilton.
Oh...good morning, Fräulein Mayr.
Good morning.
Danke.
(Moaning and grunting continues)
- Guten Morgen, Herr Isherwood.
- Guten Morgen, Fräulein Thurau.
How sweet love must be.
Tonight, yes?
Jawohl.
Morning, darling.
I don't know half the people who pass through this place.
But you've been here generations.
We must say hello.
Would you like coffee or tea?
I don't recommend the tea much.
I don't know what Fräulein Thurau does to it but it tastes like slops.
Tell me, Chris, what do you do?
- People tend not to call me Chris.
- I'm an actress.
Not at the moment.
I'm singing in a nightclub.
But you must come and see me.
- What about tonight?
- Tonight's rather difficult.
Was that your boyfriend in the hall or a one-off?
I do find one-offs so much less of a hassle, don't you, darling?
I've been here for centuries - getting on three months, now.
I came here with a girlfriend who assured me we'd get film work.
But then she was whisked away to Paris by a fat banker, left me utterly stranded.
- How rotten!
- I don't care.
I can stand on my own two feet.
But you don't mind being here alone?
One's always alone, ducky!
Surely you know that?
How old are you?
I'm practically antique.
I'm nearly 21.
I'm frightfully bright, you know.
L got myself expelled from school by saying I was pregnant.
There was a terrible to-do when they found out I wasn't.
I got myself sent down from Cambridge.
- I say!
- Flunked my tripos.
What a hoot!
I'm meeting a man in the Adlon for lunch.
He'll have to wait.
He has the most revolting underpants.
They're like camelhair, or something.
It's the sort of thing John the Baptist might wear.
Oh, Mummy would nearly die if she knew what an old whore I am.
But one has to keep that horrid wolf from the door, doesn't one?
Guten Tag.
Really!
How do you manage, darling?
I've started giving English lessons.
But actually, I'm a novelist.
A novelist?
How perfectly marvellous.
- Are you published?
- My first novel, yes.
I haven't yet found a publisher for the second.
Has it sold simply thousands?
About 300, actually.
The one you write about me shall sell by the million.
About you?
Of course, darling.
Jean Ross.
Woman of mystery.
I'm not sure you're that mysterious.
Do you know, I think we're going to get along famously.
You will write about me, won't you, darling?
Maybe.
One can't afford to wait, sweetie.
This whole thing is about to collapse around our ears.
Came chem, darling.
(Both chuckle)
Oh, damn.
I suppose I better go and meet the old goat.
He's promised to introduce me to Max Reinhardt.
I don't believe him for a second.
Why are men always such beasts, darling?
Chris, could you be an angel and lend me ten marks?
L...
I haven't got a bean for the taxi.
She said his underpants were like camel hair.
The sort of thing John the Baptist might wear.
(Show, sharp breaths)
CHRISTOPHER:
You're very quiet.
Touch of sunstroke.
You know, coming to Berlin is the first honest thing I've done in my life.
And it's all thanks to you.
I doubt your mother sees it quite like that.
He's rather lovely, don't you think?
Caspar.
So, tell me, have you come to Berlin to sample the culture?
I wouldn't quite say that.
In fact, I'm rather anti-culture.
- Like the Nazis?
- Oh, no.
Not in that way.
It's just I'm rather put off by culture worshippers.
I find them somewhat precious and prone to gushing.
Do you find me somewhat precious and prone to gushing?
No, I'm sure you're not.
But the danger is that one can use culture worship as a substitute for engaging with the messy business of living.
See, I find all this so very interesting.
You are a writer, but do not like culture.
It is my belief that culture raises us from the beasts.
I wonder, Herr Landauer, why you've employed me to teach you English.
You seem to speak it perfectly well.
One has to - how do you say?
- keep in practice.
Good.
What exactly is it that you do?
I am a shopkeeper.
A shopkeeper?
That is precisely what I am.
As in Landauer's Department Store?
Yes.
That's where I buy my socks.
Do you engage in politics, Herr Isherwood?
Actually, no.
I'm not really much of a joiner.
I seem to be constitutionally incapable of bringing myself to the required er pitch of enthusiasm.
I have my sympathies, of course.
We can no longer afford the luxury of sympathy.
I rather suspect I'm best equipped to observe and record.
That will not be an option.
When the Nazis come to power we must take to the streets.
Not only Jews like myself, but all of us, Herr Isherwood.
We must take to the streets and stay there, even when the storm troopers start firing.
I'm not sure I'd hack it as a street fighter.
Forgive me, but are you not then as guilty as your detested culture worshippers for refusing to engage with the whole messy business?
I think maybe...
we should all play to our strengths.
Perhaps we will practise the irregular verbs.
Hm?
You like that, huh?
It's like Silk.
If you go to gymnasium, Christoph, you'll be like me and Johnny Weissmüller.
I'm not so sure about that.
And then you'd do this, ja?
No.
No!
Caspar!
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
- You like, ja?
- Nein.
- Ja?
- Nein!
Ja.
Ja.
- Christoph?
- Yes?
You got ten marks?
- Yes.
- I'll pay you tonight, ja?
- Of course you will.
- (Yodelling)
- (Yodelling continues)
- Oh, dear.
Let us thank God, Christoph, that we are both normal.
CHRISTOPHER:
Aren't boys marvellous?
Their shape and their voices.
Their smell, the way they move.
And they can be so...romantic, whereas girls...
No, I'm glad I'm like I am.
Thank God for public school.
He's not coming, is he?
As I've told you, my dear, intimacy's just business to them.
So you think if I stopped giving him money]?
No, no.
Caspar and I, it's more than just...business.
They're desperate for cash.
They'll do anything for it.
- But what he says to me...
- He'll tell you anything you want to hear.
Still, what do I know about romance?
I'm a poet, not a fucking journalist.
- I've booked my ticket back to England.
- Already?
Father's allowance has dried up.
And I really must get this fissure in my rectum seen to.
I hope that wasn't me.
I'm touched by your concern, but really, Christopher, you mustn't flatter yourself.

(Applause)
Ha!
That's not what I was expecting at all.
I suspect that's a compliment, so, thank you.
I'm so thrilled you're here.
Bobby, sweetie.
- Good job.
- (Laughs)
I'm in heaven.
Chris, darling, this is Bobby Gilbert.
He does something important for something or other.
- I'm in steel.
- This is Chris Isherwood.
- Christopher.
- Hey, Chris.
Any day now, Bobby's going to whisk me off to Hollywood, aren't you?
- You bet.
- And I've told him all about you.
Oh.
Chris is absolutely my best friend.
He's the writer.
Oh!
Yeah.
Right.
Er...
Would I have read anything of yours, Chris?
Oh, no, but I've told him if he really sticks at it he could write something really great, like Noël Coward or something.
Couldn't you, darling?
(Train passes)
What's the matter, Christoph?
You don't like me tonight?
Hey, Christoph.
What's the matter?
I don't like being taken for an idiot.
You say you'll meet me then you don't turn up.
You take money off me and say you'll pay me back, but never do.
It's getting to the point where I can't believe anything you tell me.
Yes, I understand.
I understand.
Some of the girls I see, they're like that.
They say things and then let me down.
It makes me mad.
And when I see them, I always pay them, I never hit them, and still they let me down.
But you know, Christoph, some of them...they are so beautiful and they make me so happy and I just forget how mad I am.
You bastard!
(Train warning bell)
Your eyes, Christoph.
They shine so bright when you're hot for me.
(Groaning)
Oh, Caspar.
He gave me a cheap, gold-plated bracelet - probably an unwanted gift from some admirer - and fastened it around my wrist.
A love token, I fondly thought.
But then he disappeared.
I asked around, but no-one knew where he was.
I should have listened to Wystan.
Perhaps it was just a business transaction after all.
Zwei Minuten, meine Liebe.
- Must be simply marvellous to be a novelist.
- Why's that?
Because when people are utterly foul to you, you can sit down and write about them and tell the whole world how perfectly vile they are, and make simply pots of money out of it.
It hasn't quite worked out like that yet.
Darling, will you be an angel and light my ciggie?
Actually, I've been offered the chance to earn a bit extra.
Take it.
Writing letters from Berlin and doing the odd book review.
Darling, that's marvellous!
Let's have champagne.
It's for a magazine called Action.
- Oswald Mosley's rag.
- Oh, you know it, then?
Of course I know it.
I may wear green nail varnish, I'm not completely vacuous.
I meant to ask, why do you wear green nail varnish?
- Have you said yes?
- Not yet.
- Don't.
- It wouldn't be political.
Writing anything for that lot would be a statement of sorts
- even if it was for the cookery column.
- The money would come in handy.
- Christopher, you can't.
- But, Jean...
I wouldn't talk to you again and that's an end to it!
I was just testing the water.
I wasn't really going to write anything for them.
Honestly, I wasn't.
I'm one to talk.
Gosh, you know the things I've done for money.
But people here are so strange.
They have simply no idea.
And the Nazis are getting more and more of a foothold and they just seem to accept it.
I've even heard some people talk of a brighter future, as if all this ghastliness were a price worth paying.
They're going to get an awful shock unless they make a stand - which you and I must do.
We must not throw in the towel.
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- I don't really know.
(Cheering and applause)
MAN:
Aaargh!
(Thwacking, cries of pain)
- My god!
- Aaargh!
Morning, darlings.
- Aargh!
- God in heaven!
Oh!
Aaargh!
Oh, dear, I hope he won't do himself a mischief.
He ought to be more careful at his time of life.
Aaargh!
Ooh!
Oh, Bobby, darling.
You do that so well.
You must teach me one day how to catch it in my mouth.
You bet, honey.
(Jean laughs)
Thank you.
- To The Memorial.
- The Memorial.
Ja.
So do you think I'd enjoy your book, Chris?
Well, I'm not sure what son of books you like, Bobby?
- What do you think, hon?
- I haven't a clue, darling.
But I expect it's astoundingly brilliant.
And the point is it's published.
His second novel in print.
And he's even had a letter of congratulation from E M Forrester.
- Forster.
- Wow!
It won't be long now till our Chris is just as famous.
So, who's that guy in the wig?
BOTH:
Gerald.
Well, I could swear that Gerald was peeking through the keyhole while I was in the john.
When I came out he didn't know where to look.
I expect he knew exactly where to look.
Yeah.
Right.
Bobby.
Darling, I adore champagne.
We'll have it every day, won't we, once you whisk me off to Hollywood?
Sure thing.
(Giggles)
Bobby!
(Laughs)
Naughty Bobby!
(Thunder rumbles)
(Shouting and dog barking)
(Glass smashing)
(Angry shouting)
(Shouting continues)
Deutschland erwache!
(Shouting fades)
Excuse me.
Entschuldigung, bitte.
I was in the cafe and you were...
Do you remember?
No.
Well, why should you?
My name is Christopher.
Perhaps you'd like to go for ein Bier.
NO.
OK.
I'm sorry.
His name was Heinz.
He was innocent, vulnerable and uncritical.
A boy I could protect and cherish as my very own.
Jean thought ll was all frightfully jolly and decided I was at last doing my bit for the class struggle.
And as Heinz and I drew ever closer,
I had no hesitation in falling in love.
She needs to be in hospital, but there is no beds.
(Coughing)
Mum.
Gerald!
Come on out!
- I know you're in there.
- He's not here.
Where is he, then?
- Hamburg.
- Hamburg!
When he is back, tell him if I don't get what I want, he knows what to expect.
Don't you, Gerald?
(Thud)
Some people seem to be utterly lacking in consideration.
Tell me what it's about, Gerald.
It's a business transaction, that's all, that went slightly awry.
What son of business?
Do you know, Christopher, you're looking as joyous as the first day of spring.
Gerald!
I was offered a small fee to help someone get his hands on a police dossier.
Yes?
Actually, it was a positively glacial sum that would have paid off my debts at a stroke.
And do you know what?
The wretched man simply vanished.
Disparu.
Without paying me a single pfennig.
So who was that at the door?
A philistine, my dear.
Claiming interest on a little loan.
A loan for what?
Do keep up, dear boy.
For the money I needed to bribe the police to get the dossier.
What are on earth were you thinking of?
The trouble is everyone's so greedy nowadays.
And dishonest.
Simply can't trust a soul.
Gerald?
Yes?
Your wigs slipped.
Oh.
(Creaking)
- No!
(Groans) - (Thudding)
My dear Christopher, I've had to leave Berlin at very short' notice, which made it impossible for me to communicate with you.
Our friend at the door finally lost patience and matters got a little out of hand.
Try not to think too hardly of me, dear boy.
That would be more than I could bear.
As always, your affectionate...
Gerald.
- They give her bed at last.
- Ah, that's very good news, Frau Neddermayer.
She make dress to look nice in sanatorium.
Oh, I see.
Well, it would be...
- (Coughs)
- To see his Nazi friends.
(Inhales and exhales)
(Coughs)
The last Kaiser always mistrusted Berlin.
He saw it as a centre of- how do you say?
- dissidence.
Yes.
Good.
What with the leftist working class and the intellectual avant-garde...
I'm wondering if the working class is as leftist as one imagines.
It was not that long ago that we came close to a communist revolution.
But...they elected a strong leader.
This is where Adolf Hitler has been so very clever and exploited the situation.
Ever since the Treaty of Versailles and the Depression brought the country to its knees, with banks failing and savings disappearing, the poor and the unemployed see him as their saviour.
The Nazis organise everywhere.
In bars, in clubs, in schools, like a virus.
- I see.
- Ja.
Like a virus.
But...all of this I am sure that you know.
Or do you spend too much time at play?
Ha!
Berlin can be very distracting.
We must all stand by our own kind, Christopher.
Whatever the cost.

And then before my very eyes I saw him turn from prince to frog.
And I thought, "Did I really let that make love to me?"
Gerhardt.
This is my brother Gerhardt.
Gerhardt, it's a pleasure to meet you.
Won't you join us?
We're having the most perfect evening.
I think your brother is simply divine.
And he has cooked us a marvellous meal.
You are no longer welcome here, Herr Isherwood.
He doesn't mean it.
May I ask why?
Before our father went to the Western Front he said to me,
"Gerhardt, look out after your mother and your brother."
I've tried to honour his memory, but with no work and no money it's been difficult.
- I'm sure it has.
- Yes.
But now there is hope, Herr Isherwood.
- And Herr Hitler is the reason.
- Oh, for goodness' sake.
He understands men like me.
He wants to make us proud again, hold our heads up high again.
The communists had their chance.
The Nazis are the people's party.
This is your friends at night school talking.
Did he just call me a tan?
We do not want you here, Herr Isherwood.
- You and your kind.
- Oh, how frightfully rude.
Ja?
So take your pick, Heinz.
Make your father proud.
Or shame us all.
But, Gerhardt...
(Door opens and slams shut)
Honestly, how could we leave Heinz with that monster?
I'm sure he can stand up for himself.
We'll probably find him hacked into pieces at the bottom of a canal.
You didn't help, addressing Gerhardt like you were Queen Mary at an investiture.
And after the trouble he went to with the pig lung hash.
(Brown Shins taunting)
(Laughter)
(Taunting continues)
You bastards!
You bastards!
You brutes!
You filthy rotten brutes!
For God's sake!
Oh, you're just as bad, every one of you!
Poor darling, it's over now.
Can we get a taxi?
Can somebody please get a taxi?
Krankenhaus, ja?
Eine Bahre.
You know, you get used to it, that's the danger.
The uniforms and the raids.
The street fights.
Beatings.
We can't just stand by, can we?
No.
We can't, you know.
We really can't.

What a beautiful morning.
Even the sun seems to have come out for Herr Hitler.
Oh, Isherwood, the police have been round.

I cannot come, Christopher.
But of course you can.
No.
It is too dangerous.
- For you, for me.
- It's even more dangerous if you stay.
- For Gerhardt.
- Gerhardt?
He's one of them.
- For God's sake!
- He's my brother.
We're brothers too, Heinz, and more, much more besides.
- This is my country.
- Not at the moment it isn't.
It will be again one day.
I've no doubt.
But in the meantime...
You do not miss home.
I have no home.
This is home.
Wherever I am.
We should be where we belong.
We are where we belong.
Together we must stand.
Together we're responsible for each other as individuals.
Don't you see?
You have to come with me.
I want you to.
Now you do.
But in a week, a month...
I'll still want you, Heinz.
Heinz...
Of course I would.
(Woman yodels)
I'm sure I do not know, Herr Isherwood.
What makes you want to leave Berlin?
How can I best put this, Fräulein?
Adolf Hitler.
Ach, the Führer.
One day it's Brüning, then von Papen.
Next von Schleicher.
Then it's Hitler.
We must all make the best of it, Herr Isherwood.
I am staying.
Most Germans are staying.
And besides, where else would we go?
Well, this is your homeland, Fräulein.
I understand that.
But...
Heinz and I, we want to get out.
We want to... travel.
But why?
To go here, to go there.
What is the point?
Soon no-one will be left.
Herr Hamilton has gone.
Fräulein Ross.
Now you.
You get used to it.
You get used to anything.
(Speech over Tannoy in background)
(Ticking)
(Door shuts)
(Slowly) ls your room satisfactory?
Mummy, he's not retarded.
Where you sleep.
Is good?
Yes?
Yes, I sleep good.
Yes.
- Good.
- Thank you.
How long have you known Christopher?
- Mummy...
- Shush.
I know Christopher one year and one half.
Oh, that long?
And he's hardly mentioned you.
If at all.
- And how long are you staying in our country?
- Two weeks.
I'm sure Heinz can answer for himself.
Can't you, Heinz?
- Two weeks.
- You see.
What a shame it's not longer.
Two weeks is as long as his permit allows.
Then maybe another time.
What is that?
- Oh, now...
- Christopher...
That, Heinz, is Wyberslegh Hall.
Pan of the family estate.
It's in Cheshire, in the North of England.
I painted it as a matter of fact.
- You paint it?
- Yes.
- It's very good.
- Thank you, Heinz.
That is the house where I gave birth to Christopher.
- Yes?
- And very difficult it was too.
I was in labour for 18 hours.
18 hours!
Imagine that!
CHRISTOPHER:
Mummy, please.
Oh, dear, that was rather modern of me, wasn't it?
But it was worth it.
He was the most delightful baby.
Yes, I'm sure Heinz isn't remotely interested.
He had the loveliest skin and long slitty eyes, just like a Jap.
(She chuckles)
You see?
Of course he's interested.
You live in the past, Mummy.
Perhaps I do, Christopher.
Because it's always there and it never lets me down.
Do you have a mummy, Heinz?
She's dead.
Oh.
Oh, I am sorry.
Oh, dear.
Christopher's daddy's dead.
He was killed in the war.
He was my daddy too.
Yes, dear, but you hardly knew him.
He was killed by the Germans on the Western Front.
What are you thinking of, hm?
I'm not blaming Heinz, darling.
I'm simply filling him in.
Mm.
And for your information,
Heinz's daddy was also killed on the Western Front.
Well, there you are, you see.
That's what wars do.
Kill people.
Toast?
MOTHER:
He's a nice boy.
Well-mannered.
A street cleaner, you say?
There's no reason a street cleaner can't be well-mannered.
No, dear.
No reason at all.
How lovely to have a job like ordinary people.
But who'd have you, my darling?
You seem to be inept at pretty much everything.
Don't speak to him like that.
It's entirely your fault he is like he is.
- Like what?
- Richard, dear, we're talking.
(Sighs) It's terrible he has to go back.
And now Germany's withdrawn from the League of Nations.
Yes.
That is rather troubling.
I must think of a way of getting him out for good.
But why should that be your responsibility?
Surely he knows people who can help.
Well, he has absolutely no-one, Mummy, except for a brother who's disowned him.
And, besides, I want it to be my responsibility.
MOTHER:
So what will you do?
Get him another permit?
Or even another nationality.
Of course, you could always adopt him.
Darling, I don't think so.
(Chuckles)
Are you sure he wouldn't be happier in Germany?
It is his home, after all.
It's where he belongs.
And he isn't a Jew or anything.
You have no idea.
It's Nazi Germany we're talking about.
It's not just the Jews who are being victimised.
I do read the papers, darling.
I'm fully aware that the Nazis have done some bad things.
Although one hears that Herr Hitler's done some good things too.
Oh, dear God!
If it weren't for that wretched boy Auden dragging you off there.
I assure you, he didn't need to drag me.
But you must do as you wish, Christopher, as you always do.
So long as you realise what you might be taking on.
Right.
We're going to mail money to him in Berlin.
- We?
- So he can get on until he comes back here.
- And if you write a letter inviting him to stay...
- Christopher.
...then I'm sure they'll give him a much longer permit.
Maybe even for keeps.
- You can't do that!
- I think you'll find that I can.
But you haven't proved your case.
Mr Isherwood, your mother invites a foreign servant to her home without the requisite permit.
You then send the boy money telling him to claim it was a bequest, which can be construed as an attempt to deceive His Majesty's Immigration Service.
But then we have the letter that you wrote.
May I?
"I am counting the days until your arrival.
I've been so lonely without you."
It's a bit curious, don't you think?
The way it's written.
It's a bit...
What's the word?
- Queer.
- Thank you, Mr Auden.
What a boon to have a poet on hand.
- You can't send him back!
- Christopher.
No, no, God knows what they might do to him.
- Not my responsibility.
- An alien has no rights whatsoever in this democracy we're all so proud of that men have laid down their lives for.
And I hope, should the moment come, sir, you too will be willing to make the sacrifice.
I shall appeal.
You can write to the Home Secretary for all the good it'll do.
Come on.
As soon as I saw that rat, I knew we were done for.
- They're all the bloody same.
- No, my dear.
He's one of us.
Stands out a mile.
I'm sorry.
RICHARD:
You seem out of sons.
Do I?
It's Heinz, isn't it?
Goodbyes are always sad.
As sad as dying.
I'll be seeing him soon enough.
- That's right.
- Yeah.
No need to be sad.
I suppose, being a writer, you want to tidy everything up and make it make sense.
But things never do quite make sense, do they?
Not really.
No.
This Sally Bowles character, is she based on anyone?
Yes, in a manner of speaking.
What about Mr Norris?
Yes, I suppose he is too.
I thought we might first meet him on a train.
Oh, yes.
Trains are always good.
You can't go wrong with a train.
Where were we?
Full stop.
Close quotation marks.
Good.
It must be very polarising, this Nazi business.
- Hard to sit on the fence, I'd imagine.
- Yes, it is.
Berlin's fairly seething, what with all the poverty and wounded pride.
I'd say Communism was the best hope for peace.
Then why not stay here and join the Party?
I can't do that.
I have Heinz to consider.
Yes, Heinz.
Of course.
So where will you go?
Amsterdam, probably, for the time being.
That's all one can say, isn't it?
"For the time being."
It always breaks my heart a little to see you leave.
You should be used to it by now.
Oh, no.
I'll never get used to it.
And how awful if I did.
I'll be back.
I always am.
(Tapping of typewriter)
And so once again I cast of?
' from England and threw in my lot with Heinz.
Two lost souls wandering around Europe on the brink.
I have to admit, I felt a little guilty flitting from country to country to save a single man, whilst others were preparing to save the world.
But then our luck ran out and Heinz was arrested by the Gestapo.
And that...was that.
Daily Worker, ladies.
No appeasement.
Fight the Fascists.
- Excuse me, miss.
- I'm exercising my democratic right.
(Laughs)
Only you would choose to sell the Daily Worker in Knightsbridge.
I have no say in the matter.
I go where the Party tells me.
You are looking impossibly young.
- Aren't you ever going to age?
- I do hope not.
- My God, the varnish!
- (Jean laughs)
I somehow felt that red was more appropriate.
I must confess, I carry it with me everywhere.
Isn't it funny, darling?
You're the one that became famous.
And you know, I must say, I'm rather enjoying it.
And meanwhile, poor Heinz...
Well, I...
I dread to think what he's being subjected to.
A year labouring for the state followed by two years in the army.
It's frightfully harsh.
It could have been worse.
He might have got carted off to a concentration camp.
You did all you could.
I wonder if I did.
I wonder if I did really.
And what's worse, I even feel relieved.
Hm.
Do you ever miss Berlin?
Oh, no.
I never miss anything.
Sometimes I wonder if I shouldn't have had that kid.
I think I'd just about have out the mustard as a mother.
I'd tuck him in and I'd sing to him.
And then I'd go out and fuck filthy old men to pay for the brat.
(Laughs)
Then why not marry and have another?
Because I've lost my faith in men.
Well, that's a shame.
I've simply no use for them any more.
Not even you, darling.
Oh, well.
Back to the Revolution.
Might we see each other again?
Goodbye, Chris.
Goodbye.
Seems like everyone's caught Communism like flu.
It's fair to say that the closest we've come to solidarity with the workers is sleeping with them.
Well, that's a cause of sons.
The only cause you really care about, Christopher, is yourself.
Isn't that rather unkind?
Mm.
But you've turned it into an an form.
Rather successfully as it happens.
I used to be a little in love with you.
You knew that, didn't you?
Yes, I thought you did.
You're lucky.
You're not burdened by the concept of sin.
And it is a sin, Christopher.
Although I fully intend to carry on sinning.
Look, please, don't start on about God.
You're going to have such a conversion one of these days, my dear.
I do loathe the sea.
It's so wet.
And sloppy.
I don't belong here.
I'm not sure I belong anywhere.
I rather like being a foreigner.
I wonder where we might end up.
(Tapping of typewriter)
Wystan was right.
I've never known about anybody except me.
You see, I was never able to commit.
I only ever sort of added to the chorus.
And now, of course, politics are more and more about the individual.
The gay liberation movement seems to have taken me to its heart.
We very nice of them, really.
A cause at last.
But then I think it always was my cause.
And somehow, you know, it makes sense of what I was trying to do for Heinz.
All those years ago.
Christoph.
You write again about Berlin?
Yes.
For a British newspaper.
A lot has changed, ja?
What's left of it.
Ja, when the city was out in pieces and we end up in the Russian sector.
Rotten luck, eh?
We all hate the Russians, Christoph.
We would much rather be here in the Western...
Maybe one day.
My friend, Christoph, the famous writer.
I suppose you could say that.
Tell me, there are skyscrapers in America?
Oh, yes.
And you see Hollywood?
I live near there, actually.
And the Grand Canyon, you see that?
Yes.
It's um...very big.
And cowboys?
No, I haven't seen too many of them.
I feel guilty, Heinz.
All that I made you suffer.
I should never have taken you out of Germany.
But, Christoph, you changed my life.
What we had, what we did,
I would not miss for the world.
Look, Christoph, my wife Hilda.
Well, she looks very nice.
Yeah, she's a good girl.
And she doesn't ask questions.
That's all right, then.
And this is my son...
Christoph.
Christoph?
Ja.
Well, well.
You know, Christoph, you're not getting younger.
That's the way it tends to go.
You live alone, yes?
At the moment.
See, that is not good, to live alone.
You need a family around you to keep you company, to look after you when you are sick.
Heinz, I'm not decrepit.
But, listen, Christoph, we could be your family.
What?
Hilda, Christoph and...
I.
Out there in California.
Ah.
Well, I'm not so sure about that.
You see, the life I lead my...my plans are so uncertain.
Um...
I'd have to think it over.
Look, we'll see how it goes.
And I'll write to you.
We'll keep in touch.
You do understand, don't you, Heinz?
You do, don't you?
Yes, I...
I understand.
Fräulein!
On!
(Laughs)
When the city was divided, we got the Americans.
Oh, I'm so happy.
We're all so happy.
I thank God the Russians didn't get us.
Communism... (Scoffs)
Oh, Isherwood.
You look like a child.
It's lovely to see you, Fräulein.
Isherwood, Isherwood...
The last years of war here, Isherwood...
- Yes.
- Terrible.
We were in the cellar nearly all the time.
Holding each other.
We prayed so much, we got quite religious.
(Laughs)
(Sighs) Ah.
Is the yodeller still there?
No, thank God.
The Nazis shot her.
It's the one good thing they did.
(Both laugh)
Another survivor, eh, Fräulein?
Another survivor.
(Sighs) It was damaged a little.
But I mended it.
(Blows)
For you.
No.
I couldn't.
Take it, please.
And when you look at it, you will think of Berlin.
And Fräulein Thurau.
And smile.
(Ticking)
Thank you.
(Ticking continues)
{\cHFFFFFF}This programme contains {\cHFFFFFF}very strong language
{\cHFFFFFF}This programme contains scenes {\cHFFFFFF}of a sexual nature {\cHFFFFFF}and the book I'm now writing is {\cHFFFFFF}perhaps an attempt to set the {\cHFFFFFF}record as straight as possible.
so have had to rely {\cHFFFFFF}a good deal on memory.
{\cHFFFFFF}my friend Wystan Auden was there {\cHFFFFFF}and encouraged me to join him.
{\cHFFFFFF}I could also say I went because {\cHFFFFFF}of what was happening politically.
I went {\cHFFFFFF}because of the boys.
Berlin meant boys.
mein Liebling.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # One man has hands that are tender
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # One man has hands that are strong
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # If I should choose to surrender
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # My choices are bound to be wrong
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # I might find my ideal lover
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # If I search both far and wide... # that simply won't do.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} You're the very last {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} person who ought to go there.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Berlin isn't the right {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} place for you at all.
{\cHFFFFFF}What on Earth do you mean?
darling.
{\cHFFFFFF}Wystan Auden thinks it's {\cHFFFFFF}the most marvellous place.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Auden!
Such an untidy boy!
what {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} about medical school?
I am not {\cHFFFFFF}cut out for medical school.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} That's exactly what you {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} said about Cambridge!
you cannot {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} go through life shirking it.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} It's time you buckled to.
{\cHFFFFFF}I'm a published novelist!
as well?
you know?
{\cHFFFFFF}Any normal mother would be proud.
my sweetheart.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} You know I found your {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} novel most interesting.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} I thought it was ingenious the way {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} you used your antipathy towards me {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} to such creative effect.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} But you cannot expect life {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} to be one long holiday.
{\cHFFFFFF}I'm going there to get away from you.
like the Isle of Wight?
{\cHFFFFFF}Mother!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} #{\cH00FFFF} I don't know to whom I belong
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # It would be such {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} a shame to end up on my own
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # If I make myself true to one
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # How another will surely be sad {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} and alone you must do as you wish.
{\cHFFFFFF}I fully intend to. {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} just as I am bound {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} to get more lonely.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} When I think of what I went through {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} to bring you into this world!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Months and months of {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} feeling really quite seedy.
so be it. {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} that the Germans killed your father?
{\cHFFFFFF}MACHINE GUNS
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Take me with you.
{\cHFFFFFF}You have to stay {\cHFFFFFF}and look after Mummy.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} But for how long?
{\cHFFFFFF}I'm afraid I can't answer that.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # If I make myself true to one
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # How another {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} will surely be sad and alone
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # Should such a beauty {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} belong to one person?
the sun {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} and the stars
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # They belong to us all
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # I don't know
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # To whom I belong
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # I believe
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # I only belong to myself. #
{\cHFFFFFF}APPLAUSE{\cH00FFFF} {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Danke.
Vielen Dank.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} I was wondering... dear boy.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} I didn't mean to startle you.
no.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Could I trouble you for a light?
of course.
I suspect it... dear boy.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} It may have been...
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Would you mind if I...?
no.{\cHFFFF00} How kind!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} It may have been stolen.{\cHFFFFFF} Oh dear.
don't you find?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Are you going all the way?
{\cHFFFFFF}Excuse me?
{\cHFFFF00} To Berlin?
{\cHFFFFFF}Yes.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Holiday?
{\cHFFFFFF} I'm hoping for {\cHFFFFFF}a little more than that.
yes.
in certain respects.
{\cHFFFFFF}Do you live there?
{\cHFFFF00} For now.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} One never knows what {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} a new dawn may bring.
but do you have {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} accommodation in Berlin? {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} is desperate for a reliable lodger.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Her landlords are ruthless {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} and if they knew she didn't turf her out in an instant. {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} I do have a nose for these things.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} You might fit the bill perfectly.
but as I say... shall I?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Here's my card.{\cHFFFFFF} Mr Hamilton.
please.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} And who shall I tell her to expect?
{\cHFFFFFF}Isherwood.
{\cHFFFFFF}Christopher Isherwood.
{\cHFFFFFF}ANNOUNCEMENT ON TANNOY
{\cHFFFFFF}Wystan!
here you are.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Good trip?
thanks.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Those seats are devilish.
{\cHFFFFFF}I hardly noticed.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} then I'd show you the sights.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Best start as one means to go on.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} I decided the Brandenburg Gate {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} could wait.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} unless you want them to.
but it won't break the exchange rate is {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} still very much in our favour.
Pieps!
{\cH00FFFF} Hallo.
{\cHFFFFFF}IN GERMAN
{\cHFFFFFF}Guten Abend.{\cH00FFFF} Guten Abend.
Niedlich!
{\cHFFFFFF}What are you saying?
{\cHFFFFFF}What was that?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} We've been something of a feature.
maybe more of a B feature.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} I have no illusions of the {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} pitfalls of loving a whore.
{\cHFFFFFF}Are they all on the game?
yes.
You can't imagine {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} what a state the economy's in.
{\cHFFFFFF}They look very well on it.
they like to {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} keep themselves fit.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} and they're shamelessly vain.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} The fact that we find them {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} desirable only proves how {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} very masculine they are.
we"?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} They're nearly all rampant heters {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} and use our money to pay for cunt.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} they're frightfully good at it.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} What name does he go under?
{\cHFFFFFF}Caspar.
{\cHFFFFFF}That's about the only {\cHFFFFFF}thing I understood. {\cHFFFFFF}else I could get myself {\cHFFFFFF}into the most frightful fix.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Perhaps I better had.
will you {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} understand the answers?
{\cHFFFFFF}I might have found somewhere to stay.
yes?
{\cHFFFFFF} I got talking to this {\cHFFFFFF}man on the train.{\cHFFFF00} You little slut!
{\cHFFFFFF}apparently his landlady's {\cHFFFFFF}rather desperate for a lodger.
{\cHFFFFFF}Something about filling her quota.
I thought there'd be {\cHFFFFFF}no harm in checking it out.
you know.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} In fact I'd {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} very much like it if you did.
Wystan.
which I'm going well... {\cHFFFFFF}And you can't write {\cHFFFFFF}poetry with me buzzing about.
you're right.
this Caspar chappie?
yes.
I hope so.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} I have missed you.
Herr Issyvoo.
a writer!
What an honour!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} You can {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} write many famous novels here.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} this room was made for you!
Fraulein Thurau.
Herr Issyvoo!
you English men.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} There is an English {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} woman across the hall.
I was a lady.
I have {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} not always scrubbed the floors.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} that was the lodger before you.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} I don't know what he'd eaten {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} but it won't come out.
{\cHFFFFFF}THEY SPEAK GERMAN
darling.
I have {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} the most perfectly frightful head.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Who is it?
{\cHFFFFFF} Isherwood.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Who?
{\cHFFFFFF} Christopher Isherwood.
Christopher.
{\cHFFFFFF}We met on the train.
{\cHFFFFFF}I've taken the room.
Christopher!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} one has to be so careful nowadays.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Since my release from Brixton
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} I've rather lost touch with {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} the old country. {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} could I be regarded as a traitor {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} when I have rivers of Irish blood {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} simply coursing through my veins?
{\cHFFFFFF}So you're in business here?
dear boy.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Such alarming times we live in.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Ah!
Heinrich!
A young stevedore {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} I encountered in Hamburg.
{\cHFFFFFF}And what were you doing in Hamburg?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} What is one ever doing anywhere?
dear boy. {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} forever passing through.
I... that I have
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} never been able to relax sexually {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} with a member of my own class.
mm?
{\cHFFFFFF}I suppose.
dear boy.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Quite the place to let your hair {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} down with some eager young prole.
is it crooked?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} one must take a little care.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} and should the Nazis come to power {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} they'll stamp us out altogether.
{\cHFFFFFF}What's the current Communist line?
Lenin {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} said nothing about buggery.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Dearest Heinrich!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Smelt exactly like a fox.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Delicious!
Ludo?
do put something on!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} You'll frighten the horses.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} He's Polish.
{\cHFFFFFF}"He noticed I was staring at his {\cHFFFFFF}wig and asked if it was crooked.
{\cHFFFFFF}and he straightened it.
ja?
{\cHFFFFFF} Ja.
Spot on.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFFFF} GASPING
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Window.{\cHFFFFFF} Good.
{\cHFFFFFF}Good.
Ah.
{\cHFFFFFF}And this?
what is it?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Big fish?
this.
What is this?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Whale.
{\cHFFFFFF}No.
It's a clock.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Clock!
Ja!
good.
And that's a dolphin.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Was?
{\cHFFFFFF} Never mind.
{\cHFFFFFF}That...
Fraulein Schmidt?
what is that?
{\cHFFFFFF}SHE LAUGHS
{\cHFFFFFF}GASPING AND MOANING
Christoph!
Oh!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} This is how I'd like to die.
ja!
Herr Hamilton!
Fraulein Mayr.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Guten Morgen.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Danke.
{\cHFFFFFF}ROARING BEHIND DOOR
Fraulein Thurau.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} How sweet love must be!
yes?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Jawohl.
darling. {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} but you've been here simply {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} generations.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I thought we really must say hello.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Would you like coffee or tea?
{\cHFFFFFF}Well...{\cH00FFFF} I don't recommend the tea {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} much.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} but it tastes just like slops.
what do you do?
{\cHFFFFFF}People tend not to call me Chris.{\cH00FFFF} I'm {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} an actress.
Not at the moment.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I'm singing in a night club.
But {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} you absolutely must come and see me.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} What about tonight?
{\cHFFFFFF} I'm afraid {\cHFFFFFF}tonight's rather difficult.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Was that your boyfriend in {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} the hall or just a one off?
darling?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} getting on three months now. {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} but then she was whisked off {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} to Paris by a fat banker and {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} left me utterly stranded.
I don't care.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I can stand on my own two feet.
{\cHFFFFFF}But don't you mind being here alone?
duckie.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Surely you know that.
{\cHFFFFFF}How old are you?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I'm practically antique.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I'm nearly 21.
you know.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I got myself expelled from {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} school by saying I was pregnant.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} There was the most terrible to {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} do when they found out I wasn't.
{\cHFFFFFF}I got myself sent down {\cHFFFFFF}from Cambridge.{\cH00FFFF} I say!
{\cHFFFFFF}Flunked my Tripos.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} What a hoot! {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} but he'll have to wait.
they're {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} like camel hair or something.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} It's the sort of thing {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} John The Baptist might wear. doesn't one?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Guten Tag!
{\cHFFFFFF}Really!
darling?
{\cHFFFFFF}but actually I'm a novelist.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} A novelist!
How perfectly {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} marvellous!
Are you published?
yes.
I haven't yet {\cHFFFFFF}found a publisher for the second.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Has it sold simply thousands?
actually.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} The one you write about me {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} shall sell by the million.
darling.
woman of mystery!
{\cHFFFFFF}I'm not sure you're that mysterious.
I think we're {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} going to get along famously.
won't you darling?
{\cHFFFFFF}Maybe.
sweetie.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} This whole thing is about {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} to collapse around our ears.
darling!
damn!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I suppose I'd better {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} meet the old goat.
but I don't {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} believe him for a second.
darling?
could you be an angel and {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} lend me 10 marks?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I haven't got a bean for the taxi. {\cHFFFFFF}"the sort of thing John The {\cHFFFFFF}Baptist might wear.
{\cHFFFFFF}You're very quiet.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} A touch of sunstroke. {\cHFFFFFF}and it's all thanks to you.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} I doubt your mother {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} sees it quite like that.
don't you think?
{\cHFFFFFF}Caspar!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} have you come to Berlin {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} to sample the culture?
I'm rather anti-culture.
not in that way.
{\cHFFFFFF}It's just that I'm rather put off {\cHFFFFFF}by culture worshippers.
{\cHFFFFFF}I find them somewhat {\cHFFFFFF}precious and prone to gushing.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Do you find me somewhat precious {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} and prone to gushing?
{\cHFFFFFF}but the danger is that one {\cHFFFFFF}can use culture worship
{\cHFFFFFF}as a substitute for engaging {\cHFFFFFF}with the messy business of living.
that you are a writer {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} but do not like culture.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} It is my belief that culture {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} raises us from the beasts.
why you have {\cHFFFFFF}employed me to teach you English.
{\cHFFFFFF}You seem to speak it perfectly well.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} One has to...
How do you say?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} ..keep in practice.
{\cHFFFFFF}Good.
What exactly is it that you do?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} I am a shopkeeper.
{\cHFFFFFF}A shopkeeper?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} That is precisely what I am.
{\cHFFFFFF}As in Landauer's Department Store?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Yes.
{\cHFFFFFF}That's where I buy my socks.
no.
{\cHFFFFFF}I'm not really a joiner.
I seem to {\cHFFFFFF}be constitutionally incapable of {\cHFFFFFF}bringing myself to the required... {\cHFFFFFF}pitch of enthusiasm.
of course.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} We can no longer afford {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} the luxury of sympathy.
{\cHFFFFFF}I rather suspect I'm best equipped {\cHFFFFFF}to observe and record.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} That will not be an option.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} we must take to the streets.
Herr Isherwood.
even when {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} the Storm Troopers start firing.
{\cHFFFFFF}I'm not sure I'd hack {\cHFFFFFF}it as a street fighter.
but are you not then {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} as guilty as your detested {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} culture worshippers
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} for refusing to engage {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} with the whole messy business?
we should {\cHFFFFFF}all play to our strengths.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Perhaps we will practise {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} the irregular verbs?
huh?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} It's like silk.
you be like me {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} and Johnny Weissmuller.
{\cHFFFFFF}I'm not so sure about that.
ja?
{\cHFFFFFF}No!
No!
Caspar!
{\cHFFFFFF}Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
ja?
{\cHFFFFFF} Nein!
{\cH00FF00} Ja?
{\cHFFFFFF}Nein!
Ja!
Ja!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Christoph?
{\cHFFFFFF}Yes?
{\cH00FF00} You got 10 marks?
{\cHFFFFFF}Yes.
{\cHFFFFFF}YODELLING ja?
{\cHFFFFFF}Of course you will.
dear! {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} that we are both normal.
{\cHFFFFFF}Aren't boys marvellous?
{\cHFFFFFF}their smell and the way they move.
{\cHFFFFFF}And they can be so... {\cHFFFFFF}whereas girls...
I'm glad I'm like I am.
{\cHFFFFFF}Thank God for public school!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} intimacy's just business to them.
{\cHFFFFFF}So you think if I {\cHFFFFFF}stopped giving him money...?
{\cHFFFFFF}it's more than just business.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} They're desperate for cash {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} and they'll do anything for it.
{\cHFFFFFF}But what he says to me...{\cHFFFF00} He'll {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} tell you anything you want to hear.
what do I know about romance?
not {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} a fucking journalist.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} I've booked my ticket {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} back to England.{\cHFFFFFF} Already?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Father's allowance has dried up {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} and I really must get this {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} fissure in my rectum seen to.
{\cHFFFFFF}I hope that wasn't me.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} you mustn't flatter yourself.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # Can't imagine why I {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} chose to leave him
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # How could I have been so cruel?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # After all {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} he loved me without question
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # Still I left him like a fool
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # If I woke him late {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} at night complaining
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # "I'm on my last cigarette
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # He'd say "I'll be {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} over in a minute please don't get upset
Peter... #
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Gute Nacht.{\cHFFFFFF} Gute Nacht.
darling.
hon!
this is Bobby Gilbert.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} He does something frantically {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} important in something or other.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} I'm in steel.
Chris.
darling?
{\cHFFFF00} You bet!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} And I've told him all about you.{\cHFFFF00} Oh?
right!
Chris? {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} he could write something {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} really great like {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Noel Coward or something.
darling?
Christoph?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} You don't like me tonight?
Christoph?
What's the matter?
that's what's the matter.
{\cHFFFFFF}then don't turn up.
but never do.
{\cHFFFFFF}It's getting to the point where I {\cHFFFFFF}can't believe anything you tell me.
I understand.
I understand.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} they are like that.
and that makes me mad.
I always {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} pay them and never hit them {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} and still they let me down! {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} and they make me so happy {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} and I just forget how mad I am.
{\cHFFFFFF}You bastard!
Christoph.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} They shine so bright {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} when you're hot for me.
Caspar.
He gave {\cHFFFFFF}me a cheap gold-plated bracelet.
{\cHFFFFFF}Probably an unwanted {\cHFFFFFF}gift from some admirer.
{\cHFFFFFF}He fastened it around my wrist. {\cHFFFFFF}but then he disappeared.
but no-one {\cHFFFFFF}knew where he was.
{\cHFFFFFF}I should've listened to Wystan.
{\cHFFFFFF}Perhaps it was just a {\cHFFFFFF}business transaction after all.
meine Liebe.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} It must be simply marvellous {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} to be a novelist.{\cHFFFFFF} Why's that?
you can sit {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} down and write about them
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} and tell the world how perfectly {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} vile they are and make simply {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} pots of money out of it.
{\cHFFFFFF}It hasn't quite worked out {\cHFFFFFF}like that yet.
be an angel {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} and light my ciggie.
I've been offered the {\cHFFFFFF}chance to earn a bit extra.{\cH00FFFF} Take it.
{\cHFFFFFF}Writing the occasional letter from {\cHFFFFFF}Berlin and doing the odd book review.
that's marvellous!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Let's have champagne!
{\cHFFFFFF}It's for a magazine called Action.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Oswald Mosley's rag?
you know it then?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Of course I know it.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} but I'm not completely vacuous.
{\cHFFFFFF}Why DO you wear green nail varnish?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Have you said yes?
{\cHFFFFFF} Not yet.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} You won't.{\cHFFFFFF} I wouldn't write {\cHFFFFFF}anything political.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} even if it was the cookery column.
you can't!
Jean...{\cH00FFFF} I wouldn't talk to you {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} again and that's an end to it.
{\cHFFFFFF}I was just testing the water.
{\cHFFFFFF}I wasn't really going to {\cHFFFFFF}write anything for them.
I wasn't.
you know {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} the things I've done for money.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} People here are so strange.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} and the Nazis are getting
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} more and more of a foothold {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} and they just seem to accept it.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I've even heard some {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} talk of a brighter future
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} as if all this ghastliness {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} were a price worth paying. {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Which you and I must do.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} We must not throw in the towel.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Why are you looking at me like that?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFFFF} I don't really know.
CRIES OF PAIN
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Mein Gott!
darlings.{\cH00FF00} Gott im Himmel!
{\cHFFFFFF}HE CRIES OUT dear!
I do hope he {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} won't do himself a mischief.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} He ought to be more careful {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} at his time of life.
{\cHFFFFFF}HE CRIES OUT
Bobby darling!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} You do that so well.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} You must teach me one day {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} how to catch it in my mouth.
honey.
{\cHFFFFFF}Thank you.{\cH00FFFF} To The Memorial.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFFFF} The Memorial.
Chris?
hon?
but I {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} expect it's astoundingly brilliant! {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} and he's even had a {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} letter of congratulation {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} from EM Forester.{\cHFFFFFF} Forster.{\cHFFFF00} Wow!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} It won't be long till our {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Chris is just as famous.
who's that guy in the wig?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFFFF} BOTH:
Gerald.
I could swear that Gerald {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} was peeking through the keyhole {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} while I was in the john.
he didn't know {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} where to look.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I expect he knew {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} exactly where to look.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Yeah.
Right.
darling.
I adore champagne.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} once you' whisk me off to Hollywood?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Sure thing.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Bobby!
Naughty Bobby!
{\cHFFFFFF}SHOUTING
{\cHFFFFFF}GLASS SMASHES
{\cHFFFFFF}Excuse me.
bitte.
{\cHFFFFFF}I was in a cafe and you were...
{\cHFFFFFF}Do you remember?
why should you?
{\cHFFFFFF}Mein Name ist Christopher.
{\cHFFFFFF}Perhaps you'd like {\cHFFFFFF}to go for ein Bier?
{\cHFFFFFF}No.
OK.
{\cHFFFFFF}I'm sorry.
{\cHFFFFFF}vulnerable and uncritical.
{\cHFFFFFF}A boy I could protect and {\cHFFFFFF}cherish as my very own.
{\cHFFFFFF}Jean thought it was all frightfully {\cHFFFFFF}jolly and decided I was at last doing {\cHFFFFFF}my bit for the class struggle. {\cHFFFFFF}I had no hesitation {\cHFFFFFF}in falling in love.
{\cHFFFFFF}SHE COUGHS
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} but there is no bed.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Mutti...
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFFFF} SHE COUGHS
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Gerald!
Come on out.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I know you are in there!
then?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFFFF} Hamburg.{\cH00FFFF} Hamburg?
!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} he knows what to expect.
Gerald?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Some people seem to be utterly {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} lacking in consideration.
Gerald.
that went slightly awry.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFFFF} What sort of business?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} you're looking as joyous {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} as the first day of spring.
{\cHFFFFFF}Gerald!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} I was offered a small fee {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} to help someone get his {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} hands on a police dossier.
{\cHFFFFFF}Yes? {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} and do you know what?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} The wretched man simply vanished.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Disparu without paying {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} me a single pfennig.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFFFF} So who was that at the door?
my dear.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Claiming interest on a little loan.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} dear boy!
For the money I needed to {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} bribe the police to get the dossier.
{\cHFFFFFF}What on earth were you thinking of?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} The trouble is everyone's so {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} greedy nowadays.
And dishonest.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Simply can't trust a soul.
{\cHFFFFFF}Gerald.{\cHFFFF00} Yes?
{\cHFFFFFF}Your wig's slipped.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Oh!
{\cHFFFFFF}DOOR CREAKS
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} No!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFFFF} THUMP
I've had {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} to leave Berlin at very short notice
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} 'which made it impossible {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} for me to communicate with you.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} 'Our friend at the door finally {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} lost patience and matters {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} got a little out of hand.
dear boy.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} 'That would be more {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} than I could bear.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} your affectionate Gerald.'
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} They give her bed at last.
Frau Neddermayer.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} She make dress to look {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} nice in sanatorium.
um...
{\cHFFFFFF}SHE COUGHS
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} To see his Nazi friends.
{\cHFFFFFF}SHE BREATHES DEEPLY
{\cHFFFFFF}SHE COUGHS
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} The last Kaiser {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} always mistrusted Berlin.
dissidence?
{\cHFFFFFF}Yes.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} What with the leftist working class {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} and the intellectual avant garde.
{\cHFFFFFF}I'm wondering if the working {\cHFFFFFF}class is as leftist as one imagines. {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} but they lacked a strong leader.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} This is where Adolf Hitler
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} has been so very clever {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} and exploited the situation.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Ever since the Treaty of Versaille
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} and then the Depression brought {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} the country to its knees the poor and {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} unemployed see him as their saviour.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} And the Nazis organise everywhere -
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} in bars and clubs {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} and schools like a virus.
{\cHFFFFFF}I see.{\cHFFFF00} Ja.
Like a virus.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} But I am sure {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} that all this you know.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Or do you spend {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} too much time at play?
{\cHFFFFFF}Berlin can be very distracting.
Christopher.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Whatever the cost.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # I can't give you {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} anything but love
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # Baby
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # That's the only {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} thing I've plenty of
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # Baby
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # Dream a while
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # Scheme a while
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # We're sure to find
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # Happiness
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # And I guess
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # All those things {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} you've always pined for... #
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} # I can't give you {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} anything but love
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} # Baby!
# bravo!
{\cH00FFFF} Did your mother {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} teach you to cook?
{\cH00FF00} Ja.
{\cHFFFFFF}she is at the sanitorium.
I did say.
what exactly is this?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Pig.
pork!
How lovely!
er... {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Pork rib?
Delicious!
{\cHFFFFFF}I think he means lung.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Ja!
Schweinelunge!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Oh.
Golly.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} And then before my very {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} eyes I saw him turn from
Did {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I really let that make love to me?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} This is my brother Gerhardt.
it's a {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} pleasure to meet you.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Won't you join us?
We're having {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} the most perfect evening.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I think your brother {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} is simply divine and he's {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} cooked us a marvellous meal.
Herr Isherwood.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} He doesn't mean it.
{\cHFFFFFF}May I ask why? look out for your {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} mother and your brother.
it's been difficult. {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} and Herr Hitler is the reason.
for goodness sake!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} He understands men like me. they had their chance.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} The Nazis are the people's {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} party now.{\cH00FF00} This is your friends
Gerhardt.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Did he just call me a tart?
Herr Isherwood.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} You and your kind.
how frightfully rude!
Heinz.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Make your father proud...
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} ..or shame us all.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} But Gerhardt... how you can {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} leave poor Heinz with that monster?
{\cHFFFFFF}I'm sure he can stand up for himself!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} We'll probably find him hacked {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} into little pieces at {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} the bottom of a canal.
{\cHFFFFFF}And you didn't help matters {\cHFFFFFF}addressing Gerhardt like you were {\cHFFFFFF}Queen Mary at an investiture.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} And after all the trouble he {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} went to with that pig lung hash.
Jean!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Brutes!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Filthy rotten brutes!
{\cHFFFFFF}Shut up!
For God's sake!
darling... {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} It's over now.
Can we get a taxi?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Can somebody please get a taxi!
ja? {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} that's the danger. {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} the street-fights {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} and the beatings... can we?
{\cHFFFFFF}No.
you know.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} We really can't.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Gerhardt... that we don't make love?
there's {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} nothing else to do.
{\cHFFFFFF}We could go to the movies.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I haven't got two {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} pfennigs to rub together.
{\cHFFFFFF}Jean?
what is it?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Hollywood's off.
I'm so sorry.
I have to {\cHFFFFFF}go back to the States.
{\cHFFFFFF}"Some emergency at HQ.
wasn't it?
{\cHFFFFFF}"Bobby.
{\cHFFFFFF}What a complete bastard.
{\cHFFFFFF}Typical bloody American.
{\cHFFFFFF}Flaky as hell!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} You fancied him rotten!
{\cHFFFFFF}That's beside the point.
Come here.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} And he was a most marvellous lover.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} He was the best...
Jean.
Poor darling... {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} He did leave me a little something.
{\cHFFFFFF}So he bloody should!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} But I shan't be keeping it.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # Men say that they can be faithful
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # Simply I smile to myself
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # New love is always so novel
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # Faithfulness is but pretence
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # Now it is all but forgotten
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # But yesterday I still possessed
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # Love affords time that is blissful
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # Loyalty still makes no sense
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # I don't know to whom I belong
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # It would be such {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} a shame to end up on my own
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # If I make myself true to one
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # How another will surely {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} be sad and alone
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # Should such a beauty {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} belong to one person
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # No surely {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} the sun and the stars
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # They belong to us all
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # I don't know to whom I belong
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # I believe
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # I only
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} # belong to myself. # {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} and so it will always be.
Herr Issyvoo.
Fraulein Thurau.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} What a beautiful morning!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Even the sun seems to have {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} come out for Herr Hitler.
Herr Issyvoo?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} The police have been round.
{\cHFFFFFF}The police?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} They were asking about my lodgers.
{\cHFFFFFF}What did they want to know?
they said.
{\cHFFFFFF}RECORDING OF HITLER PLAYS
un Moment.{\cHFFFFFF} Caspar!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} that this is a Jewish store
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} and that there is now an {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} official anti-Jewish boycott.
{\cHFFFFFF}Where have you been?
I've been {\cHFFFFFF}looking everywhere for you.
{\cHFFFFFF}You disappeared.
{\cHFFFFFF}I didn't know what had happened.
{\cHFFFFFF}Caspar!
{\cHFFFFFF}I need to buy a pair of socks.
{\cHFFFFFF}Shame!
{\cHFFFFFF}Shame!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Beruf?
{\cHFFFFFF}"Street-sweeper"?
No.
Maybe... or... why not? "Domestic servant".
Christoph.
{\cHFFFFFF}But of course you can.
for me... {\cHFFFFFF}It's even more dangerous if you stay.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} For Gerhardt.{\cHFFFFFF} Gerhardt?
for God's sake! much more besides!
it isn't.
but in the meantime... {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} You do not miss home?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFFFF} I have no home.
This is home... {\cHFFFFFF}wherever I am.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} We should be where we belong.
{\cHFFFFFF}We are where we belong - together.
{\cHFFFFFF}We must stand together.
{\cHFFFFFF}as individuals.
Don't you see?
{\cHFFFFFF}You have to come with me.
{\cHFFFFFF}I want you to.
but in a week?
A month?
{\cHFFFFFF}I'll still want you Heinz.
{\cHFFFFFF}Heinz.
Of course I will.
{\cHFFFFFF}YODELLING {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} what makes you want to leave Berlin.
Fraulein?
{\cHFFFFFF}Adolf Hitler.
the Fuhrer! {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} then it's Hitler.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Herr Issyvoo.
I am staying.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Most Germans are staying.
where else would we go?
{\cHFFFFFF}Fraulein.
I understand that.
we want to get out.
{\cHFFFFFF}We want to...
Travel.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} But why?
To go here?
To go there?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} What is the point?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Soon no-one will be left. {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} now you... {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} You get used to it.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} You get used to anything.
{\cHFFFFFF}CLOCK TICKS
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Is your room...satisfactory?
he's not retarded.
yes?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Yes.
I sleep good.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Yes.
Good.{\cHFFFF00} Thank you.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} How long have you known Christopher?
{\cHFFFFFF}Mummy...{\cH00FF00} Shush!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} I know Christopher {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} one year and one half.
if at all.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} And how long are you staying {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} in our country?
{\cHFFFFFF} Two weeks.
Heinz?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Two weeks.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} You see?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} What a shame it's not longer.
{\cHFFFFFF}Two weeks is as long {\cHFFFFFF}as his permit allows.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Then maybe another time.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} What is that?
now...{\cH00FF00} Christopher! {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} part of the family estate.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} It's in Cheshire {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} in the north of England.
as a matter of fact.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} You paint it?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Yes.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} It's very good.
Heinz.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} That is the house where {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} I gave birth to Christopher.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Yes?
{\cH00FF00} And very difficult it was too.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} I was in labour for 18 hours.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} 18 hours!
Imagine that!
please!
wasn't it?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} But it was worth it.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} He was the most delightful baby.
{\cHFFFFFF}I'm sure Heinz isn't {\cHFFFFFF}remotely interested.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} He had the loveliest skin {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} and long slitty eyes... {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} just like a Jap.
of course he's interested.
Mummy.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} because it's always there {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} and never lets me down.
Heinz?
{\cHFFFFFF}She's dead.{\cH00FF00} Oh.
dear.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Christopher's daddy's dead.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} He was killed in the war.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} He was my daddy too.
but you hardly knew him.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} He was killed by the Germans.
darling.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} I'm simply filling him in.
{\cHFFFFFF}Heinz's daddy was also {\cHFFFFFF}killed on the Western Front.
you see.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} That's what wars do - kill people.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Toast?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} He's a nice boy.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Well-mannered.
you say?
{\cHFFFFFF}There's no reason a street-cleaner {\cHFFFFFF}can't be well-mannered.
dear.
No reason at all.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} How lovely to have a job like {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} ordinary people.
my darling?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} You seem to be inept at pretty much {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} everything.{\cHFFFFFF} Don't speak to him {\cHFFFFFF}like that!
{\cHFFFFFF}It's entirely your fault {\cHFFFFFF}he's like he is.{\cH00FFFF} Like what?
we're talking.
{\cHFFFFFF}and now Germany's withdrawn {\cHFFFFFF}from the League Of Nations.
that is rather troubling.
{\cHFFFFFF}I must think of a way of {\cHFFFFFF}getting him out for good.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} But why should that {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} be your responsibility?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Surely he knows people who can help.
I want it to be my {\cHFFFFFF}responsibility.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} So what will you do?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Get him another permit?
{\cHFFFFFF}Or even another nationality.
{\cHFFFFFF}you could always adopt him.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Darling!
I don't think so!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Are you sure he wouldn't {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} be happier in Germany?
after all.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} It's where he belongs.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} And he isn't a Jew or anything.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFFFF} You've no idea.
It's Nazi Germany {\cHFFFFFF}we're talking about.
{\cHFFFFFF}It's not just the Jews who {\cHFFFFFF}are being victimised.
darling.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} I'm fully aware that the {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Nazis have done some bad things.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Although one hears that Herr {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Hitler's done some good things too.
{\cHFFFFFF}Dear God!
dragging you off there... he {\cHFFFFFF}didn't need to drag me.
as you always do... {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} so long as you realise {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} what you might be taking on.
{\cHFFFFFF}Right.
We're going to have to {\cHFFFFFF}mail money to him in Berlin...{\cH00FF00} "We"?
and if you write {\cHFFFFFF}a letter inviting him to stay... maybe even for keeps.
{\cHFFFFFF}You can't do that!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} You'll find that I can. {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} but then {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} we have the letter you wrote.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} May I?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} "I am counting the days {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} until your arrival.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} "I've been so lonely without you.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} the way it's written?
A bit... {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} what's the word?
{\cHFFFF00} Queer?
Mr Auden.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} What a boon to have a poet on hand!
{\cHFFFFFF}You can't send him back!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Christopher...{\cHFFFFFF} No!
{\cHFFFFFF}God knows what they might do!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Not my responsibility.
{\cHFFFFFF}So an alien has no rights {\cHFFFFFF}whatsoever in this democracy
{\cHFFFFFF}that men have laid down {\cHFFFFFF}their lives for.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} that you too will be ready {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} to make the sacrifice.
I shall appeal!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} You can write to the Home Secretary {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} for all the good it will do.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Come on.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} I knew we were done for.
he's one of us.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} It stands out a mile.
{\cHFFFFFF}I'm sorry.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} You seem out of sorts.
{\cHFFFFFF}Do I?
isn't it?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Goodbyes are always sad.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} As sad as dying.
{\cHFFFFFF}I'll be seeing him soon enough.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} That's right.{\cHFFFFFF} Yeah.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} No need to be sad.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} you want to tidy everything up {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} and make it make sense.
do they?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Not really.
{\cHFFFFFF}No.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} This Sally Bowles character... {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} is she based on anyone?
in a manner of speaking.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} And what about Mr Norris?
I suppose he is too.
I thought {\cHFFFFFF}we might first meet him on a train.
yes.
Trains are always good.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} You can't go wrong with a train.
{\cHFFFFFF}Where were we?
close quotation marks.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} this Nazi business.
it is.
what with {\cHFFFFFF}all the poverty and wounded pride.
{\cHFFFFFF}I'd say communism was {\cHFFFFFF}the best hope for peace.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Then why not stay here {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} and join the Party?
{\cHFFFFFF}I can't do that!
{\cHFFFFFF}I have Heinz to consider.
Heinz.
Of course.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} So where will you go?
probably.
{\cHFFFFFF}For the time being.
isn't it?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} "For the time being.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} It always breaks my heart {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} a little to see you leave.
{\cHFFFFFF}You should be used to it by now.
I'll never get used to it... {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} ..
And how awful if I did.
{\cHFFFFFF}I'll be back.
{\cHFFFFFF}I always am.
{\cHFFFFFF}'And so once again I cast off {\cHFFFFFF}from England and threw {\cHFFFFFF}in my lot with Heinz.
{\cHFFFFFF}'Two lost souls wandering {\cHFFFFFF}around Europe on the brink... {\cHFFFFFF}'whilst others were {\cHFFFFFF}preparing to save the world. {\cHFFFFFF}'and that was that.'
ladies?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} No appeasement!
Fight the fascists!
Miss... {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I'm exercising my democratic right!
{\cHFFFFFF}Only you would choose to sell {\cHFFFFFF}The Daily Worker in Knightsbridge.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I have no say in the matter.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I go where the Party tells me.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} You're looking impossibly young.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Are you ever going to age?
{\cHFFFFFF}I do hope not.
My God!
The varnish!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I somehow felt that red {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} was more appropriate.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I must confess {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I carry it with me everywhere.
that {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} you're the one that became famous? {\cHFFFFFF}and meanwhile poor Heinz... {\cHFFFFFF}Well...
I dread to think {\cHFFFFFF}what he's being subjected to.
{\cHFFFFFF}A year labouring for the state {\cHFFFFFF}followed by two years in the army.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} It's frightfully harsh.
{\cHFFFFFF}It could be worse - {\cHFFFFFF}he might have got carted {\cHFFFFFF}off to a concentration camp.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} You did all you could.
really?
{\cHFFFFFF}I even feel relieved.
{\cHFFFFFF}Hmm.
no.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I never miss anything.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Sometimes I wonder if I {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} shouldn't have had that kid.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I think I'd just about have {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} cut the mustard as a mother.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} and I'd sing to him.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} And then I'd go out and fuck {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} filthy old men to pay for the brat!
{\cHFFFFFF}Then why not marry and have another?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Because I've lost my faith in men.
that's a shame.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I have simply no use {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} for them any more.
darling. {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} back to the revolution.
{\cHFFFFFF}Might we see each other again?
Chris.
{\cHFFFFFF}Goodbye.
{\cHFFFFFF}'It seems everyone's caught {\cHFFFFFF}communism like flu.'
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} I think it's fair to say that the {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} closest we've come to solidarity
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} with the workers is {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} sleeping with them.
that's a cause of sorts.
is yourself.
{\cHFFFFFF}Isn't that rather unkind?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Hmm.
But you've turned {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} it into an art form - as it happens.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} I used to be a little {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} in love with you.
didn't you?
I thought you did.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} You're lucky - you're not {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} burdened by the concept of sin.
Christopher... {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} although I fully intend {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} to carry on sinning.
don't start on about God!
my dear.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} I do loathe the sea.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} It's so wet and sloppy.
{\cHFFFFFF}I don't belong here.
{\cHFFFFFF}I'm not sure I belong anywhere.
{\cHFFFFFF}I rather like being a foreigner.
{\cHFFFFFF}I wonder where we might end up?
{\cHFFFFFF}'Wystan was right. {\cHFFFFFF}'I was never able to commit
- I only {\cHFFFFFF}ever sort of added to the chorus.
politics are {\cHFFFFFF}more and more about the individual.
{\cHFFFFFF}'The gay liberation movement seems to {\cHFFFFFF}have taken me to its heart.
really.
{\cHFFFFFF}'A cause at last!
you know... {\cHFFFFFF}'it makes sense of {\cHFFFFFF}what I was trying to do for Heinz.
{\cHFFFFFF}'All those years ago...'
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Christoph?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} You write again about Berlin?
for a British newspaper.
ja?
{\cHFFFFFF}What's left of it.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} we end up in the Russian sector.
eh?
Christoph.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} We would much rather be here {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} in the West Zone.
{\cHFFFFFF}Maybe one day.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} the famous writer.
{\cHFFFFFF}I suppose you could say that.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} there are skyscrapers in America?
yes.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} And you see Hollywood?
actually.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} And the Grand Canyon?
You see that?
{\cHFFFFFF}Yes.
It's... {\cHFFFFFF}very big.
I haven't seen too many of them.
Heinz.
{\cHFFFFFF}All that I made you suffer.
I should {\cHFFFFFF}never have taken you out of Germany.
you change my life. {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} I would not miss for the world.
Christoph...
Hilde.
she looks... {\cHFFFFFF}very nice!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} She's a good girl.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} And she doesn't ask questions.
{\cHFFFFFF}That's all right then.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} And this is my son...
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} ..
Christoph.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFFFF} Christoph?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Ja.
{\cHFFFFFF}Well.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} you are not getting younger.
{\cHFFFFFF}That's the way it tends to go.
yes?
{\cHFFFFFF}At the moment.
to live alone.
to {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} look after you when you are sick.
I'm not decrepit!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} we could be your family.{\cHFFFFFF} What?
Christoph and I.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Out there in...
California.
well...
I'm not so sure about that.
the life I lead... my plans are so uncertain.
we'll see.
See how it goes.
{\cHFFFFFF}we'll keep in touch.
Heinz?
{\cHFFFFFF}You do...don't you?
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Yes.
I...
I understand.
{\cHFFFFFF}Fraulein!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Ho-ho-ho-ho!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Oh!
I am so happy!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} We are all so happy!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} I thank God the Russians {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} didn't get us.
Communism!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} you look like a child!
Fraulein.
Herr Issyvoo!
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} Herr Issyvoo!
{\cHFFFFFF} Yes.{\cHFFFF00} It was terrible.
holding each other.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} we got quite religious!
{\cHFFFFFF}Ah!
Is the yodeller still there?
thank God!
The Nazis shot her.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} It's the one good thing they did!
Fraulein?
{\cHFFFFFF}Another survivor. {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} but I mended it.
{\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} For you.
I couldn't. {\cHFFFFFF}{\cHFFFF00} and smile.
{\cHFFFFFF}Thank you.

It's 40 years since I first wrote about my time in Berlin, and the book I'm now writing is perhaps an attempt to set the record as straight.
Well, as straight it's possible to be.
I destroyed my Berlin diaries, you see, so have had to rely a good deal on memory.
As to why I went in the first place, my friend Wystan Auden was there and encouraged me to join him.
I could also say I went because of what was happening politically.
But, in fact, I went because of the boys.
To me, Berlin meant boys.
Danke schon, mein Liebling.
# One man has hands that are tender
# One man has hands that are strong
# If I should choose to surrender
# My choices are bound to be wrong
# I might find my ideal lover
# If I search both far and wide... #
But, my dear, that simply won't do.
You're the very last person who ought to go there.
Berlin isn't the right place for you at all.
What on Earth do you mean?
It's German, darling.
Wystan Auden thinks it's the most marvellous place.
Auden!
Such an untidy boy!
And, besides, what about medical school?
But, Mummy, I am not cut out for medical school.
That's exactly what you said about Cambridge!
Really, Christopher, you cannot go through life shirking it.
It's time you buckled to.
I'm a published novelist!
Of course you are, darling, but wouldn't it be so much nicer to be a doctor, as well?
It isn't a hobby, you know?
Any normal mother would be proud.
And I am proud, my sweetheart.
You know I found your novel most interesting.
I thought it was ingenious the way you used your antipathy towards me to such creative effect.
But you cannot expect life to be one long holiday.
I'm not going there on holiday, I'm going there to get away from you.
Couldn't you go somewhere a little closer, like the Isle of Wight?
Mother!
# I don't know to whom I belong
# It would be such a shame to end up on my own
# If I make myself true to one
# How another will surely be sad and alone
Of course, you must do as you wish.
I fully intend to.
It's only natural, I suppose, that you should want to flee the nest, just as I am bound to get more lonely.
When I think of what I went through to bring you into this world!
Months and months of feeling really quite seedy.
Oh well, so be it.
You won't forget, will you, darling, that the Germans killed your father?
MACHINE GUNS
Take me with you.
You have to stay and look after Mummy.
But for how long?
I'm afraid I can't answer that.
# If I make myself true to one
# How another will surely be sad and alone
# Should such a beauty belong to one person?
# No, surely, the sun and the stars
# They belong to us all
# I don't know
# To whom I belong
# I believe
# I only belong to myself. #
APPLAUSE Danke.
Vielen Dank.
I was wondering...
Oh, do forgive me, dear boy.
I didn't mean to startle you.
No, no.
Could I trouble you for a light?
Yes, of course.
I seem to have mislaid my lighter, I suspect it...
Thank you, dear boy.
It may have been...
Would you mind if I...?
No, no.
How kind!
It may have been stolen.
Oh dear.
One has to be so careful nowadays, don't you find?
Are you going all the way?
Excuse me?
To Berlin?
Yes.
Holiday?
I'm hoping for a little more than that.
Ah, yes.
Well, Berlin has so much to offer, in certain respects.
Do you live there?
For now.
One never knows what a new dawn may bring.
I hope you don't think I'm prying, dear boy, but do you have accommodation in Berlin?
I do, as it happens, yes.
The reason why I venture such impertinence is that my landlady, dear, sweet woman, is desperate for a reliable lodger.
Her landlords are ruthless and if they knew she didn't have the full quota, well, turf her out in an instant.
I have a feeling, and though perhaps I shouldn't say so myself,
I do have a nose for these things.
You might fit the bill perfectly.
My goodness, yes.
Well, that's most kind of you, but as I say...
I'll tell her, then, shall I?
Here's my card.
Mr Hamilton.
Oh, Gerald, please.
And who shall I tell her to expect?
Isherwood.
Christopher Isherwood.
ANNOUNCEMENT ON TANNOY
Wystan!
So, here I am!
Yes, here you are.
Good trip?
Fine, thanks.
Those seats are devilish.
I hardly noticed.
I thought we'd drop your case off, then I'd show you the sights.
Best start as one means to go on.
I decided the Brandenburg Gate could wait.
Don't worry, they won't bite, unless you want them to.
They're very accommodating if you have the cash, but it won't break the bank, the exchange rate is still very much in our favour.
Ah, Pieps!
Hallo.
IN GERMAN
Guten Abend.
Guten Abend.
Niedlich!
What are you saying?
What was that?
We've been something of a feature.
Well, maybe more of a B feature.
I have no illusions of the pitfalls of loving a whore.
Are they all on the game?
Most of them, yes.
You can't imagine what a state the economy's in.
They look very well on it.
Yeah, they like to keep themselves fit.
It's good for business, of course, and they're shamelessly vain.
The fact that we find them desirable only proves how very masculine they are.
What do you mean, "we"?
They're nearly all rampant heters and use our money to pay for cunt.
But don't let that put you off, they're frightfully good at it.
What name does he go under?
Caspar.
That's about the only thing I understood.
Perhaps you'd better help me trot out the odd German phrase, else I could get myself into the most frightful fix.
Perhaps I better had.
The question is, will you understand the answers?
I might have found somewhere to stay.
Oh, yes?
I got talking to this man on the train.
You little slut!
apparently his landlady's rather desperate for a lodger.
Something about filling her quota.
Anyway, I thought there'd be no harm in checking it out.
You're very welcome to stay here, you know.
In fact I'd very much like it if you did.
I need a room of my own, Wystan.
Once I start giving lessons, which I'm going to have to earn a bit of cash and subsidise my writing, well...
And you can't write poetry with me buzzing about.
Yes, you're right.
So, I expect you'll be seeing him again, this Caspar chappie?
Well, yes.
I hope so.
I have missed you.
I love English gentlemen, Herr Issyvoo.
Herr Hamilton, such a charming man!
And you, a writer!
What an honour!
You can write many famous novels here.
Oh, Herr Issyvoo, this room was made for you!
It's very nice, Fraulein Thurau.
Oh, Herr Issyvoo!
You English are so polite.
Well, you English men.
There is an English woman across the hall.
She treats me like a slave.
"Fraulein Ross,"
I tell her, "I was a lady.
I have not always scrubbed the floors. "
Ach, forgive me, Herr Issyvoo, that was the lodger before you.
I don't know what he'd eaten but it won't come out.
THEY SPEAK GERMAN
Morning, darling.
I have the most perfectly frightful head.
Who is it?
Isherwood.
Who?
Christopher Isherwood.
It's me, Christopher.
We met on the train.
I've taken the room.
Oh, Christopher!
Do forgive me, dear boy, one has to be so careful nowadays.
Since my release from Brixton
I've rather lost touch with the old country.
You were in prison?
Yes, for expressing anti-British sentiments, though how, I ask myself, could I be regarded as a traitor when I have rivers of Irish blood simply coursing through my veins?
So you're in business here?
One must have fingers in many pies, dear boy.
Such alarming times we live in.
Ah!
Heinrich!
A young stevedore I encountered in Hamburg.
And what were you doing in Hamburg?
What is one ever doing anywhere?
Passing through, dear boy.
That is our destiny, forever passing through.
He does make rather an impression, though, doesn't he?
Well, I...
I have found, Christopher, down the years, that I have never been able to relax sexually with a member of my own class.
That an affair with one's social and intellectual equal is well nigh impossible, mm?
I suppose.
You are in the right city, dear boy.
Quite the place to let your hair down with some eager young prole.
Oh, dear, is it crooked?
Just a tiny bit, perhaps.
Of course, one must take a little care.
We're still illegal, and should the Nazis come to power they'll stamp us out altogether.
What's the current Communist line?
Well, as far as I know, Lenin said nothing about buggery.
Dearest Heinrich!
Smelt exactly like a fox.
Delicious!
Haven't you gone yet, Ludo?
Oh, do put something on!
You'll frighten the horses.
He's Polish.
"He noticed I was staring at his wig and asked if it was crooked.
"'Just a little', I said, and he straightened it. "
You like, ja?
Ja.
Spot on.
GASPING
Window.
Good.
Good.
Ah.
And this?
Fish.
No, what is it?
Big fish?
No, this.
What is this?
Whale.
No.
It's a clock.
Clock!
Ja!
Yes, good.
And that's a dolphin.
Was?
Never mind.
That...
Fraulein Schmidt?
Well, what is that?
SHE LAUGHS
GASPING AND MOANING
Oh, Christoph!
Oh!
This is how I'd like to die.
Ist gut?
Ja?
Ja, ja!
Guten Morgen, Herr Hamilton!
Oh, Guten Morgen, Fraulein Mayr.
Guten Morgen.
Danke.
ROARING BEHIND DOOR
Guten Morgen, Herr Issyvoo.
Guten Morgen, Fraulein Thurau.
How sweet love must be!
Tonight, yes?
Jawohl.
Morning, darling.
Of course I don't know half the people who pass through this place, but you've been here simply generations.
I thought we really must say hello.
Would you like coffee or tea?
Well...
I don't recommend the tea much.
I don't know what Fraulein Thurau does to it, but it tastes just like slops.
Tell me, Chris, what do you do?
People tend not to call me Chris.
I'm an actress.
Not at the moment.
I'm singing in a night club.
But you absolutely must come and see me.
What about tonight?
I'm afraid tonight's rather difficult.
Was that your boyfriend in the hall or just a one off?
I find one offs so much less of a hassle, don't you, darling?
I've been here for centuries, getting on three months now.
I came here with a girlfriend who assured me we'd get film work, but then she was whisked off to Paris by a fat banker and left me utterly stranded.
How rotten.
Oh, I don't care.
I can stand on my own two feet.
But don't you mind being here alone?
One's always alone, duckie.
Surely you know that.
How old are you?
I'm practically antique.
I'm nearly 21.
I'm frightfully bright, you know.
I got myself expelled from school by saying I was pregnant.
There was the most terrible to do when they found out I wasn't.
I got myself sent down from Cambridge.
I say!
Flunked my Tripos.
What a hoot!
I'm meeting a man in The Adlon for lunch, but he'll have to wait.
He has the most revolting underpants, they're like camel hair or something.
It's the sort of thing John The Baptist might wear.
Oh, Mummy would nearly die if she knew what an old whore I am, but one has to keep that horrid wolf from the door, doesn't one?
Guten Tag!
Really!
How do you manage, darling?
I've started giving English lessons, but actually I'm a novelist.
A novelist!
How perfectly marvellous!
Are you published?
My first novel, yes.
I haven't yet found a publisher for the second.
Has it sold simply thousands?
About 300, actually.
The one you write about me shall sell by the million.
About you?
Of course, darling.
Jean Ross, woman of mystery!
I'm not sure you're that mysterious.
Do you know, I think we're going to get along famously.
You will write about me, won't you darling?
Maybe.
One can't afford to wait, sweetie.
This whole thing is about to collapse around our ears.
Carpe diem, darling!
Oh, damn!
I suppose I'd better meet the old goat.
He's promised to introduce me to Max Reinhardt, but I don't believe him for a second.
Why are men always such beasts, darling?
Chris, could you be an angel and lend me 10 marks?
I haven't got a bean for the taxi.
"She said his underpants were like camel hair,
"the sort of thing John The Baptist might wear. "
You're very quiet.
A touch of sunstroke.
You know, coming to Berlin is the first honest thing I've done in my life, and it's all thanks to you.
I doubt your mother sees it quite like that.
He's rather lovely, don't you think?
Caspar!
So tell me, Herr Isherwood, have you come to Berlin to sample the culture?
I wouldn't quite say that.
In fact, I'm rather anti-culture.
Like the Nazis?
Oh, no, not in that way.
It's just that I'm rather put off by culture worshippers.
I find them somewhat precious and prone to gushing.
Do you find me somewhat precious and prone to gushing?
No, I'm sure you're not, but the danger is that one can use culture worship as a substitute for engaging with the messy business of living.
You see, I find all this so very interesting, that you are a writer but do not like culture.
It is my belief that culture raises us from the beasts.
I wonder, Herr Landauer, why you have employed me to teach you English.
You seem to speak it perfectly well.
One has to...
How do you say?
.. keep in practice.
Good.
What exactly is it that you do?
I am a shopkeeper.
A shopkeeper?
That is precisely what I am.
As in Landauer's Department Store?
Yes.
That's where I buy my socks.
Do you engage with politics, Herr Isherwood?
Actually, no.
I'm not really a joiner.
I seem to be constitutionally incapable of bringing myself to the required... pitch of enthusiasm.
I have my sympathies, of course.
We can no longer afford the luxury of sympathy.
I rather suspect I'm best equipped to observe and record.
That will not be an option.
When the Nazis come to power, we must take to the streets.
Not only Jews like myself, but all of us, Herr Isherwood.
We must take to the streets and stay there, even when the Storm Troopers start firing.
I'm not sure I'd hack it as a street fighter.
Forgive me, but are you not then as guilty as your detested culture worshippers for refusing to engage with the whole messy business?
I think, maybe, we should all play to our strengths.
Perhaps we will practise the irregular verbs?
You like that, huh?
It's like silk.
If you go to gymnasium, Christoph, you be like me and Johnny Weissmuller.
I'm not so sure about that.
And then you do this, ja?
No!
No!
Caspar!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
You like, ja?
Nein!
Ja?
Nein!
Ja!
Ja!
Christoph?
Yes?
You got 10 marks?
Yes.
YODELLING
I pay you tonight, ja?
Of course you will.
Oh, dear!
Let us thank God, Christoph, that we are both normal.
Aren't boys marvellous?
Their shape and their voices, their smell and the way they move.
And they can be so... romantic, whereas girls...
No, I'm glad I'm like I am.
Thank God for public school!
He's not coming, is he?
As I've told you, my dear, intimacy's just business to them.
So you think if I stopped giving him money...?
No, no, Caspar and I, it's more than just business.
They're desperate for cash and they'll do anything for it.
But what he says to me...
He'll tell you anything you want to hear.
Still, what do I know about romance?
I'm a poet, not a fucking journalist.
I've booked my ticket back to England.
Already?
Father's allowance has dried up and I really must get this fissure in my rectum seen to.
I hope that wasn't me.
I'm touched by your concern, but really, Christopher, you mustn't flatter yourself.
# Can't imagine why I chose to leave him
# How could I have been so cruel?
# After all he loved me without question
# Still I left him like a fool
# If I woke him late at night complaining
# "I'm on my last cigarette"
# He'd say "I'll be over in a minute
# "Darling, please don't get upset"
# Peter, Peter... #
Gute Nacht.
Gute Nacht.
That's not what I was expecting at all.
I suspect that's a compliment, so thank you, darling.
Oh, I'm so thrilled you're here.
Bobby, sweetie.
Good job, hon!
Oh, I'm in heaven!
Chris darling, this is Bobby Gilbert.
He does something frantically important in something or other.
I'm in steel.
And this is Chris Isherwood.
Christopher.
Hey, Chris.
Any day now Bobby's going to whisk me off to Hollywood, aren't you, darling?
You bet!
And I've told him all about you.
Oh?
Chris is absolutely my best friend.
He's the writer.
Oh, yeah, right!
Would I have read anything of yours, Chris?
Oh, no, but I've told him if he really sticks at it, he could write something really great like Noel Coward or something.
Couldn't you, darling?
What's the matter, Christoph?
You don't like me tonight?
Eh, Christoph?
What's the matter?
I don't like being taken for an idiot, that's what's the matter.
You say you'll meet me, then don't turn up.
You take money off me and say you'll pay me back, but never do.
It's getting to the point where I can't believe anything you tell me.
Yes, I understand.
I understand.
Some of the girls I see, they are like that.
They say things, then let me down, and that makes me mad.
And when I see them, I always pay them and never hit them and still they let me down!
But you know, Christoph, some of them, they are so beautiful, and they make me so happy and I just forget how mad I am.
You bastard!
Your eyes, Christoph.
They shine so bright when you're hot for me.
Ah, Caspar.
He gave me a cheap gold-plated bracelet.
Probably an unwanted gift from some admirer.
He fastened it around my wrist.
A love token, I fondly thought, but then he disappeared.
I asked around, but no-one knew where he was.
I should've listened to Wystan.
Perhaps it was just a business transaction after all.
Zwei Minuten, meine Liebe.
It must be simply marvellous to be a novelist.
Why's that?
Because when people are utterly foul to you, you can sit down and write about them and tell the world how perfectly vile they are and make simply pots of money out of it.
It hasn't quite worked out like that yet.
Darling, be an angel and light my ciggie.
Actually, I've been offered the chance to earn a bit extra.
Take it.
Writing the occasional letter from Berlin and doing the odd book review.
Darling, that's marvellous!
Let's have champagne!
It's for a magazine called Action.
Oswald Mosley's rag?
Oh, you know it then?
Of course I know it.
I may wear green nail varnish, but I'm not completely vacuous.
Why DO you wear green nail varnish?
Have you said yes?
Not yet.
You won't.
I wouldn't write anything political.
Writing anything for that lot would be making a statement of sorts, even if it was the cookery column.
The money would come in awfully handy.
Christopher, you can't!
But, Jean...
I wouldn't talk to you again and that's an end to it.
I was just testing the water.
I wasn't really going to write anything for them.
Honestly, I wasn't.
I'm one to talk.
Gosh, you know the things I've done for money.
People here are so strange.
They've simply no idea, and the Nazis are getting more and more of a foothold and they just seem to accept it.
I've even heard some talk of a brighter future as if all this ghastliness were a price worth paying.
They're going to get the most awful shock unless they make a stand,
Which you and I must do.
We must not throw in the towel.
Why are you looking at me like that?
I don't really know.
WHIPPING, CRIES OF PAIN
Mein Gott!
Morning, darlings.
Gott im Himmel!
HE CRIES OUT
Oh, dear!
I do hope he won't do himself a mischief.
He ought to be more careful at his time of life.
HE CRIES OUT
Oh, Bobby darling!
You do that so well.
You must teach me one day how to catch it in my mouth.
You bet, honey.
Thank you.
To The Memorial.
The Memorial.
Yeah!
So, do you reckon I'd enjoy your book, Chris?
Well, I'm not sure what sort of books you like, Bobby.
What do you think, hon?
I haven't a clue, darling, but I expect it's astoundingly brilliant!
And the point is, it's published.
His second novel in print, and he's even had a letter of congratulation from EM Forester.
Forster.
Wow!
It won't be long till our Chris is just as famous.
Say, who's that guy in the wig?
BOTH:
Gerald.
Well, I could swear that Gerald was peeking through the keyhole while I was in the john.
When I came out, he didn't know where to look.
I expect he knew exactly where to look.
Yeah.
Right.
Bobby, darling.
I adore champagne.
We'll have it every day, won't we, once you' whisk me off to Hollywood?
Sure thing.
Bobby!
Naughty Bobby!
SHOUTING
GLASS SMASHES
Excuse me.
Entschuldigung, bitte.
I was in a cafe and you were...
Do you remember?
No.
Well, why should you?
Mein Name ist Christopher.
Perhaps you'd like to go for ein Bier?
No.
OK.
I'm sorry.
His name was Heinz.
He was innocent, vulnerable and uncritical.
A boy I could protect and cherish as my very own.
Jean thought it was all frightfully jolly and decided I was at last doing my bit for the class struggle.
And as Heinz and I drew closer,
I had no hesitation in falling in love.
SHE COUGHS
She need to be in hospital, but there is no bed.
Mutti...
SHE COUGHS
Gerald!
Come on out.
I know you are in there!
He's not here!
Where is he, then?
Hamburg.
Hamburg?
!
Well, when he's back, tell him if I don't get what I want, he knows what to expect.
Don't you, Gerald?
Some people seem to be utterly lacking in consideration.
Tell me what it's about, Gerald.
A business transaction, that's all, that went slightly awry.
What sort of business?
You know, Christopher, you're looking as joyous as the first day of spring.
Gerald!
I was offered a small fee to help someone get his hands on a police dossier.
Yes?
Actually, it was a positively glacial sum that would have paid off my debts at a stroke, and do you know what?
The wretched man simply vanished.
Disparu without paying me a single pfennig.
So who was that at the door?
A philistine, my dear.
Claiming interest on a little loan.
A loan for what?
Oh, do keep up, dear boy!
For the money I needed to bribe the police to get the dossier.
What on earth were you thinking of?
The trouble is everyone's so greedy nowadays.
And dishonest.
Simply can't trust a soul.
Gerald.
Yes?
Your wig's slipped.
Oh!
DOOR CREAKS
No!
THUMP
'My dear Christopher, I've had to leave Berlin at very short notice 'which made it impossible for me to communicate with you.
'Our friend at the door finally lost patience and matters got a little out of hand.
'Try not to think too hardly of me, dear boy.
'That would be more than I could bear.
'As always, your affectionate Gerald. '
They give her bed at last.
Ah, that's very good news, Frau Neddermayer.
She make dress to look nice in sanatorium.
Oh, I see.
Well, it would be, um...
SHE COUGHS
To see his Nazi friends.
SHE BREATHES DEEPLY
SHE COUGHS
The last Kaiser always mistrusted Berlin.
He saw it as a centre of, how do you say, dissidence?
Yes.
What with the leftist working class and the intellectual avant garde.
I'm wondering if the working class is as leftist as one imagines.
It was not that long ago, Herr Isherwood, that we came close to a communist revolution, but they lacked a strong leader.
This is where Adolf Hitler has been so very clever and exploited the situation.
Ever since the Treaty of Versaille and then the Depression brought the country to its knees with banks failing and savings disappearing, the poor and unemployed see him as their saviour.
And the Nazis organise everywhere - in bars and clubs and schools like a virus.
I see.
Ja.
Like a virus.
But I am sure that all this you know.
Or do you spend too much time at play?
Berlin can be very distracting.
We must all stand by our own kind, Christopher.
Whatever the cost.
# I can't give you anything but love
# Baby
# That's the only thing I've plenty of
# Baby
# Dream a while
# Scheme a while
# We're sure to find
# Happiness
# And I guess
# All those things you've always pined for... #
# I can't give you anything but love
# Baby!
#
Oh, bravo!
Did your mother teach you to cook?
Ja.
She's not very well, she is at the sanitorium.
I did say.
Yes, of course.
So tell me, what exactly is this?
Pig.
Oh, pork!
How lovely!
Ja.
It is, er...
Pork rib?
Delicious!
I think he means lung.
Ja!
Schweinelunge!
Oh.
Golly.
And then before my very eyes I saw him turn from prince to frog and I thought, "Did I really let that make love to me?"
This is my brother Gerhardt.
Gerhardt, it's a pleasure to meet you.
Won't you join us?
We're having the most perfect evening.
I think your brother is simply divine and he's cooked us a marvellous meal.
You are no longer welcome here, Herr Isherwood.
He doesn't mean it.
May I ask why?
Before our father went to the Western Front, he said to me,
"Gerhardt, look out for your mother and your brother. "
I have always tried to honour his memory, but with no work and no money, it's been difficult.
I'm sure it is.
Yes.
But now there is hope, Herr Isherwood, and Herr Hitler is the reason.
Oh, for goodness sake!
He understands men like me.
He wants to make us proud again, hold our heads up high again.
The Communists, they had their chance.
The Nazis are the people's party now.
This is your friends at night school talking, Gerhardt.
Did he just call me a tart?
We do not want you here, Herr Isherwood.
You and your kind.
Oh, how frightfully rude!
So take your pick, Heinz.
Make your father proud...
.. or shame us all.
But Gerhardt...
Honestly, darling, how you can leave poor Heinz with that monster?
I'm sure he can stand up for himself!
We'll probably find him hacked into little pieces at the bottom of a canal.
And you didn't help matters addressing Gerhardt like you were Queen Mary at an investiture.
And after all the trouble he went to with that pig lung hash.
You bastards, you bastards!
For Christ's sake, Jean!
Brutes!
Filthy rotten brutes!
Shut up!
For God's sake!
You're just as bad, every one of you!
Don't worry, darling...
It's over now.
Can we get a taxi?
Can somebody please get a taxi!
Cracken house, ja?
You get used to it, that's the danger.
The uniforms and the raids, the street-fights and the beatings...
We can't just stand by, can we?
No.
We can't, you know.
We really can't.
Gerhardt...
Such a pity, isn't it, that we don't make love?
After all, there's nothing else to do.
We could go to the movies.
I haven't got two pfennigs to rub together.
Jean?
Jean, what is it?
Hollywood's off.
Oh, Jean, I'm so sorry.
"Dear Jean, I have to go back to the States.
"Some emergency at HQ.
"It was fun, wasn't it?
"Bobby. "
What a complete bastard.
Typical bloody American.
Flaky as hell!
You fancied him rotten!
That's beside the point.
Come here.
And he was a most marvellous lover.
He was the best...
Oh, Jean.
Poor darling...
He did leave me a little something.
So he bloody should!
But I shan't be keeping it.
# Men say that they can be faithful
# Simply I smile to myself
# New love is always so novel
# Faithfulness is but pretence
# Now it is all but forgotten
# But yesterday I still possessed
# Love affords time that is blissful
# Loyalty still makes no sense
# I don't know to whom I belong
# It would be such a shame to end up on my own
# If I make myself true to one
# How another will surely be sad and alone
# Should such a beauty belong to one person
# No surely the sun and the stars
# They belong to us all
# I don't know to whom I belong
# I believe
# I only # belong to myself. #
They come, they go, and so it will always be.
Good morning, Herr Issyvoo.
Guten Morgan, Fraulein Thurau.
What a beautiful morning!
Even the sun seems to have come out for Herr Hitler.
Oh, Herr Issyvoo?
The police have been round.
The police?
They were asking about my lodgers.
What did they want to know?
"Routine", they said.
RECORDING OF HITLER PLAYS
Hein, un Moment.
Caspar!
I would remind you, sir, that this is a Jewish store and that there is now an official anti-Jewish boycott.
Where have you been?
I've been looking everywhere for you.
You disappeared.
I didn't know what had happened.
Caspar!
I need to buy a pair of socks.
Shame!
Shame!
Beruf?
"Street-sweeper"?
No.
Maybe...
"domestic servant", or...
Yes, why not? "Domestic servant".
Heinz?
I cannot come, Christoph.
But of course you can.
No, it is too dangerous...
for you, for me...
It's even more dangerous if you stay.
For Gerhardt.
Gerhardt?
He's one of them, for God's sake!
He's my brother!
We're brothers too,
Heinz, and more, much more besides!
And this is my country.
Not at the moment, it isn't.
It will be again one day, I've no doubt, but in the meantime...
You do not miss home?
I have no home.
This is home... wherever I am.
We should be where we belong.
We are where we belong - together.
We must stand together.
We're responsible for each other, as individuals.
Don't you see?
You have to come with me.
I want you to.
Now you do, but in a week?
A month?
I'll still want you Heinz.
Heinz.
Of course I will.
YODELLING
I am sure I do not know, Herr Issyvoo, what makes you want to leave Berlin.
How can I best put this, Fraulein?
Adolf Hitler.
Ach, the Fuhrer!
One day it's Bruning, then von Papen, the next von Schleicher, then it's Hitler.
We must all make the best of it, Herr Issyvoo.
I am staying.
Most Germans are staying.
And besides, where else would we go?
Well, this is your homeland, Fraulein.
I understand that.
But Heinz and I, we want to get out.
We want to...
Travel.
But why?
To go here?
To go there?
What is the point?
Soon no-one will be left.
Herr Hamilton has gone, Fraulein Ross, now you...
You get used to it.
You get used to anything.
CLOCK TICKS
Is your room... satisfactory?
Mummy, he's not retarded.
Where you sleep, is good, yes?
Yes.
I sleep good.
Yes.
Good.
Thank you.
How long have you known Christopher?
Mummy...
Shush!
I know Christopher one year and one half.
Oh, that long, and he's hardly mentioned you, if at all.
And how long are you staying in our country?
Two weeks.
I'm sure Heinz can answer for himself, can't you, Heinz?
Two weeks.
You see?
What a shame it's not longer.
Two weeks is as long as his permit allows.
Then maybe another time.
What is that?
Oh, now...
Christopher!
That, Heinz, is Wyberslegh Hall, part of the family estate.
It's in Cheshire in the north of England.
I painted it, as a matter of fact.
You paint it?
Yes.
It's very good.
Thank you, Heinz.
That is the house where I gave birth to Christopher.
Yes?
And very difficult it was too.
I was in labour for 18 hours.
18 hours!
Imagine that!
Mummy, please!
Oh, dear, that was rather modern of me, wasn't it?
But it was worth it.
He was the most delightful baby.
I'm sure Heinz isn't remotely interested.
He had the loveliest skin and long slitty eyes... just like a Jap.
You see, of course he's interested.
You live in the past, Mummy.
Perhaps I do, Christopher, because it's always there and never lets me down.
Do you have a mummy, Heinz?
She's dead.
Oh.
Oh, I am sorry.
Oh, dear.
Christopher's daddy's dead.
He was killed in the war.
He was my daddy too.
Yes, dear, but you hardly knew him.
He was killed by the Germans.
What are you thinking of, hmm!
I'm not blaming Heinz, darling.
I'm simply filling him in.
And for your information, Heinz's daddy was also killed on the Western Front.
Well, there you are, you see.
That's what wars do - kill people.
Toast?
He's a nice boy.
Well-mannered.
A street-cleaner, you say?
There's no reason a street-cleaner can't be well-mannered.
No, dear.
No reason at all.
How lovely to have a job like ordinary people.
But who'd have you, my darling?
You seem to be inept at pretty much everything.
Don't speak to him like that!
It's entirely your fault he's like he is.
Like what?
Richard, dear, we're talking.
It's terrible he has to go back, and now Germany's withdrawn from the League Of Nations.
Yes, that is rather troubling.
I must think of a way of getting him out for good.
But why should that be your responsibility?
Surely he knows people who can help.
He has absolutely no-one, Mummy, except for a brother who's disowned him, and, besides, I want it to be my responsibility.
So what will you do?
Get him another permit?
Or even another nationality.
Of course, you could always adopt him.
Darling!
I don't think so!
Are you sure he wouldn't be happier in Germany?
It is his home, after all.
It's where he belongs.
And he isn't a Jew or anything.
You've no idea.
It's Nazi Germany we're talking about.
It's not just the Jews who are being victimised.
I do read the papers, darling.
I'm fully aware that the Nazis have done some bad things.
Although one hears that Herr Hitler's done some good things too.
Dear God!
If it weren't for that wretched boy Auden, dragging you off there...
I assure you, he didn't need to drag me.
But you must do as you wish, Christopher, as you always do... so long as you realise what you might be taking on.
Right.
We're going to have to mail money to him in Berlin... "We"?
.. So he can support himself until he comes back here, and if you write a letter inviting him to stay...
Christopher!
..
Then I'm sure they'll give him a much longer permit, maybe even for keeps.
You can't do that!
You'll find that I can.
But you haven't proved your case!
Mr Isherwood, your mother invites a foreign servant to her home without the requisite permit, you send the boy money telling him to claim it was a bequest, which could be construed as an attempt to deceive His Majesty's Immigration Service,
but then we have the letter you wrote.
May I?
"I am counting the days until your arrival.
"I've been so lonely without you. "
A bit curious, don't you think, the way it's written?
A bit... what's the word?
Queer?
Thank you, Mr Auden.
What a boon to have a poet on hand!
You can't send him back!
Christopher...
No!
God knows what they might do!
Not my responsibility.
So an alien has no rights whatsoever in this democracy that men have laid down their lives for.
I hope, should the moment come, that you too will be ready to make the sacrifice.
Make no mistake, I shall appeal!
You can write to the Home Secretary for all the good it will do.
Come on.
As soon as I saw that rat, I knew we were done for.
They're all the bloody same!
Oh no, he's one of us.
It stands out a mile.
I'm sorry.
You seem out of sorts.
Do I?
It's Heinz, isn't it?
Goodbyes are always sad.
As sad as dying.
I'll be seeing him soon enough.
That's right.
Yeah.
No need to be sad.
I suppose being a writer, you want to tidy everything up and make it make sense.
But things never do quite make sense, do they?
Not really.
No.
This Sally Bowles character... is she based on anyone?
Yes, in a manner of speaking.
And what about Mr Norris?
Yes, I suppose he is too.
I thought we might first meet him on a train.
Oh, yes.
Trains are always good.
You can't go wrong with a train.
Where were we?
Full stop, close quotation marks.
Good.
It must be very polarising, this Nazi business.
Hard to sit on the fence, I'd imagine.
Yes, it is.
Berlin's fairly seething, what with all the poverty and wounded pride.
I'd say communism was the best hope for peace.
Then why not stay here and join the Party?
I can't do that!
I have Heinz to consider.
Yes, Heinz.
Of course.
So where will you go?
Amsterdam, probably.
For the time being.
That's all one can say, isn't it?
"For the time being. "
It always breaks my heart a little to see you leave.
You should be used to it by now.
Oh, no, I'll never get used to it... .. And how awful if I did.
I'll be back.
I always am.
'And so once again I cast off from England and threw in my lot with Heinz.
'Two lost souls wandering around Europe on the brink...
'I have to admit I felt a little guilty flitting from country to country to save a single man, 'whilst others were preparing to save the world.
'But then our luck ran out and Heinz was arrested by the Gestapo, 'and that was that. '
Daily Worker, ladies?
No appeasement!
Fight the fascists!
Excuse me, Miss...
I'm exercising my democratic right!
Only you would choose to sell The Daily Worker in Knightsbridge.
I have no say in the matter.
I go where the Party tells me.
You're looking impossibly young.
Are you ever going to age?
I do hope not.
My God!
The varnish!
I somehow felt that red was more appropriate.
I must confess I carry it with me everywhere.
Isn't it funny, darling, that you're the one that became famous?
And you know I must say I'm rather enjoying it, and meanwhile poor Heinz...
Well...
I dread to think what he's being subjected to.
A year labouring for the state followed by two years in the army.
It's frightfully harsh.
It could be worse - he might have got carted off to a concentration camp.
You did all you could.
I wonder if I did?
I wonder if I did, really?
And what's worse, I even feel relieved.
Hmm.
Do you ever miss Berlin?
Oh, no.
I never miss anything.
Sometimes I wonder if I shouldn't have had that kid.
I think I'd just about have cut the mustard as a mother.
I'd tuck him in, and I'd sing to him.
And then I'd go out and fuck filthy old men to pay for the brat!
Then why not marry and have another?
Because I've lost my faith in men.
Well, that's a shame.
I have simply no use for them any more.
Not even you, darling.
Oh, well, back to the revolution.
Might we see each other again?
Goodbye, Chris.
Goodbye.
'It seems everyone's caught communism like flu. '
I think it's fair to say that the closest we've come to solidarity with the workers is sleeping with them.
Well, that's a cause of sorts.
The only cause you really care about, Christopher, is yourself.
Isn't that rather unkind?
Hmm.
But you've turned it into an art form - rather successfully, as it happens.
I used to be a little in love with you.
You knew that, didn't you?
Yes, I thought you did.
You're lucky - you're not burdened by the concept of sin.
And it is a sin, Christopher... although I fully intend to carry on sinning.
Please, don't start on about God!
You're going to have such a conversion one of these days, my dear.
I do loathe the sea.
It's so wet and sloppy.
I don't belong here.
I'm not sure I belong anywhere.
I rather like being a foreigner.
I wonder where we might end up?
'Wystan was right.
'I've never known about anybody except me.
You see,
'I was never able to commit
- I only ever sort of added to the chorus.
'And now, of course, politics are more and more about the individual.
'The gay liberation movement seems to have taken me to its heart.
'It's very nice of them, really.
'A cause at last!
'But then I think it always was my cause.
And somehow, you know... 'it makes sense of what I was trying to do for Heinz.
'All those years ago... '
Christoph?
You write again about Berlin?
Yes, for a British newspaper.
A lot has changed, ja?
What's left of it.
When the city was cut in pieces, we end up in the Russian sector.
Rotten luck, eh?
We all hate the Russians, Christoph.
We would much rather be here in the West Zone.
Maybe one day.
My friend Christoph, the famous writer.
I suppose you could say that.
Tell me, there are skyscrapers in America?
Oh, yes.
And you see Hollywood?
I live near there, actually.
And the Grand Canyon?
You see that?
Yes.
It's... very big.
And cowboys?
No, I haven't seen too many of them.
I feel guilty, Heinz.
All that I made you suffer.
I should never have taken you out of Germany.
But Christoph, you change my life.
What we had, what we did,
I would not miss for the world.
Look, Christoph...
My wife, Hilde.
Well, she looks... very nice!
She's a good girl.
And she doesn't ask questions.
That's all right then.
And this is my son...
.. Christoph.
Christoph?
Ja.
Well.
You know, Christoph, you are not getting younger.
That's the way it tends to go.
You live alone, yes?
At the moment.
That is not good, to live alone.
You need a family around you, to keep you company, to look after you when you are sick.
Heinz, I'm not decrepit!
But listen, Christoph, we could be your family.
What?
Hilde, Christoph and I.
Out there in...
California.
Ah, well...
Erm, I'm not so sure about that.
You see, the life I lead...
My, my plans are so uncertain.
I'd have to think it over.
Look, we'll see.
See how it goes.
And I'll write you, we'll keep in touch.
You do understand, don't you, Heinz?
You do... don't you?
Yes.
I...
I understand.
Fraulein!
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Oh!
When the city was divided, we got the Americans.
Oh, I am so happy!
We are all so happy!
I thank God the Russians didn't get us.
Communism!
Oh, Herr Issyvoo, you look like a child!
It's lovely to see you, Fraulein.
Herr Issyvoo, Herr Issyvoo!
Ach, the last year of the war, Herr Issyvoo!
Yes.
It was terrible.
We were in the cellar nearly all the time, holding each other.
We prayed so much, we got quite religious!
Ah!
Is the yodeller still there?
No, thank God!
The Nazis shot her.
It's the one good thing they did!
Another survivor, eh, Fraulein?
Another survivor.
It was damaged a little, but I mended it.
For you.
No, I couldn't.
Take it, please, and when you look at it, you will think of Berlin, and Fraulein Thurau, and smile.
Thank you.
Previously on "Web Therapy"...
I want you to understand this new treatment modality that I've come up with, Kip.
Okay, let's do it.
All right?
You left a financial firm.
A very good job.
Mm hmm.
I n kind of suspicious circumstances.
We're not quite sure what really went on.
You're talking about you and me?
That You mean the incident at Lachman Brothers?
Yes.
Of course.
You just misunderstood, I guess, the nature of our relationship.
Well, no, you you beckoned me.
You told me to come into your office.
Beckoned you?
"Come hither to my lips"?
Um, you know, I've sent so many e mails to Jeremy
Oh, my God, they were like, "She's resurfacing again.
We thought we dodged a bullet."
If you want the Lachman Brothers to invest in this proposal Mm hmm.
You should take out the whole insinuation of blackmail.
Because I don't think they're gonna go for that.
I don't think it's gonna fly.
Something has come up between me and my fiancée, Haley.
Okay, yes.
And.
Um.
As it turns out.
Her lesbian moms used my father's sperm to have her.
What makes you think I don't specialize in incest?
I have to keep pinging her until she comes up, that's why.
I don't know when she comes up.
Hello.
Oh.
There she is.
Oh.
Hi.
Jerome.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Wallice.
Hi.
Hi.
Dr. Wallice.
You're...
Haley.
Haley.
Yeah.
Yes.
I have it written down.
She was able to meet me during lunch.
That's... wonderful.
I just, uh
Sorry if it's a bit pushy, but, um, I just wanted to say I'm really happy to be here.
I've had extensive therapy in the past, and
Oh.
So it's not my first time at the rodeo.
But I did wanna say, um, just to fill you in, we.
Uh.
We met about six months ago.
He bought this bakelite Buddha
I was selling on eBay.
And he left me just lovely, lovely feedback with a beautiful Eckhart Tolle quote.
And it's hard to find a modern man who's sensitive.
And and loving, and interested in his own path.
But then, after a couple of months of really nice, nice times and moments.
He started to
I'm going to break in, just for a moment
He started to display his incredible fear of intimacy in so many different ways.
I think I'd like to just
He didn't wanna be touched for a week.
He said his skin was sensitive.
That he had a rash.
Well, to your perfume.
Am I muted?
I s it really to my perfume?
I s it to my perfume?
Yeah, it's your perfume.
Am I muted?
Or is it to my love?
If I may, I'd like to interject at this point, just to remark on something extraordinary.
Which is.
To anyone who has eyes or a brain stem that's connected.
You two are clearly related.
Thank you, I told you.
Did you really tell her about that?
Of course.
Of course I did.
You understand how ridic
We are not related.
Yes.
We are.
We're not related.
The sperm donor numbers match.
Don't you see, don't you see?
This is you trying to stay away from
I'm not trying to.
You're pushing me away.
Haley, is this something you would like to remain a secret?
It's not a secret.
It's not true.
Clearly, you're still passionate about each other.
What is this?
Paul?
Paul, hi, yeah, no,
I'm just having lunch and then I'm gonna go right back to work.
Who are you?
This is my friend, um, Haley.
Hi.
Oh.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
We'll be done really soon, okay?
Good to meet you.
What is that?
"Good to meet you."
All flirty, what is that?
What is you calling me "your friend"?
All right, well, let's stick with the issue.
I'm your lover, I wear your ring.
We're friends now there's been no sex.
There's been no romance since the unfortunate discovery.
Right, but we're on a bridge.
Well, let's not get bogged down in these kinds of...
I ssues...
Feelings, and that sort of thing.
Did you receive the release that I e mailed to you?
Oh, yes.
Because I need to record the sessions.
We got a fax you faxed it to me and I have it here.
So I need you to sign off and get your okay.
I've been in a lot of therapy, a lot of different kinds of therapy.
I've never been recorded.
But
What is that for?
Oh, something very exciting has happened that I would love to share with you.
An investor is interested in franchising this modality of therapy.
Well.
I'm not And I need to record them.
Um.
Dr. Wallice
This relationship that you two have, with the half siblings, with the sperm donors, and all of that, you know, it's something that is really, um, attention grabbing.
And you two are such a wonderful.
Uh.
Test case.
In that this issue is so.
Um it's fascinating and it's sexy.
The two of you are, you know, attractive, Haley.
And.
Um Thank you.
You know, this just it this could really help out a lot.
Both of us.
All three of us.
I feel.
It sounds a little bit like you want us to advertise for you.
No.
No.
This is not for advertising purposes.
This is more...
more of a sort of a sales tool.
Okay, well, before we do anything like this, or sign any documents,
I was wondering whether you might be willing to let us go back to a 50 minute hour.
Especially since Haley and I will be doing the therapies together.
No, absolutely not.
Oh.
That defeats the entire purpose of this.
It's three minute sessions.
Which is why it works.
I mean, nothing you've said in your 50 minute sessions has ever even been slightly interesting, until this.
Wow.
You know.
It's like having a gun to your head.
You're forced to get to the issue.
And that's why it works.
Okay, well, if I were paranoid,
I would think that you were maybe using us to promote your business.
Are you paranoid, Jerome?
What?
No.
No.
I don't think so.
Well, two sessions ago, you thought you might be paranoid.
And now.
In a minute and a half.
You're not.
That's a pretty fast cure.
I think.
You're right.
You're right.
Oh, my God.
You're both crazy, someone needs to see this.
It's fine, go ahead.
I'm happy to sign the release.
Fantastic.
Because this...
This is unbelievable.
Don't judge, okay?
Until you've seen what she can do.
Let's not judge anybody.
I'm agreeing, I'm agreeing.
I'm signing.
I s it signed?
Trouble.
Yeah, they're both signed.
I'll fax it to the number that you e mailed me.
Okay.
Very good.
All right, it was lovely to meet you, Haley.
Nice to meet you, Doctor.
I will see you both next week.
What perfume are you wearing?
My eyes are starting to water.
It's patchouli, I wear it every day.
Well, patchouli
I'm allergic to patchouli, so thank you.
You're allergic to love.
Okay.
Well, I think here's a good picture that we could use.
Kamal, how long exactly do you have for your lunch break?
Uh.
I have about a half hour before I have to get back to Mr. Wallice's office.
Okay, that should be
Oh, here's a good one that I could use.
I think.
I'll get your opinion.
Uh.
Fiona?
What, yes?
Could you grab my cord?
Oh, yes, I can grab your cord.
Thanks, just pull that up a little bit.
Okay.
This is an old cord.
So it might be a bad connection.
Oh, my gosh, whew!
And then do what with it?
Takes a lot of effort down there.
All right, so we're just gonna put this in the port.
Just kinda ease it in there.
Ease it in.
Yeah.
I nto the port.
There.
My Yes, your cord.
Boom, we're up.
Oh, there you are.
Look at that, all right.
Don't worry about that, I'll fix that before I leave.
You look very handsome.
Thanks, you Yes.
You look nice as well.
Well, okay, I think that's about enough of that.
All right?
Enough of I'm sorry?
Well.
I am married.
So...
I work for your husband, so...
Yeah, yes, right.
Yeah.
So we'll just keep this between us for now.
And I won't say anything about it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Keep what Oh, "plug it in the hole."
And "grab my cord," and "you're very attractive."
Oh.
Wow.
I understand how those feelings can come up.
You probably don't have that much exposure to someone like me.
Which I understand.
But in this country, you know, it's not appropriate or me to flirt with every Tom, Dick, or Hari.
Oh, no, I'm from Philadelphia, I was born here.
Yes.
Yeah.
I just I wanna be clear here.
Mm hmm.
I'm not attracted to you, I just
Oh, good, all right.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know, maybe it's It's weird.
Because "A." I don't feel anything with you.
I don't know, maybe it's cause you're, like, my mom's age.
Well, I hardly think I'm your mother's age.
Possibly your mother's much younger sister, by a generation, anyway.
Um, okay, do we wanna, um...
But very smart of you to say, "No.
I'm not attracted."
For the record.
But I won't tell Kip, anyway.
Okay, good.
Yes.
Good.
What do you wanna test?
Oh.
Well.
I have a client.
All right?
Who is.
Um...
Almost engaged, or sexually involved with a woman who is possibly his sister.
So let's see if you can't...
Be looking into the You know, into your computer.
Okay.
All right.
And tell me about how in love you are with your sister, and, you know, certain of those sexual exploits.
Now what button do I push to record?
Have I done that yet?
You're just gonna wanna
Here, you just gotta...
Here...
Will there be a light?
Just take this.
And...
there you go.
You just wanna hit "return," which is the same as "accept."
Mm hmm.
Now there's no light or anything.
So no one would even know that I'm recording.
No, there just isn't.
Okay.
Okay, so you want me to pretend that I want to sleep with my sister?
Right, that's what this that's what it's going to be about.
So...
Uh, okay Wow, that's weird, but I will give it a shot.
Okay, so we're in therapy.
All right, um...
But.
Look at But we won't be
I'm not in the same room with my client, obviously.
I don't wanna go anywhere near them.
Yeah, okay.
Yes, you're looking into your computer.
Okay.
As am I.
And this is how we're able to relate to each other.
Okay.
Hey, Dr. Wallice.
Yes.
Hello.
Um, I have this problem, and it's
I wanna sleep with my sister.
Oh.
Kamal.
How old is your sister?
My sister is three.
Oh, yes.
All right, you know what?
It doesn't it doesn't help me as much as I thought.
Stop.
Great news.
Uh, we're actually celebrating.
Yeah.
Oh.
I don't know why we're celebrating.
It's all covered with soy sauce.
I can't even eat gluten, so that's great.
What.
Since when can't you eat gluten?
Since the stress of finding out that you're my sister has given me celiac disease.
Well, actually, that's what we're celebrating.
A couple of weeks ago, before our first session.
I... swabbed your cheek, inside your cheek, in the middle of the night and I sent it to a DNA lab.
And it turns out that we're not related.
Take your hand off my shoulder.
Do not touch me.
Why are you
All right, don't panic, everybody.
I cannot believe that you would swab me in the middle of the night without my knowing it.
I understand, I really do understand how you feel, but I did it for us.
Jerome.
I did it so that we could be together.
What May I ask which DNA lab you used?
I I don't know.
I can't remember.
I don't know.
You don't know?
I found it on the I nternet.
It's only the most important thing in your life, and then you don't know which lab you used.
It was 100% conclusive But that's very telling.
That we were not related.
Well.
Was it called Acme?
Was there a little roadrunner?
And a coyote on the label?
Do you understand?
Because if it was I think you're mocking me.
Then that's not 100% conclusive.
No, I'm not mocking you.
I'm just saying it's all relative.
And we believe what we want to believe.
You know who's a relative?
I'll tell you who's relative.
You and me.
I am not your relative.
I don't believe you.
I'm not your relative.
Why can't you just love me?
Well, you're fighting like brother and sister right now.
Which is interesting.
I think we're splitting hairs here.
It was 100% conclusive.
What about the sperm donor?
The numbers matched.
I thought.
Oh no, that actually 'cause I sent that in too.
That was actually wrong.
It was just a printing error.
The last two numbers
Jerome made a mistake.
In other words.
Jerome made a mistake, yeah.
I don't blame him.
I don't blame him.
Because I love you, and I try to understand you.
But But it's fine now.
Because we're not related.
So we can proceed.
Jerome.
Well...
We're not related.
But
Yes.
I've heard that.
Thank you very much.
I'm having trouble.
Yet, in another attempt for you to manufacture an interesting personality for yourself, you have now created all kinds of bigger problems for those around you.
All right?
I did not make that
You have drawn a young woman into a relationship with you who is perfectly wonderful Thank you.
And then the minute you're threatened by any kind of intimacy, well, you're related.
And then that draws me in too.
Wanting to treat you, and to interest investors into... my modality for therapy that they want to franchise, not in small part based on the fact that I may have a couple who is siblings.
Who are siblings, forgive me.
I n my hysterical state, my grammar has flown out the window!
I'm beside myself, Jerome, I really am.
There was a lot riding on this.
I'm sorry, I
I need to think.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?
Why did you do it in front of her?
Because I knew that you wouldn't be able to accept it.
No, I can't trust you anymore, that's the problem.
And you should have asked me about getting the DNA test.
All right, okay.
This is therapy.
I think where You've gotta let me get through this, all right?
I'm going to have to fix you two quickly so we can get past this silliness and move on.
So, Jerome, clearly, you are craving a mother's attention that you never received, all right?
Which is why that, every time a woman is the least bit interested.
You reject her out of hand.
And Haley, well, clearly you were raised by two lesbians, okay?
Neither one of them is a man.
No matter how mannish either one of them was, all right?
And so that's why, when you find a man who is so unavailable emotionally, you can't keep yourself away because it's the only thing familiar.
I n other words.
You two have been essentially created for each other.
So let's go from there, all right?
Yeah.
Wow.
Okay.
Now, I have fixed you, as far as I'm concerned.
And what I would like in return is for you to spend the next six sessions fulfilling the commitment I made to my investor to deliver a story about half siblings who have found themselves in love and in a relationship
and how they navigate those murky waters, regardless of the results of the DNA test.
Uh, okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
All right, I'll see you again next week.
Then.
And if there's some kind of sexual story, that would be good.
Jeremy, could you please listen to me?
No, I need to show it to you, so that you know what it is that you're investing in.
It's taken on huge proportions that I'm very excited about.
And I wanted to I have Well, okay.
One of them is the tape of a typical client, okay?
And let me just say that it's interesting, okay?
And...
Look, all right, well, I don't wanna say too much, but it's really provocative.
Yes, all right, it has to do with siblings.
No, not rivalry.
The opposite.
Yes, now I have your...
Your interest.
Okay.
No, no, they're not twins.
Good.
Let's let me nail down that appointment, though.
How about
Then you must have two hours on maybe Thursday?
All right.
Very good.
Okay, well, listen, it was lovely talking to
What?
Well, uh, you know what?
You'll see what I'm wearing when I see you on Thursday.
How's that.
Then?
All right, bye bye.
Pig.
Oh, Kip, no.
What are you doing on my computer?
I'm printing out a deposition.
It's important, I need it in the morning.
Sweetie pie, why am I wanted
Why can I see myself right now?
Oh.'cause the camera's on.
It's always on.
You mean.
People can see in now?
See me doing this?
No.
No, this isn't being broadcast.
It's just the web cam that's attached to the computer.
So you Do you know what year it is?
Cute.
Um, you know, you're the computer girl.
Do you look at yourself all day long?
Well, yes, I'm here all by myself, and I like to keep myself company.
Okay.
Strong, healthy self esteem.
I don't see anything wrong with that.
Nothing wrong with that.
I heard a little judgment in your tone.
No judgment, darling, no judgment.
I'm happy that you have yourself to keep yourself company.
Look at that.
Isn't that nice?
Mm hmm.
Oh.
I haven't heard from the Lachmans.
There's nothing there.
I don't understand.
I gave such a riveting presentation.
You heard it.
It was outstanding.
Absolutely.
And I haven't heard from them.
No.
I need that money.
I don't have it at this moment.
All right, yes, I've heard you, Kip.
I've heard you explain that to me, that you can't.
My money is tied up.
I've got some other things I'm planning to do.
I can't I don't have that cash.
And what kind of things are you planning to do?
You know, things that will involve both of us.
We'll talk about it.
But why don't you just call your mother?
My No.
The richest woman I know.
Yes, well, I'm not going to call my mother, because I don't think that's it's right to mix business...
I'm not going to ask family for money.
Well.
What am I?
Well, you're my spouse, you're not family.
Oh, yeah, you have a point.
All right.
Oh, look what tonight is, it's bubble bath night.
Oh.
Remember that?
Yeah.
Well.
It was fun.
Yeah.
You know.
I'm a little
My skin is a little...
Dry.
Oily.
Yeah.
Dry, patchy.
Yes.
It is.
Mm hmm.
All right.
I think a quick shower for me.
And
Yeah, let's skip it.
I gotta get to bed.
Hi.
Fiona.
Hello.
Richard.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
I...
I haven't slept very much since Thursday.
Mm.
It was weird when you showed up at Morimoto's.
Well, it's my husband's favorite restaurant.
It's not like I've never been there before.
So I simply had plans to be there.
I didn't see him there.
Well.
I wasn't with him.
I was meeting a friend.
I didn't see a friend.
Well, she didn't show up, as it turns out.
So you just were there.
Yeah.
It was it was
I mean.
I liked it.
But I think that it put Sheila off when you joined us.
Well, my friend didn't show up.
And, you know, the only polite thing to do was to invite me to come over.
And you did.
What?
Or, you know, allowed me to.
And when I invited myself over, you said, "Yes."
Yeah.
I Didn't have to say "yes."
I don't I don't know.
I just think that we
She sounds very passive aggressive to me.
Well
I n addition to all the myriad of other problems.
Well, you told her that.
And I think that she felt like you were judging her.
Well.
Now.
I said. "Please don't be passive aggressive."
Yeah.
If you're uncomfortable, or feel threatened by me in any way because of our history...
Yeah, but then you That's very direct.
I know, I'm just Believe me.
I understand.
But I think that.
From her point of view, what upset her the most, probably, was when you said,
"What do you think, fatty?"
Well, nicknames are usually a nice icebreaker, so I'm sorry.
Well.
In this instant.
I think it hurt her feelings.
Well, let me put it this way.
I think it's wonderful that you don't have a requirement that the woman you're with is attractive.
So, you know, that's that's really big of you.
That's wonderful.
I n all fairness There's more to you, you know.
So of course she was a little threatened, you know?
I don't go to a nice restaurant wearing a track suit, or, you know, what have you.
No, you looked like a million bucks.
Thank you, well...
I have to ask you something.
I do have to ask you this.
Did you, when we left, did you put your gum in her hair?
What a ridiculous
Put my gum in her hair?
I I Well, I mean, you honestly
I told her think I took it out of my mouth, like some vulgarian?
No.
I don't.
Threw it in her hair?
No, I told her that you would not do that.
You are starting to fall down the rabbit hole yourself, my friend, and that is from spending a lot of intimate time with a person who is... sadly unbalanced.
Yeah.
All right.
You know.
I will admit that I was pleasantly surprised that my friend hadn't shown up, so I had the opportunity to join you so I could see how you interact as a couple.
Well, she's usually really fun.
I think that it was weird because you were sitting on my side of the booth.
And and we were just laughing and I think she felt excluded.
I
Well.
If she would contribute something to the conversation,
I gladly would have engaged her.
Well.
She did let us use her berries when you wanted to feed them to me.
And
They were delicious.
They were.
And I thought you should try, she wasn't making any attempt
She doesn't like berries.
To feed you berries.
She doesn't like berries.
Maybe you do.
I s it all about her and her needs and what she likes?
Oh.
Sheila doesn't like oxygen.
Shall we all drop dead?
Yeah.
It's not her fault.
No.
She has an imbalance and she needs a great deal of help.
I s this the person you want to spend eternity with?
It's something you need to think about.
I've thought about it, actually, because I told her that...
I had to back out.
Back out of the dinner.
Relationship?
Well, I had proposed to her, and then we got into a big fight afterwards.
And I told her that I. Uh... was breaking it off.
And she got mad, and she was...
She...
Well, she got mad, that's the first normal response she's given to any That's appropriate.
Grant her that.
Then I had to help cut the gum out of her hair.
Mm.
It's just been a confusing time since Sheila left.
I think about you...
all the time.
Um...
I love you.
I think I love you.
Well.
Here we are.
With a classic case of transference.
What is that?
Well, that is when the patient transfers phantom feelings onto the therapist.
Phantom feelings?
They're not actionable.
It would be very irresponsible of me to acknowledge them as actual feelings.
They are feelings.
They're not actual feelings.
They are actual
They're not actionable feelings.
You keep saying that, I don't know what that means.
It's very common.
It's in every psychology, psychiatry textbook.
I mean, please don't make me look through them.
They're as dull as dishwater.
So I don't I can't give you a precise definition of what the word means Well.
All I know is but everybody knows what "transference" means.
I know what I feel.
And what I feel for you is love.
I wanna be with you, I wanna hold you.
I wanna...
I wanna be with you.
You know.
This is all
This is all fine to talk about.
But I can't do anything about it, so...
I wanna see you tomorrow.
I wanna see you...
tomorrow.
Well, tomorrow, I'm having lunch with my friend, who's unreliable.
At Giacomo's at 12: 15.
Parking in the rear.
Giacomo's.
Okay.
Richard, I'm going to sign off now.
I'll see you next time.
I n the rear.
Oh, yes, you will.
I see you.
You better be ready, because we are gonna have some fun.
I'm gonna rip that blouse off of you, and I'm going to take you
You're muted.
Richard.
I don't care.
I am going to take you, and I'm going to kiss you
I'm not listening.
And hold you and throw you all over the back of my car.
Well, you can try.
What?
You're listening to me.
Look at me.
Look at me.
You can hear me.
Hello?
Hello?
I can't hear you, because you're muted.
Well, you're talking to me.
What are you, crazy?
All right.
Get over it.
I forgot your name.
Haley.
Haley.
Yes, thank you, all right.
What upset her the most probably was when you said,
"What do you think, fatty?"
I'm sorry.
I honestly don't think it helped when you said,
"Hey, what do you think over there, fatty?"
What am I gonna do?
We're gonna do it, you know?
You're gonna draw on your training.
Lisa, just I have no training.
Previously on Web Therapy...
I want you to understand this new treatment modality that I've come up with, kip.
- Okay, let's do it.
- All right?
You left a financial firm.
A very good job.
Mm-hmm.
In kind of suspicious circumstances.
We're not quite sure what really went on.
You're talking about you and me.
That--you mean the incident at Lachman brothers?
Yes, of course.
You just misunderstood...
I guess...
The nature of our relationship.
Well, no.
You...
You beckoned me.
You told me to come into your office...
Beckoned you?
Come hither...
To my lips?
Um, you know, I've sent so many emails to Jeremy--
Oh, my God.
They were like,
"She's resurfacing again.
We thought we dodged a bullet."
Uh, if you want the lachman brothers to invest in this proposal-- mm-hmm.
You should take out the whole insinuation of blackmail because I don't think they're gonna go for that.
I don't think it's gonna fly.
Something has come up between me and my fiancee, Haley--
Okay, yes.
And, um, as it turns out, her lesbian moms used my father's sperm to have her.
What makes you think I don't specialize in incest?
♪ ♪
I have to keep pinging her until she comes up, that's why.
I don't know when she comes up.
- Hello.
- Oh, there she is.
- Oh.
- Hi, Jerome.
- Hello, I'm Dr. Wallace.
- Hi.
Hi, Dr. Wallace.
- You're...
- Haley.
- Haley.
- Yeah.
Yes, I have it written down.
She was able to meet me during lunch.
That's...
Wonderful.
I just, uh-- sorry if it's a bit pushy, but, um, I just wanted to say I'm really happy to be here.
I've had extensive therapy in the past, and-- oh.
So it's not my first time at the rodeo.
But I did wanna say, um, just to fill you in.
We, uh, we met about, uh, six months ago.
He bought this bakelite Buddha
I was selling on ebay.
And he left me just lovely, lovely feedback with a beautiful Eckhart tolle quote.
And it's hard to find a modern man who's sensitive, and loving, and interested in his own path.
But then, after a couple of months of really nice, nice, times and moments, he started to--
I'm going to break in, just for a moment.
He started to display his incredible fear of intimacy in so many different ways.
I think I'd like to just-- he didn't wanna be touched for a week.
- He said his skin was sensitive, that he had a rash.
- Well, to your perfume.
- Am I muted?
- Is it really to my perfume?
- Is it to my perfume?
- Yeah, it's your perfume.
- Am I muted?
- Or is it to my love?
If I may, I'd like to interject at this point.
Just to remark on something extraordinary.
Which is, to anyone who has eyes or a brain stem that's connected, you two are clearly related.
Thank you.
I told you.
Did you really tell her about that?
You understand how ridic-- of course!
Of course I did.
- We are not related.
- Yes, we are.
We're not related.
Don't you see?
The sperm donor numbers match.
Don't you see?
This is you trying to stay away from--
- I'm not trying to.
- You're pushing me away.
Haley, is this something you would like to remain a secret?
It's not a secret.
It's not true.
Clearly, you're still passionate about each other.
- What is this?
- Paul?
Paul, hi, yeah, no, I'm just having lunch and then I'm gonna go right back to work.
- Who are you?
- This is my friend, um, Haley.
- Hi, oh, hi, nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
We'll be done really soon.
Okay.
Good to meet you.
What is that?
"Good to meet you."
All flirty.
What is that?
What is you calling me "your friend"?
All right, well, let's stick with the issue.
I'm your lover, I wear your ring.
We're friends now-- there's been no sex, there's been no romance since the unfortunate discovery.
Right, but we're on a bridge.
Well, let's not get bogged down in these kinds of...
Issues...
Feelings, and that sort of thing.
Did you receive the release that I emailed to you?
Oh...
Yes.
Because I need to record the sessions.
We got a fax--you faxed it to me and I have it here.
So I need you to sign off and get your okay.
I've been in a lot of therapy, a lot of different kinds of therapy.
I've never been recorded, but-- what is that for?
Oh, something very exciting has happened that I would love to share with you.
An investor is interested in franchising this modality of therapy.
- Well, I'm not--
- And I need to record them.
Um, Dr. Wallace-- you know, this relationship that you two have, with the half-siblings, with the sperm donors, and all of that-- you know, it's something that is really, um, attention grabbing.
And you two are such a wonderful, uh, test case, in that this issue is so, um-- it's fascinating.
And it's sexy.
The two of you are, you know, attractive...
Haley.
- And, um--
- Thank you.
You know, this just--it-- this could really help out a lot.
Both of us.
All three of us, I feel.
It sounds a little bit like you want us to advertise for you.
No, no, this is not for advertising purposes.
This is for more of a-- sort of a sales tool.
Okay, well, before we do anything like this, or sign any documents,
I was wondering whether you might be willing to let us go back to a 50-minute hour.
Especially since Haley and I will be doing the therapies together.
No.
- Absolutely not.
- Oh.
That defeats the entire purpose of this.
It's three-minute sessions.
Which is why it works.
I mean, nothing you've said in your 50-minute sessions has ever even been slightly interesting.
Until this.
- Wow.
- You know.
It's like having a gun to your head.
You're forced to get to the issue.
And that's why it works.
Okay, well, if I were paranoid,
I would think that you were maybe using us to promote your business.
Are you paranoid, Jerome?
What?
No.
No, I don't think so.
Well, two sessions ago, you thought you might be paranoid.
And now, in a minute and a half, you're not.
That's a pretty fast cure, I think.
You're right.
- You're right.
- Oh, my God.
You're both crazy.
Someone needs to see this.
It's fine, go ahead.
I'm happy to sign the release.
Fantastic.
Because this...
This is unbelievable.
Don't judge, okay?
Until you've seen what she can do.
Let's not judge anybody.
I'm agreeing, I'm agreeing.
I'm signing.
- Is it signed?
- Yeah, they're both signed.
I'll fax it to the number that you emailed me.
Okay.
- Very good.
All right, it was lovely to meet you, Haley.
Nice to meet you, doctor.
I will see you both next week.
What perfume are you wearing?
My eyes are starting to water.
It's patchouli, I wear it every day.
Well, patchouli-- I'm allergic to patchouli.
So thank you.
- You're allergic to love.

Okay, well, I think here's a good picture that we could use.
Kamal, how long exactly do you have for your lunch break?
Uh, I have about a half-hour before I have to get back to Mr. Wallace's office.
Okay, that should be-- oh, here's a good one that I could use, I think.
I'll get your opinion.
- Uh, Fiona?
- What, yes?
Could you grab my cord?
Oh, yes, I can grab your cord.
Thanks, just pull that up a little bit.
Okay.
This is an old cord, so it might be a bad connection.
Oh, my gosh.
Whew!
Takes a lot of effort down there.
And then do what with it?
All right, so we're just gonna put this in the port.
Just kinda ease it in there.
- Ease it in.
- Yeah.
- Into the port.
- There.
My--yes, your cord.
- Boom, we're up.
- Oh, there you are.
Look at that.
All right.
Don't worry about that.
I'll fix that before I leave.
You look very handsome.
- Thanks, you--
- Yes.
You look nice as well.
Well, okay, I think that's about enough of that.
- All right?
- Enough of--I'm sorry?
Well, I am married.
So...
I work for your husband, so...
Yeah.
- Yes, right.
- Yeah.
So we'll just keep this between us for now.
And I won't say anything about it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
- Keep what--
- Oh, "plug it in the hole,"
and "grab my cord," and "you're very attractive."
Oh, wow.
I understand how those feelings can come up.
You probably don't have that much exposure to someone like me.
Which I understand.
But in this country, you know, it's not appropriate for me to flirt with every tom, dick, or hari.
Oh, no, I'm from Philadelphia.
I was born here.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- I just--I wanna be clear here.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm not attracted to you.
I just--
- Oh, good.
All right.
- Yeah, I don't know.
I don't know, maybe it's-- it's weird.
Because "a," I don't feel anything with you.
I don't know, maybe it's cause you're, like, my mom's age.
Well, I hardly think I'm your mother's age.
Possibly your mother's much younger sister, by a generation, anyway.
Um, okay, do we wanna, um...
But very smart of you to say,
"no, I'm not attracted." For the record.
- But I won't tell kip, anyway.
- Okay, good.
- Yes.
- Good.
What do you wanna test?
Oh!
Well, I have a client, all right?
Who is, um...
Almost engaged, or sexually involved with a woman who is possibly his sister.
So let's see if you can't...
Be looking into the-- you know, into your computer.
- Okay.
- All right.
And tell me about how in love you are with your sister, and...
You know.
Certain of those sexual exploits.
Now what button do I push to record?
Have I done that yet?
You're just gonna wanna-- here, you just gotta...
Here...
Will there be a light?
Just take this, and...
There you go.
You just wanna hit "return,"
which is the same as "accept."
Mm-hmm.
Now there's no light or anything.
So no one would even know that I'm recording.
- No, there just isn't.
- Okay.
Okay, so you want me to pretend that I want to sleep with my sister?
Right, that's what this-- that's what it's going to be about, so...
Uh, okay.
Wow, that's weird.
But I will give it a shot.
Okay, so we're in therapy.
All right, um...
But, look at-- but we won't be--
I'm not in the same room with my client, obviously.
I don't wanna go anywhere near that.
Yeah, okay.
Yes, you're looking into your computer.
- Okay.
All right.
- As am I.
And this is how we're able to relate to each other.
Okay.
Hey, Dr. Wallace.
Yes, hello.
Um, I have this problem, and it's--
I wanna sleep with my sister.
Oh, kamal.
How old is your sister?
- My sister is three.
- Oh.
Yes.
All right.

It doesn't-- it doesn't help me as much as I thought.

Great news.
Uh, we're actually celebrating.
- Yeah.
- Oh.
I don't know why we're celebrating.
It's all covered with soy sauce.
I can't even eat gluten, so that's great.
What, since when can't you eat gluten?
Since the stress of finding out that you're my sister has given me celiac disease.
Well, actually, that's what we're celebrating.
A couple of weeks ago, before our first session,
I swabbed your cheek, inside your cheek, in the middle of the night and I sent it to a DNA lab.
And it turns out that we're not related.
Take your hand off my shoulder.
- Do not touch me.
- Why are you-- all right.
Don't panic, everybody.
I cannot believe that you would swab me in the middle of the night without my knowing it.
I understand, I really do understand how you feel.
But I did it for us, Jerome.
I did it so that we could be together.
What--may I ask which DNA lab you used?
I--I don't know.
I can't remember.
I don't know.
- You don't know?
- I found it on the Internet.
It's only the most important thing in your life, and then you don't know which lab you used.
- It was 100% conclusive.
- But that's very telling.
That we were not related.
Well, was it called acme?
Was there a little roadrunner?
And a coyote on the label?
Do you understand?
Because if it was...
I think you're mocking me.
Then that's not 100% conclusive.
No, I'm not mocking you.
I'm just saying it's all relative.
Yeah.
And we believe what we want to believe.
You know who's a relative?
I'll tell you who's relative.
- You and me.
- I am not your relative.
- I don't believe you.
- I'm not your relative.
- Why can't you just love me?
- Well, you're fighting like brother and sister right now.
- Well, I--
- Which is interesting.
I think we're splitting hairs here.
It was 100% conclusive.
What about the sperm donor?
The numbers matched, I thought.
Oh, that actually-- 'cause I sent that in too.
That was actually wrong.
It was just a printing error.
The last two numbers--
Jerome made a mistake, in other words.
Jerome made a mistake, yeah.
I don't blame him.
I don't blame him.
Because I love you, and I try to understand you.
But--but it's fine now, because...
We're not related.
So we can proceed.
- Jerome.
- Well...
We're not related, but-- yes, I've heard that.
Thank you very much.
I'm having trouble.
Yet, in another attempt for you to manufacture an interesting personality for yourself, you have now created all kinds of bigger problems for those around you.
All right?
- I did not make that-- you have drawn a young woman into a relationship with you who is perfectly wonderful.
And then the minute you're threatened by any kind of intimacy, well, you're related.
And then that draws me in too, wanting to treat you, and to interest investors into my modality for therapy that they want to franchise.
Not in small part based on the fact that I may have a couple who is siblings.
Who are siblings.
Forgive me.
In my hysterical state, my grammar has flown out the window!
I'm beside myself, Jerome.
I really am.
There was a lot riding on this.
I'm sorry.
I...
I need to think.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?
Why did you do it in front of her?
Because I knew that you wouldn't be able to accept it.
No, I can't trust you anymore.
That's the problem.
And you should have asked me about getting the DNA test.
- All right, okay.
- This is therapy.
I think where-- you've gotta let me get through this, all right?
I'm going to have to fix you two quickly so we can get past this silliness and move on.
So, Jerome, clearly, you are craving a mother's attention that you never received.
All right?
Which is why that, every time a woman is the least bit interested, you reject her out of hand.
And Haley, well, clearly you were raised by two lesbians, okay?
Neither one of them is a man, no matter how mannish either one of them was.
All right?
And so that's why, when you find a man who is so unavailable emotionally, you can't keep yourself away because it's the only thing familiar.
In other words, you two have been essentially created for each other.
So let's go from there, all right?
Yeah.
- Wow.
- Okay.
Now, I have fixed you, as far as I'm concerned.
And what I would like in return is for you to spend the next six sessions fulfilling the commitment I made to my investor to deliver a story about half-siblings who have found themselves in love and in a relationship and how they navigate those murky waters,
regardless of the results of a DNA test.
- Uh, okay.
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you.
All right, I'll see you again next week, then.
And if there's some kind of sexual story, that would be good.

Hi, Fiona.
Hello, Richard.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
I haven't slept very much since Thursday.
Mm.
It was weird when you showed up at morimoto's.
Well, it's my husband's favorite restaurant.
It's not like I've never been there before.
So I simply had plans to be there.
I didn't see him there.
Well, I wasn't with him.
I was meeting a friend.
I didn't see a friend.
Well, she didn't show up, as it turns out.
So you just were there.
Yeah, it was...
It was...
I mean, I liked it.
But I think that it put Sheila off when you joined us.
Well, my friend didn't show up.
And, you know, the only polite thing to do was to invite me to come over.
And you did.
Or, you know, allowed me to.
And when I invited myself over, you said "yes."
- Yeah, I--
- Didn't have to say "yes."
I don't-
- I don't know.
I just think that we-- she sounds very passive-aggressive to me.
Well-- in addition to all the myriad of other problems.
Well, you told her that.
And I think that she felt like you were judging her.
Well, now, I said "please don't be passive-aggressive."
Yeah.
"If you're uncomfortable, or feel threatened by me in any way because of our history."
Yeah, but then you-- that's very direct.
I know, I'm just-- believe me, I understand.
But I think that, from her point of view, what upset her the most, probably, was when you said, "what do you think, fatty?"
Well, nicknames are usually a nice icebreaker.
- So I'm sorry.
- Well...
In this instant, I think it hurt her feelings.
Well, let me put it this way.
I think it's wonderful that you don't have a requirement that the woman you're with is attractive.
So, you know, that's-- that's really big of you.
That's wonderful.
- In all fairness--
- There's more to you, you know.
So of course she was a little threatened, you know?
I don't go to a nice restaurant wearing a track suit, or, you know, what have you.
No, you looked like a million bucks.
Thank you, well...
I have to ask you something.
I do have to ask you this.
Did you, when we left, did you put your gum in her hair?
What a ridiculous-- put my gum in her hair?
I...
I...
Well, I mean, you honestly...
I told her!
Think I took it out of my mouth, like some vulgarian?
- No, I don't.
- Threw it in her hair?
No, I told her that you would not do that.
You are starting to fall down the rabbit hole yourself, my friend.
And that is from spending a lot of intimate time with a person who is...
Sadly unbalanced.
- Yeah.
- All right.
You know, I will admit that I was pleasantly surprised that my friend hadn't shown up, so I had the opportunity to join you so I could see how you interact as a couple.
Well, she's usually really fun.
I think that it was weird because you were sitting on my side of the booth.
And--and we were just laughing and I think she felt excluded, I-- well, if she would contribute something to the conversation,
I gladly would have engaged her.
Well, she did let us use her berries when you wanted to feed them to me, and--
- They were delicious.
- They were.
And I thought you should try.
She wasn't making any attempt...
- She doesn't like berries.
- To feed you berries.
She doesn't like berries.
Maybe you do.
Is it all about her?
And her needs and what she likes?
Oh, Sheila doesn't like oxygen.
Shall we all drop dead?
Yeah.
- It's not her fault.
- No.
She has an imbalance, and she needs a great deal of help.
Is this the person you want to spend eternity with?
It's something you need to think about.
I've thought about it, actually.
Because I told her that I had to back out.
Back out of the dinner?
Relationship?
Well, I had proposed to her, and then we got into a big fight afterwards.
And I told her that I, uh...
I was breaking it off.
And she got mad, and she was...
She...
Well, she got mad.
That's the first normal response she's given to any-- that's appropriate.
Grant her that.
Then I had to help cut the gum out of her hair.
Mm.
It's just been a confusing time since Sheila left.
I think about you.
All the time.
Um...
I love you.
I think I love you.
Well, here we are with a classic case of transference.
What is that?
Well, that is when the patient transfers phantom feelings onto the therapist.
- Phantom feelings?
- They're not actionable.
It would be very irresponsible of me to acknowledge them as actual feelings.
- They are feelings.
- They're not actual feelings.
They are actual-- they're not actionable feelings.

You didn't give him any drugs.
No, I never touch the stuff.
He took me to some place up on Signal Hill.
What do you know about that house on signal hill?

Her husband is Tommy Windsor, of the t.
W. Group.
Why would your wife be renting a house on signal hill?

Yeah, good morning Randy.
Now this is the same Tommy Windsor whose wife died last year, isn't it?
And they say she, she was murdered.
But we've gotta be clear here, there's never been an arrest made.
I do know the police, though, are looking at a person of interest, I believe his name is Christian Doyle, if I'm not mistaken.
Yeah, uh, Christian Doyle, it was all over the news.

Police are now on the scene and have cordoned off the Plaza area to begin their investigation into this tragic incident.
What began as an angry pro...
What the hell is this?
Dad, what are you doing?
He's been working on that night for six months since
Christian disappeared.
What?
Christian didn't kill Tommy's wife, Tommy framed him.
I'm convinced of that.
We've got a slightly bigger problem right now, like who killed Tommy Windsor.
Well it couldn't have been Christian.
Tommy Windsor had his share of enemies, like there's
Destiny, the working girl.
She helped frame Christian.
Destiny was Tommy's mistress on the side.
Yeah, and that probably turned sour.
And then there's a whole slew of investors who Tommy ripped off in his land deals, someone in there could be looking for blood.
What about Bartlett and Morgan, his old law firm, I mean, they would want to quiet him.
What did he say to you, when you saw him?
He said something about a silent partner, but honestly, he was acting like a crazy person.
He was digging through Tommy Windsor's garbage for God's sake!
Silent partner?
Yeah, he said the silent partner could clear his name.
If there's a silent partner, Tommy Windsor would have been the only one who knew who they were.
Well, we all know what happened to him.
Look, Christian confronts Tommy, maybe, there's a fight...
Jake, do you think Christian could have done this?
Could he have... could he have thrown Tommy out that window?
I hope not dad.
Honestly, I do.
Every cop in town will be after him.
We've got to get to
Christian first.
Come on.
Hey, sorry I'm late.
Job for you.
Sort through all that, see what you can find.
How come I always get the garbage, man?
Christian was looking for something, will you find it?
Okay.
Hey, hey!
Not in here.
It stinks.
Ugh... [Leslie] So, Tommy Windsor beats the rap on all these fraud charges, and then he supermans himself out the window.
Guilty conscience?
Not likely.
So who would have helped him along?
Well jumpers usually remove all their valuables before they leap.
He didn't even take off his glasses.
Good to see you focused for a change.
It's about time.
Focused?
When have I not been focused?
Well I don't know how you can think straight with all these men on the line.
Hi, uh, I can't talk right now.
'Kay, right, I'll ah, I'll be quick, um, there's ah, a dinner party this weekend and I would kinda like you to be my date.
Oh yeah?
Date, like...
Yeah, uh, public.
Uh, official.
Call you my gal, or, or, or the like.
In, in front of people, you know?
Um.
Gotta go.
Well look at this.
Security spotted someone on the loading docks, and entering the building.
Christian Doyle.
You'd better believe it.
Love what he's done with the place.
He was always the tidy one.
Your room was the one that needed an exterminator.
Yeah, you just like him better.
You always have.
What is this?
Shredded documents from the t.
W. Group.
It's lists of investors, names, numbers, addresses, everything.
Christian pieced these together by hand.
He was always very patient.
Oh, God.
Pass it to me.
Just relax, it's not prescription, it's antacid.
Safe to say that he's probably off the crack.
Oh, silent partners.
He's narrowed it down to one.
But who is he?
How the hell should I know?
Phone numbers, one's a pizza place, once you have Rose, check on the other one.
Yeah.
Hey hon, need you to find a street address for a number.
Well hello there.
Yeah.
Jake.
Bad time?
Oh, no no, it's a great time.
How's married life?
Yeah, uh, we should probably talk about that.
Yeah, we should, because I'm kind of ah, an authority when it comes to marriage and I just want to know the parameters.
The parameters, right.
Yeah, first of all, does he have a gun?
Jake.
Second of all, does he like to watch?
Because I'm really not into that.
We're separated.
Third of all, does he want me to watch ye, because, unless he's a woman, yeh...
Okay, we haven't been together for years.
We just, we haven't gotten the divorce.
Ah, the delayed split.
That's always a bad sign.
Okay, I'm calling about your brother.
Everyone in town is hunting him.
Let me help you.
I have no idea what you're talking about, but, uh, I appreciate the offer.
I'm serious, Jake.
So am I, I do appreciate it.
Thank you.
Come on.
Word on the street is somebody's been hanging out with
Dylan a little.
I'm not getting any action.
I need to live vicariously through others.
One night, I got him to drive me to bantam and park.
Nice.
And?
And, I got out and I walked the rest of the way.
Uh, pass me that screwdriver?
Why'd you walk home?
No, not the Phillips, the Robertson.
Because, unlike you, I don't want Johnny drug dealer knowing where I live.
What are you doing anyway?
I'm trying to wind back your hydro meter so this place isn't such a heat score.
Have you checked your bill lately?
Woah!
And we need to step up security in here before somebody
Jacks these plants.
I found muddy footprints in the back yard and all along the side of the house.
Chill!
That's a bit intense, Tinny.
Figure out a way to pay that bill.
It's fine.
They don't get uppity about the bill for a couple of months.
By then we'll be paid.
Chantal, that bill is a massive red flag.
They will notify the cops.
Heads up, we've got company.
Stop right there, please.
How can we help you, sergeant?
Where's Christian?
My brother Christian?
He's back in town?
That's weird, he didn't call or write, very strange of him.
When was the last time you saw your son, Mal?
Been a while, not sure why he'd come back now.
Maybe to help Tommy Windsor jump out of a building.
Watch your mouth!
What I...
I think he meant to say was...
"Watch your mouth."
Jake, Tommy was hit with a blunt object when he went out the window.
This is murder.
Your brother has a grudge against the deceased, and we've got photo evidence of him entering the building moments before.
What?
Okay dad, it's true, Christian's back in town, I was gonna tell you.
Thanks for ruining the surprise.
We need to speak with Christian.
Yeah, well ah, if we hear from him, we'll let you know sergeant.
Dan.
Let's get out of here, now.
What number did Rose say it was again?
215, it should be on the right here.
Trudy Spencer.
Who the hell's Trudy Spencer?
Whoever she is, Christian called her again and again.
Rose checked with the motel manager.
We need to protect him.
Jake, if he did this, I don't know what I'll do.
Let's just wait and see how things play out, alright?
Don't start confessing to any murders that you didn't commit.
Get out of my house, I won't tell anyone, just get out.
If you don't come through for me I'm gonna...
I don't!
Who the girl be?
It's Destiny, call girl.
Aka Trudy Spencer, yep, let's go.
Christian.
Come on buddy, we got... you stay with Destiny,
I'll go after him!
Destiny?
Destiny, wait.
Hey!
Let go of me!
Not possible.
Look, it's not "Destiny" these days.
Sorry.
Trudy.
We need to talk [Trudy Spencer] Yeah, there's nothing to talk about.
When was the last time you saw Tommy Windsor?
On TV earlier, kissing the sidewalk outside his office.
Couldn't have happened to a nicer man.
Do you know who this man is?
He did business with Tommy.
I don't know who he is, but he's a weirdo.
Now leave me alone, please, I just want to leave all this behind me.
Okay!
Alright, alright, enough.
What do you want?
Seriously.
Was this necessary?
Jake, I know what I'm doing.
Yeah, well forgive me for not exactly buying that.
Looking good, buttons.
Yeah?
Well this is not looking good.
Okay?
It's actually looking pretty crazy.
I didn't kill Tommy.
Look, I went to talk to the guy, he was...
I didn't get to the elevator before he hit the ground!
You've got to believe me.
You're killing dad, you know that?
Seriously, he's like, reached his breaking point here.
What's this, a guilt trip?
I'm trying to clear my name.
That car's been following me everywhere.
This thing is bigger than me.
I'm just a fall guy.
Let's get out of here.
Now.
You look good.
I mean, you look better, you know, than the last time I saw you.
You mean, ah, when I was in the hospital suffering two heart attacks?
Yeah, just, I'm really glad that you're okay.
So, life on the lamb.
Not everything you thought it would be, huh?
It wasn't like that.
I don't know what else to do for you, son.
I've tried everything.
First with the drugs...
I'm clean.
Now with this whole mess you're in, I'm not sure...
I don't know what I can do to help you here, if I even can help you.
I didn't want to drag you into this.
I'm your father!
I'm in it whether I like it or not.
Did you kill Tommy Windsor?
Tell me, does it even matter what I say right now?
Would you believe me?
I'm trying, my son, I'm trying.
But you need to tell me everything the cops are gonna find out, everything!
Well, I've been through his house, I've been through his car, so my fingerprints are on everything.
Cops gonna have no.
Oh good.
So glad we had this chat.
So... how we doing?
Fine.
Never better.
Des.
Jake.
I think I got something.
See, I told you there's gold in garbage.
What do you got?
Uh, there's a cheque and that Windsor guy tried to destroy it, but, but I did a chemical analysis and did a handwriting study, uh...
Des, get to the point.
Okay, I just, I just taped it back together.
It's for 200,000 dollars and it's made out to some guy, Durham Fowler.
Hello?
Hello?
Ja...
Jake?
Durham Fowler, you ever hear of him?
Yeah, Durham Fowler, the silent partner.
Rich as sin, never leaves the house so they say.
Old merchant money.
Any idea why Tommy Windsor'd be writing him a cheque for 200 grand?
Told you, he's the partner, I narrowed it down to this guy.
That's what I was going to talk to Tommy about but...
Hey!
Where you going?
I've gotta make contact with Durham Fowler!
Look, he's the only guy alive that can clear my name.
Christian, don't be a dick smack alright?
Every cop and frigging security guard in the country is looking for you right now.
I'll go take care of it, you two, you know, bond or whatever.
Hello?
Durham?
Durham Fowl...
Oh, ah.
Holy crap you're still alive.
Okay, ah, okay, ah, just, just ah, just hang on!
Okay buddy, come here.
Okay, stay with me buddy.
♪Yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah♪
So, you think he's going to make it?
They tell me it's touch and go.
Lucky guy, you just happened to be on his property.
Yeah, it's a total fluke.
So what were you doing there?
Well, I was out for a run, you know, 'cause I exercise a lot, and I heard a commotion.
Saved his life.
Question is, what are you doing here, now?
Your brother's in a lot of trouble, Jake, I'm trying to help you.
Oh, are you trying to help me as the crown prosecutor, or...
I am an officer of the court, and a professional, and let's not confuse our personal relationship with what's going on here.
So we do have a personal relationship, that's good to know.
Your brother needs to turn himself in or things are going to get a lot worse.
Durham Fowler tried to take his own life, maybe he did it because he felt guilty for killing Tommy Windsor.
Is that Chanel?
Hm.
Bulgari.
I'm serious, Jake.
Put your hands on the steering wheel where I can see them.
Good girl.
Now why are you following me?
I'm not following you.
Really?
Then why are we seeing so much of each other?
Fate, is it?
Some say everything happens for a reason.
Well Durham Fowler's almost dead, what's the reason for that?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
See, I saw you leave his house just before I found him hanging from the rafters.
You try to kill him?
Of course not.
Look, I found him hanging at the beams, I got out of there.
Dialing 911, too much trouble for you.
Hmph, a man's business is a man's business, even if it is killing himself.
Wow, that is probably the sweetest thing I've ever heard,
Michelle...
Richmond.
Says there you work at Bartlett and Morgan.
That's my brother's old law firm.
What is this?
What's a lawyer doing with a police scanner in her purse?
Our firm's prepared to defend your brother, free of charge.
Wow, I misjudged you.
Yeah, dad, if a, you know, fairly attractive lawyer comes calling, don't let her in.
Durham Fowler still alive?
Barely.
And he's not saying much, that's for sure.
There's something about this lawyer lady, we'd better look into her.
I've got to tell you, I don't really trust her.
Was that Jake?
Where is he?
You've got to let me help him with this!
Are you out of your mind?
Your face is plastered on every TV set in the province!
Sit tight.
You need a fix, don't you?
Right.
Nice.
You're using again.
Dad, you've gotta believe me.
Look, since I've been back I've been going to NA.
Narcotics anonymous.
Go, go check it out if you want.
I'm known as Phil from Halifax.
Look, just try and be patient.
Let me and Jake handle this.
If you want to share, share with me, but you're not leaving here.
Fine.
Uh, nice digs.
What are you doing here?
I heard about your uncle, I thought maybe, you might need a shoulder to lean on.
How do you know where I live?
I've been texting you, and you haven't been texting me back, so I decided to come and find you.
Yeah, well the first shirtless pic was cool, but after twelve it started to get a little weird.
Just, just a little bit of fun.
You can't be here.
Get out.
Okay I ah, I just wanted to give you that.
It's a little advance, I know how operating fees can add up, so...
Thanks, but no thanks.
I don't like to count my clones before they mature.
Just take the money.
No.
Oh, hello there.
Hey.
Hey.
Ah, you must be Rose, Tinny told me all about you.
Did she really?
Yeah.
And you've gotta be, ah, Jake.
Who is this and why is he saying my name?
I'm Dylan Noseworthy, sir.
And he was just leaving.
Good.
Good bye.
Ah, I, I'll see you around.
Yeah.
'Kay, see you guys.
See you around.
Everything okay?
Everything's fine, and we don't need to have a big discussion about it.
Uh, I looked up Michelle Richmond on the website of the firm and she has no photo there, but this is interesting, that she's an environmental lawyer.
An environmental lawyer?
Yeah.
I think it's time we gave Michelle Richmond a little call.
Bartlett and Morgan, how may I help you?
Uh, hi, can I speak with Michelle Richmond please?
It's society, she's expecting my call.
Hello, who is this please?
Are you in your ah, office in St. John's?
No, Toronto.
So you're in Toronto.
Listen, I don't know who this is...
Oh, God, okay so the woman you saw is not Michelle
Richmond, who is she and what role is she playing in this?
I don't know, but whoever it was, I saw her leaving Durham
Fowler's house.
Yeah.
Dad.
I need you to meet me.
He told me he's clean.
Been going to meetings.
I'm starting to believe him.
Yeah.
This is where I found ah, Durham Fowler, hanging from the rafters there.
Methuselah.
A cognac that you or I will never taste as long as we live.
Speak for yourself.
Methuselah was the oldest guy in the Bible.
He was 969.
A last drink for Durham before he tried to hang himself?
Didn't even finish it.
Sin.
Dad, look at this.
What did he do, jump up into the noose?
Someone tried to hang him and I bet you it was that ah, mystery girl I saw leaving here.
Got those burn marks on the rafter, that could have been from when you hauled him down.
Or from when someone hauled him up.
Yep, got rope burns on the banister.
Bet he got his head in the noose on the ground, rope goes over the rafter, around the banister to give a little leverage.
Question is, was Durham awake when all this happened?
Because if he was...
He'd be the prime witness to his own attempted murder.
Hey-y, Mr. Fowler.
Remember me?
You got a second to talk, can we ask you a few questions?
Mr. Fowler, squeeze once for yes, twice for no, you understand?
Good.
Did you intend to commit suicide?
What'd he say?
No.
Someone tried to kill you?
Do you know who it was?
You do?
Christian Doyle.
♪oh yeah!
♪
Hey.
So what, first you save the guy then you try and kill him?
Yeah, that's my style, killing old folks.
Then what are you doing here?
We think someone tried to kill Durham Fowler.
And why would you think that?
Because before he dropped into a coma, he told us.
It was staged.
Staged by who?
We don't know yet, we didn't get that far.
If you guys are keeping anything from me, I'm not even close to being in the mood.
Leslie, this is my brother we're talking about, so honestly?
We're going to do whatever it takes.
Okay, fair enough.
So will I, Jake.
Sooner or later, they're going to find him, or we'll have to turn him in, even for his own safety.
Well that's a good idea if he's innocent, but if he's not...
He is innocent.
All right.
You just stay with Christian, there's one person in all this that's had some answers.
I just need one more from her.
Did you pay the hydro?
Yeah, part of it.
My mom pays 50 bucks a month online.
50?
The bill is almost 800.
'Kay, come here.
I want you to take this and pay off the rest.
Woah!
Where'd you get this?
From Dylan.
Really?
Now I know you must be hooking up.
It has nothing to do with that.
It's an advance on the deal.
Totally.
Okay, we're going to go to the bank right now, I'm going to watch you pay it.
Christian?
Christian?
Hey Destiny, what are you at?
I need to talk to you.
Trudy, garbage day isn't 'till Tuesday.
Don't worry, I got it.
Just go back inside, okay?
I am not Destiny anymore, don't call me that.
I'll call you whatever you want, just answer a few questions, all right?
Do you know this woman?
She might have worked for Tommy.
Never heard of her.
I saw her leaving Durham Fowler's house just before I found him hanging from the rafters, and she's been here, right outside your house, watching you, so look again.
Are you sure?
Tommy knew a lot of people.
Now I don't know anything else, so could you just leave me and my 'nan alone, please?
Alright, Tommy.
What's this now?
Huh.
Security number.
Doctor almond to e.
R., doctor almond to the E.R.
Leslie.
Are you at the hospital?
Go to Durham Fowler's room.
I think he's about to be killed.
Jake, he's all ready dead.
She was at that hospital and she killed Durham Fowler in his bed.
Yeah, but who is she?
She's a hit...
Man, woman, whatever.
Tommy Windsor must have hired her to tie up loose ends.
Tommy Windsor's dead.
Why is she still on the job?
She's conscientious?
They used this to communicate.
There's only one phone number on it, I called it, she answered, plus there's four text messages on there.
Yeah, we've got l.W.
About 9 months ago.
Lucy Windsor.
Yeah, about a month ago, we got d.F.
Durham Fowler.
G.S. About two weeks ago.
Who's that?
And then about a week ago we had c.
D. Dear God, it's Christian Doyle.
It's a hit list.
Durham wasn't putting the finger on
Christian, he was trying to warn us.
Okay, we've got to find Christian before she does.
You all right there, skipper?
Tommy Windsor hired this woman to kill Durham, but she didn't kill Tommy.
It's still possible Christian could...
Okay you just breathe, all right?
I have a pretty good idea where I'll find Christian, you stay here.
Malachy, honey, you got, you gotta take it easy on this.
Gonna kill you.
What if Christian killed him?
Tommy Windsor?
He could have.
No, honey, don't.
Don't think like that.
I've got to check something out.
I need to know he's not lying to me.
Okay, this is for you, alright?
But I need it.
I really need this.
Christian!
Jake, this is not what you think.
Oh yeah?
Hey buddy!
Douchebag, what are you selling?
I'm not paying him for drugs, I'm paying him for information.
You have to come with me.
Hey, buddy the meth dealer is Destiny's ex-pimp.
I don't care!
Someone is trying to kill you, you have to let me help you, here.
No, I'm sick of this.
I'm a grown man, and I'm your older brother, I don't need you running in trying to save me every time.
Jake!
You all right?
Oh!
Oh, yeah, fantastic.
Is anything broken?
Everything, I think.
Come on, cops are going to be here any minute.
Hey.
What the hell?
You're a marked man.
Tommy Windsor hired a hit man, hit woman, whatever, to tie up loose ends and you're next on the list.
Safest place for you to be is in jail.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
You're calling the cops!
Yeah.
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.
I'll figure this out.
Yeah, Leslie, I've got an old friend that I'd like you to see.
♪Yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah♪
You want to know if this guy was here?
Yeah, or if you'd seen him around at any other meetings.
You know, they call it narcotics anonymous for a reason.
I know.
But I need to find out.
Are you his boss or something?
No.
You a cop?
Look, take this, he's not in any trouble, I just need to know.
We don't work that way.
He's my son.
I'll take the 50, for the coffee fund.
Phil from
Halifax, right?
Yeah, he's been coming, regular as clockwork for a while, except for the last few days.
Well, hopefully he'll be back.
He's got a ways to go, that one.
Hey.
Hey.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing, I um...
I just, I slipped.
What's this?
You okay?
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?
What about you and your little twilight friend?
Dylan.
It's nothing.
It's so not a big deal.
Okay.
Look, Tinny, I know you know what you're doing.
I do.
But you should know that I...
I run a background check on every little creep that shows up to the door looking for you.
You do.
I do.
I've been doing it since you were in, you know, junior high and started looking like a girl, girl.
Dylan, he's got quite a rap sheet to his name.
Like what?
Possession... of drugs.
Break and enters.
Seems he has a habit of ripping off local grow ops in and around town.
It doesn't matter, you know.
I'm done with it.
He's a loser.
I figured.
But Tinny, men are tools, Tinny, and boys are even worse, all right?
Women are the superior species so... trust your instincts.
All right.
I'm on it.
Promise?
Yeah.
I trust that.
Oh!
Attention dispatch, this is car 204 reporting transfer of prisoner Christian Doyle to 134 Kenmount Road.
Repeat, transfer,
Christian Doyle to 134 Kenmount Road, subject extremely sensitive, over and out.
Who is this?
Please don't shoot.
Okay, I know you could kill me if you wanted, obviously, right?
And ah, I didn't, ah, lure you here to have you arrested or anything.
Actually, I need a favour.
Okay, let me rephrase that!
You want to make a deal?
I don't make deals.
Just hear me out.
I'm unarmed.
This is the phone your client used to make contact with you.
He's dead.
How did you get this?
Now, I have a feeling you had no idea Tommy Windsor was your client.
I'm pretty sure you didn't kill him.
It'd be bad for business.
To kill your client, yes.
So... [Michelle] So?
Turn around.
Turn around!
Your brother and that hooker are two very lucky people.
Okay, obviously you're a consummate professional, I get that, and you like to finish what you start, I'm kind of like that too, you know, in fact I felt like we had some chemistry
back then earlier when we met, you know, that first time?
I thought maybe we could talk about this over a drink, and you could not kill me.
Hello?
♪Oh yeah!
♪
She just left ya?
Yep.
That was a foolish thing to do.
Would have ended up losing both sons, one to a bullet and one to jail.
Yeah, well you didn't and now you've got both of us around for the rest of your life to get on your nerves.
Where's that file, you know, with the list of Tommy Windsor's investors?
There, Des already went through it all.
Ah, okay, the assassin lady, right?
She said "both your brother and the hooker are lucky to be alive.
" What was on that list, you know?
The hit list, the text messages.
What were the initials on it that we couldn't figure out?
G.S.
G.S. What's Trudy short for?
Gertrude.
Gertrude Spencer.
G.S.
You know, I have this cop friend, and ah, she told me that an extraordinary amount of people get caught because they actually throw the murder weapon in their own garbage. 260 thousand dollars, that's a lot of money.
Must have been quite a sting when Tommy Windsor ripped off your nest egg.
Pretty sure that's his blood, and your fingerprints will be all over this.
The other bookend?
You left it in Tommy's office.
I didn't go there to kill him.
I really thought he'd give me my money back.
You earned that money the hard way, huh?
Tommy said he was trying to get it back, but I knew he was lying.
In the meantime, he said "here's 250 dollars" and he slid it across the desk to me for old time's sake.
He's a class act, that Tommy Windsor.
I hit him before I knew what I was doing.
He threw the chair at me and it went out the window, and then he lunged at me again, and I hit him again, and he stumbled back, and he just fell out.
Um, Trudy, you don't have a lot of options here.
I'm pretty sure you know what you need to do.
I'm sorry for what I did to your brother.
He didn't do anything.
I'll tell the cops.
Thank you.
I'll catch a cab back to the motel.
Probably a different motel.
Hey, I was thinking, um, maybe I could borrow a couple bucks.
What?
Sorry, that was a, a bad joke.
Too soon?
Yeah, maybe.
Um, your old room?
Still empty since Jake moved out.
I'm glad to see you don't think I'm going to steal your jewellery or whatever.
For crack?
Well uh, jury's still out on that one, so we'll see.
Look,
Christian, I'm sorry for doubting you.
Stay the night.
Yeah.
What the hell?
I'll make us some eggs.
Sound good?
You okay?
Yes.

Wow, I'm surprised, thought you forgot how to use a phone.

I'm glad that he's cleared.
I am.
Yeah.
Well, thank you.
And I'm glad that you're not, you know, living with your husband.
And about all that, you know, I'm sorry.
I just, heh, it's none of my business, right?
And I've been married myself, and I'm the last person in the world that can judge anybody, believe me.
Thank you.
So when am I gonna see you again?
Okay, do I ever get to see you again?
Better question.
Thanks for the shirt.

For my daughter Itzayana (the one with the expressive eyes), the seed of my love for my wife and cinema.
Who is it?
Good evening, I need a room.
Not at this hour.
If you want a room, come tomorrow.
I'm begging you.
How much?
It's 180,000 pesos.
But I can't show you the room at this time.
Look, I can pay three months' in advance.
It's 180,000.
For three... it'll be 540,000 pesos.
Utilities are included, but the kitchen and bathroom are shared.
And I lock the door at 10:30 p.m.
Okay, but please let me in quick.
- Don't you have more stuff?
- No.
Come in.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Can I use the bathroom?
See if it's free.
Thanks.
Hey!
There's a cockroach in the bathroom.
Kill it.
Good morning.
SALESWOMAN WANTED, 18 TO 25
Good morning.
- Hi.
Can I help you?
- Are you taking resumes?
No, we don't need staff at the moment.
- It's not because of my age, right?
- No.
Of course not.
But if you'd like to leave me your resume, maybe if something comes up...
Oh yes, thanks.
I really appreciate it.
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Hey!
Oh my God.
What happened?
Let me get this.
Let me see.
What happened?
You're drunk.
Come on.
Come on, hold onto me.
Get hold of me.
Fine, stay there.
- No no no.
- What?
Leave it on.
Leave it on.
Morning.
There's no hot water.
Mm, how about that?
And so...?
So take a cold shower.
- Hi Mom.
- I'm coming down.
What happened?
He hit you?
Cheated on you?
No, Mom.
You know, when your dad and I were young, we had a really big argument.
It was a rainy night, but I decided to pack my stuff and leave him.
But when I went to get on the bus back to Tunja, he stopped me and convinced me not to leave him.
The next day we found out that the bus I was going to take had crashed and many people were killed and injured.
That day we realized we had to stay together for life... until death do us part.
But sleeping in different rooms, no?
But under the same roof.
Look, Mom, all I ask is that you let me stay here until I find a job.
My love, this is your home, but you belong with Mario.
Please call him.
I'm going to take a shower.
- Hi Mom.
- Mario is downstairs waiting for you.
What are you talking about?
Why?
Talk to him, okay?
Okay.
Tell him I'm coming.
Well, I'll leave you alone, so you can talk.
- How are you?
- Fine.
And you?
Fine.
Here.
Thanks.
They're beautiful.
Karen, I have to tell you...
I'm a fool.
Sometimes I say things that I don't mean.
I've come to apologize.
I know we are in a crisis.
I know that if we both try harder, we can make things better than before.
Look, let's go out to dinner... so we can relax and talk.
What do you think?
Hey, I've been waiting for awhile now.
It's not a problem.
I can wait for you.
I'm waiting for you.
Bye.
- Mario, how are you?
- Sandra, what are you doing here?
- I'm meeting a friend, but he's late.
- This is my wife.
- Hi.
I'm Sandra.
- Nice to meet you.
I'm Karen.
Well, why don't you join us while you wait for your friend?
- All right.
- Okay, come on.
House red wine.
- Three glasses?
- Yes, please.
A glass of white for me, please.
Sure.
Excuse me.
Hello.
What's up?
Okay.
No no no, not a problem.
Okay.
Bye.
Thanks.
It seems that my friend has a problem and can't make it.
Well, looks like you'll have to join us.
No, I don't want to impose.
It's not a problem, is it, darling?
Well, let's order.
Well, I know you gave the quote.
Full or basic coverage?
Full coverage, of course.
You know.
I included injury, coverage against losses, even coverage for heavy machinery.
- And they approved?
- What do you think, Mario?
Wonderful!
Well, then let's toast to that lucrative commission.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
And what exactly is this business?
Well, company stuff-- High-risk insurance, heavy machinery, you know.
And by the way, Karen, what do you do?
At the moment I'm a housewife.
I love reading.
I'm reading Ibsen's "A Doll's House" at the moment.
- Do you know it?
- Yes, of course-- the play.
It's the same author who wrote "The Glass Menagerie" right?
- No, that was Tennessee Williams.
- Ah, of course.
Tennessee Williams.
You know "A Doll's House," darling, right?
I don't know anything about novels.
You know, honey...
We're talking about plays, Mario.
See?
I have no idea!
Don't forget the appointment on Monday with the clients to see whether they accept the offer.
Oh yes, I got the message.
At 9:00, right?
Yes, at 9.00.
Karen.
Karen.
Mario, I want a divorce.
I need to be alone.
I need to be my own person.
Alone...
So tell me one thing, Karen.
How will you manage on your own?
You cannot do anything.
Can you get me my jacket, please?
You know what?
I have done everything I could.
If you want to go, just go.
This is the last chance I will give you.
I don't want to see you coming back asking for forgiveness.
What would you say if I offered you an English course completely free for the first three months?
Would you take it?
- Well, yeah.
Yes.
- That's precisely what you have to do-- offer people free English courses.
Simple as that.
But I don't understand.
I offer courses for free?
Obviously, people have to buy the materials, like in any other school.
It's simple.
So when will I start?
First, I have to test you.
I will give you three forms.
If you get at least three clients, you'll be hired immediately.
And you pay me for the test, right?
Not exactly-- not with money, but you'll be employed by us.
Let me give you some advice.
I don't do it for anybody.
I'm doing it for you because I like you.
Why don't you start with your family?
Your uncles, your cousins-- they can help you.
And then you would be officially hired straight away.
Okay.
I'm going to try.
Thank you very much.
Good morning, sir.
How are you?
I'm here on behalf of American Dream.
I'm offering really good English courses...
- No.
I'm not interested right now.
- The first three months are free.
Thanks, but not now.
Thanks.
- I can give you a form.
- Not now.
I'm busy.
Okay.
Thanks.
But this is a special offer-- the first three months for free.
Okay.
Thanks.
Well, maybe, if you explain it to me.
My English is really bad.
I completely understand.
This is why we are offering these courses.
If you let me in, I can explain everything to you.
Just tell me when you want to start.
But you're sure that we don't have to pay anything up front?
Completely sure.
Shall we fill in the form?
- Okay.
- Perfect.
- What is the boy's name?
- Alejandro.
Would you like a form?
NO SOLICITING
Can I give you a form?
Are you interested?
No.
Okay, thanks.
Hi.
I broke the key.
That's just what I needed.
I don't know if I have something to open it.
What have you done to it?
I'm going to ring the bell.
I'm sorry.
Magda doesn't open the door at this hour.
Give me my handbag.
Hey!
Where are you going?
Let's go.
Okay, I've found someone who can help us out.
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.
Hey, thanks for the other night.
Do you want a beer?
No thanks.
You've already done a lot for me.
If I had to pay for it, I wouldn't have asked.
Honestly.
Barmaid!
Two beers, please.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
And you really don't know anybody around here?
No, I don't know anybody here.
That's strange, because you're married, right?
Or aren't you?
The ring is just an accessory?
No.
But I don't want to talk about it now.
It's funny.
I knew that you would be like that.
- Like what?
- Like that, like you are.
Why?
What do you mean?
Because of your haircut.
- And now you are a psychic?
- I'm a hair stylist.
- You finally call me, eh, blondie?
- Hi honey.
Karen, this is my boyfriend who I told you about before.
Look,
I'm going to ask you two favors:
first, don't get in too late;
second, don't have parties.
Hey, but give me some money, please.
Okay.
How much?
Well, I have a guest.
Okay, I have to go.
What's going on?
I thought the guy in the car was your boyfriend.
Oh, no.
I wish he was my boyfriend.
He's married.
So who was that guy?
That's just an idiot that I use for money now and then.
No, we haven't asked for anything else.
The guys at the bar bought you them.
- No, but we don't want--
- Excuse me, but they've already paid.
What's wrong with you?
It's free beer.
Just put on your best smile.
- Karen, Karen.
- Listen...
- Well, thank you very much.
- We can come in for awhile, no?
The sun is rising.
Come on, just a little while.
- We had a good time, didn't we?
- No, no.
Really.
That's enough.
- Karen.
- I'll have a last sip.
Karen.
Well, thanks a lot.
Really.
- Keep in touch.
- I'll call you.
- See you later.
- Bye, Karen.
- We had a good time.
No complaints.
- I'll never be able to get rid of him.
Look, honey, lesson one.
You never give your real number.
Otherwise, you can't shake them off.
Come on, that's shameless.
Just a little bit.
And Horacio?
He's at work.
So it's not a problem.
No, miss.
Thank you.
I haven't even asked you yet.
Please.
No, thanks.
Not at the moment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
At the moment, no.
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.
The lunch options are Ajiaco, Mondongo, vegetable soup and the main course.
I'll have the vegetable soup and the main course, please.
Sure.
One order of vegetable soup with main dish.
Hurry up, girl!
- Something wrong, ma'am?
- My bag has been stolen.
- You're sure it was here?
- I'm sure.
I arrived, and I hung it here when I sat down.
It was a big, black leather bag.
I have no money to pay you.
What?
And so?
What do we do?
Look, I'll leave you my ring as a guarantee and tomorrow I'll come and pay, okay?
- Until tomorrow only.
- Yes, sir.
I promise.
"No money to pay."
- Thank you very much.
- Eating for free.
I know that's the rules, but you told me one thing
I know that's the rules, but you told me one thing and now you're saying another.
Now I need to sell two more courses?
This is a scam.
You're misleading people.
I'm going to sue.
Stay here if you want to be ripped off.
Now you'll fly over there.
Oh, you broke your back.
- Hi!
- Hi.
- What's your name?
- Karen.
And yours?
- Sergio.
- How old are you?
- Five.
- Guess how old I am.
- 16?
- Don't bother the lady.
- I'm not bothering her!
- He isn't bothering me.
Don't worry.
- Bye, Sergio.
- Come on, son.
My apologies.
- Alejandro, some cigarettes, please.
- Sure, Mr. Enrique.
I'll give them to you right away.
Hello.
Excuse me.
My bag was stolen and I have no money to take the bus.
Can you help me out?
- No.
I don't have any money.
- Thanks.
- Look.
Take it.
- Thank you so much.
Really, thanks.
Hi, ma'am, excuse me.
My bag was stolen.
Can you spare me any money for the bus?
Can you spare me any money for the bus?
Thank you very much.
Thanks.
Thank you very much.
God bless you.
- My purse was stolen.
- I have no money.
- You need money?
- Yes.
- My pleasure.
- Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you.
No, honey, that's all I've got.
I've only got enough for the bus.
I'm sorry.
They've stolen my wallet.
Can you give me money for the bus?
I need 100 pesos more to pay for the bus.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Can you spare some change?
Or a bite?
Don't bother the customers.
Go away!
Karen.
Are you there?
It's open.
I was asleep.
Alberto chose to stay with his wife tonight.
Today is my birthday and I don't want to spend it bored and alone.
And Horacio?
Working.
- Do you have plans for tonight?
- No.
I'm going to stay here.
You want to join me?
Look, I'm all dressed up.
I was supposed to have a date with Alberto, but he stood me up... on my birthday.
Change your face!
- I don't like all this, Patricia!
- What?
I don't like it.
I don't like this music.
I don't like the crowds.
Here.
Come on, come on, come on.
Drink it all-- all of it.
All of it, all of it.
Okay, but with you-- a toast to your birthday.
Okay, sounds good.
Cheers!
To my birthday!
To you!
- Drink drink drink.
- No, I don't want it.
Karen!
It's for my birthday!
It's a gift.
- Come on, move.
- I don't know how to dance to this.
You're gonna fall asleep on me.
No, sir.
Have another drink.
I like to see you like this!
Bottoms up.
Feel better?
I feel ugly... and old.
You're not ugly or old.
You are a very pretty woman.
I think what you need is a guy who loves you as you deserve.
No, Patricia, I don't need that.
Of course you do.
One nail drives out another.
I speak from experience.
I was also in love.
The only man I ever loved in my life, I think.
And when it was over, I thought I was going to die.
But before long I met another guy and I moved on.
And what about Horacio and Alberto?
That's different.
It's not love.
I'm not going to give anyone else my heart for them to fuck with it.
Have you never done it just for pleasure?
I've only ever slept with my husband.
And you loved him?
Listen.
You have to take all these things that you're feeling now and use them to your own advantage.
You are a very pretty and smart woman.
Don't be afraid of living life and taking risks... like I do.
Well, see you tomorrow.
I'm going to sleep now.
See you tomorrow.
Hello.
My bag was stolen.
Can you spare me some money for the bus?
Thanks a lot.
Thanks a lot.
Hello.
My bag was stolen.
Can you spare me some money for the bus?
I don't have anything-- just my own change.
I'm so glad to see you, honey.
Alberto has asked us to go out tonight.
What do you mean he asked "us" to go out tonight?
Well, I think it's a good idea.
No, Patricia, I can't, really.
You have nothing to do tonight, so don't tell me you can't.
Karen, just for a bit.
How exactly do you think I can go out when I can't even afford to eat breakfast?
Come on, I'm going to get you something nice to eat and then after that we can look for jobs.
Okay.
You go and I'll catch up with you later.
Okay, but don't be too long.
Well, honey, it's better than nothing.
It's not the best job in the world, but at least you can make some money.
I'll look out for something better and let you know.
- Thanks.
- I have to go to work now.
I'm late.
- Okay, thanks.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Goodbye.
- You're welcome.
Bye.
Karen?
Karen!
- Hi.
- Hi!
- How are you?
- Nice to see you.
- How are you?
- Fine fine.
And you?
- What are you doing here?
- I've just come from the office.
- And you?
How's life?
- Fine.
I'm just walking about.
- It's so nice around here.
- Yeah, it's nice.
- You got married, right?
- Yes, I got married.
I did.
- And you?
How's life treating you?
- Fine fine.
I have two girls, I'm married.
Actually, I'm in a bit of a rush right now.
Give me your mobile number and I'll call you.
Mafe, you know what?
I lost my phone
- and haven't got a new one yet.
- Your home number, then.
Actually, I just moved.
I haven't got a landline yet.
Give me your card and I'll call you.
Yes, yes, sure.
Let me give you my card.
Let me give you my business card.
Listen, the extension number, my office number and the last one is my mobile.
- Perfect.
I'll call you.
- Call me.
- Sure.
Nice to see you.
- Same.
- Bye, Karen.
- Bye.
Truth is, Eduardo and I met in college when he was studying engineering.
But you never finished the course.
Why?
I studied engineering because my dad wanted another engineer in the family.
But after a year I realized that it wasn't what I wanted to do.
No no no.
Sorry to interrupt Eduardo, but that's not true.
Ladies, what really happened is that Eduardo is a bohemian, an avid writer.
He prefers being in front of a computer or a typewriter, occupied with things that only he understands.
Is this not true?
Yes, I like writing.
I decided to dedicate myself to literature, but it's not a big deal.
Honestly, you should dedicate yourself to something else.
Reading is so boring.
People don't like it.
Okay, so what do you like doing then?
I don't know, but something active and exciting.
But imagine yourself just sitting there turning pages.
What a drag!
I agree.
I love extreme sports.
In fact, I've recently started skydiving.
You know what?
One of these days we should all go together.
- What do you think?
- No.
- Karen?
Let's go!
- No, thanks.
- So how did it go with the flyers?
- Fine.
And what did you think of the guy that Alberto brought for you?
- All right.
- Do you like him or not?
Charming, that's all.
I thought he was pretty boring.
Did you see his old-school haircut?
He looks like a granddad.
No, darling.
Patricia, that's not important.
Don't be silly.
And what about Alberto, eh?
Gorgeous, no?
- He invited us to his apartment.
- No, I'm not going.
- What about his wife?
- Why not?
That cow is away somewhere.
I don't know, I don't care.
No, Patricia, I'm not going.
Seriously.
Yes, you are.
Come on.
I promise next time I'll tell Alberto to bring you someone decent.
Because that guy, no.
There will be no "next time."
Finally!
Hold this.
We must come back, no?
- I'll pay by card, okay?
- Yes, sir.
- And can you clear the table?
Thanks.
- Okay.
- Can I take this to go, please?
- Sure.
For a homeless kid who lives near us.
Congratulations on the beautiful apartment, Alberto.
- Make yourself at home.
- Gorgeous.
I love the fireplace.
Really?
And you haven't even seen the bedroom yet.
- You want to see it?
- Show me.
- Okay.
Make yourselves at home, guys.
- Have fun.
- Thanks.
- Patricia, don't be too long.
- Which way?
- Right there.
- Alberto, don't be too long.
- Okay.
Do you want to hear music?
Let me see what's around here.
Let me see.
Nothing.
There's nothing good to listen to.
Well, I'm not so sure about that.
- Are we going to the terrace?
- Fine, it's okay.
What are you writing at the moment?
- I've just finished a play.
- Really?
- Yes.
- When I was at school, I loved acting.
We performed "La Celestina" and I played Melibea.
- Really?
And are you still acting?
- No.
And even if I did it again, I'd have to be Celestina.
Look at me.
Please, don't exaggerate.
But you would like to act again?
I'd love to.
Really.
Okay.
And what are you doing now?
Do you really want to know?
If you don't mind.
I am... painting my life...
- repainting it.
- Nice.
Really.
Yes.
It's difficult, but I'm getting there.
- Hey, what's up?
- Hi.
- What's up, blondie?
- Everything's okay.
- Okay.
- This is my friend.
- You'll look out for her, right?
- Of course.
Obviously, blondie!
I've seen you before at the bus stops.
Here's a present for you.
Thanks.
Where've you been?
- Why are you getting home so late?
- What are you doing here?
What do you mean?
I've been waiting for you.
Where've you been?
With Karen, can't you see?
Who were you with?
Why didn't you pick up your phone?
I didn't pick up because I couldn't.
Really?
Why couldn't you?
Who were you with?
Horacio, let's talk tomorrow, okay?
Let's talk tomorrow?
Why can't we talk now?
It's already "tomorrow."
Have you seen the time?
Exactly.
We're really tired, so let's talk tomorrow.
Why won't you tell me who you were with, blondie?
Hey!
Why won't you tell me who you were with?
I was with five guys!
Why do you treat me like this?
Let's talk tomorrow, okay?
Talk about what?
You're right.
I've had it with you.
Fuck off.
Don't follow me or call me.
Fuck off!
- Come on, baby, don't be like that.
- Don't "baby" me.
Fuck off.
Let's talk, okay?
Come on, I've been waiting for you for five hours.
I don't care how long you've been waiting.
Can't you see I want to go to sleep?
Fuck off.
Aren't you embarrassed in front of Karen?
Get lost, Horacio.
You know what I'm capable of.
Don't make me think any worse of you.
Just go away and do whatever you want.
You're not scaring me with this nonsense.
Get lost.
Idiot.
Fuck off, Horacio!
You'll see.
Please come with me, ma'am.
We have to search you.
In your underwear, please.
How are we going to resolve this?
Because you have to pay me three times the cost of the things you stole.
Sir, I have no money.
It's simple.
Call a relative, a friend, somebody to bring you the money.
I don't know anybody around here.
Okay, then I have no option but to call the police.
No, please.
I'm begging you, sir.
What did you steal?
Deodorant and some sanitary towels.
You know what?
Just go.
Just go, but don't ever come to this supermarket again, you hear me?
Hello.
Are you leaving?
Where are you going?
Very nice, very nice.
- That puppet was awesome.
- Yeah, really good.
But I think he was flirting with you.
Well, I have a certain charm.
Don't you think?
Without a doubt.
So I'll see you again, won't I?
- Yes, of course.
- Okay.
Do you know the East Tower?
Well, my office is on the roof.
I'm there Monday through Friday in the afternoon.
You can come whenever you want without an appointment.
- I'll surprise you.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Excuse me, ma'am.
What's wrong?
Oh, sir, somebody stole my bag and left me with nothing.
- But are you okay?
Did they harm you?
- No, I'm fine.
Be patient.
Anyway, you can get the material things back.
I can help you out, if you like.
I'd really appreciate it if you could, because I need to get home.
Thank you, sir.
Goodbye.
Thanks.
Done.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
- Have you chosen, honey?
- Yes.
I like this.
What?
It's okay, I like it.
Come on.
You'll look gorgeous.
I hope so.
Move your hair, please.
And how is Alberto?
He asked me to move in with him.
Can I tell you something?
- I feel really sorry for his wife.
- No.
Why sorry?
That woman is horrible to him.
- Ready?
- Do it.
You know what?
I've never been to Monserrate.
Really?
Would you like to come with me?
No.
Why?
You don't know the story?
What do you mean?
What?
They say that couples who go to Monserrate will never get married.
Well, I think I'm going to close the office for today.
I want to take you somewhere.
Bring me the bill, please.
Thanks.
But this one's on me.
No.
Yes.
A long time ago we looked like shadows.
I know, darling.
I know.
Where is it?
I don't know, darling.
I don't know.
I gave it to you to look after on the first day,
- the same day that I accepted you.
- I know, darling.
I know.
Then where the hell have you put it?
!
If it weren't for this, we would be free.
- I don't know, darling.
- Shut up!
Don't call me that!
I haven't been your darling for a long time now.
And yet, I can't get away from here.
I need to find her.
If you tell me, I swear to you I'll forget all the bad memories.
But if we don't find her, the bad ones will destroy the good ones... and then I'm going to hate you for the rest of my life.
If I could take somebody's hand...
If I could ask somebody where she is.
Help me!
Do you know where she is?
But how could you know?
You don't even exist.
You are the same as me-- the same.
I have only you.
So how did you like it?
I loved it.
Congratulations.
You're brilliant.
- Thank you very much.
- Well done, Pedro.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Buddy, this is your play, your baby, and finally it's seen the light of day!
- Congratulations, buddy.
- Thank you.
- Hang on.
Eduardo, you wrote this play?
- Yes.
He didn't tell you?
This man is the creator of the masterpiece you have just seen.
- But you brought it to life.
- A minor role.
Everyone, here is our star writer!
- Hello.
- Hi everyone.
- Hi Eduardo.
How are you?
- Fine.
You were really good, Lorena.
- Congratulations to you too.
- Thank you.
- Oh, this is Karen.
- Hi Karen.
How are you?
- How are you?
Nice to meet you.
- Did you like the play?
- Very good.
Congratulations.
- Thank you very much for coming.
Are you staying here for awhile this evening?
Yes, of course.
Honestly, I can't.
I have to work tomorrow.
No, don't say that.
Your boyfriend is a genius.
Pedro's direction was really good.
You were great as well;
and the guys, excellent.
Thank you so much.
- Excuse me one moment.
Persuade her.
- Of course.
Karen, you can't go.
We have to celebrate.
You don't have a choice!
Well, here we are.
Goodbye.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Bye.
Do you want to come in?
- Welcome to my home.
- Thanks.
What are you thinking about?
About the great time I had with you tonight.
Thanks for coming with me, really- honestly.
- I had a really good time as well.
Hold on.
What's going on?
Let's do it with it on.
No.
Take it off.
Wait.
What's the problem?
They're so small.
What are you talking about?
You look great to me.
- Really?
- Really.
Patricia.
Patricia!
Mrs. Magda!
Hello.
What happened, huh?
I'm ashamed that you've seen me like this.
Don't be silly.
You've seen me worse.
Was it because of Alberto?
Look at me.
Remember that you are a really beautiful person, full of life.
You're-- you're a wonderful person... and you'll get over it, right?
That's not true.
What do you mean?
I'm not even blonde.
I'm a fake.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
- Hello.
- Hi Mom.
Say hello to your mommy.
- Go to say hello to your mommy!
- Mom, don't force her.
I'll see you in a little while, okay?
- Nice to meet you.
- Goodbye.
I don't know how to run so slowly.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Let's go son.
Sir!
Your wallet!
Ah, my wallet!
Come on, run!
Run and get it from her.
Come on, son.
Hello.
- You're so kind.
Have a nice day.
- Goodbye.
And the little duck has arrived.
Little missy?
Very good.
One, two, three.
Very good.
Come for the little duck.
- Kisses for the duck!
- Very good.
I'm going to put this one here.
The other is for your mom.
Come here, Patricia.
For your mom.
We put this one here, you see?
Patricia, why didn't you tell me?
Because it's not easy.
That'll be my mom.
I'll get the door.
Where?
- I'm coming.
- Grandma is here.
- So you live here.
- What do you want?
- To talk to you.
- About what?
I need to talk.
I promise to leave after that.
Please.
Let's go.
- At your service.
What would you like?
- Two cappuccinos, please.
We don't have cappuccino.
Just black coffee or latte.
- Okay, two lattes.
- Sure.
- I'll have a beer, instead of a latte.
- Sure.
Karen, I know that I made a lot of mistakes... that I wasn't a good husband,
- that...
- Don't apologize, please.
Our marriage was a mistake.
I was never the woman for you.
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
You look good with short hair.
- And how's business?
- Fine fine.
I finished the thing I was working on with Sandra and, well, now we're waiting for other projects.
And are you working?
I'm doing this and that around here.
And your ring?
You're not wearing it.
Do you want to know the truth?
Are you seeing someone?
Listen...
I had to pawn the ring because I had no money to pay for a meal.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- And... our relationship was over before I left, wasn't it?
Shall we get the bill?
Ma'am.
The bill.
- How much is it?
- 3,000 pesos.
Let me get it.
- My pleasure, please come again.
- Thank you.
Well, when will I see you again?
I don't know Mario.
I'll call you sometime, okay?
- Okay.
- Goodbye.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Someone called for you.
- Who?
They called from the bookstore where you left your resume, to offer you a job.
They want you to get over there as soon as possible.
Thanks.
Bye.
I'll see you later.
Okay, good luck.
Hello.
You know I hate it when people turn up late.
Yes yes.
I'm sorry.
But I had to do some things at the last minute and I couldn't call you.
But let's not argue about it.
Yes, you're right.
I have good news.
Me too!
No.
You tell me first.
I got a job in a bookstore.
That's good.
I'm so happy.
It's like everything is beginning to fall into place.
I'm so happy for you.
And what's your news?
I've been hired to go write in Argentina.
- Because you sent them the play?
- Yes.
- Wow, I'm impressed!
- Thank you.
But there's a second part--
I want you to come with me.
Look, it's perfect.
It's the chance we've been waiting for, an opportunity to be together, away from everything.
You're right.
Let's go?
Let's go.
- I like you better with long hair.
- Come on, Mom!
Mario misses you a lot.
I'm here to say goodbye.
- Where are you going?
- To Argentina.
And Mario?
My relationship with Mario was over a long time ago, Mom.
You have to understand.
I knew it.
He's absolutely right.
You're going crazy.
Think, please!
You will never understand me, right?
You know what, Mom?
I love you.
But I'm leaving.
And I'll be fine.
Really.
Give me a hug.
You know what?
I'm feeling bad about leaving the bookstore.
Don't worry about that.
With my income in Argentina we have enough for both of us.
Can you pass me my jacket, please?
I can't.

SALESWOMAN WANTED, 18 TO 25
Good morning.
- Hi.
Can I help you?
- Are you taking resumes?
No, we don't need staff at the moment.
- It's not because of my age, right?
- No.
Of course not.
But if you'd Iike to leave me your resume, maybe if something comes up...
Oh yes, thanks.
I really appreciate it.
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Hey!
Oh my God.
What happened?
Let me get this.
Let me see.
What happened?
You're drunk.
Come on.
Come on, hold onto me.
Get hold of me.
Fine, stay there.
- No no no.
- What?
Leave it on.
Leave it on.
Morning.
There's no hot water.
Mm, how about that?
And so...?
So take a cold shower.
- Hi Mom.
- I'm coming down.
What happened?
He hit you?
Cheated on you?
No, Mom.
You know, when your dad and I were young, we had a really big argument.
It was a rainy night, but I decided to pack my stuff and leave him.
But when I went to get on the bus back to Tunja, he stopped me and convinced me not to leave him.
The next day we found out that the bus I was going to take had crashed
and many people were killed and injured.
That day we realized we had to stay together for life... until death do us part.
But sleeping in different rooms, no?
But under the same roof.
Look, Mom, all I ask is that you let me stay here until I find a job.
My love, this is your home, but you belong with Mario.
please call him.
I'm going to take a shower.
- Hi Mom.
- Mario is downstairs waiting for you.
What are you talking about?
Why?
talk to him, okay?
Okay.
tell him I'm coming.
well, I'II leave you alone, so you can talk.
- How are you?
- Fine.
And you?
Fine.
Here.
Thanks.
They're beautiful.
Karen, I have to tell you...
I'm a fool.
Sometimes I say things that I don't mean.
I've come to apologize.
I know we are in a crisis.
I know that if we both try harder, we can make things better than before.
Look, Iet's go out to dinner... so we can relax and talk.
What do you think?
Hey, I've been waiting for awhile now.
It's not a problem.
I can wait for you.
I'm waiting for you.
Bye.
- Mario, how are you?
- Sandra, what are you doing here?
- I'm meeting a friend, but he's late.
- This is my wife.
- Hi.
I'm Sandra.
- Nice to meet you.
I'm Karen.
well, why don't you join us while you wait for your friend?
- AII right.
- Okay, come on.
House red wine.
- Three glasses?
- Yes, please.
A glass of white for me, please.
Sure.
Excuse me.
hello.
What's up?
Okay.
No no no, not a problem.
Okay.
Bye.
Thanks.
It seems that my friend has a problem and can't make it.
well, looks like you'II have to join us.
No, I don't want to impose.
It's not a problem, is it, darling?
well, Iet's order.
well, I know you gave the quote.
full or basic coverage?
full coverage, of course.
You know.
I included injury, coverage against losses, even coverage for heavy machinery.
- And they approved?
- What do you think, Mario?
wonderful!
well, then let's toast to that lucrative commission.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
And what exactly is this business?
well, company stuff-- High-risk insurance, heavy machinery, you know.
And by the way, Karen, what do you do?
At the moment I'm a housewife.
I Iove reading.
I'm reading Ibsen's "A doll's House" at the moment.
- Do you know it?
- Yes, of course-- the play.
It's the same author who wrote "The glass Menagerie" right?
- No, that was Tennessee williams.
- Ah, of course.
Tennessee williams.
You know "A doll's House," darling, right?
I don't know anything about novels.
You know, honey...
We're talking about plays, Mario.
See?
I have no idea!
Don't forget the appointment on Monday with the clients to see whether they accept the offer.
Oh yes, I got the message.
At 9:00, right?
Yes, at 9.00.
Karen.
Karen.
Mario, I want a divorce.
I need to be alone.
I need to be my own person.
alone...
So tell me one thing, Karen.
How will you manage on your own?
You cannot do anything.
Can you get me my jacket, please?
You know what?
I have done everything I couId.
If you want to go, just go.
This is the Iast chance I will give you.
I don't want to see you coming back asking for forgiveness.
What would you say if I offered you an english course completely free for the first three months?
would you take it?
- well, yeah.
Yes.
- That's precisely what you have to do-- offer people free english courses.
simple as that.
But I don't understand.
I offer courses for free?
obviously, people have to buy the materials, Iike in any other school.
It's simple.
So when will I start?
First, I have to test you.
I will give you three forms.
If you get at Ieast three clients, you'II be hired immediately.
And you pay me for the test, right?
Not exactIy-- not with money, but you'II be employed by us.
Let me give you some advice.
I don't do it for anybody.
I'm doing it for you because I Iike you.
Why don't you start with your family?
Your uncles, your cousins-- they can help you.
And then you would be officially hired straight away.
Okay.
I'm going to try.
Thank you very much.
Good morning, sir.
How are you?
I'm here on behalf of American Dream.
Good morning, sir.
How are you?
I'm here on behalf of American Dream.
I'm offering really good english courses...
- No.
I'm not interested right now.

Thanks, but not now.
Thanks.
- I can give you a form.
- Not now.
I'm busy.
Okay.
Thanks.
But this is a special offer-- the first three months for free.
Okay.
Thanks.
well, maybe, if you explain it to me.
My english is really bad.
I completely understand.
This is why we are offering these courses.
If you let me in, I can explain everything to you.
Just tell me when you want to start.
But you're sure that we don't have to pay anything up front?
completely sure.
shall we fill in the form?
- Okay.
- Perfect.

- alejandro.
would you Iike a form?
NO SOLICITING
Can I give you a form?
Are you interested?
No.
Okay, thanks.
Hi.
I broke the key.
That's just what I needed.
I don't know if I have something to open it.
What have you done to it?
I'm going to ring the bell.
I'm sorry.
Magda doesn't open the door at this hour.
Give me my handbag.
Hey!
Where are you going?
Let's go.
Okay, I've found someone who can help us out.
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.
Hey, thanks for the other night.
Do you want a beer?
No thanks.
You've already done a Iot for me.
If I had to pay for it, I wouldn't have asked.
honestly.
Barmaid!
Two beers, please.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
And you really don't know anybody around here?
No, I don't know anybody here.
That's strange, because you're married, right?
Or aren't you?
The ring is just an accessory?
No.
But I don't want to talk about it now.
It's funny.
I knew that you would be like that.
- Like what?
- Like that, Iike you are.
Why?
What do you mean?
Because of your haircut.
- And now you are a psychic?
- I'm a hair stylist.
- You finally call me, eh, blondie?
- Hi honey.
Karen, this is my boyfriend who I told you about before.
Look,
I'm going to ask you two favors:
first, don't get in too late;
second, don't have parties.
Hey, but give me some money, please.
Okay.
How much?
well, I have a guest.
Okay, I have to go.
What's going on?
I thought the guy in the car was your boyfriend.
Oh, no.
I wish he was my boyfriend.
He's married.
So who was that guy?
That's just an idiot that I use for money now and then.
No, we haven't asked for anything else.
The guys at the bar bought you them.
- No, but we don't want--
- Excuse me, but they've already paid.
What's wrong with you?
It's free beer.
Just put on your best smile.
- Karen, Karen.
- Listen...
- well, thank you very much.
- We can come in for awhile, no?
The sun is rising.
Come on, just a little while.
- We had a good time, didn't we?
- No, no.
really.
That's enough.
- Karen.
- I'II have a last sip.
Karen.
well, thanks a Iot.
really.
- Keep in touch.
- I'II call you.
- See you later.
- Bye, Karen.
- We had a good time.
No complaints.
- I'II never be able to get rid of him.
Look, honey, lesson one.
You never give your real number.
Otherwise, you can't shake them off.
Come on, that's shameless.
Just a little bit.
And Horacio?
He's at work.
So it's not a problem.
No, miss.
Thank you.
I haven't even asked you yet.
please.
No, thanks.
Not at the moment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
At the moment, no.
- Good afternoon.

The lunch options are Ajiaco, Mondongo, vegetable soup and the main course.
I'II have the vegetable soup and the main course, please.
Sure.
One order of vegetable soup with main dish.
Hurry up, girl!
- Something wrong, ma'am?
- My bag has been stolen.
- You're sure it was here?
- I'm sure.
I arrived, and I hung it here when I sat down.
It was a big, black leather bag.
I have no money to pay you.
What?
And so?
What do we do?
Look, I'II leave you my ring as a guarantee and tomorrow I'II come and pay, okay?
- until tomorrow only.
- Yes, sir.
I promise.
"No money to pay."
- Thank you very much.
- Eating for free.
I know that's the rules, but you told me one thing
I know that's the rules, but you told me one thing and now you're saying another.
Now I need to sell two more courses?
This is a scam.
You're misleading people.
I'm going to sue.
Stay here if you want to be ripped off.
Now you'II fly over there.
Oh, you broke your back.
- Hi!
- Hi.
- What's your name?
- Karen.
And yours?
- Sergio.
- How old are you?
- Five.
- Guess how old I am.
- 16?
- Don't bother the lady.
- I'm not bothering her!
- He isn't bothering me.
Don't worry.
- Bye, Sergio.
- Come on, son.
My apologies.
- alejandro, some cigarettes, please.
- Sure, Mr. Enrique.
I'II give them to you right away.
hello.
Excuse me.
My bag was stolen and I have no money to take the bus.
Can you help me out?
- No.
I don't have any money.
- Thanks.
- Look.
Take it.
- Thank you so much.
really, thanks.
Hi, ma'am, excuse me.
My bag was stolen.
Can you spare me any money for the bus?
Can you spare me any money for the bus?
Thank you very much.
Thanks.
Thank you very much.
God bless you.
- My purse was stolen.
- I have no money.
- You need money?
- Yes.
- My pleasure.
- Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you.
No, honey, that's all I've got.
I've only got enough for the bus.
I'm sorry.
They've stolen my wallet.
Can you give me money for the bus?
I need 100 pesos more to pay for the bus.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Can you spare some change?
Or a bite?
Don't bother the customers.
Go away!
Karen.
Are you there?
It's open.
I was asleep.
alberto chose to stay with his wife tonight.
Today is my birthday and I don't want to spend it bored and alone.
And Horacio?
Working.
- Do you have plans for tonight?
- No.
I'm going to stay here.
You want to join me?
Look, I'm all dressed up.
I was supposed to have a date with AIberto, but he stood me up... on my birthday.
Change your face!
- I don't like all this, Patricia!
- What?
I don't like it.
I don't like this music.
I don't like the crowds.
Here.
Come on, come on, come on.
Drink it aII-- all of it.
AII of it, all of it.
Okay, but with you-- a toast to your birthday.
Okay, sounds good.
Cheers!
To my birthday!
To you!
- Drink drink drink.
- No, I don't want it.
Karen!
It's for my birthday!
It's a gift.
- Come on, move.
- I don't know how to dance to this.
You're gonna fall asleep on me.
No, sir.
Have another drink.
I Iike to see you Iike this!
Bottoms up.
feel better?
I feel ugly... and old.
You're not ugly or old.
You are a very pretty woman.
I think what you need is a guy who loves you as you deserve.
No, Patricia, I don't need that.
Of course you do.
One nail drives out another.
I speak from experience.
I was also in love.
The only man I ever loved in my Iife, I think.
And when it was over, I thought I was going to die.
But before long I met another guy and I moved on.
And what about Horacio and AIberto?
That's different.
It's not love.
I'm not going to give anyone else my heart for them to fuck with it.
Have you never done it just for pleasure?
I've only ever slept with my husband.
And you loved him?
Listen.
You have to take all these things that you're feeling now and use them to your own advantage.
You are a very pretty and smart woman.
Don't be afraid of living life and taking risks...
like I do.
well, see you tomorrow.
I'm going to sleep now.
See you tomorrow.
hello.
My bag was stolen.
Can you spare me some money for the bus?
Thanks a Iot.
Thanks a Iot.
hello.
My bag was stolen.
Can you spare me some money for the bus?
I don't have anything-- just my own change.
I'm so glad to see you, honey.
alberto has asked us to go out tonight.
What do you mean he asked "us" to go out tonight?
well, I think it's a good idea.
No, Patricia, I can't, really.
You have nothing to do tonight, so don't tell me you can't.
Karen, just for a bit.
How exactly do you think I can go out when I can't even afford to eat breakfast?
Come on, I'm going to get you something nice to eat and then after that we can look for jobs.
Okay.
You go and I'II catch up with you later.
Okay, but don't be too long.
well, honey, it's better than nothing.
It's not the best job in the world, but at Ieast you can make some money.
I'II look out for something better and let you know.
- Thanks.
- I have to go to work now.
I'm late.
- Okay, thanks.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Goodbye.
- You're welcome.
Bye.

I haven't got a landline yet.
Give me your card and I'II call you.
Yes, yes, sure.

- Sure.
Nice to see you.
- Same.
- Bye, Karen.
- Bye.
Truth is, Eduardo and I met in college when he was studying engineering.
But you never finished the course.
Why?
I studied engineering because my dad wanted another engineer in the family.
But after a year I realized that it wasn't what I wanted to do.
No no no.
Sorry to interrupt Eduardo, but that's not true.
Ladies, what really happened is that Eduardo is a bohemian, an avid writer.
He prefers being in front of a computer or a typewriter, occupied with things that only he understands.
Is this not true?
Yes, I Iike writing.
I decided to dedicate myself to literature, but it's not a big deal.
honestly, you should dedicate yourself to something else.
Reading is so boring.
people don't like it.
Okay, so what do you Iike doing then?
I don't know, but something active and exciting.
But imagine yourseIfjust sitting there turning pages.
What a drag!
I agree.
I Iove extreme sports.
In fact, I've recently started skydiving.
You know what?
One of these days we should all go together.
- What do you think?
- No.
- Karen?
Let's go!
- No, thanks.
- So how did it go with the flyers?
- Fine.
And what did you think of the guy that AIberto brought for you?
- AII right.
- Do you Iike him or not?
Charming, that's all.
I thought he was pretty boring.
Did you see his oId-schooI haircut?
He looks like a granddad.
No, darling.
Patricia, that's not important.
Don't be silly.
And what about AIberto, eh?
Gorgeous, no?
- He invited us to his apartment.
- No, I'm not going.
- What about his wife?
- Why not?
That cow is away somewhere.
I don't know, I don't care.
No, Patricia, I'm not going.
seriously.
Yes, you are.
Come on.
I promise next time I'II tell AIberto to bring you someone decent.
Because that guy, no.
There will be no "next time."
finally!
hold this.
We must come back, no?
- I'II pay by card, okay?
- Yes, sir.
- And can you clear the table?
Thanks.
- Okay.
- Can I take this to go, please?
- Sure.
For a homeless kid who lives near us.
congratulations on the beautiful apartment, alberto.
- Make yourself at home.
- Gorgeous.
I Iove the fireplace.
really?
And you haven't even seen the bedroom yet.
- You want to see it?
- Show me.
- Okay.
Make yourselves at home, guys.
- Have fun.
- Thanks.
- Patricia, don't be too long.
- Which way?
- Right there.
- AIberto, don't be too long.
- Okay.
Do you want to hear music?
Let me see what's around here.
Let me see.
Nothing.
There's nothing good to listen to.
well, I'm not so sure about that.
- Are we going to the terrace?
- Fine, it's okay.
What are you writing at the moment?
- I've just finished a play.
- really?
- Yes.
- When I was at school, I Ioved acting.
We performed "La CeIestina" and I played MeIibea.
- really?
And are you still acting?
- No.
And even if I did it again, I'd have to be CeIestina.
Look at me.
please, don't exaggerate.
But you would Iike to act again?
I'd love to.
really.
Okay.
And what are you doing now?
Do you really want to know?
If you don't mind.
I am... painting my Iife...
- repainting it.
- Nice.
really.
Yes.
It's difficult, but I'm getting there.
- Hey, what's up?
- Hi.
- What's up, blondie?
- Everything's okay.
- Okay.
- This is my friend.
- You'II look out for her, right?
- Of course.
obviously, blondie!
I've seen you before at the bus stops.
Here's a present for you.
Thanks.
Where've you been?
- Why are you getting home so late?
- What are you doing here?
What do you mean?
I've been waiting for you.
Where've you been?
With Karen, can't you see?
Who were you with?
Why didn't you pick up your phone?
I didn't pick up because I couldn't.
really?
Why couldn't you?
Who were you with?
Horacio, Iet's talk tomorrow, okay?
Let's talk tomorrow?
Why can't we talk now?
It's already "tomorrow."
Have you seen the time?
exactly.
We're really tired, so let's talk tomorrow.
Why won't you tell me who you were with, blondie?
Hey!
Why won't you tell me who you were with?
I was with five guys!
Why do you treat me like this?
Let's talk tomorrow, okay?
talk about what?
You're right.
I've had it with you.
Fuck off.
Don't follow me or call me.
Fuck off!
- Come on, baby, don't be like that.
- Don't "baby" me.
Fuck off.
Let's talk, okay?
Come on, I've been waiting for you for five hours.
I don't care how long you've been waiting.
Can't you see I want to go to sleep?
Fuck off.
Aren't you embarrassed in front of Karen?
Get lost, Horacio.
You know what I'm capable of.
Don't make me think any worse of you.
Just go away and do whatever you want.
You're not scaring me with this nonsense.
Get lost.
Idiot.
Fuck off, Horacio!
You'II see.
please come with me, ma'am.
We have to search you.
In your underwear, please.
How are we going to resolve this?
Because you have to pay me three times the cost of the things you stole.
Sir, I have no money.
It's simple.
call a relative, a friend, somebody to bring you the money.
I don't know anybody around here.
Okay, then I have no option but to call the police.
No, please.
I'm begging you, sir.
What did you steal?
Deodorant and some sanitary towels.
You know what?
Just go.
Just go, but don't ever come to this supermarket again, you hear me?
hello.
Are you leaving?
Where are you going?
Very nice, very nice.
- That puppet was awesome.
- Yeah, really good.
But I think he was flirting with you.
well, I have a certain charm.
Don't you think?
Without a doubt.
So I'II see you again, won't I?
- Yes, of course.
- Okay.
Do you know the East Tower?
well, my office is on the roof.
I'm there Monday through Friday in the afternoon.
You can come whenever you want without an appointment.
- I'II surprise you.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Excuse me, ma'am.
What's wrong?
Oh, sir, somebody stole my bag and left me with nothing.
- But are you okay?
Did they harm you?
- No, I'm fine.
Be patient.
Anyway, you can get the material things back.
I can help you out, if you Iike.
I'd really appreciate it if you could, because I need to get home.
Thank you, sir.
Goodbye.
Thanks.
Done.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
- Have you chosen, honey?
- Yes.
I Iike this.
What?
It's okay, I Iike it.
Come on.
You'II look gorgeous.
I hope so.
Move your hair, please.
And how is AIberto?
He asked me to move in with him.
Can I tell you something?
- I feel really sorry for his wife.
- No.
Why sorry?
That woman is horrible to him.
- Ready?
- Do it.
You know what?
I've never been to Monserrate.
really?
would you Iike to come with me?
No.
Why?
You don't know the story?
What do you mean?
What?
They say that couples who go to Monserrate will never get married.
well, I think I'm going to close the office for today.
I want to take you somewhere.
Bring me the bill, please.
Thanks.
But this one's on me.
No.
Yes.
A long time ago we looked like shadows.
I know, darling.
I know.
Where is it?
I don't know, darling.
I don't know.
I gave it to you to look after on the first day,
- the same day that I accepted you.
- I know, darling.
I know.
Then where the hell have you put it?
!
If it weren't for this, we would be free.
- I don't know, darling.
- Shut up!
Don't call me that!
I haven't been your darling for a Iong time now.
And yet, I can't get away from here.
I need to find her.
If you tell me, I swear to you I'II forget all the bad memories.
But if we don't find her, the bad ones will destroy the good ones... and then I'm going to hate you for the rest of my Iife.
If I couId take somebody's hand...
If I couId ask somebody where she is.
help me!
Do you know where she is?
But how could you know?
You don't even exist.
You are the same as me-- the same.
I have only you.
So how did you Iike it?
I Ioved it.
congratulations.
You're brilliant.
- Thank you very much.
- well done, Pedro.
congratulations.
congratulations.
Buddy, this is your play, your baby, and finally it's seen the light of day!
- congratulations, buddy.
- Thank you.

Eduardo, you wrote this play?
- Yes.
He didn't tell you?
This man is the creator of the masterpiece you have just seen.
- But you brought it to life.
- A minor role.
Everyone, here is our star writer!

Nice to meet you.

Are you staying here for awhile this evening?
Yes, of course.

I have to work tomorrow.
No, don't say that.
Your boyfriend is a genius.
Pedro's direction was really good.
You were great as well;
and the guys, excellent.
Thank you so much.
- Excuse me one moment.
Persuade her.
- Of course.
Karen, you can't go.
We have to celebrate.
You don't have a choice!
well, here we are.
Goodbye.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Bye.
Do you want to come in?

What are you thinking about?
About the great time I had with you tonight.
Thanks for coming with me, reaIIy- honestly.

What's going on?
Let's do it with it on.
No.
Take it off.
Wait.

They're so small.
What are you talking about?
You look great to me.
- really?
- really.
Patricia.
Patricia!
Mrs. Magda!
hello.
What happened, huh?
I'm ashamed that you've seen me like this.
Don't be silly.
You've seen me worse.
Was it because of AIberto?
Look at me.
Remember that you are a really beautiful person, full of Iife.
You're-- you're a wonderful person... and you'II get over it, right?
That's not true.
What do you mean?
I'm not even blonde.
I'm a fake.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
- hello.
- Hi Mom.
Say hello to your mommy.
- Go to say hello to your mommy!
- Mom, don't force her.
I'II see you in a little while, okay?

I don't know how to run so slowly.

Ah, my wallet!
Come on, run!
Run and get it from her.

Very good.
One, two, three.
Very good.
Come for the little duck.
- Kisses for the duck!

I'm going to put this one here.
The other is for your mom.
Come here, Patricia.
For your mom.
We put this one here, you see?
Patricia, why didn't you tell me?
Because it's not easy.
That'II be my mom.
I'II get the door.
Where?

- About what?
I need to talk.
I promise to leave after that.

Let's go.

What would you Iike?
- Two cappuccinos, please.
We don't have cappuccino.
Just black coffee or latte.
- Okay, two lattes.
- Sure.
- I'II have a beer, instead of a latte.
- Sure.
Karen, I know that I made a Iot of mistakes... that I wasn't a good husband,
- that...
- Don't apologize, please.
Our marriage was a mistake.
I was never the woman for you.
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
You look good with short hair.
- And how's business?
- Fine fine.
I finished the thing I was working on with Sandra and, well, now we're waiting for other projects.
And are you working?
I'm doing this and that around here.
And your ring?
You're not wearing it.
Do you want to know the truth?
Are you seeing someone?
Listen...
I had to pawn the ring because I had no money to pay for a meal.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- And... our relationship was over before I Ieft, wasn't it?
shall we get the bill?
Ma'am.
The bill.
- How much is it?
- 3,000 pesos.
Let me get it.
- My pleasure, please come again.
- Thank you.
well, when will I see you again?
I don't know Mario.
I'II call you sometime, okay?
- Okay.
- Goodbye.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Someone called for you.
- Who?
They called from the bookstore where you left your resume, to offer you a job.
They want you to get over there as soon as possible.
Thanks.
Bye.
I'II see you later.
Okay, good luck.
hello.
You know I hate it when people turn up late.
Yes yes.
I'm sorry.
But I had to do some things at the Iast minute and I couldn't call you.
But let's not argue about it.
Yes, you're right.
I have good news.
Me too!
No.
You tell me first.
I got a job in a bookstore.
That's good.
I'm so happy.
It's like everything is beginning to fall into place.
I'm so happy for you.
And what's your news?
I've been hired to go write in Argentina.
- Because you sent them the play?
- Yes.
- Wow, I'm impressed!
- Thank you.
But there's a second part--
I want you to come with me.
Look, it's perfect.
It's the chance we've been waiting for, an opportunity to be together, away from everything.
You're right.
Let's go?
Let's go.
- I Iike you better with long hair.
- Come on, Mom!
Mario misses you a Iot.
I'm here to say goodbye.
- Where are you going?
- To Argentina.
And Mario?
My relationship with Mario was over a Iong time ago, Mom.
You have to understand.
I knew it.
He's absolutely right.
You're going crazy.
Think, please!
You will never understand me, right?
You know what, Mom?
I Iove you.
But I'm leaving.
And I'II be fine.
really.
Give me a hug.
You know what?
I'm feeling bad about leaving the bookstore.
Don't worry about that.
With my income in Argentina we have enough for both of us.
Can you pass me my jacket, please?
I can't.
For my daughter Itzayana (the one with the expressive eyes), the seed of my love for my wife and cinema.
Who is it?
Good evening, I need a room.
Not at this hour.
If you want a room, come tomorrow.
I'm begging you.
How much?
It's 180,000 pesos.
But I can't show you the room at this time.
Look, I can pay three months' in advance.
It's 180,000.
For three... it'II be 540,000 pesos.
utilities are included, but the kitchen and bathroom are shared.
And I lock the door at 10:30 p.m.
Okay, but please let me in quick.
- Don't you have more stuff?
- No.
Come in.
- Good morning.

Can I use the bathroom?
See if it's free.
Thanks.

There's a cockroach in the bathroom.

Good morning.
SALESWOMAN WANTED, 18 TO 25
Good morning.
- Hi.
Can I help you?
- Are you taking resumes?
No, we don't need staff at the moment.
- It's not because of my age, right?
- No.
Of course not.
But if you'd Iike to leave me your resume, maybe if something comes up...
Oh yes, thanks.
I really appreciate it.
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Hey!
Oh my God.
What happened?
Let me get this.
Let me see.
What happened?
You're drunk.
Come on.
Come on, hold onto me.
Get hold of me.
Fine, stay there.
- No no no.
- What?
Leave it on.
Leave it on.
Morning.
There's no hot water.
Mm, how about that?
And so...?
So take a cold shower.
- Hi Mom.
- I'm coming down.
What happened?
He hit you?
Cheated on you?
No, Mom.
You know, when your dad and I were young, we had a really big argument.
It was a rainy night, but I decided to pack my stuff and leave him.
But when I went to get on the bus back to Tunja, he stopped me and convinced me not to leave him.
The next day we found out that the bus I was going to take had crashed and many people were killed and injured.
That day we realized we had to stay together for life... until death do us part.
But sleeping in different rooms, no?
But under the same roof.
Look, Mom, all I ask is that you let me stay here until I find a job.
My love, this is your home, but you belong with Mario.
please call him.
I'm going to take a shower.
- Hi Mom.
- Mario is downstairs waiting for you.
What are you talking about?
Why?
talk to him, okay?
Okay.
tell him I'm coming.
well, I'II leave you alone, so you can talk.
- How are you?
- Fine.
And you?
Fine.
Here.
Thanks.
They're beautiful.
Karen, I have to tell you...
I'm a fool.
Sometimes I say things that I don't mean.
I've come to apologize.
I know we are in a crisis.
I know that if we both try harder, we can make things better than before.
Look, Iet's go out to dinner... so we can relax and talk.
What do you think?
Hey, I've been waiting for awhile now.
It's not a problem.
I can wait for you.
I'm waiting for you.
Bye.
- Mario, how are you?
- Sandra, what are you doing here?
- I'm meeting a friend, but he's late.
- This is my wife.
- Hi.
I'm Sandra.
- Nice to meet you.
I'm Karen.
well, why don't you join us while you wait for your friend?
- AII right.
- Okay, come on.
House red wine.
- Three glasses?
- Yes, please.
A glass of white for me, please.
Sure.
Excuse me.

What's up?
Okay.
No no no, not a problem.
Okay.
Bye.
Thanks.
It seems that my friend has a problem and can't make it.
well, looks like you'II have to join us.
No, I don't want to impose.
It's not a problem, is it, darling?
well, Iet's order.
well, I know you gave the quote.
full or basic coverage?
full coverage, of course.
You know.
I included injury, coverage against losses, even coverage for heavy machinery.
- And they approved?
- What do you think, Mario?
wonderful!
well, then let's toast to that lucrative commission.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
And what exactly is this business?
well, company stuff-- High-risk insurance, heavy machinery, you know.
And by the way, Karen, what do you do?
At the moment I'm a housewife.
I Iove reading.
I'm reading Ibsen's "A doll's House" at the moment.
- Do you know it?
- Yes, of course-- the play.
It's the same author who wrote "The glass Menagerie" right?
- No, that was Tennessee williams.
- Ah, of course.
Tennessee williams.
You know "A doll's House," darling, right?
I don't know anything about novels.
You know, honey...
We're talking about plays, Mario.
See?
I have no idea!
Don't forget the appointment on Monday with the clients to see whether they accept the offer.
Oh yes, I got the message.
At 9:00, right?
Yes, at 9.00.
Karen.
Karen.
Mario, I want a divorce.
I need to be alone.
I need to be my own person.

So tell me one thing, Karen.
How will you manage on your own?
You cannot do anything.
Can you get me my jacket, please?
You know what?
I have done everything I couId.
If you want to go, just go.
This is the Iast chance I will give you.
I don't want to see you coming back asking for forgiveness.
What would you say if I offered you an english course completely free for the first three months?
would you take it?
- well, yeah.
Yes.
- That's precisely what you have to do-- offer people free english courses.
simple as that.
But I don't understand.
I offer courses for free?

It's simple.
So when will I start?
First, I have to test you.
I will give you three forms.
If you get at Ieast three clients, you'II be hired immediately.
And you pay me for the test, right?
Not exactIy-- not with money, but you'II be employed by us.
Let me give you some advice.
I don't do it for anybody.
I'm doing it for you because I Iike you.
Why don't you start with your family?
Your uncles, your cousins-- they can help you.
And then you would be officially hired straight away.
Okay.
I'm going to try.
Thank you very much.
Good morning, sir.
How are you?
I'm here on behalf of American Dream.
