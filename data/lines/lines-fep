Why?
Every day must be the same for him, the whole day in the bed, that's a good life man.
No, not every day is the same for him.
Today is his birthday.
He's been here 2 years now.
I've been here a day and I can't take any more.
Do you want all three of us to play something?
Yeah, how about, hide and seek, Roc hides and we have to find him.
Come on, you're moving rooms.
-What's wrong with this room?
-I said room, I didn't say bad room.
Hey, watch what you say or I may report you for child abuse.
And what about you?
What do you call what you've done?
Apologize to her.
I won't apologize, it was a joke and good one.
Very well, then come on, you have to go for some tests.
-I'm not going home today?
-No, and from what I can see, neither today nor the weekend, you have to do a test that's...
painful, but I'm sure a tough guy like you won't have a problem.
I'll tell them you don't need any anesthetic.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have made that joke.
Satisfied?
-And Roc.
-Roc can't hear me...
Very well, then prepare yourself for unbearable pain.
Okay,
I'm sorry Roc.
-alright now?
-That's better.
Also, I believe I made a mistake, because I think they only have to do an x-ray on you.
Look you're a liar...
Roc, why don't you go and talk to those boys over there?
-But we don't know each other.
-So, go and introduce yourself.
They won't want to be friends, I'm new.
Of course they'll want to be friends, they're children, they'll ask you a question, or some silly test, and they'll immediately think you're a great guy, and they'll want to be friends with you and you'll have a group.
I don't need a group,
I already have the PSP and loads of games to amuse myself.
-Give it here.
-Hey!
Either you start making friends, or you don't get the PSP back.
choose.
Come on.
Hello!
What do you want?
-Nothing, just that I'm new.
-New and lily white.
You look like a snowflake.
I'd like to be friends.
Look Roc, you have to pass a test if you want to be our friend.
Good idea, Do you see that dive platform?
It is very high that platform.
Not that one, the other one.
You'd have to be crazy to jump from there.
Well that's what you have to do, if you want to be friends with us.
Many times a silence is more powerful than ten thousand words.
I'd like to wake up, to tell you that you shouldn't feel guilty.
And leastwise on that day, it wasn't your fault.
-Hey, boss!
Where are you going?
-To radiography, for this boy.
-And where are you off to with Lleó?
-To orthopedics.
To see if we can find a leg to fit him.
-About time, right, Lleó?
Yeah, yeah, maybe wait little longer and I'll even grow a new one.
Whats up?
Did the brakes jam or something?
Relax, imagine we've stopped at a traffic light, eh?
Juanma, come here a minute.
-You're new, aren't you?
-New, but soon I'll be history because I'll be leaving.
Yeah, yeah, everyone says that, what's your name?
Move on kid,
I have a full gang of mates.
I don't want any more friends.
Dammit Mercero, where did you find this asshole, in a pack of idiots?
Whatever his anger may be, it'll pass away soon, buddy, let's go.
It must be a shit not having a leg, right?
It must be a shit not having a brain, right?
- Hello.
- Hello.
How's Jordi, have you heard anything?
No no, not yet, later I'll pass by the operating theater.
You look great.
Jordi's already told me that you're in the group
Yes, it's cool, thanks.
Where are you going now?
-To do some tests.
-What tests?
Nothing, some hospital nonsense.
-Going where?
Yes, some nonsense, a few blood tests, urine in the blood, or blood in the urine, I don't know.
Okay, see you later, good luck with the nonsense.
Bye!
You didn't want to tell her, eh?
No, I don't want to be the first guy she accompanies to try some artificial legs,
She can start off with someone else.
Of course, man.
-Doctor, his vital signs are dropping.
-Shit.
Load the atropine.
Blood please, Merche.
Charging... clear... now.
The sound of death I've heard it often since the day I arrived
Many people don't know it, but that beep could be the sound of death.
Now Jordi, is in that strange place between life and death.
He can end up by returning, going, or remain like me.
The curious thing, is that in this strange state,
I end up by connecting with them.
Somehow, they come to me.
Hello!
Hello!
-Have we met?
-Yes, from sight, at the hospital.
At the hospital?
What hospital?
Where am I?
Look, my name's Roc, and for 2 years I've been in a coma, this, is my daily life,
I'm always here, I like it.
And me?
What am I doing here?
Is this my place?
No, you don't have a place yet, because... because you probably won't remain in a coma and will return.
Listen, can you hear?
They're trying to bring me back.
Yes, and they attempt it with many people, eh!
Do you want to join me?
I've been alone a long time, and it's a bit boring.
Maybe I shouldn't do anything if I have to return.
If they manage to bring you back, they'll do it wet or dry, but at least this way, we enjoy ourselves, right?
One... two... and three!
Look, In case you return, can you do me a favour?
Yeah, sure, what?
Can you speak to my mother?
And tell her tell her it wasn't her fault.
What wasn't her fault?
-In case, she doesn't believe me.
-Of course, just say to her.
Ah, tell her not to stick out her tongue while working,
I always said that someone would steal her tongue,
I was the only one to say that to her, so she'll believe you.
See you around.
Goodbye.
We have him.
He's ours.
Gauze please.
Let's clean this up a bit.
Hi Ivan, Ignasi here...
Yeah, yeah, still at the hospital, but it's nothing, so they'll send me home.
You'll see...
Hey, I wanted to ask you something...
Why don't you visit me?
Yeah, sure, sure.
Hey, Ivan!
Hello?
Wait...
I think I'm losing you.
It think that now...
Shit, I've been cut off.
Do you know that you make a lot of noise with that phone?
-What?
-You've made 23 calls, each time you've been one and a half minutes on average.
My head's about to explode from listening to you so much.
-Sorry, sorry about coming in.
I couldn't get a signal and...
-Besides, why do you call so many people so many times?
It is clear that nobody wants to see you.
Man, that's not why, look, they have things to do and that's it,
I wouldn't be going to see a friend in the hospital if I was out.
Then... perhaps you're not friends.
If you want, you can stay here awhile.
No, the fact is that I've...
I have to...
-To make calls?
Three meters over there please.
Hello Toni.
What?
making new friends?
No, I only like friends, who don't come to to see him and say they have things to do.
If I had phone and he called me, yes maybe we'd be friends.
Look, this man's a police officer and he wants to speak to you,
Well, you'll have to go so that I can take a statement from your grandson.
Oh, no, no, if you want I'll sit here and I won't bother anyone.
No, I'm sorry, these are the rules.
Calm down grandpa, besides, supposing that he is a police officer, I don't have to say anything, right?
Okay.
Listen Toni.
I guess you know why I'm here.
-Because of the motorcycle?
-Exactly, you had an accident with the motorcycle, and we want to know, who gave you permission to take it without a license.
What?
-Was it your grandfather?
-What?
I'm asking you, if it was your grandfather who gave you permission to take the bike.
What are you saying?
It's okay Toni, we'll talk another day.
-What are you doing here?
-You don't lie very well, whenever you lie, you touch your eye.
No Way!
So, today you have to choose the leg that you'll receive, right?
Yes but, I don't have much choice, because my father's run out of cash.
I'll settle for the basic.
And what's the basic?
It's the one that comes with the insurance, the pirate leg.
The pirate leg.
-The terrible pirate leg.
-You know what?
My father always says that when you're going to buy something, the important thing is that they explain everything well, and in the end you always have to say:
I'll return, I have to think about it.
Man, wouldn't it be nice to do that.
But we'd have a good laugh with the feet though.
Let's do it.
I don't know...
Come on, yes, let's do it.
Are you sure?
No, no...
Yes, do it!
do it.
And your father?
He's in Canet.
Look, I've changed my mind.
Show me everything you've got.
Sometimes the hospital, is rather strange,
The same space, and different hopes.
Terminator.
Toni, how did it go?
I acted like a dummy, it always works.
although the worst thing, is not wanting to be in this space,
And not having any emotion inside, because you need the excitement you find outside.
Is this one the leg with dynamic foot, and four-axis hydraulic knee?
Yes, it's the same one, it's the one you've chosen all afternoon.
How long have you been without a leg?
Almost 9 months, like a pregnancy but in reverse, instead of gaining members, I lose them.
These are gorgeous, you look like Terminator 2.
They retail at 26,000 euros.
Hello.
Sorry, I've slept so little that I thought I'd stretch out for a bit.
There are some new developments, if you'd like to accompany me.
Is Jordi okay?
I believe that something happened, but he's okay.
-What?
-He's okay now.
What do you know?
How is he?
-They said something happened.
-Wait here, please.
-What's happened?
-I don't know.
-What happened?
!
-I don't know!
Why weren't you here?
Eh?
Why weren't you here, instead of going to a crappy meeting, to bring peace to a crappy company?
-It's okay, calm down.
Jordi, honey.
How are you?
-Are they taking him to the ICU?
-Yes, 24 hours in observation, and then back to his room.
-How did it go?
-It went very well, almost a record.
You'll be able to see him, as soon as he wakes up.
And they've removed the tumor?
-Completely.
-Thank you.
-Thats good news, eh?
-Yes.
listen...
I have to go to a meeting,
I'll be back tomorrow morning, anything new, call my mobile.
-Why do you have to go?
-I'm sorry, really, but I'm in the middle of a negotiation, and if I don't return...
Go to hell.
At the hospital, sometimes there wasn't time to control ones emotions.
Everything goes fast:
joy, sadness.
I have a feeling, it's because there are so many different emotions in one day, that they must fade out quickly, otherwise, new ones won't be able to come in.
-Jordi.
-Jordi.
-Jordi.
-Jordi.
-Jordi.
-Eh.
He doesn't want to wake up.
Jordi!
Another kiss a kiss a kiss please.
-What's he saying?
-I don't know, a kiss, didn't he?
...a kiss a kiss, please.
-I'm not giving him a kiss.
-Go on, give him one.
This bald guy... just had his leg off.
-Go on.
-Don't.
Yes, man.
Another kiss... go on, another kiss...
I don't know if this guy's asleep or just playing dumb, eh?
Come on, let him rest.
In no time, he'll be back in his room.
A kiss...
Jordi, are you okay?
We'll increase your sedative a little, okay?
...Jordi How are you?
... ...You've done very well...
Yes.
The doctor says it went really well and you're very, very brave.
I'm sorry Lleó.
We'll find a way, don't worry.
Hey, before you came to hospital, did you have a boyfriend?
Some time ago, but...
-Did he go to your school?
-Yeah, and you.
Yes, I had one but hey, I had to leave her.
Didn't she like the hospital?
Well, I dunno, she was always saying... she didn't like hospitals and she had a relative who... became ill and hey, it's as if she had some trauma, and well, I don't know.
-And are you still talking to him?
-Nah.
We stopped speaking to each other, some time ago.
What the hell are you doing here?
Nothing, they told me that you weren't well.
And I thought you'd like a visit.
But man, I didn't call you, Why have you come?
What happened to him?
He's in a coma!
Man, can you go now?
-I think we could be friends!
-But... but look, you don't have friends, You've never had any,
Now, you can go out of here...
I don't need your crappy friendship!
Eehh!
Who do you think you are?
You think that you can decide who can or can't be your friend.
You're a shit!
That's what you are!
I'll come back another day.
I'm sorry Ignasi,
Ignasi!
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
-Is this my bed?
-Yes.
This is the life, the whole day lying in bed.
-Then I'll bring you a wheelchair.
-Will I be able to get up today?
You have to do it, the doctor will explain to you later, it's important that today you move yourself a bit, to help with the circulation of blood to the stump.
Can I give you some advice?
-Tell me if you don't want to hear it.
-Yes yes, sure.
I believe that all these years, I've taken... hundreds of lads without a leg to their room from the ICU... and I've realized what scares you... it's hard what I'm telling you, but on the same night,
go to the bathroom, and view your entire body in the mirror.
I've noticed that the longer you delay it, the harder it is to overcome.
Hey, do you fancy speeding up a bit?
Yes...eh!
How are you?
I thought you'd be all day in the ICU.
I had to come back, we have to finish forming the group, right?
By the way, you have to lend me another bracelet.
Sure, sure.
Right, I'll go away and leave you here... to do this mother and son stuff, so lovely to see.
Mercero!
Son of a bitch!
Don't sit there!
I'm Sorry Jordi, I didn't realize.
-Where's Dad?
-Dad?
He had to...
Yeah...
like always.
-Don't you want to eat any more, Nuno?
-No, I'm not hungry.
-Besides, I don't have any more room.
-No, I understand,
You don't have the stomach for these things.
I couldn't have said it better myself
-Can I come in?
-Sure,
Look Nuno, meet Lleó my early morning gymnastics buddy.
This is Nuno, my night room companion.
-Nice to meet you.
-Aha... so this is the clever boy you're always talking about.
One tries to be clever, though it's not always achieved.
What do you want Lleó?
Except for trading, you never come to this old men's floor.
How did it go, the quest for a leg?
Yes look, that's why I came, on business.
-Can you spare a moment?
-Business?
Sure, sure, I'd love to, let's go.
-Have a nice day.
-Bye, bye.
See, today I was looking at legs, and it turns out, that the one that I'd like to have isn't covered by insurance, it's more expensive.
And my father, as I've explained before, doesn't have much money, and can't afford it, and so I thought, if it's ok with you, you could lend me the money,
and I'd start working and pay you back bit by bit.
-hmm, hmm, hmm...
-I'll do it!
don't worry.
-I always keep a promise.
-Wait, wait...
Let's see, take it in steps.
How much money do you need?
-26,000 euros.
-Damn, this leg costs a fortune.
Yes look, I thought so too, a leg costs a kidney.
If you want I can start work at fifteen if you need the money earlier.
And the one paid for by insurance.
What's wrong with it?
Well, it's a crappy leg, I want a leg to return to a normal life,
-it's not a whim it's a necessity.
-Hey, I can imagine.
I'd lend it to you but, I don't have it.
I don't have money.
Dammit, you're older, you must have money.
But I've never earned very much...
I'm sorry, if I had it, I'd lend it you.
I'll think of another idea.
Alright, goodbye.
Hello, Roc.
Thank you for helping me get back.
I've come to fulfill my promise.
but first, I want you to be part of our group.
We're forming one, and I believe, that you must be the indispensable one.
A friend of Lleó's told us that the essential one, is so important, that without him, the group doesn't exist.
That's to say, we'll be nothing without you.
So...
I'm sure you'll return soon.
Welcome to the group Roc.
Hello, my name's Jordi, although you may not believe it, I met your son in a dream.
and he gave me a message.
"It wasn't your fault,"
"it wasn't"
That's all he said.
Ah!
and stop sticking out your tongue, otherwise one day you'll get it stolen.
I felt good.
I knew it was hard for my mother, but that would give her one more year of strength to fight for me.
(I'm a solitary navigator.)
(I'm a sailor without a port.)
that day was a day of losses and gains.
Losses of boys, who thought they had many friends, and perhaps had none.
Losses for people, who cannot have the leg of their dreams.
(You, old rudder, that helps me.)
And finally, losses so recent, that you still don't see the benefit.
(Get me out of this storm.)
(Get me out, I can't go on any more)
(By following a star, I Probably missed the sky...) (And I lost my reason.)
(Give me the strength to scream that I don't belong here...) (neither there my homeland is the sea.)
(Gives me strength to scream that I belong to myself,...) (I don't belong to anyone...)
Breathe, deep breaths.
How can such a young boy have heart attacks?
-Who are we missing?
-The clever one and the handsome one.
And can't you be the handsome one?
-What are you doing here, Tony?
-I'm talking with... what's your name?
Roc
-You're speaking with Roc?
He speaks to me.
You can't fool me, he didn't say anything to you.
-Do you want to join a group?
-If everyone in the group are like you,
I'll pass.
What are you doing?
Do you know that this is Cristina's breakfast?
Are you afraid that your brother will die?
-Wait five minutes Lleó...
-Joana!
-Who are you in the group?
-The leader.
Like hell, I'll be the leader.
What are you doing?
You're the girl, right?
Yeah, you're not the smart one, that's for sure.
Subtitles by Oliver Sanderson
My name is Roc, and for two years I've been in a coma.
I don't know why the hell pigs like you are allowed to play.
This here is Ignasi, my roommate.
No, please no clowns.
and this is my mother.
It's not for you!
It's for him!
-But isn't he in a coma?
-Yes, so?
, and?
,
He hears everything and sees everything.
My mother is right, I know everything that happens in the hospital.
Toni doesn't have a driving license, I'll have to call social services.
I'm afraid that I'll lose custody.
The problems of the new arrivals...
They have to cut off my leg.
-I love these silences.
-This silence is nothing... compared to when they see you're missing a leg.
...and those like me, we're already veterans.
-Does it hurt?
-This?
No.
And does it hurt you?
I mean being so thin.
I'll call your father to tell him that the operation will be tomorrow.
At the hospital, children may be bald, too thin, have broken bones, a problem heart, or always wear pyjamas.
However, this doesn't mean we stop being children, wanting to have fun.
When I lost it, I had a farewell party for my leg.
Really?
Yes, a doctor told me that, and I thought, why not?
We could form a group and do your party.
-What do you mean?
-I always say that...
I won't die of cancer here, but of boredom.
In every group of friends there are always six types of people:
the leader, the hansome one, the smart one,
The indispensable one, the 2nd leader who would be leader if there wasn't a leader, and the girl.
-And what's the party for?
-Saying goodbye to Jordi's leg.
I'd like to have a last dance on two legs, it might be a nice way of saying goodbye.
Today Jordi, will lose a leg, but he has just gained two friends, and that here, is a half of life.
From my room, I could feel Jordi's fear.
Perhaps what's most frightening, isn't the operating table, nor the number of knives of different sizes, but, that there are so many people.
And all have a role to play.
Curiously, many hands are needed to cut off a leg.
You feel like you've a secondary role, when in reality you're the true star.
Three hours playing the role of the boy who lost a leg.
And you have to endure it well, because, 20% do not survive.
Episode 2 [1x02]
Subtitles by Oliver Sanderson
-You all right, Jordi?
-A little nervous.
Don't worry you'll be asleep in no time and...
And I'll be without a leg, is this how you mean to cheer me up?
Look, you just have to count backwards, from ten to zero, and when you get to seven you'll be asleep.
How long will it take me to wake up?
My doctor in Andorra said it would be 3 hours.
-Will it seem long to me?
-Jordi, hey, it's very fast, really, You know what works?
You can choose something you like very much, for example, think about the best time in your life.
You take this moment, and split it into two parts, the first part you think about now, and the second part,
I assure you, will come to you immediately you wake up.
And... that memory can he split?
So, for example if you love chocolate cake, with strawberries and cream that's inside the fridge, you imagine that you open the door, You take the cake, and then on the verge of biting it, you stop that thought.
You'll see that when you wake up, it'll seem as if no time has passed at all, and then you eat it.
-I know what I'll think about.
-Yes?
great.
but above all, split it at the best moment, eh?
Shall we?
Ready.
-We can begin.
Ten... nine... eight...
What are you doing here?
Nothing, I'm waiting.
But you know the operation lasts 3 hours, don't you?
Have you been told?
-Yes, I know, they recommended that I go home or go and eat something, but...
The closer you are to where they operate, the more you feel that you keep him company.
Yes.
When they operated on Lleó, I grabbed his trousers and t-shirt,
And wore them during the whole operation,
I thought that like that, I'd be with him.
although the clothes were a bit on the tight side.
I've also taken something of Jordi's, to have his smell.
If he knew, he'd get really mad...
Lleó almost killed me later, He said I'd stretched everything.
And your husband?
You told me he was coming from Andorra today, didn't you?
He had to go to a very important meeting.
And he missed the plane.
He says that he should get here in a few hours.
He devotes himself to conciliating between companies and workers.
He's supposed to understand what both parties need.
But it seems to me that... he's not very sympathetic.
Come on, let's go get a coffee.
The cafeteria is on the ground floor just below the operating room, if you raise your head it'll be as if you're seeing him.
Only a wall will separate you.
They should have already started the operation,
I'm sure that Dr. Abel must have already explained to him... that thing about spliting a good memory.
-Perhaps he's changed the technique.
-No way!
When doctors have a trick, they always use it.
What did you think about?
I split a memory that I'd never had, I cheated.
And that was?
-Nothing, just a silly thing.
-Go on, tell me.
No, really, it was just a silly thing.
Come, let's go Lleó, there are new models of legs for you to try.
Do you remember what you told me about the group?
-It's going well, we already have 3.
-This is looking good.
You only need three more, to find the rest of the group.
You'll know as soon as we will find them, and I hope today I find a leg.
I wish I could find a couple of vertebrae for my back.
See you later.
Sometimes, I miss playing, I like hearing the sounds of the games, and not just the ones coming from the games, but also the sounds coming from the people playing them.
I even miss my mother's voice shouting "stop playing".
Ok, stop playing with that, you'll drive yourself crazy.
I thought you were my mother, all mothers are alike.
-Where are your parents?
-Hard at work I suppose.
I hope I go home today, I can't stand being in hospital any more.
-You're not clowning, today!
-No, not today.
Today's a very special day for Roc and me.
Why?
Every day must be the same for him, the whole day in bed, that's a good life man.
No, not every day is the same for him.
Today is his birthday.
He's been here 2 years now.
I've been here a day and I can't take any more.
Do you want all three of us to play something?
Yeah, how about, hide and seek, Roc hides and we have to find him.
Come on, you're moving rooms.
-What's wrong with this room?
-I said room, I didn't say bad room.
Hey, watch what you say or I may report you for child abuse.
And you?
What do you call what you've done?
Apologize to her.
I won't apologize, it was a joke and good one.
Very well, then come on, you have to go for some tests.
-I'm not going home today?
-No, and from what I can see, neither today nor the weekend, you have to do a test that's...
painful, but I'm sure a tough guy like you won't have a problem.
I'll tell them you don't need any anesthetic.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have made that joke.
Satisfied?
-And Roc.
-Roc can't hear me...
Very well, then prepare yourself for unbearable pain.
Okay,
I'm sorry Roc.
-Alright now?
-That's better.
Also, I believe I made a mistake, because I think they only have to do an x-ray on you.
Look, you're a liar...
Roc, why don't you go and talk to those boys over there?
-But we don't know each other.
-So, go and introduce yourself.
They won't want to be friends, I'm new.
Of course they'll want to be friends, they're children, they'll ask you a question, or some silly test, and they'll immediately think you're a great guy, and they'll want to be friends with you and you'll have a group.
I don't need a group,
I already have the PSP and loads of games to amuse myself.
-Give it here.
-Hey!
Either you start making friends, or you don't get the PSP back.
Choose.
Come on.
Hello!
What do you want?
-Nothing, just that I'm new.
-New and lily white.
You look like a snowflake.
I'd like to be friends.
Look Roc, you have to pass a test if you want to be our friend.
Good idea, Do you see that dive platform?
It's very high that platform.
Not that one, the other one.
You'd have to be crazy to jump from there.
Well that's what you have to do, if you want to be friends with us.
-Come on!
-Come on, jump!
Jump, come on, chicken!
-Come on!
-Jump, come on!
Many times a silence is more powerful than ten thousand words.
I'd like to wake up, to tell you that you shouldn't feel guilty.
And leastwise on that day, it wasn't your fault.
-Hey, boss!
Where are you going?
-To radiography, for this boy.
-And where are you off to with Lleó?
-To orthopedics.
To see if we can find a leg to fit him.
-About time, right, Lleó?
Yeah, maybe wait little longer and I'll even grow a new one.
Whats up?
Did the brakes jam or something?
Relax, imagine we've stopped at a traffic light, eh?
Juanma, come here a minute.
-You're new, aren't you?
-New, but soon I'll be history because I'll be leaving.
Yeah, yeah, everyone says that, what's your name?
Move on kid,
I have a full gang of mates.
I don't want any more friends.
Dammit Mercero, where did you find this asshole, in a pack of idiots?
Whatever his anger may be, it'll pass away soon, buddy, let's go.
It must be a shit not having a leg, right?
It must be a shit not having a brain, right?
-Hello.
-Hello.
How's Jordi, have you heard anything?
No no, not yet, later I'll pass by the operating theater.
You look great.
Jordi's already told me that you're in the group
Yes, it's cool, thanks.
Where are you going now?
-To do some tests.
-What tests?
-Nothing, some hospital nonsense.
-Going where?
Yes, some nonsense, a few blood tests, urine in the blood, or blood in the urine, I don't know.
Okay, see you later, good luck with the nonsense.
Bye!
You didn't want to tell her, eh?
No, I don't want to be the first guy she accompanies to try some artificial legs,
She can start off with someone else.
Of course, man.
-Doctor, his vital signs are dropping.
-Shit.
Load the atropine.
Blood please, Merche.
Charging... clear... now.
The sound of death, I've heard it often since the day I arrived.
Many people don't know it, but that beep could be the sound of death.
Now Jordi, is in that strange place between life and death.
He can end up by returning, going, or remain like me.
The curious thing, is that in this strange state,
I end up by connecting with them.
Somehow, they come to me.
Hello!
Hello!
-Have we met?
-Yes, from sight, at the hospital.
At the hospital?
What hospital?
Where am I?
Look, my name's Roc, and for 2 years I've been in a coma, this, is my daily life,
I'm always here, I like it.
And me?
What am I doing here?
Is this my place?
No, you don't have a place yet, because... because you probably won't remain in a coma and will return.
Listen, can you hear?
Stand clear!
Now.
They're trying to bring me back.
Yes, and they attempt it with many people, eh!
Do you want to join me?
I've been alone a long time, and it's a bit boring.
Maybe I shouldn't do anything if I have to return.
If they manage to bring you back, they'll do it wet or dry, but at least this way, we enjoy ourselves, right?
It's cold, eh?
We'll go on three, okay
One... two... and three!
Look, In case you return, can you do me a favour?
Yeah, sure, what?
Can you speak to my mother?
And tell her tell her it wasn't her fault.
What wasn't her fault?
-In case, she doesn't believe me.
-Of course, just say to her.
Ah, tell her not to stick out her tongue while working,
I always said that someone would steal her tongue,
I was the only one to say that to her, so she'll believe you.
See you around.
Goodbye.
We have him.
He's ours.
Gauze please.
Let's clean this up a bit.
Hi Ivan, Ignasi here...
Yeah, still at the hospital, but it's nothing, so they'll send me home, you'll see.
Hey, I wanted to ask you something...
Why don't you visit me?
Yeah, sure, sure.
Hey, Ivan!
Hello?
Wait...
I think I'm losing you.
I think that now...
Shit, I've been cut off.
Do you know that you make a lot of noise with that phone?
-What?
-You've made 23 calls, each time you've been one and a half minutes on average.
My head's about to explode from listening to you so much.
-Sorry, sorry about coming in.
I couldn't get a signal and...
-Besides, why do you call so many people so many times?
It's clear that nobody wants to see you.
Man, that's not why, look, they have things to do and that's it,
I wouldn't be going to see a friend in the hospital if I was out.
Then... perhaps you're not friends.
If you want, you can stay here awhile.
No, the fact is that I've...
I have to...
-To make calls?
Three meters over there please.
Hello Toni.
What?
making new friends?
No.
I only like friends, who don't come to see me... and say they have things to do.
If I had a phone and he called me, yes, maybe we'd be friends.
Look, this man's a police officer and he wants to speak to you.
Well, you'll have to go so that I can take a statement from your grandson.
Oh, no, no, if you want I'll sit here and I won't bother anyone.
No, I'm sorry, these are the rules.
Calm down Grandpa, besides, supposing that he is a police officer, I don't have to say anything, right?
No.
Okay.
Listen Toni.
I guess you know why I'm here.
-Because of the motorcycle?
-Exactly, you had an accident with the motorcycle, and we want to know, who gave you permission to take it without a license.
What?
-Was it your grandfather?
-What?
I'm asking you, if it was your grandfather who gave you permission to take the bike.
What are you saying?
It's okay Toni, we'll talk another day.
-What are you doing here?
-You don't lie very well, whenever you lie, you touch your eye.
No way!
So, today you have to choose the leg that you'll receive, right?
Yes but, I don't have much choice, because my father's run out of cash.
I'll settle for the basic.
And what's the basic?
It's the one that comes with the insurance, the pirate leg.
The pirate leg.
-The terrible pirate leg.
-You know what?
My father always says that when you're going to buy something, the important thing is that they explain everything well, and in the end you always have to say:
I'll return, I have to think about it.
Man, wouldn't it be nice to do that.
But we'd have a good laugh with the feet though.
Let's do it.
I don't know...
Come on, yes, let's do it.
Are you sure?
No, no...
Yes, do it!
Do it.
And your father?
He's in Canet.
Look, I've changed my mind.
Show me everything you've got.
Sometimes the hospital, is rather strange,
The same space, and different hopes.
Terminator.
Toni, how did it go?
I acted like a dummy, it always works.
although the worst thing, is not wanting to be in this space,
And not having any emotion inside, because you need the excitement you find outside.
Is this one the leg with dynamic foot, and four-axis hydraulic knee?
Yes, it's the same one, it's the one you've chosen all afternoon.
How long have you been without a leg?
Almost 9 months, like a pregnancy but in reverse, instead of gaining members, I lose them.
These are gorgeous, you look like Terminator 2.
They retail at 26,000 euros.
Hello.
Sorry, I've slept so little that I thought I'd stretch out for a bit.
There are some new developments, if you'd like to accompany me.
Is Jordi okay?
I believe that something happened, but he's okay.
-What?
-He's okay now.
What do you know?
How is he?
-They said something happened.
-Wait here, please.
-What's happened?
-I don't know.
-What happened?
!
-I don't know!
Why weren't you here?
Eh?
Why weren't you here, instead of going to a crappy meeting, to bring peace to a crappy company?
-It's okay, calm down.
Jordi, honey.
How are you?
-Are they taking him to the ICU?
-Yes, 24 hours in observation, and then back to his room.
Doctor, how did it go?
It went very well, almost a record.
You'll be able to see him, as soon as he wakes up.
And they've removed the tumour?
-Completely.
-Thank you.
-Thats good news, eh?
-Yes.
listen...
I have to go to a meeting,
I'll be back tomorrow morning, anything new, call my mobile.
-Why do you have to go?
-I'm sorry, really, but I'm in the middle of a negotiation, and if I don't return...
Go to hell.
At the hospital, sometimes there wasn't time to control ones emotions.
Everything goes fast:
joy, sadness.
I have a feeling, it's because there are so many different emotions in one day, that they must fade out quickly, otherwise, new ones won't be able to come in.
-Jordi.
-Jordi.
-Jordi.
-Jordi.
-Jordi.
-Eh.
He doesn't want to wake up.
Jordi!
Another kiss a kiss a kiss please.
-What's he saying?
-I don't know, a kiss, didn't he?
...a kiss a kiss, please.
-I'm not giving him a kiss.
-Go on, give him one.
-No way.
-This bald guy... just had his leg off.
-Go on.
-No.
Yes, man.
Another kiss... go on, another kiss...
I don't know if this guy's asleep or just playing dumb, eh?
Come on, let him rest.
In no time, he'll be back in his room.
Bye.
Rest now.
A kiss...
Jordi, are you okay?
We'll increase your sedative a little, okay?
...Jordi How are you?
... ...You've done very well...
Yes.
The doctor says it went really well and you're very, very brave.
My little hero.
Sleep, son, sleep.
I'm sorry Lleó.
We'll find a way, don't worry.
Hey, before you came to hospital, did you have a boyfriend?
Some time ago, but...
-Did he go to your school?
-Yeah, and you.
Yes, I had one but hey, I had to leave her.
Didn't she like the hospital?
Well, I dunno, she was always saying... she didn't like hospitals and she had a relative who... became ill and hey, it's as if she had some trauma, and well, I don't know.
-And are you still talking to him?
-Nah.
We stopped speaking to each other, some time ago.
What the hell are you doing here?
Nothing, they told me that you weren't well.
And I thought you'd like a visit.
But man, I didn't call you, why have you come?
What happened to him?
He's in a coma!
Man, can you go now?
-I think we could be friends!
-But... but look, you don't have friends, You've never had any,
Now, you can get out of here...
I don't need your crappy friendship!
Eh!
Who do you think you are?
You think that you can decide who can or can't be your friend.
You're a shit!
That's what you are!
I'll come back another day.
I'm sorry Ignasi,
Ignasi!
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
-Is this my bed?
-Yes.
This is the life, the whole day lying in bed.
-Then I'll bring you a wheelchair.
-Will I be able to get up today?
You have to do it, the doctor will explain to you later, it's important that today you move yourself a bit, to help with the circulation of blood to the stump.
Can I give you some advice?
-Tell me if you don't want to hear it.
-Yes yes, sure.
I believe that all these years, I've taken... hundreds of lads without a leg to their room from the ICU... and I've realized what scares you... it's hard what I'm telling you, but on the same night,
go to the bathroom, and view your entire body in the mirror.
I've noticed that the longer you delay it, the harder it is to overcome.
Hey, do you fancy speeding up a bit?
Yes... eh!
How are you?
Are you okay?
I thought you'd be all day in the ICU.
I had to come back, we have to finish forming the group, right?
By the way, you have to lend me another bracelet.
Sure, sure.
Right, I'll go away and leave you here... to do this mother and son stuff, so lovely to see.
Mercero!
Son of a bitch!
Don't sit there!
I'm Sorry Jordi, I didn't realize.
-Where's Dad?
-Dad?
He had to...
Yeah...
like always.
-Don't you want to eat any more, Nuno?
-No, I'm not hungry.
-Besides, I don't have any more room.
-No, I understand,
You don't have the stomach for these things.
I couldn't have said it better myself
-Can I come in?
-Sure,
Look Nuno, meet Lleó my early morning gymnastics buddy.
This is Nuno, my night room companion.
-Nice to meet you.
-Aha... so this is the clever boy you're always talking about.
One tries to be clever, though it's not always achieved.
What do you want Lleó?
Except for trading, you never come to this old men's floor.
How did it go, the quest for a leg?
Yes look, that's why I came, on business.
-Can you spare a moment?
-Business?
Sure, sure, I'd love to, let's go.
-Have a nice day.
-Bye-bye.
See, today I was looking at legs, and it turns out, that the one that I'd like to have isn't covered by insurance, it's more expensive.
And my father, as I've explained before, doesn't have much money, and can't afford it, and so I thought, if it's ok with you, you could lend me the money,
and I'd start working and pay you back bit by bit.
-hmm, hmm, hmm...
-I'll do it!
don't worry.
-I always keep a promise.
-Wait, wait...
Let's see, take it in steps.
How much money do you need?
-26,000 euros.
-Damn, this leg costs a fortune.
Yes look, I thought so too, a leg costs a kidney.
If you want I can start work at fifteen if you need the money earlier.
And the one paid for by insurance.
What's wrong with it?
Well, it's a crappy leg, I want a leg to return to a normal life,
-it's not a whim it's a necessity.
-Hey, I can imagine.
I'd lend it to you but, I don't have it.
I don't have money.
Dammit, you're older, you must have money.
But I've never earned very much...
I'm sorry, if I had it, I'd lend it you.
I'll think of another idea.
Alright, goodbye.
Hello, Roc.
Thank you for helping me get back.
I've come to fulfill my promise.
But first, I want you to be part of our group.
We're forming one, and I believe, that you must be the indispensable one.
A friend of Lleó's told us that the essential one, is so important, that without him, the group doesn't exist.
That's to say, we'll be nothing without you.
So...
I'm sure you'll return soon.
Welcome to the group Roc.
Hello, my name's Jordi, although you may not believe it, I met your son in a dream.
and he gave me a message.
"It wasn't your fault,"
"it wasn't"
That's all he said.
Ah!
And stop sticking out your tongue, otherwise one day you'll get it stolen.
I felt good.
I knew it was hard for my mother.
but that would give her one more year of strength to fight for me.
# I'm a solitary navigator.
# I'm a sailor without a port.
That day was a day of losses and gains.
Losses of boys, who thought they had many friends, and perhaps had none.
Losses for people, who cannot have the leg of their dreams.
# You, old rudder, that helps me.
And finally, losses so recent, that you still don't see the benefit.
# Get me out of this storm.
# Get me out, I can't go on any more, # by following a star, I Probably missed the sky... # and I lost my reason.
# Give me the strength to scream that I don't belong here... # neither there my homeland is the sea.
# Gives me strength to scream that I belong to myself,
# I don't belong to anyone...
Breathe, deep breaths.
How can such a young boy have heart attacks?
-Who are we missing?
-The smart and the handsome one.
And can't you be the handsome one?
-What are you doing here, Tony?
-I'm talking with... what's your name?
Roc.
-You're speaking with Roc?
He speaks to me.
You can't fool me, he didn't say anything to you.
-Do you want to join a group?
-If everyone in the group are like you,
I'll pass.
What are you doing?
Do you know that this is Cristina's breakfast?
Are you afraid that your brother will die?
-Wait five minutes Lleó...
-Joana!
-Who are you in the group?
-The leader.
Like hell, I'll be the leader.
What are you doing?
You're the girl, right?
Yeah, you're not the smart one, that's for sure.
Subtitles by Oliver Sanderson
My name is Roc, and for two years I've been in a coma.
I don't know why the hell pigs like you are allowed to play.
This here is Ignasi, my roommate.
No, please no clowns.
and this is my mother.
It's not for you!
It's for him!
-But isn't he in a coma?
-Yes, so?
, and?
,
He hears everything and sees everything.
My mother is right, I know everything that happens in the hospital.
Toni doesn't have a driving license, I'll have to call social services.
I'm afraid that I'll lose custody.
The problems of the new arrivals...
They have to cut off my leg.
-I love these silences.
-This silence is nothing... compared to when they see you're missing a leg.
...and those like me, we're already veterans.
-Does it hurt?
-This?
No.
And does it hurt you?
I mean being so thin.
I'll call your father to tell him that the operation will be tomorrow.
At the hospital, children may be bald, too thin, have broken bones, a problem heart, or always wear pyjamas.
However, this doesn't mean we stop being children, wanting to have fun.
When I lost it, I had a farewell party for my leg.
Really?
Yes, a doctor told me that, and I thought, why not?
We could form a group and do your party.
-What do you mean?
-I always say that...
I won't die of cancer here, but of boredom.
In every group of friends there are always six types of people:
the leader, the hansome one, the smart one,
The indispensable one, the 2nd leader who would be leader if there wasn't a leader, and the girl.
-And what's the party for?
-Saying goodbye to Jordi's leg.
I'd like to have a last dance on two legs, it might be a nice way of saying goodbye.
Today Jordi, will lose a leg, but he has just gained two friends, and that here, is a half of life.
From my room, I could feel Jordi's fear.
Perhaps what's most frightening, isn't the operating table, nor the number of knives of different sizes, but, that there are so many people.
And all have a role to play.
Curiously, many hands are needed to cut off a leg.
You feel like you've a secondary role, when in reality you're the true star.
Three hours playing the role of the boy who lost a leg.
And you have to endure it well, because, 20% do not survive.
-You all right, Jordi?
-A little nervous.
Don't worry you'll be asleep in no time and...
And I'll be without a leg, is this how you mean to cheer me up?
Look, you just have to count backwards, from ten to zero, and when you get to seven you'll be asleep.
How long will it take me to wake up?
My doctor in Andorra said it would be 3 hours.
-Will it seem long to me?
-Jordi, hey, it's very fast, really, You know what works?
You can choose something you like very much, for example, think about the best time in your life.
You take this moment, and split it into two parts, the first part you think about now, and the second part,
I assure you, will come to you immediately you wake up.
And... that memory can he split?
So, for example if you love chocolate cake, with strawberries and cream that's inside the fridge, you imagine that you open the door, You take the cake, and then on the verge of biting it, you stop that thought.
You'll see that when you wake up, it'll seem as if no time has passed at all, and then you eat it.
-I know what I'll think about.
-Yes?
great.
but above all, split it at the best moment, eh?
Shall we?
ready.
-We can begin.
Ten... nine... eight...
What are you doing here?
Nothing, I'm waiting.
But you know the operation lasts 3 hours, don't you?
-Have you been told?
-Yes, I know, they recommended that I go home or go and eat something, but...
The closer you are to where they operate,
You more you feel that you keep him company.
Yes.
When they operated on Lleó, I grabbed his trousers and t-shirt,
And wore them during the whole operation,
I thought that like that, I'd be with him.
although the clothes were a bit on the tight side.
I've also taken something of Jordi's, To have his smell.
If he knew, he'd get really mad...
Lleó almost killed me later, He said I'd stretched everything.
And your husband?
You told me he was coming from Andorra today, didn't you?
He had to go to a very important meeting.
And he missed the plane,
He says that he should get here in a few hours,
He devotes himself to conciliating between companies and workers.
He's supposed understand what both parties need.
But it seems to me that... he's not very sympathetic.
Come on, let's go get a coffee.
The cafeteria is on the ground floor just below the operating room,
If you raise your head it'll be as if you're seeing him.
Only a wall will separate you.
They should have already started the operation,
I'm sure that Dr. Abel must have already explained to him that thing about spliting a good memory.
-Perhaps he's changed the technique.
-No way!
When doctors have a trick, they always use it.
What did you think about?
I split a memory that I'd never had, I cheated.
And that was?
-Nothing, just a silly thing.
-Go on, tell me about it.
No, really, it was just a silly thing.
Come, let's go Lleó, there are new models of legs for you to try.
Do you remember what you told me about the group?
-It's going well, we already have 3.
-This is looking good.
You only need three more, to find the rest of the group.
You'll know as soon as we will find them, and I hope today I find a leg.
I wish I could find a couple of vertebrae for my back.
See you later.
Sometimes, I miss playing, I like hearing the sounds of the games, and not just the ones coming from the games, but also the sounds coming from the people playing them.
I even miss my mother's voice shouting "stop playing".
Ok, stop playing with that, you'll drive yourself crazy.
I thought you were my mother, all mothers are alike.
-Where are your parents?
-Hard at work I suppose.
I hope I go home today, I can't stand being in hospital any more.
-You're not clowning, today!
-No, not today.
Today's a very special day for Roc and me.
Why?
Every day must be the same for him, the whole day in the bed, that's a good life man.
No, not every day is the same for him.
Today is his birthday.
He's been here 2 years now.
I've been here a day and I can't take any more.
Do you want all three of us to play something?
Yeah, how about, hide and seek, Roc hides and we have to find him.
Come on, you're moving rooms.
-What's wrong with this room?
-I said room, I didn't say bad room.
Hey, watch what you say or I may report you for child abuse.
And what about you?
What do you call what you've done?
Apologize to her.
I won't apologize, it was a joke and good one.
Very well, then come on, you have to go for some tests.
-I'm not going home today?
-No, and from what I can see, neither today nor the weekend, you have to do a test that's...
painful, but I'm sure a tough guy like you won't have a problem.
I'll tell them you don't need any anesthetic.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have made that joke.
Satisfied?
-And Roc.
-Roc can't hear me...
Very well, then prepare yourself for unbearable pain.
Okay,
I'm sorry Roc.
-alright now?
-That's better.
Also, I believe I made a mistake, because I think they only have to do an x-ray on you.
Look you're a liar...
Roc, why don't you go and talk to those boys over there?
-But we don't know each other.
-So, go and introduce yourself.
They won't want to be friends, I'm new.
Of course they'll want to be friends, they're children, they'll ask you a question, or some silly test, and they'll immediately think you're a great guy, and they'll want to be friends with you and you'll have a group.
I don't need a group,
I already have the PSP and loads of games to amuse myself.
-Give it here.
-Hey!
Either you start making friends, or you don't get the PSP back.
choose.
Come on.
Hello!
What do you want?
-Nothing, just that I'm new.
-New and lily white.
You look like a snowflake.
I'd like to be friends.
Look Roc, you have to pass a test if you want to be our friend.
Good idea, Do you see that dive platform?
It is very high that platform.
Not that one, the other one.
You'd have to be crazy to jump from there.
Well that's what you have to do, if you want to be friends with us.
Many times a silence is more powerful than ten thousand words.
I'd like to wake up, to tell you that you shouldn't feel guilty.
And leastwise on that day, it wasn't your fault.
-Hey, boss!
Where are you going?
-To radiography, for this boy.
-And where are you off to with Lleó?
-To orthopedics.
To see if we can find a leg to fit him.
-About time, right, Lleó?
Yeah, yeah, maybe wait little longer and I'll even grow a new one.
Whats up?
Did the brakes jam or something?
Relax, imagine we've stopped at a traffic light, eh?
Juanma, come here a minute.
-You're new, aren't you?
-New, but soon I'll be history because I'll be leaving.
Yeah, yeah, everyone says that, what's your name?
Move on kid,
I have a full gang of mates.
I don't want any more friends.
Dammit Mercero, where did you find this asshole, in a pack of idiots?
Whatever his anger may be, it'll pass away soon, buddy, let's go.
It must be a shit not having a leg, right?
It must be a shit not having a brain, right?
- Hello.
- Hello.
How's Jordi, have you heard anything?
No no, not yet, later I'll pass by the operating theater.
You look great.
Jordi's already told me that you're in the group
Yes, it's cool, thanks.
Where are you going now?
-To do some tests.
-What tests?
Nothing, some hospital nonsense.
-Going where?
Yes, some nonsense, a few blood tests, urine in the blood, or blood in the urine, I don't know.
Okay, see you later, good luck with the nonsense.
Bye!
You didn't want to tell her, eh?
No, I don't want to be the first guy she accompanies to try some artificial legs,
She can start off with someone else.
Of course, man.
-Doctor, his vital signs are dropping.
-Shit.
Load the atropine.
Blood please, Merche.
Charging... clear... now.
The sound of death I've heard it often since the day I arrived
Many people don't know it, but that beep could be the sound of death.
Now Jordi, is in that strange place between life and death.
He can end up by returning, going, or remain like me.
The curious thing, is that in this strange state,
I end up by connecting with them.
Somehow, they come to me.
Hello!
Hello!
-Have we met?
-Yes, from sight, at the hospital.
At the hospital?
What hospital?
Where am I?
Look, my name's Roc, and for 2 years I've been in a coma, this, is my daily life,
I'm always here, I like it.
And me?
What am I doing here?
Is this my place?
No, you don't have a place yet, because... because you probably won't remain in a coma and will return.
Listen, can you hear?
They're trying to bring me back.
Yes, and they attempt it with many people, eh!
Do you want to join me?
I've been alone a long time, and it's a bit boring.
Maybe I shouldn't do anything if I have to return.
If they manage to bring you back, they'll do it wet or dry, but at least this way, we enjoy ourselves, right?
One... two... and three!
Look, In case you return, can you do me a favour?
Yeah, sure, what?
Can you speak to my mother?
And tell her tell her it wasn't her fault.
What wasn't her fault?
-In case, she doesn't believe me.
-Of course, just say to her.
Ah, tell her not to stick out her tongue while working,
I always said that someone would steal her tongue,
I was the only one to say that to her, so she'll believe you.
See you around.
Goodbye.
We have him.
He's ours.
Gauze please.
Let's clean this up a bit.
Hi Ivan, Ignasi here...
Yeah, yeah, still at the hospital, but it's nothing, so they'll send me home.
You'll see...
Hey, I wanted to ask you something...
Why don't you visit me?
Yeah, sure, sure.
Hey, Ivan!
Hello?
Wait...
I think I'm losing you.
It think that now...
Shit, I've been cut off.
Do you know that you make a lot of noise with that phone?
-What?
-You've made 23 calls, each time you've been one and a half minutes on average.
My head's about to explode from listening to you so much.
-Sorry, sorry about coming in.
I couldn't get a signal and...
-Besides, why do you call so many people so many times?
It is clear that nobody wants to see you.
Man, that's not why, look, they have things to do and that's it,
I wouldn't be going to see a friend in the hospital if I was out.
Then... perhaps you're not friends.
If you want, you can stay here awhile.
No, the fact is that I've...
I have to...
-To make calls?
Three meters over there please.
Hello Toni.
What?
making new friends?
No, I only like friends, who don't come to to see him and say they have things to do.
If I had phone and he called me, yes maybe we'd be friends.
Look, this man's a police officer and he wants to speak to you,
Well, you'll have to go so that I can take a statement from your grandson.
Oh, no, no, if you want I'll sit here and I won't bother anyone.
No, I'm sorry, these are the rules.
Calm down grandpa, besides, supposing that he is a police officer, I don't have to say anything, right?
Okay.
Listen Toni.
I guess you know why I'm here.
-Because of the motorcycle?
-Exactly, you had an accident with the motorcycle, and we want to know, who gave you permission to take it without a license.
What?
-Was it your grandfather?
-What?
I'm asking you, if it was your grandfather who gave you permission to take the bike.
What are you saying?
It's okay Toni, we'll talk another day.
-What are you doing here?
-You don't lie very well, whenever you lie, you touch your eye.
No Way!
So, today you have to choose the leg that you'll receive, right?
Yes but, I don't have much choice, because my father's run out of cash.
I'll settle for the basic.
And what's the basic?
It's the one that comes with the insurance, the pirate leg.
The pirate leg.
-The terrible pirate leg.
-You know what?
My father always says that when you're going to buy something, the important thing is that they explain everything well, and in the end you always have to say:
I'll return, I have to think about it.
Man, wouldn't it be nice to do that.
But we'd have a good laugh with the feet though.
Let's do it.
I don't know...
Come on, yes, let's do it.
Are you sure?
No, no...
Yes, do it!
do it.
And your father?
He's in Canet.
Look, I've changed my mind.
Show me everything you've got.
Sometimes the hospital, is rather strange,
The same space, and different hopes.
Terminator.
Toni, how did it go?
I acted like a dummy, it always works.
although the worst thing, is not wanting to be in this space,
And not having any emotion inside, because you need the excitement you find outside.
Is this one the leg with dynamic foot, and four-axis hydraulic knee?
Yes, it's the same one, it's the one you've chosen all afternoon.
How long have you been without a leg?
Almost 9 months, like a pregnancy but in reverse, instead of gaining members, I lose them.
These are gorgeous, you look like Terminator 2.
They retail at 26,000 euros.
Hello.
Sorry, I've slept so little that I thought I'd stretch out for a bit.
There are some new developments, if you'd like to accompany me.
Is Jordi okay?
I believe that something happened, but he's okay.
-What?
-He's okay now.
What do you know?
How is he?
-They said something happened.
-Wait here, please.
-What's happened?
-I don't know.
-What happened?
!
-I don't know!
Why weren't you here?
Eh?
Why weren't you here, instead of going to a crappy meeting, to bring peace to a crappy company?
-It's okay, calm down.
Jordi, honey.
How are you?
-Are they taking him to the ICU?
-Yes, 24 hours in observation, and then back to his room.
-How did it go?
-It went very well, almost a record.
You'll be able to see him, as soon as he wakes up.
And they've removed the tumor?
-Completely.
-Thank you.
-Thats good news, eh?
-Yes.
listen...
I have to go to a meeting,
I'll be back tomorrow morning, anything new, call my mobile.
-Why do you have to go?
-I'm sorry, really, but I'm in the middle of a negotiation, and if I don't return...
Go to hell.
At the hospital, sometimes there wasn't time to control ones emotions.
Everything goes fast:
joy, sadness.
I have a feeling, it's because there are so many different emotions in one day, that they must fade out quickly, otherwise, new ones won't be able to come in.
-Jordi.
-Jordi.
-Jordi.
-Jordi.
-Jordi.
-Eh.
He doesn't want to wake up.
Jordi!
Another kiss a kiss a kiss please.
-What's he saying?
-I don't know, a kiss, didn't he?
...a kiss a kiss, please.
-I'm not giving him a kiss.
-Go on, give him one.
This bald guy... just had his leg off.
-Go on.
-Don't.
Yes, man.
Another kiss... go on, another kiss...
I don't know if this guy's asleep or just playing dumb, eh?
Come on, let him rest.
In no time, he'll be back in his room.
A kiss...
Jordi, are you okay?
We'll increase your sedative a little, okay?
...Jordi How are you?
... ...You've done very well...
Yes.
The doctor says it went really well and you're very, very brave.
I'm sorry Lleó.
We'll find a way, don't worry.
Hey, before you came to hospital, did you have a boyfriend?
Some time ago, but...
-Did he go to your school?
-Yeah, and you.
Yes, I had one but hey, I had to leave her.
Didn't she like the hospital?
Well, I dunno, she was always saying... she didn't like hospitals and she had a relative who... became ill and hey, it's as if she had some trauma, and well, I don't know.
-And are you still talking to him?
-Nah.
We stopped speaking to each other, some time ago.
What the hell are you doing here?
Nothing, they told me that you weren't well.
And I thought you'd like a visit.
But man, I didn't call you, Why have you come?
What happened to him?
He's in a coma!
Man, can you go now?
-I think we could be friends!
-But... but look, you don't have friends, You've never had any,
Now, you can go out of here...
I don't need your crappy friendship!
Eehh!
Who do you think you are?
You think that you can decide who can or can't be your friend.
You're a shit!
That's what you are!
I'll come back another day.
I'm sorry Ignasi,
Ignasi!
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
-Is this my bed?
-Yes.
This is the life, the whole day lying in bed.
-Then I'll bring you a wheelchair.
-Will I be able to get up today?
You have to do it, the doctor will explain to you later, it's important that today you move yourself a bit, to help with the circulation of blood to the stump.
Can I give you some advice?
-Tell me if you don't want to hear it.
-Yes yes, sure.
I believe that all these years, I've taken... hundreds of lads without a leg to their room from the ICU... and I've realized what scares you... it's hard what I'm telling you, but on the same night,
go to the bathroom, and view your entire body in the mirror.
I've noticed that the longer you delay it, the harder it is to overcome.
Hey, do you fancy speeding up a bit?
Yes...eh!
How are you?
I thought you'd be all day in the ICU.
I had to come back, we have to finish forming the group, right?
By the way, you have to lend me another bracelet.
Sure, sure.
Right, I'll go away and leave you here... to do this mother and son stuff, so lovely to see.
Mercero!
Son of a bitch!
Don't sit there!
I'm Sorry Jordi, I didn't realize.
-Where's Dad?
-Dad?
He had to...
Yeah...
like always.
-Don't you want to eat any more, Nuno?
-No, I'm not hungry.
-Besides, I don't have any more room.
-No, I understand,
You don't have the stomach for these things.
I couldn't have said it better myself
-Can I come in?
-Sure,
Look Nuno, meet Lleó my early morning gymnastics buddy.
This is Nuno, my night room companion.
-Nice to meet you.
-Aha... so this is the clever boy you're always talking about.
One tries to be clever, though it's not always achieved.
What do you want Lleó?
Except for trading, you never come to this old men's floor.
How did it go, the quest for a leg?
Yes look, that's why I came, on business.
-Can you spare a moment?
-Business?
Sure, sure, I'd love to, let's go.
-Have a nice day.
-Bye, bye.
See, today I was looking at legs, and it turns out, that the one that I'd like to have isn't covered by insurance, it's more expensive.
And my father, as I've explained before, doesn't have much money, and can't afford it, and so I thought, if it's ok with you, you could lend me the money,
and I'd start working and pay you back bit by bit.
-hmm, hmm, hmm...
-I'll do it!
don't worry.
-I always keep a promise.
-Wait, wait...
Let's see, take it in steps.
How much money do you need?
-26,000 euros.
-Damn, this leg costs a fortune.
Yes look, I thought so too, a leg costs a kidney.
If you want I can start work at fifteen if you need the money earlier.
And the one paid for by insurance.
What's wrong with it?
Well, it's a crappy leg, I want a leg to return to a normal life,
-it's not a whim it's a necessity.
-Hey, I can imagine.
I'd lend it to you but, I don't have it.
I don't have money.
Dammit, you're older, you must have money.
But I've never earned very much...
I'm sorry, if I had it, I'd lend it you.
I'll think of another idea.
Alright, goodbye.
Hello, Roc.
Thank you for helping me get back.
I've come to fulfill my promise.
but first, I want you to be part of our group.
We're forming one, and I believe, that you must be the indispensable one.
A friend of Lleó's told us that the essential one, is so important, that without him, the group doesn't exist.
That's to say, we'll be nothing without you.
So...
I'm sure you'll return soon.
Welcome to the group Roc.
Hello, my name's Jordi, although you may not believe it, I met your son in a dream.
and he gave me a message.
"It wasn't your fault,"
"it wasn't"
That's all he said.
Ah!
and stop sticking out your tongue, otherwise one day you'll get it stolen.
I felt good.
I knew it was hard for my mother, but that would give her one more year of strength to fight for me.
that day was a day of losses and gains.
Losses of boys, who thought they had many friends, and perhaps had none.
Losses for people, who cannot have the leg of their dreams.
And finally, losses so recent, that you still don't see the benefit.
Breathe, deep breaths.
How can such a young boy have heart attacks?
-Who are we missing?
-The clever one and the handsome one.
And can't you be the handsome one?
-What are you doing here, Tony?
-I'm talking with... what's your name?
Roc
-You're speaking with Roc?
He speaks to me.
You can't fool me, he didn't say anything to you.
-Do you want to join a group?
-If everyone in the group are like you,
I'll pass.
What are you doing?
Do you know that this is Cristina's breakfast?
Are you afraid that your brother will die?
-Wait five minutes Lleó...
-Joana!
-Who are you in the group?
-The leader.
Like hell, I'll be the leader.
What are you doing?
You're the girl, right?
Yeah, you're not the smart one, that's for sure.

Here's mine.
I need you to babysit the client till I get there.
And don't mention the deal.
If she asks any questions, just nod your head and look pretty.
[Whistles]
[Clears throat]
Ms. McAfee, I'm Mike Ross.
I work with Harvey.
Oh, you're the protege that he's been gushing about.
He was gushing?
Well, he mentioned that you existed.
For Harvey, that's gushing.
Uh, he's running a few minutes late today.
Um, car trouble.
I was just about to have tea with the girls.
Would you care to join me?
I'd love to.
Good.
And for heaven's sakes, call me Joy.
Okay, Joy.
These...
Are the girls.
Susie, Sarah,
Stacy, Sinclair, and Sabrina.
Susie, where are your manners?
Shake hands with this nice young man.
Mm...
Just kidding, I know they're dolls.
Oh.
[Laughs]
They're named after my daughters.
I started the company because of them, really.
You know, dolls didn't used to be these cheap, plastic bimbos from China that we have today.
Your mother made them for you by hand.
I wanted my girls to have that same experience.
And here we are, 30 years later.
Every parent's worst nightmare.
What do you mean?
These little angels, they sell for $90 a pop.
I wasn't born with a butler, you know.
I gotta say, this is amazing, taking on a project like a licensing deal.
Why is that amazing?
Well, my grandmother could never pull this off.
She's been retired for ten years.
How is that treating her?
She lives near my apartment.
I get to see her once a week, so...
- That's very sweet of you.
- No.
No, it's not.
You know, whenever I needed her, she was there.
You know, no matter what.
She'd give me a hug, she'd tell me everything is gonna be all right.
And...
[Chuckles]
Even if it wasn't.
And now that she needs me, I am always at work.
And I'm-- [Phone rings]
I'm so sorry.
Yeah?
Never answer your phone in front of a client.
- But it's you.
- What's happening?
Well, actually we're in the middle of a tea party.
I knew you were the doll-playing type.
Put Joy on.
Ms. McAfee, it's Harvey.
Oh.
Joy, I'm sorry,
I have to reschedule.
No need to apologize.
I like this one.
- [Laughs]
- I'll send him back after tea.
[Clears throat]
Tell me you didn't ask our client for a doggy bag.
What can I say?
Stacy insisted.
Just got off with Joy McAfee's general counsel.
It seems she had an epiphany.
She wants less on her plate, not more.
I thought you were going to close her.
We need that doll money.
I'm on top of it.
Harvey took five months to structure that deal.
Please don't make me set fire to your desk.
I--
All you had to do was have tea with the dolls.
Donna, schedule another tea party with Joy as soon as possible.
And text me the names of her girls.
Oh, what a shock.
You can't keep girls' names straight in your head.
Just yours, Debbie.
See, that's funny because your name is Donna.
Harvey Specter.
I got your order right here.
I didn't order a pizza.
You've been served.
Cab driver who hit Ray named me as a witness in a civil suit.
I need to pay Travis Bickle a visit.
Harvey, if you let me go talk to Joy,
I know I can fix this--
- No.
You don't send a puppy to clean up its own mess.
Optimally, you don't even have a puppy.
[Sighs]
Ross, rumor has it you talked a client out of $200 million.
The deal's not off the table, all right?
It's just a speed bump.
Dude, I think we just found him a new nickname.
Speed Bump!
[Laughs]
I feel like I'm back in high school.
They called you Speed Bump in high school?
- [Sighs]
- Kidding.
But if you need any boxes to pack up your office, just--
Ow.
Hmm, wait a minute, uh-- [grunts] There.
I think that belongs to you.
It wouldn't hurt so much if you had thicker skin.
[Phone rings]
What do you want?
I wanna pay you back for posting bail.
Trevor, you've owed me 40 bucks since fifth grade.
I wrote it off, okay?
Look, I want a clean slate, okay?
So you don't want to see me, I'll mail you a check.
[All chuckle]
Okay.
Yeah, let's hang out tomorrow night.
Nothing crazy, though, all right?
I have to be up early.
We can crochet panty hose if that's what it takes to be cool.
I think we can do a little better than that.
Why don't we, uh...
Why don't we say Rex's, 7:30.
First six rounds are on me.
If you're serious about paying me back, the first 100 rounds are on you.
[Laughs] All right.
[Soft indistinct chatter]
So it's the tough guy.
This is a matter for insurance, not a frivolous lawsuit.
You know, for your information,
I suffered emotional pain.
Emotional pain?
Rub this on your emotional pain.
You condescending son of a--
Look at me, I am gonna warn you once.
Do not pursue this matter.
You know, I have been held up at gunpoint three times.
So do you think a fancy suit and a $500 haircut, that's gonna scare me?
You take my driver to court, I'm gonna represent him myself.
And when you lose, you'll be covering my fee, which is gonna be a hell of a lot of haircuts.
Hmm, so you weren't a one-way fare.
Ray's worked for me eight years.
Then you don't have to worry about being a witness, because as his employer, you're liable for his actions.
You know, I think you've seen way too many reruns of Ally McBeal.
Hmm.
You know, I emigrated here after September 11th, and they shut the doors on everybody.
I couldn't pay for a lawyer, so I had to take them to court.
I sued for my citizenship, so I have a very special appreciation for the law.
I appreciate a good single malt.
I don't pretend I can make one.
I wiped the floor with the U.S. government, counselor.
I'm gonna do the same with you.
- Ray.
- Donna.
What are you doin' here?
I don't have you scheduled.
Uh, I need to see Harvey.
Oh, come on.
You know the rules.
No one sets foot in there without a warrant, a papal edict, or my say-so.
I just got named in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit.
The accident wasn't my fault.
Can I get in to see Harvey, please?
Okay, say no more.
I will get you in.
You are so beautiful when you're forceful.
I know you meant that as a compliment, but I don't appreciate limitations being placed on my beauty.
Harvey, I'm already losing money with my car in the shop.
A trial means I can't work.
And how do you think my name is gonna play in front of a New York jury?
Rahim Benghazi.
I may as well buy a one-way ticket to Guantanamo.
- Not gonna happen.
- If I lose,
I won't even be able to afford a livery license, let alone my insurance.
That's why I'm gonna be defending both of us.
Ray, this goes against every fiber of my being.
I'm taking your case pro bono.
I don't know what to say.
Absolutely nothing, I've got a reputation to maintain.
Besides, it's not gonna take long, okay?
I'm gonna get it dismissed.
Donna, call the court.
We need priority status on the docket.
Yeah, I already tried.
You drew Judge Palermo.
You know what you have to do, don't you?
Yeah.
The other thing that goes against every fiber of my being.
Louis, has anyone told you you're an exquisite soprano?
What do you want, Harvey?
You're right.
Why prolong my suffering?
I need you to get me in to see Judge Palermo.
You need my help, and you're not gonna pull rank on me?
Your case has nothing to do with firm business, does it?
What's it gonna take?
A mani-pedi?
Tickets to Celine?
[Laughs] I'll see what I can do.
And your pound of flesh?
I need my back scratched, I'll let you know.
Louis, unless that's a metaphor, the deal's off.
Huh.
Joy, when I told you that my grandmother didn't have much time,
I--I didn't realize that she's 15 years older than you.
Now, how would you know how old I am?
That is a very closely guarded secret.
[Sighs] I did some research.
Very resourceful.
I did it to assure myself that you can handle a heavier workload.
I appreciate that, but I'm not worried about my health.
Is it the money?
Because I can guarantee, 200 million up front is just 1/10 of what you stand to make on this deal.
Michael, my dolls eat better than most people.
I've got plenty of money.
This deal meant staying on for five more years and doubling my workload.
[Sighs] [Clears throat]
I am going to take my grandchildren on a cruise to Tahiti.
Tahiti?
You know, the licensing agreement includes a theme park.
You could-- you could take them there.
It's not about the deal.
I have had this same view for 25 years.
I need a change of scenery.
I am gonna speak to Harvey, and I'm gonna tell him that I want to sell the whole business.
So...
I just spoke to Judge Palermo.
And because he thinks I'm a good guy, and I told him I'd owe him one, your case is gonna be moved up way ahead.
Back scratch.
I don't have a firstborn, you know, so what exactly do you want for that?
No, you're not getting one of my ties.
No.
Your shoulder?
What-- your lapel--
Donna?
[Laughs] Oh, God.
Norma is going to Istanbul for two weeks, and you know that I'm not good with temps.
Oh, my God.
Ask me for something else.
Harvey, this is non-negotiable.
You owe me now.
Donna is one thing that I can't give you.
- Why not?
- For one thing, she'd never agree to it.
You're her boss.
You just tell her to do stuff.
I don't tell her to do anything.
She just does.
All right, fine.
You know what?
That's just...
Not a problem.
I will call Judge Palermo, and I'll tell him
I was mistaken, and then your hearing will be in,
I don't know, maybe six months?
I tell you what.
If you can convince her yourself, you have my blessing.
She's gonna love me so much, you're gonna fight to get her back.
Hi, Donna.
Harvey and I were just, uh, talking about you.
And--
- No.
You don't even know what I was gonna say.
Yes, I do.
And how is that possible?
I read lips, I know body language, and I talk to Norma.
I'm not some token you win at a fair, Louis.
You're not--I know you're not.
You're not a token.
I'm a human being, and I--
Yes, you are.
I'm sorry, I just-- you know what, that just made me feel really...
Cheap.
I--
No, I'm just trying to tell you that you're really good at what you do, Donna.
So I'm gonna ask you--
It's like my soul hurts now.
No, Donna, listen, even if your soul hurts a little bit--
I'm sorry.
[Sobs]
It's okay.
It's gonna be fine.
Don't cry.
Please don't cry, Donna.
- [Sobs]
- Oh, sh--.
I think I owe you one for that.
That was fun.
Wait a second, the-- the time that you cried, and then I let your parents stay in my condo--
Yup.

Oh, no.
I'm privy to all communication between you and the court.
Well, if your driving matched your legal knowledge, we wouldn't be here.
Your Honor.
This case should be dismissed.
It's a matter for insurance.
Insurance only covers repairs.
It does not deal with my losses.
What losses?
Because of the accident, I missed my chance to get my taxi medallion.
You can't just buy it next year?
The loan I got expires in one week.
On top of that, a medallion costs 300,000 this go-round.
Next year, 350.
So his entire claim rests upon the assumption that he would've won this year's medallion.
The hallmark of America is that the little guy gets to see justice done.
We are all equals in the eyes of the law.
That is why, out of all the countries in the world,
I chose to come here.
What do you got to say about that, counselor?
I say Atticus Finch makes a good speech here, but this is a fender-bender, not a multimillion-dollar lawsuit.
Vicarious liability applies to discrimination, harassment, and accidents.
Employers are responsible for their employees' negligence.
Court finds a reasonable suit here.
Trial starts tomorrow.
Thank you, Your Honor.
You're getting a good kick out of this, aren't you?
I am.
But I'm taking this on its merits.
And you better bring your "A" game tomorrow, 'cause he's got a legitimate claim.
He wants a trial?
I'll give him a goddamn trial.
Your Honor.
So how many cases have you won?
I only remember how many I've lost.
None.

Let's say we get a bottle and take the party back to your place?
Make it a bottle of Dom, and you're on.
All right, how about four bottles?
Come on.

Cab, four bottles of Dom.

[Sighs] How did you know?
I didn't.
Until now.
- [Sighs]
- I told you, a puppy can't clean up its own mess.
Mess?
All I did was tell her about my grandmother.
Your job is to make my life easier.
If you can't understand that, why did I hire you?
Police report summarized.
Traffic signal analysis.
Medallion bids, attendees, and results.
That's why you hired me.
I thought you were all over the Joy situation.
Instead, you're all over page six.
You wanted me to do pro bono work, this is it.
Pro bono enhances a firm's image.
This makes us look like wealthy bullies against an everyman cabbie.
Does that seem like it enhances our image to you?
I refuse to answer that, on the grounds that I don't want to.

Someone had a fun night.

Piece of advice-- when the big dog asks the puppy something like that, it's a rhetorical question.
Got it.
Before you go, the phone call, the other day, when you answered it during the meeting...
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
Won't happen again.
Who was it?
Um, it's just a friend.
You know, an emergency.
What kind of emergency?
- Um--
- Was it a friend who almost got you busted for drug trafficking?
That friend?
Trevor?
He's not dealing anymore, Harvey.
So it was him.
He called you from jail?
You know, I make a living learning how to read people, Mike.
So if I saw it, Jessica did too.
Is that the kind of impression you want to leave around here?
This guy is not your friend.
He is an anchor dragging you down.
Get rid of him.
He is my oldest friend, Harvey.
I wasn't just gonna let him rot in jail.
What's gonna happen the next time?
'Cause there will be a next time.
You gonna bail him out?
Put yourself in jeopardy?
You know, if it weren't for Trevor, you and I never would've met.

I asked you, how'd you get that tear?
A couple of guys came to the firm.
They were looking for me.
I don't know what they wanted, but I'm...
I'm pretty sure it something to do with some shit Trevor did.
And that big brain of yours doesn't remember me saying to cut ties with that loser?
You know what?
You've been blowing off Joy's deal all week for your friend, okay?
So please.
First of all, Trevor's not your friend.
You want to know why I'm loyal to Ray?
I was taking a limo, and I left $3,000 in it.
Ray happened to be the driver.
He found it and tracked me down.
Not a nickel of it was missing, and his first reaction when this accident occurred was to ask if we were okay.
Now, what would Trevor's have been?
Cut him off.
Now, as far as the licensing deal goes, just because you think I'm blowing something off doesn't mean I am.
Now, watch and learn.

Everything's set for you to walk away.
We're selling your stake as a block.
[Children screaming] Your, uh, headhunter's lining up your replacement as we speak.
[Glass shatters] Well, Harvey, this was the most wonderful surprise.

And you'll have all the free time in the world to spend with them.
Joey broke the lamp.

Now, how soon can we send 'em home?

And you were gonna fly them out all along.
Do you remember when I said,
"You don't send a puppy to clean up its own mess?"
Yes, Harvey, I do.
I'm not a puppy.
Court will come to order.
Mr. Santana, your opening statement, please.
Driving a cab is not very glamorous.
But it's an honest day's work.
Ever since I started, I looked forward to a time when I could tell customers that they were riding in my cab.
That I was an owner-operator.
So I scrimped, and I saved, until I finally had enough put away to buy a medallion.
But...
Because of the actions of this man,
I've lost that opportunity.
So make no mistake, this-- this trial is not about a busted headlight.
This is a trial about a broken dream.
Forget the case, they're gonna make him president.
Statements are like free throws--easy.
Nobody's playing defense.
Are we good at defense?
You would agree that chauffeur drivers cause more accidents--
Objection.
Badgering.
Sustained.
Objection.
Argumentative.
Leading the witness.
Ambiguous.
Privileged.
Inflammatory.
Sustained.
Anything further, Mr. Santana?
Yes, Your Honor, I would like to call to the stand Mr. Michael Ross, please.
Uh-- [Clears throat]
What time had you called for the limo on the morning of the accident?
Uh, we were supposed to leave at 8:30.
And what time did you get to work?
Objection.
Irrelevant.
It's highly relevant, Your Honor.
It speaks to the psychology of the driver,
Rahim Benghazi.
Overruled.
Answer Mr. Santana's question.
[Sighs] 8:40.
So unless Mr. Benghazi made up for that lost time, you were going to be late for that meeting, correct?
Yes.
No further questions, Your Honor.
[Clears throat]
When the accident occurred, you were on your way to the medallion auction.
When and where was this auction to take place?
9:00 a.m., City Hall.
According to the police report, the accident occurred at 8:53 a.m.
That means you only had seven minutes to get downtown in rush hour traffic.
Objection, irrelevant.
I believe when I made the same objection, you told his honor it was highly relevant.
Overruled.
You were running late, only the stakes for you were much higher, weren't they?
These things never start on time.
Then why was the first medallion sold at 9:03 a.m.?
You were scared your chance at a medallion was going up in smoke, and you ran a red.
Then you used the accident to paint me and Ray Benghazi as a couple of scapegoats.
You can't prove that.
What color was the light?
I take the fifth.
You can't take the fifth, Mr. Santana.
This isn't a criminal case.
What color was the light?
He cut me off.
You claim to love our legal system so much, answer the question.
What color was the light?
What color was the light?
Your Honor?
Answer the question, Mr. Santana.
It just meant so much to me.
Your Honor, can I sidebar with opposing counsel?
We can roll the dice with the jury, but I'd rather settle.
Well, how much would I have to pay?
Nothing.
You take responsibility for the accident, and your insurance company makes Ray whole.
In return,
I waive my right to collect legal fees.
[Sighs]
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
I've got a reputation to maintain.
That goes for you too, judge.
[Phone rings]
Damn it, Trevor.
I left you like five messages.
Good to know your boy's flaky with everyone.
I was taking it personal.
What do you want?
Well, Trevor owes us $50,000 he's never paid, so you're gonna bail him out.
Listen,
I don't have that kind of money, okay?
I can't.
Well, if you're not down here in an hour with it, we're gonna take it out on Trevor.
Tell him where the money is.
Whatever you do, don't show up.
[Winces]
Trevor!
You have one hour.
Hello?
Hello?
What do you think you're doing, leaving in the middle of a trial?
I got some things to take care of.
You mean someone to take care of.
You never cut Trevor off, did you?
No, I didn't.
My friend's in trouble, and I'm gonna help him.
You know what?
This is what addicts do.
The second they start making progress, they screw up, because deep down they think it's only a matter of time until they fail.
They'd rather fall from the third floor than the penthouse.
Nothing you say can stop me.
Then tell me what the hell's going on.
[Sighs]
He's clean.
No wires.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
You remember what happened with the guy.
He was 300 pounds.
Now, who'd you say you were again?
Trevor's lawyer.
Trevor didn't mention a lawyer.
He doesn't know he hired me.
[Laughs] Come on.
Open the briefcase.
Where's the goddamn money?
That photo is a screen shot, taken from my firm's security video.
We know what you look like.
And if Mike Ross doesn't hear from me in the next five minutes, he's calling the police.
[Laughs]
No, man.
You're not comin' in here and threatening' us.
You're looking at kidnapping, extortion, and drug-dealing, and the district attorney happens to be number three on my speed dial.
Well, if we're looking at all that time, you might as well add murder.
I got a better idea.
Retainer agreement.
If you sign right here, you'll become one of my clients.
And I won't be able to testify against you, even if I wanted to.
What about the money?
This envelope contains $10,000.
Consider it a down payment on Trevor's debt.
Only here's the thing,
I don't do pro bono work.
And my retainer agreement requires a down payment of $10,000.
Now, as your attorney, my job is to give you advice.
So here's the deal.
Sign the agreement.
[Sighs]
I thought I said not to come.
Remember that 40 bucks from the fifth grade you owe me?
If you were dead, how would I collect?
[Sighing] Oh, man.
I'm sorry, I just...
Put you in trouble just by hanging out with you.
So why'd you do it?
'Cause I'm a dick.
[Both chuckle]
Bet you didn't think you'd have to save my ass so soon after bailing me out.
I wasn't the one who saved you.
Yeah.
Well, as a friend, the guy puts me to shame.
Harvey's not my friend, trust me.
Well, he didn't put his ass on the line because of me.
Listen, I pled you down to a misdemeanor--
- Ugh.
- Drunk and disorderly.
And I paid the fine.
[Sighs]
I think it might be a good idea if you got out of town for a while.
[Sighs]
Montana.
Well, you said you wanted a clean slate.
I figured 20 hours on a bus ought to do the trick.
Oh, yeah, it'll do me good.

Yeah.

Well, accident, on purpose, the really important thing is, is that I'm taller than you.
Yeah.
Yup, you look much thinner in that.
You planted that story, be man enough to own it.
I don't traffic in the tabloids, Harvey.
But I can see how whoever planted this might find it amusing.
You know, the great Harvey Specter bullying a humble cab driver.
I mean, it's a no-win situation, really.
Well, maybe you didn't hear.
I won the no-win situation.
Did it ever occur to you that if you hadn't done that to me,
I actually would have owed you one?
Maybe if you didn't humiliate me in front of the associates--

No, sir, it was not!
Are you calling me a liar?
- Back off.
- Mind your business, okay?
- No, I'm minding my business.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Anyone throws a punch, or I'm gonna introduce you to Mr. Taser.
Trade insurance,
I'll take reports, one at a time.
Yeah, as much as I'd like to help you out,
I'm late for a meeting.
No, no, no.
You're not going anywhere.
I need a statement from you too.
Here's mine.
I need you to babysit the client till I get there.
And don't mention the deal.
If she asks any questions, just nod your head and look pretty.
Ms. McAfee, I'm Mike Ross.
I work with Harvey.
Oh, you're the protege that he's been gushing about.
He was gushing?
Well, he mentioned that you existed.
For Harvey, that's gushing.
Uh, he's running a few minutes late today.
Um, car trouble.
I was just about to have tea with the girls.
Would you care to join me?
I'd love to.
Good.
And for heaven's sakes, call me Joy.
Okay, Joy.
These...
Are the girls.
Susie, Sarah,
Stacy, Sinclair, and Sabrina.
Susie, where are your manners?
Shake hands with this nice young man.
Mm...
Just kidding, I know they're dolls.
Oh.
They're named after my daughters.
I started the company because of them, really.
You know, dolls didn't used to be these cheap, plastic bimbos from China that we have today.
Your mother made them for you by hand.
I wanted my girls to have that same experience.
And here we are, 30 years later.
Every parent's worst nightmare.
What do you mean?
These little angels, they sell for $90 a pop.
I wasn't born with a butler, you know.
I gotta say, this is amazing, taking on a project like a licensing deal.
Why is that amazing?
Well, my grandmother could never pull this off.
She's been retired for ten years.
How is that treating her?
She lives near my apartment.
I get to see her once a week, so...
- That's very sweet of you.
- No.
No, it's not.
You know, whenever I needed her, she was there.
You know, no matter what.
She'd give me a hug, she'd tell me everything is gonna be all right.
And...
Even if it wasn't.
And now that she needs me, I am always at work.
And I'm...
I'm so sorry.
Yeah?
Never answer your phone in front of a client.
- But it's you.
- What's happening?
Well, actually we're in the middle of a tea party.
I knew you were the doll-playing type.
Put Joy on.
Ms. McAfee, it's Harvey.
Oh.
Joy, I'm sorry,
I have to reschedule.
No need to apologize.
I like this one.
I'll send him back after tea.
Tell me you didn't ask our client for a doggy bag.
What can I say?
Stacy insisted.
Just got off with Joy McAfee's general counsel.
It seems she had an epiphany.
She wants less on her plate, not more.
I thought you were going to close her.
We need that doll money.
I'm on top of it.
Harvey took five months to structure that deal.
Please don't make me set fire to your desk.
I...
All you had to do was have tea with the dolls.
Donna, schedule another tea party with Joy as soon as possible.
And text me the names of her girls.
Oh, what a shock.
You can't keep girls' names straight in your head.
Just yours, Debbie.
See, that's funny because your name is Donna.
Harvey Specter.
I got your order right here.
I didn't order a pizza.
You've been served.
Cab driver who hit Ray named me as a witness in a civil suit.
I need to pay Travis Bickle a visit.
Harvey, if you let me go talk to Joy,
I know I can fix this...
No.
You don't send a puppy to clean up its own mess.
Optimally, you don't even have a puppy.
Ross, rumor has it you talked a client out of $200 million.
The deal's not off the table, all right?
It's just a speed bump.
Dude, I think we just found him a new nickname.
Speed Bump!
I feel like I'm back in high school.
They called you Speed Bump in high school?
Kidding.
But if you need any boxes to pack up your office, just...
Ow.
Hmm, wait a minute, uh...
There.
I think that belongs to you.
It wouldn't hurt so much if you had thicker skin.
What do you want?
I wanna pay you back for posting bail.
Trevor, you've owed me 40 bucks since fifth grade.
I wrote it off, okay?
Look, I want a clean slate, okay?
So you don't want to see me, I'll mail you a check.
Okay.
Yeah, let's hang out tomorrow night.
Nothing crazy, though, all right?
I have to be up early.
We can crochet panty hose if that's what it takes to be cool.
I think we can do a little better than that.
Why don't we, uh...
Why don't we say Rex's, 7:30.
First six rounds are on me.
If you're serious about paying me back, the first 100 rounds are on you.
All right.
So it's the tough guy.
This is a matter for insurance, not a frivolous lawsuit.
You know, for your information,
I suffered emotional pain.
Emotional pain?
Rub this on your emotional pain.
You condescending son of a...
Look at me, I am gonna warn you once.
Do not pursue this matter.
You know, I have been held up at gunpoint three times.
So do you think a fancy suit and a $500 haircut, that's gonna scare me?
You take my driver to court, I'm gonna represent him myself.
And when you lose, you'll be covering my fee, which is gonna be a hell of a lot of haircuts.
Hmm, so you weren't a one-way fare.
Ray's worked for me eight years.
Then you don't have to worry about being a witness, because as his employer, you're liable for his actions.
You know, I think you've seen way too many reruns of Ally McBeal.
Hmm.
You know, I emigrated here after September 11th, and they shut the doors on everybody.
I couldn't pay for a lawyer, so I had to take them to court.
I sued for my citizenship, so I have a very special appreciation for the law.
I appreciate a good single malt.
I don't pretend I can make one.
I wiped the floor with the U.S. government, counselor.
I'm gonna do the same with you.
- Ray.
- Donna.
What are you doin' here?
I don't have you scheduled.
Uh, I need to see Harvey.
Oh, come on.
You know the rules.
No one sets foot in there without a warrant, a papal edict, or my say-so.
I just got named in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit.
The accident wasn't my fault.
Can I get in to see Harvey, please?
Okay, say no more.
I will get you in.
You are so beautiful when you're forceful.
I know you meant that as a compliment, but I don't appreciate limitations being placed on my beauty.
Harvey, I'm already losing money with my car in the shop.
A trial means I can't work.
And how do you think my name is gonna play in front of a New York jury?
Rahim Benghazi.
I may as well buy a one-way ticket to Guantanamo.
- Not gonna happen.
- If I lose,
I won't even be able to afford a livery license, let alone my insurance.
That's why I'm gonna be defending both of us.
Ray, this goes against every fiber of my being.
I'm taking your case pro bono.
I don't know what to say.
Absolutely nothing, I've got a reputation to maintain.
Besides, it's not gonna take long, okay?
I'm gonna get it dismissed.
Donna, call the court.
We need priority status on the docket.
Yeah, I already tried.
You drew Judge Palermo.
You know what you have to do, don't you?
Yeah.
The other thing that goes against every fiber of my being.
Louis, has anyone told you you're an exquisite soprano?
What do you want, Harvey?
You're right.
Why prolong my suffering?
I need you to get me in to see Judge Palermo.
You need my help, and you're not gonna pull rank on me?
Your case has nothing to do with firm business, does it?
What's it gonna take?
A mani-pedi?
Tickets to Celine?
I'll see what I can do.
And your pound of flesh?
I need my back scratched, I'll let you know.
Louis, unless that's a metaphor, the deal's off.
Huh.
Joy, when I told you that my grandmother didn't have much time,
I...
I didn't realize that she's 15 years older than you.
Now, how would you know how old I am?
That is a very closely guarded secret.
I did some research.
Very resourceful.
I did it to assure myself that you can handle a heavier workload.
I appreciate that, but I'm not worried about my health.
Is it the money?
Because I can guarantee, 200 million up front is just 1/10 of what you stand to make on this deal.
Michael, my dolls eat better than most people.
I've got plenty of money.
This deal meant staying on for five more years and doubling my workload.
I am going to take my grandchildren on a cruise to Tahiti.
Tahiti?
You know, the licensing agreement includes a theme park.
You could...
you could take them there.
It's not about the deal.
I have had this same view for 25 years.
I need a change of scenery.
I am gonna speak to Harvey, and I'm gonna tell him that I want to sell the whole business.
So...
I just spoke to Judge Palermo.
And because he thinks I'm a good guy, and I told him I'd owe him one, your case is gonna be moved up way ahead.
Back scratch.
I don't have a firstborn, you know, so what exactly do you want for that?
No, you're not getting one of my ties.
No.
Your shoulder?
What... your lapel...
Donna?
Oh, God.
Norma is going to Istanbul for two weeks, and you know that I'm not good with temps.
Oh, my God.
Ask me for something else.
Harvey, this is non-negotiable.
You owe me now.
Donna is one thing that I can't give you.
- Why not?
- For one thing, she'd never agree to it.
You're her boss.
You just tell her to do stuff.
I don't tell her to do anything.
She just does.
All right, fine.
You know what?
That's just...
Not a problem.
I will call Judge Palermo, and I'll tell him
I was mistaken, and then your hearing will be in,
I don't know, maybe six months?
I tell you what.
If you can convince her yourself, you have my blessing.
She's gonna love me so much, you're gonna fight to get her back.
Hi, Donna.
Harvey and I were just, uh, talking about you.
And...
No.
You don't even know what I was gonna say.
Yes, I do.
And how is that possible?
I read lips, I know body language, and I talk to Norma.
I'm not some token you win at a fair, Louis.
You're not...
I know you're not.
You're not a token.
I'm a human being, and I...
Yes, you are.
I'm sorry, I just... you know what, that just made me feel really...
Cheap.
I...
No, I'm just trying to tell you that you're really good at what you do, Donna.
So I'm gonna ask you...
It's like my soul hurts now.
No, Donna, listen, even if your soul hurts a little bit...
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It's gonna be fine.
Don't cry.
Please don't cry, Donna.
Oh, sh...
I think I owe you one for that.
That was fun.
Wait a second, the...
the time that you cried, and then I let your parents stay in my condo...
Yup.

I mean, all I did was set you up on a drug bust.
Oh, God, that was too soon.
I'm sorry.
Hi, ladies.
How are you?
Um, I want to let you know, if you... either of you ever get arrested for anything, you call this guy.
He's the best attorney in the city.
Well, what would we get arrested for?
- Um...

I don't know.
What are you thinking about doing?

What's he doing here?
You think you can schedule a meeting without me knowing it?
Oh, no.
I'm privy to all communication between you and the court.
Well, if your driving matched your legal knowledge, we wouldn't be here.
Your Honor.
This case should be dismissed.
It's a matter for insurance.
Insurance only covers repairs.
It does not deal with my losses.
What losses?
Because of the accident, I missed my chance to get my taxi medallion.
You can't just buy it next year?
The loan I got expires in one week.
On top of that, a medallion costs 300,000 this go-round.
Next year, 350.
So his entire claim rests upon the assumption that he would've won this year's medallion.
The hallmark of America is that the little guy gets to see justice done.
We are all equals in the eyes of the law.
That is why, out of all the countries in the world,
I chose to come here.
What do you got to say about that, counselor?
I say Atticus Finch makes a good speech here, but this is a fender-bender, not a multimillion-dollar lawsuit.
Vicarious liability applies to discrimination, harassment, and accidents.
Employers are responsible for their employees' negligence.
Court finds a reasonable suit here.
Trial starts tomorrow.
Thank you, Your Honor.
You're getting a good kick out of this, aren't you?
I am.
But I'm taking this on its merits.
And you better bring your "A" game tomorrow, 'cause he's got a legitimate claim.
He wants a trial?
I'll give him a goddamn trial.
Your Honor.
So how many cases have you won?
I only remember how many I've lost.
None.
Wait, what happened to the drinks?
I got a better idea.
Let's say we get a bottle and take the party back to your place?
Make it a bottle of Dom, and you're on.
All right, how about four bottles?
Come on.
You guys want to get a cab?
Definitely.
Definitely.
Cab, four bottles of Dom.
You want to spend any more of my money?
Just relax, okay?
It's an investment in the evening.
And, uh, I just said the thing about the bottles to get the girls out of the bar.
Really?
'Cause it looked like you were trying to get away from those guys.
Taxi!
- What guys?
- The guys in the back.
You know what I'm talking about.
Come on, who are they?
What?
Those two?
I...
I...
I don't know.
Where are all the...
Cabs?
Well, it looked like they knew you, and not in a very good way.
I...
I don't know.
Maybe they were, uh, flirting with our dates, okay?
I'd be pissed too if I watched those legs walk away from me.
How are we doin', ladies?
My feet are killing me in these heels.
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, Trevor, come on...
- Taxi!
- Seriously, stop playing with me.
What was that about back there?
Look, I'm not playing with you, all right?
But just play your cards right, maybe you and, uh, maybe Marcella will, uh, maybe she'll play with you.
Okay.
Now, it's gonna be a tight squeeze.

Want to go after him?
No, we're gonna get to him through this guy.

You wanted to see me?
Did you go see Joy after I told you not to?
How did you know?
I didn't.
Until now.
I told you, a puppy can't clean up its own mess.
Mess?
All I did was tell her about my grandmother.
Your job is to make my life easier.
If you can't understand that, why did I hire you?
Police report summarized.
Traffic signal analysis.
Medallion bids, attendees, and results.
That's why you hired me.
I thought you were all over the Joy situation.
Instead, you're all over page six.
You wanted me to do pro bono work, this is it.
Pro bono enhances a firm's image.
This makes us look like wealthy bullies against an everyman cabbie.
Does that seem like it enhances our image to you?
I refuse to answer that, on the grounds that I don't want to.
Someone had a fun night.
Answer another call you shouldn't have?
I...
I...
I didn't...
I was...
Piece of advice...
when the big dog asks the puppy something like that, it's a rhetorical question.
Got it.
Before you go, the phone call, the other day, when you answered it during the meeting...
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
Won't happen again.
Who was it?
Um, it's just a friend.
You know, an emergency.
What kind of emergency?
- Um...
- Was it a friend who almost got you busted for drug trafficking?
That friend?
Trevor?
He's not dealing anymore, Harvey.
So it was him.
He called you from jail?
You know, I make a living learning how to read people, Mike.
So if I saw it, Jessica did too.
Is that the kind of impression you want to leave around here?
This guy is not your friend.
He is an anchor dragging you down.
Get rid of him.
He is my oldest friend, Harvey.
I wasn't just gonna let him rot in jail.
What's gonna happen the next time?
'Cause there will be a next time.
You gonna bail him out?
Put yourself in jeopardy?
You know, if it weren't for Trevor, you and I never would've met.
Cut him loose.
We're here to see Mike Ross.
He's an associate.
His friend Trevor referred us.
Thank you.
Hey.
It looked like they knew you, and not in a very good way.
♪ ♪
Hey!
Hey!
Excuse me, officer.
Is... is Central Park that way?
Yeah, just go right there.
Uh, I'm sorry, I'm...
I'm...
I'm really terrible with direction.
Is it this street, right here?
- Yeah, this street, yes.
- This street.
Right here?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Trevor, it's Mike.
Call me back.
I need to know what the hell's going on.
Did you get the red velvet cupcakes?
Yes, three dozen, extra icing.
How the hell did that happen?
Okay.
You know what?
There.
Problem solved.
I asked you, how'd you get that tear?
A couple of guys came to the firm.
They were looking for me.
I don't know what they wanted, but I'm...
I'm pretty sure it something to do with some shit Trevor did.
And that big brain of yours doesn't remember me saying to cut ties with that loser?
You know what?
You've been blowing off Joy's deal all week for your friend, okay?
So please.
First of all, Trevor's not your friend.
You want to know why I'm loyal to Ray?
I was taking a limo, and I left $3,000 in it.
Ray happened to be the driver.
He found it and tracked me down.
Not a nickel of it was missing, and his first reaction when this accident occurred was to ask if we were okay.
Now, what would Trevor's have been?
Cut him off.
Now, as far as the licensing deal goes, just because you think I'm blowing something off doesn't mean I am.
Now, watch and learn.
Everything's set for you to walk away.
We're selling your stake as a block.
Your, uh, headhunter's lining up your replacement as we speak.
Well, Harvey, this was the most wonderful surprise.
You're a long-time client who wants to be with her family.
It's the least I could do.
And you'll have all the free time in the world to spend with them.
Joey broke the lamp.
Oh, that's great.
Now, how soon can we send 'em home?
They're booked on the first flight out, tomorrow morning.
So when you had Donna text you the girls' names...
I was talking about her daughters.
And you were gonna fly them out all along.
Do you remember when I said,
"You don't send a puppy to clean up its own mess?"
Yes, Harvey, I do.
I'm not a puppy.
Court will come to order.
Mr. Santana, your opening statement, please.
Driving a cab is not very glamorous.
But it's an honest day's work.
Ever since I started, I looked forward to a time when I could tell customers that they were riding in my cab.
That I was an owner-operator.
So I scrimped, and I saved, until I finally had enough put away to buy a medallion.
But...
Because of the actions of this man,
I've lost that opportunity.
So make no mistake, this... this trial is not about a busted headlight.
This is a trial about a broken dream.
Forget the case, they're gonna make him president.
Statements are like free throws... easy.
Nobody's playing defense.
Are we good at defense?
You would agree that chauffeur drivers cause more accidents...
Objection.
Badgering.
Sustained.
Objection.
Argumentative.
Leading the witness.
Ambiguous.
Privileged.
Inflammatory.
Sustained.
Anything further, Mr. Santana?
Yes, Your Honor, I would like to call to the stand Mr. Michael Ross, please.
Uh...
What time had you called for the limo on the morning of the accident?
Uh, we were supposed to leave at 8:30.
And what time did you get to work?
Objection.
Irrelevant.
It's highly relevant, Your Honor.
It speaks to the psychology of the driver,
Rahim Benghazi.
Overruled.
Answer Mr. Santana's question.
8:40.
So unless Mr. Benghazi made up for that lost time, you were going to be late for that meeting, correct?
Yes.
No further questions, Your Honor.
When the accident occurred, you were on your way to the medallion auction.
When and where was this auction to take place?
9:00 a.m., City Hall.
According to the police report, the accident occurred at 8:53 a.m.
That means you only had seven minutes to get downtown in rush hour traffic.
Objection, irrelevant.
I believe when I made the same objection, you told his honor it was highly relevant.
Overruled.
You were running late, only the stakes for you were much higher, weren't they?
These things never start on time.
Then why was the first medallion sold at 9:03 a.m.?
You were scared your chance at a medallion was going up in smoke, and you ran a red.
Then you used the accident to paint me and Ray Benghazi as a couple of scapegoats.
You can't prove that.
What color was the light?
I take the fifth.
You can't take the fifth, Mr. Santana.
This isn't a criminal case.
What color was the light?
He cut me off.
You claim to love our legal system so much, answer the question.
What color was the light?
What color was the light?
Your Honor?
Answer the question, Mr. Santana.
It just meant so much to me.
Your Honor, can I sidebar with opposing counsel?
We can roll the dice with the jury, but I'd rather settle.
Well, how much would I have to pay?
Nothing.
You take responsibility for the accident, and your insurance company makes Ray whole.
In return,
I waive my right to collect legal fees.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
I've got a reputation to maintain.
That goes for you too, judge.
Damn it, Trevor.
I left you like five messages.
Good to know your boy's flaky with everyone.
I was taking it personal.
What do you want?
Well, Trevor owes us $50,000 he's never paid, so you're gonna bail him out.
Listen,
I don't have that kind of money, okay?
I can't.
Well, if you're not down here in an hour with it, we're gonna take it out on Trevor.
Tell him where the money is.
Whatever you do, don't show up.
Trevor!
You have one hour.
Hello?
Hello?
What do you think you're doing, leaving in the middle of a trial?
I got some things to take care of.
You mean someone to take care of.
You never cut Trevor off, did you?
No, I didn't.
My friend's in trouble, and I'm gonna help him.
You know what?
This is what addicts do.
The second they start making progress, they screw up, because deep down they think it's only a matter of time until they fail.
They'd rather fall from the third floor than the penthouse.
Nothing you say can stop me.
Then tell me what the hell's going on.
He's clean.
No wires.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
You remember what happened with the guy.
He was 300 pounds.
Now, who'd you say you were again?
Trevor's lawyer.
Trevor didn't mention a lawyer.
He doesn't know he hired me.
Come on.
Open the briefcase.
Where's the goddamn money?
That photo is a screen shot, taken from my firm's security video.
We know what you look like.
And if Mike Ross doesn't hear from me in the next five minutes, he's calling the police.
No, man.
You're not comin' in here and threatening' us.
You're looking at kidnapping, extortion, and drug-dealing, and the district attorney happens to be number three on my speed dial.
Well, if we're looking at all that time, you might as well add murder.
I got a better idea.
Retainer agreement.
If you sign right here, you'll become one of my clients.
And I won't be able to testify against you, even if I wanted to.
What about the money?
This envelope contains $10,000.
Consider it a down payment on Trevor's debt.
Only here's the thing,
I don't do pro bono work.
And my retainer agreement requires a down payment of $10,000.
Now, as your attorney, my job is to give you advice.
So here's the deal.
Sign the agreement.
I thought I said not to come.
Remember that 40 bucks from the fifth grade you owe me?
If you were dead, how would I collect?
Oh, man.
I'm sorry, I just...
Put you in trouble just by hanging out with you.
So why'd you do it?
'Cause I'm a dick.
Bet you didn't think you'd have to save my ass so soon after bailing me out.
I wasn't the one who saved you.
Yeah.
Well, as a friend, the guy puts me to shame.
Harvey's not my friend, trust me.
Well, he didn't put his ass on the line because of me.
Listen, I pled you down to a misdemeanor...
- Ugh.
- Drunk and disorderly.
And I paid the fine.
I think it might be a good idea if you got out of town for a while.
Montana.
Well, you said you wanted a clean slate.
I figured 20 hours on a bus ought to do the trick.
Oh, yeah, it'll do me good.
Wait.
When I get back, you know who the first person I'm gonna call is.
Yeah.
The one person you know who'll answer.
For you.
What's this?
I'm very happy you took Ray on pro bono.
You, on the other hand, can afford our services.
You want me to pay me to represent me?
Mm-hmm.
Ten hours at $1,000 an hour.
Eh, yeah, I'll let you do the math.
You can't be serious.
I'll tell you what I am serious about.
I hear you're finally mentoring the kid.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Really, because I understand that you dropped the puppy analogy on him, which is exactly what I used on you.
May have slipped out by accident.
Well, accident, on purpose, the really important thing is, is that I'm taller than you.
Yeah.
Yup, you look much thinner in that.
You planted that story, be man enough to own it.
I don't traffic in the tabloids, Harvey.
But I can see how whoever planted this might find it amusing.
You know, the great Harvey Specter bullying a humble cab driver.
I mean, it's a no-win situation, really.
Well, maybe you didn't hear.
I won the no-win situation.
Did it ever occur to you that if you hadn't done that to me,
I actually would have owed you one?
Maybe if you didn't humiliate me in front of the associates...
Louis, for an average attorney, 100 million is a career case.
If I'm mocking you, it means I think you're above average.
But stress balls?
You're making it too easy.
You put Trevor on the bus to the boondocks?
Yeah.
Can I ask you a question?
After all this, you really think I'm still buying the Mr. I-don't-give-a-crap thing?
Joy sent a little token of her appreciation.
She got your hair just right.
Did she ever make one of these for you?
Not that you'll ever see.

You don't know the lyrics, do you?
I don't even know the lyrics, Louis.
Now are we practicing law down here, or auditioning a chorus line?
It's called esprit de corps.
And I just got a $100 million jury award overturned.
I don't have to overturn awards like that because I've never lost one in the first place.
So what is this, a new cologne or just a hint of jealousy?
I'm surprised you, uh, don't recognize your wife's perfume.
I know, you're not married.
It's still funny.
You do realize we're celebrating making fat people even fatter, right?
If you wanted to do good, you should've been a fake doctor.
Business cards.
Yup.
My mistake is now official.
Come with me.
And learn the goddamn lyrics to the Harvard song, will ya?
Oakhurst Capital has agreed to a $200 million licensing deal.
We are at the goal line.
How are we on brand protection?
The contract is airtight.
The only issue here is to get the Joyful Toy Company to close.
I'll go over it with Joy one-on-one.
- Uh...
- And if it does ring, you answer it.
Oh.
Yeah.
Not in here.
I--okay.
Don't feel the need to rush back when you're done.
Who is this?
Dude, it's Trevor.
Don't hang up.
I only get one call.
I'm in jail.
I--I tried to hop this bus at Port Authority.
I was drunk.
It's all messed up.
Look, I know we haven't talked since we fought, but I didn't know who else to call.
Hey.
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
- I'm gonna pay you back.
- Yeah, you better.
Your ball cost me everything I have in the bank.
The thing is,
I don't have the money.
What are you talking about?
You're clearing $10,000 a month selling weed.
It went out as fast as it came in.
Came in?
I quit.
I'm not dealing anymore.
- Bullshit.
- I'm serious.
After we fought, I don't know.
Things just started to fall apart.
Jenny broke up with me.
I didn't know.
Well, I just realized I needed to make a change.
Even sold my bong.
What have you done with my friend?
Yeah.
You should talk.
Look at you.
You look like Gordon Gekko's little brother.
What, are you working on Wall Street, man?
Why'd you call me, Trevor?
You're the one person I knew would show up.
You want to ask me for anything...else?
Look, all I care about right now is keeping my record clean.
You don't happen to know any good lawyers, do ya?
No.
I don't.
Suits 1x05 Bail Out Original Air Date on July 21, 2011
Why the rush now?
You've already wasted ten minutes of my life.
Please tell me you didn't wait ten minutes just to scold me.
I've been waiting for you to bring the paperwork down so I can close a nine-figure licensing deal.
If your phone rings while I'm talking to Ray,
I'm throwing it out of the car while it's attached to your hand.
Eddie Hope and the Mannish Boys.
1959, three guesses.
Guesses?
You insult me, Harvey.
Don't worry, we won't be late.
Okay, what was the name of the record label?
Marlin records.
Who covered it in the late '60s?
Ahh!
I want to say The Stones, but--
You need some guesses?
Oh!
Oh, my God.
Just like a private car service, huh?
Thinking you don't have to yield?
What?
Yield?
You ran a red light!
That light was yellow!
No, sir, it was not!
Are you calling me a liar?
- Back off.
- Mind your business, okay?
- No, I'm minding my business.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Anyone throws a punch, or I'm gonna introduce you to Mr. Taser.
Trade insurance,
I'll take reports, one at a time.
Yeah, as much as I'd like to help you out,
I'm late for a meeting.
No, no, no.
You're not going anywhere.
I need a statement from you too.
Here's mine.
I need you to babysit the client till I get there.
And don't mention the deal.
If she asks any questions, just nod your head and look pretty.
Ms. McAfee, I'm Mike Ross.
I work with Harvey.
Oh, you're the protege that he's been gushing about.
He was gushing?
Well, he mentioned that you existed.
For Harvey, that's gushing.
Uh, he's running a few minutes late today.
Um, car trouble.
I was just about to have tea with the girls.
Would you care to join me?
I'd love to.
Good.
And for heaven's sakes, call me Joy.
Okay, Joy.
These...
Are the girls.
Susie, Sarah,
Stacy, Sinclair, and Sabrina.
Susie, where are your manners?
Shake hands with this nice young man.
Mm...
Just kidding, I know they're dolls.
Oh.
They're named after my daughters.
I started the company because of them, really.
You know, dolls didn't used to be these cheap, plastic bimbos from China that we have today.
Your mother made them for you by hand.
I wanted my girls to have that same experience.
And here we are, 30 years later.
Every parent's worst nightmare.
What do you mean?
These little angels, they sell for $90 a pop.
I wasn't born with a butler, you know.
I gotta say, this is amazing, taking on a project like a licensing deal.
Why is that amazing?
Well, my grandmother could never pull this off.
She's been retired for ten years.
How is that treating her?
She lives near my apartment.
I get to see her once a week, so...
- That's very sweet of you.
- No.
No, it's not.
You know, whenever I needed her, she was there.
You know, no matter what.
She'd give me a hug, she'd tell me everything is gonna be all right.
And...
Even if it wasn't.
And now that she needs me, I am always at work.
And I'm--
I'm so sorry.
Yeah?
Never answer your phone in front of a client.
- But it's you.
- What's happening?
Well, actually we're in the middle of a tea party.
I knew you were the doll-playing type.
Put Joy on.
Ms. McAfee, it's Harvey.
Oh.
Joy, I'm sorry,
I have to reschedule.
No need to apologize.
I like this one.
I'll send him back after tea.
Tell me you didn't ask our client for a doggy bag.
What can I say?
Stacy insisted.
Just got off with Joy McAfee's general counsel.
It seems she had an epiphany.
She wants less on her plate, not more.
I thought you were going to close her.
We need that doll money.
I'm on top of it.
Harvey took five months to structure that deal.
Please don't make me set fire to your desk.
I--
All you had to do was have tea with the dolls.
Donna, schedule another tea party with Joy as soon as possible.
And text me the names of her girls.
Oh, what a shock.
You can't keep girls' names straight in your head.
Just yours, Debbie.
See, that's funny because your name is Donna.
Harvey Specter.
I got your order right here.
I didn't order a pizza.
You've been served.
Cab driver who hit Ray named me as a witness in a civil suit.
I need to pay Travis Bickle a visit.
Harvey, if you let me go talk to Joy,
I know I can fix this--
- No.
You don't send a puppy to clean up its own mess.
Optimally, you don't even have a puppy.
Ross, rumor has it you talked a client out of $200 million.
The deal's not off the table, all right?
It's just a speed bump.
Dude, I think we just found him a new nickname.
Speed Bump!
I feel like I'm back in high school.
They called you Speed Bump in high school?
Kidding.
But if you need any boxes to pack up your office, just--
Ow.
Hmm, wait a minute, uh--
There.
I think that belongs to you.
It wouldn't hurt so much if you had thicker skin.
What do you want?
I wanna pay you back for posting bail.
Trevor, you've owed me 40 bucks since fifth grade.
I wrote it off, okay?
Look, I want a clean slate, okay?
So you don't want to see me, I'll mail you a check.
Okay.
Yeah, let's hang out tomorrow night.
Nothing crazy, though, all right?
I have to be up early.
We can crochet panty hose if that's what it takes to be cool.
I think we can do a little better than that.
Why don't we, uh...
Why don't we say Rex's, 7:30.
First six rounds are on me.
If you're serious about paying me back, the first 100 rounds are on you.
All right.
So it's the tough guy.
This is a matter for insurance, not a frivolous lawsuit.
You know, for your information,
I suffered emotional pain.
Emotional pain?
Rub this on your emotional pain.
You condescending son of a--
Look at me, I am gonna warn you once.
Do not pursue this matter.
You know, I have been held up at gunpoint three times.
So do you think a fancy suit and a $500 haircut, that's gonna scare me?
You take my driver to court, I'm gonna represent him myself.
And when you lose, you'll be covering my fee, which is gonna be a hell of a lot of haircuts.
Hmm, so you weren't a one-way fare.
Ray's worked for me eight years.
Then you don't have to worry about being a witness, because as his employer, you're liable for his actions.
You know, I think you've seen way too many reruns of Ally McBeal.
Hmm.
You know, I emigrated here after September 11th, and they shut the doors on everybody.
I couldn't pay for a lawyer, so I had to take them to court.
I sued for my citizenship, so I have a very special appreciation for the law.
I appreciate a good single malt.
I don't pretend I can make one.
I wiped the floor with the U.S. government, counselor.
I'm gonna do the same with you.
- Ray.
- Donna.
What are you doin' here?
I don't have you scheduled.
Uh, I need to see Harvey.
Oh, come on.
You know the rules.
No one sets foot in there without a warrant, a papal edict, or my say-so.
I just got named in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit.
The accident wasn't my fault.
Can I get in to see Harvey, please?
Okay, say no more.
I will get you in.
You are so beautiful when you're forceful.
I know you meant that as a compliment, but I don't appreciate limitations being placed on my beauty.
Harvey, I'm already losing money with my car in the shop.
A trial means I can't work.
And how do you think my name is gonna play in front of a New York jury?
Rahim Benghazi.
I may as well buy a one-way ticket to Guantanamo.
- Not gonna happen.
- If I lose,
I won't even be able to afford a livery license, let alone my insurance.
That's why I'm gonna be defending both of us.
Ray, this goes against every fiber of my being.
I'm taking your case pro bono.
I don't know what to say.
Absolutely nothing, I've got a reputation to maintain.
Besides, it's not gonna take long, okay?
I'm gonna get it dismissed.
Donna, call the court.
We need priority status on the docket.
Yeah, I already tried.
You drew Judge Palermo.
You know what you have to do, don't you?
Yeah.
The other thing that goes against every fiber of my being.
Louis, has anyone told you you're an exquisite soprano?
What do you want, Harvey?
You're right.
Why prolong my suffering?
I need you to get me in to see Judge Palermo.
You need my help, and you're not gonna pull rank on me?
Your case has nothing to do with firm business, does it?
What's it gonna take?
A mani-pedi?
Tickets to Celine?
I'll see what I can do.
And your pound of flesh?
I need my back scratched, I'll let you know.
Louis, unless that's a metaphor, the deal's off.
Huh.
Joy, when I told you that my grandmother didn't have much time,
I--I didn't realize that she's 15 years older than you.
Now, how would you know how old I am?
That is a very closely guarded secret.
I did some research.
Very resourceful.
I did it to assure myself that you can handle a heavier workload.
I appreciate that, but I'm not worried about my health.
Is it the money?
Because I can guarantee, 200 million up front is just 1/10 of what you stand to make on this deal.
Michael, my dolls eat better than most people.
I've got plenty of money.
This deal meant staying on for five more years and doubling my workload.
I am going to take my grandchildren on a cruise to Tahiti.
Tahiti?
You know, the licensing agreement includes a theme park.
You could-- you could take them there.
It's not about the deal.
I have had this same view for 25 years.
I need a change of scenery.
I am gonna speak to Harvey, and I'm gonna tell him that I want to sell the whole business.
So...
I just spoke to Judge Palermo.
And because he thinks I'm a good guy, and I told him I'd owe him one, your case is gonna be moved up way ahead.
Back scratch.
I don't have a firstborn, you know, so what exactly do you want for that?
No, you're not getting one of my ties.
No.
Your shoulder?
What-- your lapel--
Donna?
Oh, God.
Norma is going to Istanbul for two weeks, and you know that I'm not good with temps.
Oh, my God.
Ask me for something else.
Harvey, this is non-negotiable.
You owe me now.
Donna is one thing that I can't give you.
- Why not?
- For one thing, she'd never agree to it.
You're her boss.
You just tell her to do stuff.
I don't tell her to do anything.
She just does.
All right, fine.
You know what?
That's just...
Not a problem.
I will call Judge Palermo, and I'll tell him
I was mistaken, and then your hearing will be in,
I don't know, maybe six months?
I tell you what.
If you can convince her yourself, you have my blessing.
She's gonna love me so much, you're gonna fight to get her back.
Hi, Donna.
Harvey and I were just, uh, talking about you.
And--
- No.
You don't even know what I was gonna say.
Yes, I do.
And how is that possible?
I read lips, I know body language, and I talk to Norma.
I'm not some token you win at a fair, Louis.
You're not--I know you're not.
You're not a token.
I'm a human being, and I--
Yes, you are.
I'm sorry, I just-- you know what, that just made me feel really...
Cheap.
I--
No, I'm just trying to tell you that you're really good at what you do, Donna.
So I'm gonna ask you--
It's like my soul hurts now.
No, Donna, listen, even if your soul hurts a little bit--
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It's gonna be fine.
Don't cry.
Please don't cry, Donna.
Oh, sh--.
I think I owe you one for that.
That was fun.
Wait a second, the-- the time that you cried, and then I let your parents stay in my condo--
Yup.
So you don't want to talk about it?
What is there to talk about?
I did exactly what my boss told me not to do, and it blew up in my face.
Dude, I told you, I'm taking care of this.
In my last few hours of employment, please, I should pay.
All right, put the wallet away.
Oh.
Wait--give--dude, this is epic.
This is the scam we always talked about.
God, I bet you're gettin' laid left and right.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You lose appreciation after a while.
Come on.
Yeah, why'd you put a phone number on there?
It's a real firm.
Oh, yeah?
Huh.
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm just calling the employee directory.
It's part of the scam, man.
- They'll check your story.
- Stop it.
- What?
- Trevor, stop.
Hang up the phone.
Oh, no.
Trevor, hang up the phone, stop!
- What?
- All right?
I'm working there.
Oh, yeah.
What, as a lawyer?
Are you-- dude.
It's a long story, okay?
But you can't tell anyone.
Ever.
Okay?
That is awesome!
Man, I-- I always said that if you quit smoking pot, you could do it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah, oh, that's right.
Yeah, you did.
Right before you passed me the bowl.
Oh--
What?
Naw, I just--
I wish you trusted me enough to tell me.
I mean, all I did was set you up on a drug bust.
Oh, God, that was too soon.
I'm sorry.
Hi, ladies.
How are you?
Um, I want to let you know, if you--either of you ever get arrested for anything, you call this guy.
He's the best attorney in the city.
Well, what would we get arrested for?
- Um...
- I don't know.
I don't know.
What are you thinking about doing?
Uh, as your attorney,
I would definitely advise you to do that.
Uh, four more.
Yeah.
I must warn you that representing yourself at trial is not the--
- What's he doing here?
You think you can schedule a meeting without me knowing it?
Oh, no.
I'm privy to all communication between you and the court.
Well, if your driving matched your legal knowledge, we wouldn't be here.
Your Honor.
This case should be dismissed.
It's a matter for insurance.
Insurance only covers repairs.
It does not deal with my losses.
What losses?
Because of the accident, I missed my chance to get my taxi medallion.
You can't just buy it next year?
The loan I got expires in one week.
On top of that, a medallion costs 300,000 this go-round.
Next year, 350.
So his entire claim rests upon the assumption that he would've won this year's medallion.
The hallmark of America is that the little guy gets to see justice done.
We are all equals in the eyes of the law.
That is why, out of all the countries in the world,
I chose to come here.
What do you got to say about that, counselor?
I say Atticus Finch makes a good speech here, but this is a fender-bender, not a multimillion-dollar lawsuit.
Vicarious liability applies to discrimination, harassment, and accidents.
Employers are responsible for their employees' negligence.
Court finds a reasonable suit here.
Trial starts tomorrow.
Thank you, Your Honor.
You're getting a good kick out of this, aren't you?
I am.
But I'm taking this on its merits.
And you better bring your "A" game tomorrow, 'cause he's got a legitimate claim.
He wants a trial?
I'll give him a goddamn trial.
Your Honor.
So how many cases have you won?
I only remember how many I've lost.
None.
Wait, what happened to the drinks?
I got a better idea.
Let's say we get a bottle and take the party back to your place?
Make it a bottle of Dom, and you're on.
All right, how about four bottles?
Come on.
You guys want to get a cab?
Definitely.
Definitely.
Cab, four bottles of Dom.
You want to spend any more of my money?
Just relax, okay?
It's an investment in the evening.
And, uh, I just said the thing about the bottles to get the girls out of the bar.
Really?
'Cause it looked like you were trying to get away from those guys.
Taxi!
- What guys?
- The guys in the back.
You know what I'm talking about.
Come on, who are they?
What?
Those two?
I--I--I don't know.
Where are all the...
Cabs?
Well, it looked like they knew you, and not in a very good way.
I--I don't know.
Maybe they were, uh, flirting with our dates, okay?
I'd be pissed too if I watched those legs walk away from me.
How are we doin', ladies?
My feet are killing me in these heels.
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, Trevor, come on--
- Taxi!
- Seriously, stop playing with me.
What was that about back there?
Look, I'm not playing with you, all right?
But just play your cards right, maybe you and, uh, maybe Marcella will, uh, maybe she'll play with you.
Okay.
Now, it's gonna be a tight squeeze.
Who wants to sit on my lap?
Want to go after him?
No, we're gonna get to him through this guy.
Ah-ha!
Just like the good old days, huh?
Are you kidding me?
This is way better than the good old days.
I--I'm actually missing a shoe.
Hey, where are we?
Uh, I think we're in Hoboken.
You wanted to see me?
Did you go see Joy after I told you not to?
How did you know?
I didn't.
Until now.
I told you, a puppy can't clean up its own mess.
Mess?
All I did was tell her about my grandmother.
Your job is to make my life easier.
If you can't understand that, why did I hire you?
Police report summarized.
Traffic signal analysis.
Medallion bids, attendees, and results.
That's why you hired me.
I thought you were all over the Joy situation.
Instead, you're all over page six.
You wanted me to do pro bono work, this is it.
Pro bono enhances a firm's image.
This makes us look like wealthy bullies against an everyman cabbie.
Does that seem like it enhances our image to you?
I refuse to answer that, on the grounds that I don't want to.
Someone had a fun night.
Answer another call you shouldn't have?
I--I-- I didn't--I was--
Piece of advice-- when the big dog asks the puppy something like that, it's a rhetorical question.
Got it.
Before you go, the phone call, the other day, when you answered it during the meeting...
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
Won't happen again.
Who was it?
Um, it's just a friend.
You know, an emergency.
What kind of emergency?
- Um--
- Was it a friend who almost got you busted for drug trafficking?
That friend?
Trevor?
He's not dealing anymore, Harvey.
So it was him.
He called you from jail?
You know, I make a living learning how to read people, Mike.
So if I saw it, Jessica did too.
Is that the kind of impression you want to leave around here?
This guy is not your friend.
He is an anchor dragging you down.
Get rid of him.
He is my oldest friend, Harvey.
I wasn't just gonna let him rot in jail.
What's gonna happen the next time?
'Cause there will be a next time.
You gonna bail him out?
Put yourself in jeopardy?
You know, if it weren't for Trevor, you and I never would've met.
Cut him loose.
We're here to see Mike Ross.
He's an associate.
His friend Trevor referred us.
Thank you.
Hey.
It looked like they knew you, and not in a very good way.
Hey!
Hey!
Excuse me, officer.
Is-- is Central Park that way?
Yeah, just go right there.
Uh, I'm sorry, I'm--I'm-- I'm really terrible with direction.
Is it this street, right here?
- Yeah, this street, yes.
- This street.
Right here?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Trevor, it's Mike.
Call me back.
I need to know what the hell's going on.
Did you get the red velvet cupcakes?
Yes, three dozen, extra icing.
How the hell did that happen?
Okay.
You know what?
There.
Problem solved.
I asked you, how'd you get that tear?
A couple of guys came to the firm.
They were looking for me.
I don't know what they wanted, but I'm...
I'm pretty sure it something to do with some shit Trevor did.
And that big brain of yours doesn't remember me saying to cut ties with that loser?
You know what?
You've been blowing off Joy's deal all week for your friend, okay?
So please.
First of all, Trevor's not your friend.
You want to know why I'm loyal to Ray?
I was taking a limo, and I left $3,000 in it.
Ray happened to be the driver.
He found it and tracked me down.
Not a nickel of it was missing, and his first reaction when this accident occurred was to ask if we were okay.
Now, what would Trevor's have been?
Cut him off.
Now, as far as the licensing deal goes, just because you think I'm blowing something off doesn't mean I am.
Now, watch and learn.
Everything's set for you to walk away.
We're selling your stake as a block.
Your, uh, headhunter's lining up your replacement as we speak.
Well, Harvey, this was the most wonderful surprise.
You're a long-time client who wants to be with her family.
It's the least I could do.
And you'll have all the free time in the world to spend with them.
Joey broke the lamp.
Oh, that's great.
Now, how soon can we send 'em home?
They're booked on the first flight out, tomorrow morning.
So when you had Donna text you the girls' names--
I was talking about her daughters.
And you were gonna fly them out all along.
Do you remember when I said,
"You don't send a puppy to clean up its own mess?"
Yes, Harvey, I do.
I'm not a puppy.
Court will come to order.
Mr. Santana, your opening statement, please.
Driving a cab is not very glamorous.
But it's an honest day's work.
Ever since I started, I looked forward to a time when I could tell customers that they were riding in my cab.
That I was an owner-operator.
So I scrimped, and I saved, until I finally had enough put away to buy a medallion.
But...
Because of the actions of this man,
I've lost that opportunity.
So make no mistake, this-- this trial is not about a busted headlight.
This is a trial about a broken dream.
Forget the case, they're gonna make him president.
Statements are like free throws--easy.
Nobody's playing defense.
Are we good at defense?
You would agree that chauffeur drivers cause more accidents--
Objection.
Badgering.
Sustained.
Objection.
Argumentative.
Leading the witness.
Ambiguous.
Privileged.
Inflammatory.
Sustained.
Anything further, Mr. Santana?
Yes, Your Honor, I would like to call to the stand Mr. Michael Ross, please.
Uh--
What time had you called for the limo on the morning of the accident?
Uh, we were supposed to leave at 8:30.
And what time did you get to work?
Objection.
Irrelevant.
It's highly relevant, Your Honor.
It speaks to the psychology of the driver,
Rahim Benghazi.
Overruled.
Answer Mr. Santana's question.
8:40.
So unless Mr. Benghazi made up for that lost time, you were going to be late for that meeting, correct?
Yes.
No further questions, Your Honor.
When the accident occurred, you were on your way to the medallion auction.
When and where was this auction to take place?
9:00 a.m., City Hall.
According to the police report, the accident occurred at 8:53 a.m.
That means you only had seven minutes to get downtown in rush hour traffic.
Objection, irrelevant.
I believe when I made the same objection, you told his honor it was highly relevant.
Overruled.
You were running late, only the stakes for you were much higher, weren't they?
These things never start on time.
Then why was the first medallion sold at 9:03 a.m.?
You were scared your chance at a medallion was going up in smoke, and you ran a red.
Then you used the accident to paint me and Ray Benghazi as a couple of scapegoats.
You can't prove that.
What color was the light?
I take the fifth.
You can't take the fifth, Mr. Santana.
This isn't a criminal case.
What color was the light?
He cut me off.
You claim to love our legal system so much, answer the question.
What color was the light?
What color was the light?
Your Honor?
Answer the question, Mr. Santana.
It just meant so much to me.
Your Honor, can I sidebar with opposing counsel?
We can roll the dice with the jury, but I'd rather settle.
Well, how much would I have to pay?
Nothing.
You take responsibility for the accident, and your insurance company makes Ray whole.
In return,
I waive my right to collect legal fees.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
I've got a reputation to maintain.
That goes for you too, judge.
Damn it, Trevor.
I left you like five messages.
Good to know your boy's flaky with everyone.
I was taking it personal.
What do you want?
Well, Trevor owes us $50,000 he's never paid, so you're gonna bail him out.
Listen,
I don't have that kind of money, okay?
I can't.
Well, if you're not down here in an hour with it, we're gonna take it out on Trevor.
Tell him where the money is.
Whatever you do, don't show up.
Trevor!
You have one hour.
Hello?
Hello?
What do you think you're doing, leaving in the middle of a trial?
I got some things to take care of.
You mean someone to take care of.
You never cut Trevor off, did you?
No, I didn't.
My friend's in trouble, and I'm gonna help him.
You know what?
This is what addicts do.
The second they start making progress, they screw up, because deep down they think it's only a matter of time until they fail.
They'd rather fall from the third floor than the penthouse.
Nothing you say can stop me.
Then tell me what the hell's going on.
He's clean.
No wires.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
You remember what happened with the guy.
He was 300 pounds.
Now, who'd you say you were again?
Trevor's lawyer.
Trevor didn't mention a lawyer.
He doesn't know he hired me.
Come on.
Open the briefcase.
Where's the goddamn money?
That photo is a screen shot, taken from my firm's security video.
We know what you look like.
And if Mike Ross doesn't hear from me in the next five minutes, he's calling the police.
No, man.
You're not comin' in here and threatening' us.
You're looking at kidnapping, extortion, and drug-dealing, and the district attorney happens to be number three on my speed dial.
Well, if we're looking at all that time, you might as well add murder.
I got a better idea.
Retainer agreement.
If you sign right here, you'll become one of my clients.
And I won't be able to testify against you, even if I wanted to.
What about the money?
This envelope contains $10,000.
Consider it a down payment on Trevor's debt.
Only here's the thing,
I don't do pro bono work.
And my retainer agreement requires a down payment of $10,000.
Now, as your attorney, my job is to give you advice.
So here's the deal.
Sign the agreement.
I thought I said not to come.
Remember that 40 bucks from the fifth grade you owe me?
If you were dead, how would I collect?
Oh, man.
I'm sorry, I just...
Put you in trouble just by hanging out with you.
So why'd you do it?
'Cause I'm a dick.
Bet you didn't think you'd have to save my ass so soon after bailing me out.
I wasn't the one who saved you.
Yeah.
Well, as a friend, the guy puts me to shame.
Harvey's not my friend, trust me.
Well, he didn't put his ass on the line because of me.
Listen, I pled you down to a misdemeanor--
- Ugh.
- Drunk and disorderly.
And I paid the fine.
I think it might be a good idea if you got out of town for a while.
Montana.
Well, you said you wanted a clean slate.
I figured 20 hours on a bus ought to do the trick.
Oh, yeah, it'll do me good.
Wait.
When I get back, you know who the first person I'm gonna call is.
Yeah.
The one person you know who'll answer.
For you.
What's this?
I'm very happy you took Ray on pro bono.
You, on the other hand, can afford our services.
You want me to pay me to represent me?
Mm-hmm.
Ten hours at $1,000 an hour.
Eh, yeah, I'll let you do the math.
You can't be serious.
I'll tell you what I am serious about.
I hear you're finally mentoring the kid.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Really, because I understand that you dropped the puppy analogy on him, which is exactly what I used on you.
May have slipped out by accident.
Well, accident, on purpose, the really important thing is, is that I'm taller than you.
Yeah.
Yup, you look much thinner in that.
You planted that story, be man enough to own it.
I don't traffic in the tabloids, Harvey.
But I can see how whoever planted this might find it amusing.
You know, the great Harvey Specter bullying a humble cab driver.
I mean, it's a no-win situation, really.
Well, maybe you didn't hear.
I won the no-win situation.
Did it ever occur to you that if you hadn't done that to me,
I actually would have owed you one?
Maybe if you didn't humiliate me in front of the associates--
Louis, for an average attorney, 100 million is a career case.
If I'm mocking you, it means I think you're above average.
But stress balls?
You're making it too easy.
You put Trevor on the bus to the boondocks?
Yeah.
Can I ask you a question?
After all this, you really think I'm still buying the Mr. I-don't-give-a-crap thing?
Joy sent a little token of her appreciation.
She got your hair just right.
Did she ever make one of these for you?
Not that you'll ever see.

Louis won the class action suit?
Ten thousand men of Harvard
Want vict'ry today,
ALL:
For they know that o'er old Eli
Fair Harvard holds sway
So then we'll conquer all old Eli's men
(UNCERTAINLY) My favorite part.
You don't know the lyrics, do you?
HARVEY:
I don't even know the lyrics, Louis.
Now, are we practicing law down here or auditioning a chorus line?
It's called esprit de corps.
And I just got a $100 million jury award overturned.
I don't have to overturn awards like that because I've never lost one in the first place.
So, what is this?
A new cologne?
Or just a hint ofjealousy?
I'm surprised you, uh, don't recognize your wife's perfume.
I know.
You're not married.
It's still funny.
You do realize we're celebrating making fat people even fatter, right?
If you wanted to do good, you should have been a fake doctor.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Business cards.
Yep.
My mistake is now official.
Come with me.
And learn the goddamn lyrics to the Harvard song, will you?
Oakhurst Capital has agreed to a $200 million licensing deal.
We are at the goal line.
How are we on brand protection?
The contract is airtight.
The only issue here is to get the Joyful Toy Company to close.
I'll go over it with Joy one-on-one.
(PHONE RINGING)
Protocol in a meeting is to put your phone on silent.
Oh.
Uh...
If it does ring, you answer it.
Not in here.
Don't feel the need to rush back when you're done.
Who is this?
Dude, it's Trevor.
Don't hang up.
Look, I only get one call.
I'm in jail.
I tried to hop this bus at Port Authority.
I was drunk.
It's all messed up.
Look, I know we haven't talked since we fought.
But I didn't know who else to call.
(DOOR BUZZES)
I'm sorry, man.
(SIGHS) I'm sorry.
Okay.
TREVOR:
I'm going to pay you back.
MIKE:
Good.
Your ball cost me everything I had in the bank.
The thing is, I don't have the money.
What are you talking about?
You were clearing $10,000 a month selling weed.
It went out as fast as it came in.
Came in?
I quit.
I'm not dealing anymore.
Bullshit.
I'm serious.
After we fought, things just started to fall apart.
Jenny broke up with me.
I didn't know.
Well, I just realized I needed to make a change.
I even sold my bong.
What have you done with my friend?
You should talk.
Look at you.
You look like Gordon Gekko's little brother.
Okay.
Are you working on Wall Street, man?
Why did you call me, Trevor?
You're the one person I knew would show up.
You want to ask me for anything?
Else?
Look.
All I care about right now is keeping my record clean.
(SIGHS)
You don't happen to know any good lawyers, do you?
No.
I don't.
See the money, wanna stay for your meal
Get another piece of pie for your wife
Everybody wanna know how it feel
Everybody wanna see what it's like
I'll even eat a bean pie I don't mind
Me and missy is so early
Busy, busy making money
All right!
All step back I'm 'bout to dance
The greenback boogie
Why the rush now?
You've already wasted ten minutes of my life.
Please tell me you didn't wait ten minutes just to scold me.
I've been waiting for you to bring the paperwork down so I can close a nine-figure licensing deal.
If your phone rings while I'm talking to Ray,
I'm throwing it out of the car while it's attached to your hand.
Eddie Hope and the Mannish Boys.
1959.
Three guesses.
Guesses?
Won't be a fool no more
You insult me, Harvey.
Don't worry, we won't be late.
Okay.
What was the name of the record label?
Marlin Records.
Who covered it in the late '60s?
Ah, I want to say The Stones, but...
You need some guesses?
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(CAR CRASHING) RAY:
Oh!
Oh, my God.
CAB DRIVER:
Just like a private car service, huh?
Thinking you don't have to yield?
What?
Yield?
You ran a red light.
That light was yellow.
No, sir, it was not.
Are you calling me a liar?
Back off.
Mind your business, okay?
Oh, I'm minding my business.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Anyone throws a punch, I'm going to introduce you to Mr. Taser.
Trade insurance.
I'll take reports one at a time.
As much as I'd like to help you out,
I'm late for a meeting.
Oh, no.
You're not going anywhere.
I need a statement from you, too.
Here is my information.
I need you to babysit the client until I get there.
Don't mention the deal.
She asks any questions, just nod your head and look pretty.
(WHISTLES)
(CLEARS THROAT)
Ms. McAfee.
I'm Mike Ross.
I work with Harvey.
Oh.
You're the protégé that he's been gushing about.
He was gushing?
Well, he mentioned that you existed.
For Harvey, that's gushing.
Uh, he's running a few minutes late today.
Car trouble.
I was just about to have tea with the girls.
Would you care to join me?
I'd love to.
Good.
And for heaven's sakes, call me Joy.
Okay, Joy.
JOY:
These are the girls.
Susie, Sarah, Stacy, Sinclair, and Sabrina.
Susie, where are your manners?
Shake hands with this nice young man.
(CLEARS THROAT)
(CHUCKLES) Just kidding.
I know they're dolls.
Oh.
They're named after my daughters.
I started the company because of them, really.
You know, dolls didn't used to be these cheap, plastic bimbos from China that we have today.
Your mother made them for you by hand.
I wanted my girls to have that same experience.
And here we are, thirty years later.
Every parent's worst nightmare.
What do you mean?
These little angels, they sell for $90 a pop.
I wasn't born with a butler, you know.
I've got to say, this is amazing.
Taking on a project like a licensing deal.
Why is that amazing?
Well, my grandmother could never pull this off.
She's been retired for ten years.
How is that treating her?
She lives near my apartment.
I get to see her once a week.
So...
That's very sweet of you.
No.
No, it's not.
You know, whenever I needed her, she was there.
No matter what.
She'd give me a hug.
She'd tell me everything was going to be alright.
Even if it wasn't.
And now that she needs me,
I am always at work.
And I'm... (PHONE RINGING)
I'm so sorry.
Yeah.
Never answer your phone in front of a client.
But it's you.
What's happening?
Well, actually, we're in the middle of a tea party.
I knew you were the doll-playing type.
Put Joy on.
Ms. McAfee.
It's Harvey.
Oh.
Oh.
Joy, I'm sorry.
I have to reschedule.
No need to apologize.
I like this one.
I'll send him back after tea.
Tell me you didn't ask our client for a doggie bag.
What can I say?
Stacy insisted.
I just got off with Joy McAfee's general counsel.
It seems she had an epiphany.
She wants less on her plate, not more.
I thought you were going to close her.
We need that doll money.
I'm on top of it.
Harvey, it took five months to structure that deal.
Please don't make me set fire to your desk.
I...
All you had to do was have tea with the dolls.
Donna, schedule another tea party with Joy as soon as possible.
And text me the names of her girls.
Oh, what a shock.
You can't keep girls' names straight in your head.
Just yours, Debbie.
See, that's funny because your name is Donna.
Harvey Specter.
I got your order right here.
I didn't order a pizza.
You've been served.
The cab driver who hit Ray named me as a witness in a civil suit.
I need to pay Travis Bickle a visit.
Harvey, if you let me go talk to Joy,
I know I can fix this.
No.
You don't send a puppy to clean up its own mess.
Optimally, you don't even have a puppy.
Ross.
Rumor has it you talked a client out of $200 million.
The deal's not off the table, all right?
It's just a speed bump.
Dude, I think we just found him a new nickname.
Speed Bump.
(ASSOCIATES LAUGHING)
I feel like I'm back in high school.
They called you Speed Bump in high school?
Kidding.
But if you need any boxes to pack up your office...
Ah.
Wait a minute.
(GROANS)
There.
I think that belongs to you.
It wouldn't hurt so much if you had thicker skin.
(PHONE RINGING)
What do you want?
I want to pay you back for posting bail.
Trevor, you've owed me forty bucks since fifth grade.
I wrote it off.
Okay?
Look, I want a clean slate.
Okay?
So, you don't want to see me, I'll mail you a check.
(ALL CHUCKLING)
Okay.
Yeah.
Let's hang out tomorrow night.
Nothing crazy, though, all right?
I have to be up early.
We can crochet pantyhose if that's what it takes to be cool.
I think we can do a little better than that.
Why don't we, uh...
Why don't we say Rex's, 7:30?
First six rounds are on me.
If you're serious about paying me back, the first hundred rounds are on you.
Oh, it's the tough guy.
This is a matter for insurance.
Not a frivolous lawsuit.
You know, for your information, I suffered emotional pain.
Emotional pain?
Rub this on your emotional pain.
You condescending son of a...
Look at me.
I am going to warn you once.
Do not pursue this matter.
You know, I have been held up at gunpoint three times.
So, do you think a fancy suit and a $500 haircut, that's going to scare me?
You take my driver to court,
I'm going to represent him myself.
And when you lose, you'll be covering my fee.
Which is going to be a hell of a lot of haircuts.
Mmm.
So you weren't a one-way fare.
Ray's worked for me eight years.
Then you don't have to worry about being a witness.
Because as his employer, you're liable for his actions.
You know, I think you've seen way too many reruns of Ally McBeal.
You know, I immigrated here after September 11.
And they shut the doors on everybody.
I couldn't pay for a lawyer, so I had to take them to court.
I sued for my citizenship.
So I have a very special appreciation for the law.
I appreciate a good single malt.
I don't pretend I can make one.
I wiped the floor with the US government, Counselor.
I'm going to do the same with you.
DONNA:
Ray.
Donna.
What are you doing here?
I don't have you scheduled.
Uh, I need to see Harvey.
Oh, come on.
You know the rules.
No one sets foot in there without a warrant, a Papal edict, or my say-so.
I just got named in a multi-million dollar lawsuit.
The accident wasn't my fault.
Can I get in to see Harvey, please?
Okay, say no more.
I will get you in.
You are so beautiful when you're forceful.
I know you meant that as a compliment, but I don't appreciate limitations being placed on my beauty.
Harvey.
I'm already losing money with the car in the shop.
A trial means I can't work.
And how do you think my name is going to play in front of a New York jury?
Rahim Benghazi?
I may as well buy a one-way ticket to Guantanamo.
Not going to happen.
If I lose, I won't even be able to afford a livery license, let alone my insurance.
That's why I'm going to be defending both of us.
Ray, this goes against every fiber of my being.
I'm taking your case.
Pro bono.
I don't know what to say.
Absolutely nothing.
I've got a reputation to maintain.
Besides, it's not going to take long.
Okay?
I'm going to get it dismissed.
Donna, call the court.
We need priority status on the docket.
Yeah.
I already tried.
You drew Judge Palermo.
You know what you have to do, don't you?
Yeah.
The other thing that goes against every fiber of my being.
Louis, has anyone told you you're an exquisite soprano?
What do you want, Harvey?
You're right.
Why prolong my suffering?
I need you to get me in to see Judge Palermo.
You need my help, and you're not going to pull rank on me?
Your case has nothing to do with firm business, does it?
What's it going to take?
A mani-pedi?
Tickets to Celine?
I'll see what I can do.
And your pound of flesh?
I need my back scratched, I'll let you know.
Louis, unless that's a metaphor, the deal's off.
Huh.
Joy, when I told you that my grandmother didn't have much time,
I didn't realize that she's 15 years older than you.
Now how do you know how old I am?
That is a very closely guarded secret.
I did some research.
Very resourceful.
I did it to assure myself that you can handle a heavier workload.
I appreciate that.
But I'm not worried about my health.
Is it the money?
Because I can guarantee $200 million upfront is just a tenth of what you stand to make on this deal.
Michael, my dolls eat better than most people.
I've got plenty of money.
This deal meant staying on for five more years and doubling my workload.
(CLEARS THROAT)
I am going to take my grandchildren on a cruise to Tahiti.
Tahiti?
You know the licensing agreement includes a theme park.
You could take them there.
It's not about the deal.
I have had this same view for 25 years.
I need a change of scenery.
I'm going to speak to Harvey and I'm going to tell him that I want to sell the whole business.
So I just spoke to Judge Palermo.
And because he thinks I'm a good guy and I told him I'd owe him one, your case is going to be moved up.
Way ahead.
Back scratch.
I don't have a first born, you know.
So what exactly do you want for that?
No, you're not getting one of my ties.
No.
Your shoulder?
What...
Your lapel...
Donna?
(LAUGHS) God.
Norma is going to Istanbul for two weeks.
And you know that I'm not good with temps.
My God.
Ask me for something else.
Harvey, this is non-negotiable.
You owe me now.
Donna is one thing that I can't give you.
Why not?
For one thing, she'd never agree to it.
You're her boss.
You just tell her to do stuff.
I don't tell her to do anything.
She just does.
All right, fine.
You know what?
That's just not a problem.
I will call Judge Palermo, and I'll tell him I was mistaken.
And then, your hearing will be in,
I don't know, maybe six months?
I tell you what.
If you can convince her yourself, you have my blessing.
She's going to love me so much, you're going to fight to get her back.
Hi, Donna.
Harvey and I were just talking about you.
No.
You don't even know what I was going to say.
Yes, I do.
And how is that possible?
I read lips.
I know body language.
And I talk to Norma.
I'm not some token you win at a fair, Louis.
You...
I know you're not.
You're not a token.
I'm a human being, and I just...
Yes, you are.
I'm sorry.
I just...
You know what?
That just made me feel really... cheap.
No, I'm just trying to tell you that you're really good at what you do, Donna.
So I'm going to ask you...
It's like my soul hurts now.
No.
Donna, listen.
Even if your soul hurts a little bit...
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It's going to be fine.
Don't cry.
Please don't cry, Donna.
Oh, shit.
I think I owe you one for that.
That was fun.
Wait a second.
The time that you cried and then I let your parents stay at my condo?
Yep.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
So you don't want to talk about it?
What is there to talk about?
I did exactly what my boss told me not to do, and it blew up in my face.
Dude, I told you I'm taking care of this.
For my last few hours of employment, please, I should pay.
Put the wallet away.
Ooh.
Dude, this is epic.
This is the scam we always talked about.
God, I bet you're getting laid left and right.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You lose appreciation after a while.
Come on.
Why did you put a phone number on there?
It's a real firm.
Oh, yeah?
Huh.
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm just calling the employee directory.
It's part of the scam, man.
They'll check your story.
Stop it.
What?
Trevor, stop.
Hang up the phone.
No.
Trevor, hang up the phone.
Stop.
What?
All right?
I'm working there.
Oh, yeah.
What, as a lawyer?
(WHISPERS) Are you...
Dude.
It's a long story.
Okay?
But you can't tell anyone.
Ever.
Okay?
That is awesome.
Man, I always said that if you quit smoking pot, you could do it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, that's right.
Yeah, you did.
Right before you passed me the bowl.
What?
No, I just...
I wish you trusted me enough to tell me.
I mean, all I did was set you up on a drug bust.
Oh, God.
That was too soon.
(GROANS) I'm sorry.
Hi, ladies.
How are you?
Um, I want to let you know, if you, either of you, ever get arrested for anything, you call this guy.
He's the best attorney in the city.
What would we get arrested for?
Um...
I don't know.
What are you thinking about doing?
Uh, as your attorney,
I would definitely advise you to do that.
(GIRLS GIGGLE)
Uh, four more.
TREVOR:
Yeah.
JUDGE:
I must warn you that representing yourself at trial is not the...
What's he doing here?
You think you can schedule a meeting without me knowing it?
Oh, no.
I'm privy to all communication between you and the court.
Well, if your driving matched your legal knowledge, we wouldn't be here.
Your Honor.
This case should be dismissed.
It's a matter for insurance.
Insurance only covers repairs.
It does not deal with my losses.
What losses?
Because of that accident, I missed my chance to get my Taxi Medallion.
Can't you just buy it next year?
The loan I got expires in one week.
On top of that, a Medallion costs $300,000 this go round.
Next year, $350,000.
So his entire claim rests upon the assumption that he would have won this year's Medallion.
The hallmark of America is that the little guy gets to see justice done.
We are all equals in the eyes of the law.
That is why, out of all the countries in the world,
I chose to come here.
What do you have to say about that, Counselor?
I say Atticus Finch makes a good speech here.
But this is a fender bender, not a multi-million dollar law suit.
Vicarious liability applies to discrimination, harassment, and accidents.
Employers are responsible for their employees' negligence.
The court finds a reasonable suit here.
Trial starts tomorrow.
Thank you, Your Honor.
You're getting a good kick out of this, aren't you?
I am.
But I'm taking this on its merits.
And you better bring your A game tomorrow, because he's got a legitimate claim.
He wants a trial, I'll give him a goddamn trial.
Your Honor.
So, how many cases have you won?
I only remember how many I've lost.
None.
Well, what happened to the drinks?
I got a better idea.
Let's say we get a bottle and take the party back to your place.
Make it a bottle of Dom, and you're on.
All right.
How about four bottles?
Come on.
MARCELLA:
You guys want to get a cab?
Definitely.
Definitely.
Cab, four bottles of Dom...
You want to spend any more of my money?
Just relax.
Okay?
It's an investment in the evening.
And, uh, I just said the thing about the bottles to get the girls out of the bar.
Really?
Because it looked like you were trying to get away from those guys.
TREVOR:
Taxi!
What guys?
The guys in the back.
You know what I'm talking about.
Come on.
Who are they?
Look.
Those two?
I...
I...
I don't know.
Where are all the cabs?
Well, it looked like they knew you.
And not in a very good way.
I...
I don't know.
Maybe they were, uh, flirting with our dates.
Okay?
I'd be pissed, too, if I watched those legs walk away from me.
How we doing, ladies?
My feet are killing me in these heels.
TREVOR:
I'm sorry.
MIKE:
Hey.
Trevor.
Come on.
Seriously.
Taxi!
Stop playing with me.
What was that about back there?
Look, I'm not playing with you.
All right?
But just, if you play your cards right, maybe you and, uh...
Maybe Marcella will...
Maybe she'll play with you.
Okay.
TREVOR:
Now, it's going to be a tight squeeze.
Who wants to sit on my lap?
MIGUEL:
We don't go after him?
No, we're going to get to him through this guy.
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
A-ha, just like the good old days, huh?
Are you kidding me?
This is way better than the good old days.
I'm actually missing a shoe.
Hey, where are we?
Uh, I think we're in Hoboken.
You wanted to see me?
Did you go to see Joy after I told you not to?
How did you know?
I didn't.
Until now.
I told you.
A puppy can't clean up its own mess.
Mess?
All I did was tell her about my grandmother.
Your job is to make my life easier.
If you can't understand that, why did I hire you?
Police report summarized.
Traffic signal analysis.
Medallion bids, attendees, and results.
That's why you hired me.
I thought you were all over the Joy situation.
Instead, you're all over page six.
You wanted me to do pro bono work.
This is it.
Pro bono enhances a firm's image.
This makes us look like wealthy bullies against an everyman cabby.
Does that seem like it enhances our image to you?
I refuse to answer that on the grounds that I don't want to.
Someone had a fun night.
Answer another call you shouldn't have?
I...
I...
I didn't...
I was...
Piece of advice.
When the big dog asks the puppy something like that, it's a rhetorical question.
Got it.
Before you go...
The phone call.
The other day when you answered it during the meeting?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about that.
It won't happen again.
Who was it?
Um, it was just a friend.
You know, an emergency.
What kind of emergency?
Um...
Was it the friend who almost got you busted for drug trafficking?
That friend?
Trevor?
He's not dealing anymore, Harvey.
So, it was him.
He called you from jail?
You know, I make a living learning how to read people, Mike.
So if I saw it, Jessica did, too.
Is that the kind of impression that you want to leave around here?
This guy is not your friend.
He is an anchor dragging you down.
Get rid of him.
He is my oldest friend, Harvey.
I wasn't just going to let him rot in jail.
What's going to happen the next time?
Because there will be a next time.
You going to bail him out?
Put yourself in jeopardy?
You know, if it weren't for Trevor, you and I never would have met.
Cut him loose.
We're here to see Mike Ross.
He's an associate.
His friend, Trevor, referred us.
Thank you.
MIKE:
It looked like they knew you.
And not in a very good way.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
(WHISTLING)
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Hey!
Hey!
Excuse me.
Officer.
Is Central Park that way?
Yeah, just go right there.
I'm sorry.
I'm really terrible with direction.
Is it this street right here?
This street, yes.
Right here.
Yeah.
Okay.
(PHONE BEEPS)
Trevor, it's Mike.
Call me back.
I need to know what the hell is going on.
Did you get the red velvet cupcakes?
Yes.
Three dozen.
Extra icing.
How the hell did that happen?
Okay.
You know what?
There.
Problem solved.
I asked you how'd you get that tear.
A couple of guys came to the firm.
They were looking for me.
I don't know what they wanted, but I'm pretty sure it has something to do with some shit Trevor did.
And that big brain of yours doesn't remember me saying to cut ties with that loser?
You know what?
You've been blowing off Joy's deal all week for your friend, okay?
So, please.
First of all, Trevor is not your friend.
You want to know why I'm loyal to Ray?
I was taking a limo, and I left $3,000 in it.
Ray happened to be the driver.
He found it and tracked me down.
Not a nickel of it was missing.
And his first reaction when this accident occurred was to ask if we were okay.
Now, what would Trevor's have been?
Cut him off.
And as far as the licensing deal goes, just because you think I'm blowing something off, doesn't mean I am.
Now watch and learn.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
Everything's set for you to walk away.
We're selling your stake as a block.
Your headhunter is lining up your replacement as we speak.
(CHILDREN YELLING)
Well, Harvey, this was the most wonderful surprise.
You're a long-time client who wants to be with her family.
It was the least I could do.
And you'll have...
(GLASS SHATTERS) ...all the free time in the world to spend with them.
GIRL:
Joey broke the lamp.
Oh, that's great.
Now, how soon can we send them home?
They're booked on the first flight out tomorrow morning.
So when you had Donna text you the girls' names...
I was talking about her daughters.
And you were going to fly them out all along.
Do you remember when I said you don't send a puppy to clean up its own mess?
Yes, Harvey.
I do.
I'm not a puppy.
JUDGE:
Court will come to order.
Mr. Santana, your opening statement, please.
Driving a cab isn't glamorous.
But it's an honest day's work.
Ever since I started, I've looked forward to a time when I could tell customers that they were riding in my cab.
That I was an owner-operator.
So, I scrimped and I saved until I finally had enough put away to buy a Medallion.
But because of the actions of these men,
I've lost that opportunity.
So make no mistake.
This trial is not about a busted headlight.
This is a trial about a broken dream.
Forget the case.
They're going to make him President.
Statements are like free throws.
Easy.
Nobody's playing defense.
Are we good at defense?
You would agree that chauffeured drivers cause more accidents?
Objection.
Badgering.
Sustained.
Objection.
Argumentative.
Leading the witness.
Ambiguous.
Privileged.
Inflammatory.
Sustained.
JUDGE:
Anything further, Mr. Santana?
Yes, Your Honor.
I would like to call to the stand
Mr. Michael Ross, please.
(CLEARS THROAT)
What time had you called for the limo on the morning of the accident?
We were supposed to leave at 8:30.
And what time did you get to work?
Objection.
Irrelevant.
It's highly relevant, Your Honor.
It speaks to the psychology of the driver, Rahim Benghazi.
Overruled.
Answer Mr. Santana's question.
8:40.
So unless Mr. Benghazi made up for that lost time, you were going to be late for that meeting.
Correct?
Yes.
No further questions, Your Honor.
(CLEARS THROAT)
When the accident occurred, you were on your way to the Medallion auction.
When and where was this auction to take place?
9:00 a.m., City Hall.
According to the police report, the accident occurred at 8:53 a.m.
That means you only had seven minutes to get downtown in rush hour traffic.
Objection.
Irrelevant.
I believe when I made the same objection, you told his Honor it was highly relevant.
Overruled.
You were running late.
Only the stakes for you were much higher, weren't they?
These things never start on time.
Then, why was the first Medallion sold at 9:03 a.m.?
You were scared your chance at a Medallion was going up in smoke, and you ran a red.
Then, you used the accident to paint me and Ray Benghazi as a couple of scapegoats.
You can't prove that.
What color was the light?
I take the Fifth.
You can't take the Fifth, Mr. Santana.
This isn't a criminal case.
What color was the light?
He cut me off.
You claim to love our legal system so much, answer the question.
What color was the light?
What color was the light?
Your Honor?
Answer the question, Mr. Santana.
It just meant so much to me.
Your Honor?
Can I sidebar with opposing counsel?
We can roll the dice with the jury, but I'd rather settle.
How much would I have to pay?
Nothing.
You take responsibility for the accident, and your insurance company makes Ray whole.
In return, I waive my right to collect legal fees.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
I've got a reputation to maintain.
That goes for you, too, Judge.
(PHONE RINGING)
Damn it, Trevor.
I left you, like, five messages.
Good to know your boy's flaky with everyone.
I was taking it personal.
What do you want?
Well, Trevor owes us $50,000.
He's never paid, so you're going to bail him out.
Listen, I don't have that kind of money.
Okay?
I can't.
Well, if you're not down here in an hour with it, we're going to take it out on Trevor.
Tell him where the money is.
Whatever you do, don't show up.
(GROANS)
Trevor.
You have one hour.
Hello?
Hello.
HARVEY:
What do you think you're doing, leaving in the middle of a trial?
I've got some things to take care of.
You mean someone to take care of.
You never cut Trevor off, did you?
No, I didn't.
My friend's in trouble, and I'm going to help him.
You know what?
This is what addicts do.
The second they start making progress, they screw up.
Because deep down, they think it's only a matter of time until they fail.
They'd rather fall from the third floor than the penthouse.
Nothing you say can stop me.
Then tell me what the hell is going on.
MIGUEL:
He's clean.
No wires.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Remember what happened with the guy.
He was 300 pounds.
Now who did you say you were again?
Trevor's lawyer.
VICTOR:
Trevor didn't mention a lawyer.
He doesn't know he hired me.
Come on.
Open the briefcase.
Where's the goddamn money?
That photo is a screen-shot taken from my firm's security video.
We know what you look like.
And if Mike Ross doesn't hear from me in the next five minutes, he's calling the police.
(LAUGHS)
No, man.
You're not coming in here and threatening us.
You're looking at kidnapping, extortion, and drug dealing.
And the District Attorney happens to be number three on my speed dial.
Well, if we're looking at all that time, you might as well add murder.
I've got a better idea.
Retainer agreement.
If you sign right here, you'll become one of my clients.
And I won't be able to testify against you even if I wanted to.
What about the money?
This envelope contains $10,000.
Consider it a down payment on Trevor's debt.
Only here's the thing.
I don't do pro bono work.
And my retainer agreement requires a down payment of $10,000.
Now, as your attorney, my job is to give you advice.
So, here's the deal.
Sign the agreement.
I thought I said not to come.
Remember that forty bucks from the fifth grade you owe me?
If you were dead, how would I collect?
Oh, man.
I'm sorry.
I just put you in trouble just by hanging out with you.
So, why did you do it?
Because I'm a dick.
TREVOR:
I bet you didn't think you'd have to save my ass so soon after bailing me out.
I wasn't the one who saved you.
Yeah.
Wow.
As a friend, that guy puts me to shame.
Harvey's not my friend.
Trust me.
Well, he didn't put his ass on the line because of me.
Listen, I pled you down to a misdemeanor, drunk and disorderly, and I paid the fine.
I think it might be a good idea if you got out of town for a while.
Montana.
You said you wanted a clean slate.
I figured 20 hours on a bus ought to do the trick.
Oh, yeah.
It will do me good.
Wait.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
When I get back, you know who the first person I'm going to call is.
Yeah.
The one person you know who'll answer it.
For you.
What's this?
I'm very happy you took Ray on pro bono.
You, on the other hand, can afford our services.
You want me to pay me to represent me?
Mmm-hmm.
Ten hours at a $1,000 an hour.
Yeah, I'll let you do the math.
You can't be serious.
I'll tell you what I am serious about.
I hear you're finally mentoring the kid.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Really?
Because I understand that you dropped the puppy analogy on him.
Which is exactly what I used on you.
It may have slipped out by accident.
On accident, on purpose...
The really important thing is that I'm taller than you.
Yeah.
Yep.
You look much thinner in that.
You planted that story.
Be man enough to own it.
I don't traffic in the tabloids, Harvey.
But I can see how whoever planted this might find it amusing.
The great Harvey Specter bullying a humble cab driver?
I mean, it's a no-win situation, really.
Well, maybe you didn't hear.
I won the no-win situation.
Did it ever occur to you that if you hadn't done that to me,
I actually would have owed you one?
Maybe if you didn't humiliate me in front of the associates.
Louis, for an average attorney, a $100 million is a career case.
If I'm mocking you, it means I think you're above average.
But stress balls?
You're making it too easy.
You put Trevor on the bus to the boondocks?
Yeah.
Can I ask you a question?
After all this, you really think I'm still buying the Mr. I-Don't-Give-a-Crap thing?
Joy sent a little token of her appreciation.
She got your hair just right.
(CHUCKLES)
Did she ever make one of these for you?
Not that you'll ever see.

- And if it does ring, you answer it.
Oh.
Yeah.
Not in here.
I--okay.
Don't feel the need to rush back when you're done.
Who is this?
Dude, it's Trevor.
Don't hang up.
I only get one call.
I'm in jail.
I--I tried to hop this bus at Port Authority.
I was drunk.
It's all messed up.
Look, I know we haven't talked since we fought, but I didn't know who else to call.

Hey.
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.

You look like Gordon Gekko's little brother.

Why'd you call me, Trevor?
You're the one person I knew would show up.
You want to ask me for anything...else?
Look, all I care about right now is keeping my record clean.

You're not going anywhere.
I need a statement from you too.
Here's mine.
I need you to babysit the client till I get there.
And don't mention the deal.
If she asks any questions, just nod your head and look pretty.
[Whistles]
[Clears throat]
Ms. McAfee, I'm Mike Ross.
I work with Harvey.
Oh, you're the protege that he's been gushing about.
He was gushing?
Well, he mentioned that you existed.
For Harvey, that's gushing.
Uh, he's running a few minutes late today.
Um, car trouble.
I was just about to have tea with the girls.
Would you care to join me?
I'd love to.
Good.
And for heaven's sakes, call me Joy.
Okay, Joy.
These...
Are the girls.
Susie, Sarah,
Stacy, Sinclair, and Sabrina.
Susie, where are your manners?
Shake hands with this nice young man.
Mm...
Just kidding, I know they're dolls.
Oh.
[Laughs]
They're named after my daughters.
I started the company because of them, really.
You know, dolls didn't used to be these cheap, plastic bimbos from China that we have today.
Your mother made them for you by hand.
I wanted my girls to have that same experience.
And here we are, 30 years later.
Every parent's worst nightmare.
What do you mean?
These little angels, they sell for $90 a pop.
I wasn't born with a butler, you know.
I gotta say, this is amazing, taking on a project like a licensing deal.
Why is that amazing?
Well, my grandmother could never pull this off.
She's been retired for ten years.
How is that treating her?
She lives near my apartment.
I get to see her once a week, so...
- That's very sweet of you.
- No.
No, it's not.
You know, whenever I needed her, she was there.
You know, no matter what.
She'd give me a hug, she'd tell me everything is gonna be all right.
And...
[Chuckles]
Even if it wasn't.
And now that she needs me, I am always at work.
And I'm-- [Phone rings]
I'm so sorry.
Yeah?
Never answer your phone in front of a client.
- But it's you.
- What's happening?
Well, actually we're in the middle of a tea party.
I knew you were the doll-playing type.
Put Joy on.
Ms. McAfee, it's Harvey.
Oh.
Joy, I'm sorry,
I have to reschedule.
No need to apologize.
I like this one.
- [Laughs]
- I'll send him back after tea.
[Clears throat]
Tell me you didn't ask our client for a doggy bag.
What can I say?
Stacy insisted.
Just got off with Joy McAfee's general counsel.
It seems she had an epiphany.
She wants less on her plate, not more.
I thought you were going to close her.
We need that doll money.
I'm on top of it.
Harvey took five months to structure that deal.
Please don't make me set fire to your desk.
I--
All you had to do was have tea with the dolls.
Donna, schedule another tea party with Joy as soon as possible.
And text me the names of her girls.
Oh, what a shock.
You can't keep girls' names straight in your head.
Just yours, Debbie.
See, that's funny because your name is Donna.
Harvey Specter.
I got your order right here.
I didn't order a pizza.
You've been served.
Cab driver who hit Ray named me as a witness in a civil suit.
I need to pay Travis Bickle a visit.
Harvey, if you let me go talk to Joy,
I know I can fix this--
- No.
You don't send a puppy to clean up its own mess.
Optimally, you don't even have a puppy.
[Sighs]
Ross, rumor has it you talked a client out of $200 million.
The deal's not off the table, all right?
It's just a speed bump.
Dude, I think we just found him a new nickname.
Speed Bump!
[Laughs]
I feel like I'm back in high school.
They called you Speed Bump in high school?
- [Sighs]
- Kidding.
But if you need any boxes to pack up your office, just--
Ow.
Hmm, wait a minute, uh-- [grunts] There.
I think that belongs to you.
It wouldn't hurt so much if you had thicker skin.
[Phone rings]
What do you want?
I wanna pay you back for posting bail.
Trevor, you've owed me 40 bucks since fifth grade.
I wrote it off, okay?
Look, I want a clean slate, okay?
So you don't want to see me, I'll mail you a check.
[All chuckle]
Okay.
Yeah, let's hang out tomorrow night.
Nothing crazy, though, all right?
I have to be up early.
We can crochet panty hose if that's what it takes to be cool.
I think we can do a little better than that.
Why don't we, uh...
Why don't we say Rex's, 7:30.
First six rounds are on me.
If you're serious about paying me back, the first 100 rounds are on you.
[Laughs] All right.
[Soft indistinct chatter]
So it's the tough guy.
This is a matter for insurance, not a frivolous lawsuit.
You know, for your information,
I suffered emotional pain.
Emotional pain?
Rub this on your emotional pain.
You condescending son of a--
Look at me, I am gonna warn you once.
Do not pursue this matter.
You know, I have been held up at gunpoint three times.
So do you think a fancy suit and a $500 haircut, that's gonna scare me?
You take my driver to court, I'm gonna represent him myself.
And when you lose, you'll be covering my fee, which is gonna be a hell of a lot of haircuts.
Hmm, so you weren't a one-way fare.
Ray's worked for me eight years.
Then you don't have to worry about being a witness, because as his employer, you're liable for his actions.
You know, I think you've seen way too many reruns of Ally McBeal.
Hmm.
You know, I emigrated here after September 11th, and they shut the doors on everybody.
I couldn't pay for a lawyer, so I had to take them to court.
I sued for my citizenship, so I have a very special appreciation for the law.
I appreciate a good single malt.
I don't pretend I can make one.
I wiped the floor with the U.S. government, counselor.
I'm gonna do the same with you.
- Ray.
- Donna.
What are you doin' here?
I don't have you scheduled.
Uh, I need to see Harvey.
Oh, come on.
You know the rules.
No one sets foot in there without a warrant, a papal edict, or my say-so.
I just got named in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit.
The accident wasn't my fault.
Can I get in to see Harvey, please?
Okay, say no more.
I will get you in.
You are so beautiful when you're forceful.
I know you meant that as a compliment, but I don't appreciate limitations being placed on my beauty.
Harvey, I'm already losing money with my car in the shop.
A trial means I can't work.
And how do you think my name is gonna play in front of a New York jury?
Rahim Benghazi.
I may as well buy a one-way ticket to Guantanamo.
- Not gonna happen.
- If I lose,
I won't even be able to afford a livery license, let alone my insurance.
That's why I'm gonna be defending both of us.
Ray, this goes against every fiber of my being.
I'm taking your case pro bono.
I don't know what to say.
Absolutely nothing, I've got a reputation to maintain.
Besides, it's not gonna take long, okay?
I'm gonna get it dismissed.
Donna, call the court.
We need priority status on the docket.
Yeah, I already tried.
You drew Judge Palermo.
You know what you have to do, don't you?
Yeah.
The other thing that goes against every fiber of my being.
Louis, has anyone told you you're an exquisite soprano?
What do you want, Harvey?
You're right.
Why prolong my suffering?
I need you to get me in to see Judge Palermo.
You need my help, and you're not gonna pull rank on me?
Your case has nothing to do with firm business, does it?
What's it gonna take?
A mani-pedi?
Tickets to Celine?
[Laughs] I'll see what I can do.
And your pound of flesh?
I need my back scratched, I'll let you know.
Louis, unless that's a metaphor, the deal's off.
Huh.
Joy, when I told you that my grandmother didn't have much time,
I--I didn't realize that she's 15 years older than you.
Now, how would you know how old I am?
That is a very closely guarded secret.
[Sighs] I did some research.
Very resourceful.
I did it to assure myself that you can handle a heavier workload.
I appreciate that, but I'm not worried about my health.
Is it the money?
Because I can guarantee, 200 million up front is just 1/10 of what you stand to make on this deal.
Michael, my dolls eat better than most people.
I've got plenty of money.
This deal meant staying on for five more years and doubling my workload.
[Sighs] [Clears throat]
I am going to take my grandchildren on a cruise to Tahiti.
Tahiti?
You know, the licensing agreement includes a theme park.
You could-- you could take them there.
It's not about the deal.
I have had this same view for 25 years.
I need a change of scenery.
I am gonna speak to Harvey, and I'm gonna tell him that I want to sell the whole business.
So...
I just spoke to Judge Palermo.
And because he thinks I'm a good guy, and I told him I'd owe him one, your case is gonna be moved up way ahead.
Back scratch.
I don't have a firstborn, you know, so what exactly do you want for that?
No, you're not getting one of my ties.
No.
Your shoulder?
What-- your lapel--
Donna?
[Laughs] Oh, God.
Norma is going to Istanbul for two weeks, and you know that I'm not good with temps.
Oh, my God.
Ask me for something else.
Harvey, this is non-negotiable.
You owe me now.
Donna is one thing that I can't give you.
- Why not?
- For one thing, she'd never agree to it.
You're her boss.
You just tell her to do stuff.
I don't tell her to do anything.
She just does.
All right, fine.
You know what?
That's just...
Not a problem.
I will call Judge Palermo, and I'll tell him
I was mistaken, and then your hearing will be in,
I don't know, maybe six months?
I tell you what.
If you can convince her yourself, you have my blessing.
She's gonna love me so much, you're gonna fight to get her back.
Hi, Donna.
Harvey and I were just, uh, talking about you.
And--
- No.
You don't even know what I was gonna say.
Yes, I do.
And how is that possible?
I read lips, I know body language, and I talk to Norma.
I'm not some token you win at a fair, Louis.
You're not--I know you're not.
You're not a token.
I'm a human being, and I--
Yes, you are.
I'm sorry, I just-- you know what, that just made me feel really...
Cheap.
I--
No, I'm just trying to tell you that you're really good at what you do, Donna.
So I'm gonna ask you--
It's like my soul hurts now.
No, Donna, listen, even if your soul hurts a little bit--
I'm sorry.
[Sobs]
It's okay.
It's gonna be fine.
Don't cry.
Please don't cry, Donna.
- [Sobs]
- Oh, sh--.
I think I owe you one for that.
That was fun.
Wait a second, the-- the time that you cried, and then I let your parents stay in my condo--
Yup.

Oh, no.
I'm privy to all communication between you and the court.
Well, if your driving matched your legal knowledge, we wouldn't be here.
Your Honor.
This case should be dismissed.
It's a matter for insurance.
Insurance only covers repairs.
It does not deal with my losses.
What losses?
Because of the accident, I missed my chance to get my taxi medallion.
You can't just buy it next year?
The loan I got expires in one week.
On top of that, a medallion costs 300,000 this go-round.
Next year, 350.
So his entire claim rests upon the assumption that he would've won this year's medallion.
The hallmark of America is that the little guy gets to see justice done.
We are all equals in the eyes of the law.
That is why, out of all the countries in the world,
I chose to come here.
What do you got to say about that, counselor?
I say Atticus Finch makes a good speech here, but this is a fender-bender, not a multimillion-dollar lawsuit.
Vicarious liability applies to discrimination, harassment, and accidents.
Employers are responsible for their employees' negligence.
Court finds a reasonable suit here.
Trial starts tomorrow.
Thank you, Your Honor.
You're getting a good kick out of this, aren't you?
I am.
But I'm taking this on its merits.
And you better bring your "A" game tomorrow, 'cause he's got a legitimate claim.
He wants a trial?
I'll give him a goddamn trial.
Your Honor.
So how many cases have you won?
I only remember how many I've lost.
None.

Wait, what happened to the drinks?
I got a better idea.
Let's say we get a bottle and take the party back to your place?
Make it a bottle of Dom, and you're on.
All right, how about four bottles?
Come on.

You guys want to get a cab?
Definitely.

Cab, four bottles of Dom.
You want to spend any more of my money?

You wanted to see me?
Did you go see Joy after I told you not to?
[Sighs] How did you know?
I didn't.
Until now.
- [Sighs]
- I told you, a puppy can't clean up its own mess.
Mess?
All I did was tell her about my grandmother.
Your job is to make my life easier.
If you can't understand that, why did I hire you?
Police report summarized.
Traffic signal analysis.
Medallion bids, attendees, and results.
That's why you hired me.
I thought you were all over the Joy situation.
Instead, you're all over page six.
You wanted me to do pro bono work, this is it.
Pro bono enhances a firm's image.
This makes us look like wealthy bullies against an everyman cabbie.
Does that seem like it enhances our image to you?
I refuse to answer that, on the grounds that I don't want to.
[Laughs]
Someone had a fun night.
Answer another call you shouldn't have?
I--I-- I didn't--I was--
Piece of advice-- when the big dog asks the puppy something like that, it's a rhetorical question.
Got it.
Before you go, the phone call, the other day, when you answered it during the meeting...
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
Won't happen again.
Who was it?
Um, it's just a friend.
You know, an emergency.
What kind of emergency?
- Um--
- Was it a friend who almost got you busted for drug trafficking?
That friend?
Trevor?
He's not dealing anymore, Harvey.
So it was him.
He called you from jail?
You know, I make a living learning how to read people, Mike.
So if I saw it, Jessica did too.
Is that the kind of impression you want to leave around here?
This guy is not your friend.
He is an anchor dragging you down.
Get rid of him.
He is my oldest friend, Harvey.
I wasn't just gonna let him rot in jail.
What's gonna happen the next time?
'Cause there will be a next time.
You gonna bail him out?
Put yourself in jeopardy?
You know, if it weren't for Trevor, you and I never would've met.
Cut him loose.

We're here to see Mike Ross.

Did you get the red velvet cupcakes?
Yes, three dozen, extra icing.
How the hell did that happen?
Okay.
You know what?
There.
Problem solved.
I asked you, how'd you get that tear?
A couple of guys came to the firm.
They were looking for me.
I don't know what they wanted, but I'm...
I'm pretty sure it something to do with some shit Trevor did.
And that big brain of yours doesn't remember me saying to cut ties with that loser?
You know what?
You've been blowing off Joy's deal all week for your friend, okay?
So please.
First of all, Trevor's not your friend.
You want to know why I'm loyal to Ray?
I was taking a limo, and I left $3,000 in it.
Ray happened to be the driver.
He found it and tracked me down.
Not a nickel of it was missing, and his first reaction when this accident occurred was to ask if we were okay.
Now, what would Trevor's have been?
Cut him off.
Now, as far as the licensing deal goes, just because you think I'm blowing something off doesn't mean I am.
Now, watch and learn.

Everything's set for you to walk away.
We're selling your stake as a block.
[Children screaming] Your, uh, headhunter's lining up your replacement as we speak.
[Glass shatters] Well, Harvey, this was the most wonderful surprise.
You're a long-time client who wants to be with her family.
It's the least I could do.
And you'll have all the free time in the world to spend with them.
Joey broke the lamp.
Oh, that's great.
Now, how soon can we send 'em home?
They're booked on the first flight out, tomorrow morning.
So when you had Donna text you the girls' names--
I was talking about her daughters.
And you were gonna fly them out all along.
Do you remember when I said,
"You don't send a puppy to clean up its own mess?"
Yes, Harvey, I do.
I'm not a puppy.
Court will come to order.
Mr. Santana, your opening statement, please.
Driving a cab is not very glamorous.
But it's an honest day's work.
Ever since I started, I looked forward to a time when I could tell customers that they were riding in my cab.
That I was an owner-operator.
So I scrimped, and I saved, until I finally had enough put away to buy a medallion.
But...
Because of the actions of this man,
I've lost that opportunity.
So make no mistake, this-- this trial is not about a busted headlight.
This is a trial about a broken dream.
Forget the case, they're gonna make him president.
Statements are like free throws--easy.
Nobody's playing defense.
Are we good at defense?
You would agree that chauffeur drivers cause more accidents--
Objection.
Badgering.
Sustained.
Objection.
Argumentative.
Leading the witness.
Ambiguous.
Privileged.
Inflammatory.
Sustained.
Anything further, Mr. Santana?
Yes, Your Honor, I would like to call to the stand Mr. Michael Ross, please.
Uh-- [Clears throat]
What time had you called for the limo on the morning of the accident?
Uh, we were supposed to leave at 8:30.
And what time did you get to work?
Objection.
Irrelevant.
It's highly relevant, Your Honor.
It speaks to the psychology of the driver,
Rahim Benghazi.
Overruled.
Answer Mr. Santana's question.
[Sighs] 8:40.
So unless Mr. Benghazi made up for that lost time, you were going to be late for that meeting, correct?
Yes.
No further questions, Your Honor.
[Clears throat]
When the accident occurred, you were on your way to the medallion auction.
When and where was this auction to take place?
9:00 a.m., City Hall.
According to the police report, the accident occurred at 8:53 a.m.
That means you only had seven minutes to get downtown in rush hour traffic.
Objection, irrelevant.
I believe when I made the same objection, you told his honor it was highly relevant.
Overruled.
You were running late, only the stakes for you were much higher, weren't they?
These things never start on time.
Then why was the first medallion sold at 9:03 a.m.?
You were scared your chance at a medallion was going up in smoke, and you ran a red.
Then you used the accident to paint me and Ray Benghazi as a couple of scapegoats.
You can't prove that.
What color was the light?
I take the fifth.
You can't take the fifth, Mr. Santana.
This isn't a criminal case.
What color was the light?
He cut me off.
You claim to love our legal system so much, answer the question.
What color was the light?
What color was the light?
Your Honor?
Answer the question, Mr. Santana.
It just meant so much to me.
Your Honor, can I sidebar with opposing counsel?
We can roll the dice with the jury, but I'd rather settle.
Well, how much would I have to pay?
Nothing.
You take responsibility for the accident, and your insurance company makes Ray whole.
In return,
I waive my right to collect legal fees.
[Sighs]
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
I've got a reputation to maintain.
That goes for you too, judge.
[Phone rings]
Damn it, Trevor.
I left you like five messages.
Good to know your boy's flaky with everyone.
I was taking it personal.
What do you want?
Well, Trevor owes us $50,000 he's never paid, so you're gonna bail him out.
Listen,
I don't have that kind of money, okay?
I can't.
Well, if you're not down here in an hour with it, we're gonna take it out on Trevor.
Tell him where the money is.
Whatever you do, don't show up.
[Winces]
Trevor!
You have one hour.
Hello?
Hello?
What do you think you're doing, leaving in the middle of a trial?
I got some things to take care of.
You mean someone to take care of.
You never cut Trevor off, did you?
No, I didn't.
My friend's in trouble, and I'm gonna help him.
You know what?
This is what addicts do.
The second they start making progress, they screw up, because deep down they think it's only a matter of time until they fail.
They'd rather fall from the third floor than the penthouse.
Nothing you say can stop me.
Then tell me what the hell's going on.
[Sighs]
He's clean.
No wires.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
You remember what happened with the guy.
He was 300 pounds.
Now, who'd you say you were again?
Trevor's lawyer.
Trevor didn't mention a lawyer.
He doesn't know he hired me.
[Laughs] Come on.
Open the briefcase.
Where's the goddamn money?
That photo is a screen shot, taken from my firm's security video.
We know what you look like.
And if Mike Ross doesn't hear from me in the next five minutes, he's calling the police.
[Laughs]
No, man.
You're not comin' in here and threatening' us.
You're looking at kidnapping, extortion, and drug-dealing, and the district attorney happens to be number three on my speed dial.
Well, if we're looking at all that time, you might as well add murder.
I got a better idea.
Retainer agreement.
If you sign right here, you'll become one of my clients.
And I won't be able to testify against you, even if I wanted to.
What about the money?
This envelope contains $10,000.
Consider it a down payment on Trevor's debt.
Only here's the thing,
I don't do pro bono work.
And my retainer agreement requires a down payment of $10,000.
Now, as your attorney, my job is to give you advice.
So here's the deal.
Sign the agreement.
[Sighs]
I thought I said not to come.
Remember that 40 bucks from the fifth grade you owe me?
If you were dead, how would I collect?
[Sighing] Oh, man.
I'm sorry, I just...
Put you in trouble just by hanging out with you.
So why'd you do it?
'Cause I'm a dick.
[Both chuckle]
Bet you didn't think you'd have to save my ass so soon after bailing me out.
I wasn't the one who saved you.
Yeah.
Well, as a friend, the guy puts me to shame.
Harvey's not my friend, trust me.
Well, he didn't put his ass on the line because of me.
Listen, I pled you down to a misdemeanor--
- Ugh.
- Drunk and disorderly.
And I paid the fine.
[Sighs]
I think it might be a good idea if you got out of town for a while.
[Sighs]
Montana.
Well, you said you wanted a clean slate.
I figured 20 hours on a bus ought to do the trick.
Oh, yeah, it'll do me good.
Wait.

When I get back, you know who the first person I'm gonna call is.
Yeah.
The one person you know who'll answer.

You can't be serious.

I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Really, because I understand that you dropped the puppy analogy on him, which is exactly what I used on you.
May have slipped out by accident.
Well, accident, on purpose, the really important thing is, is that I'm taller than you.
Yeah.
Yup, you look much thinner in that.
You planted that story, be man enough to own it.
I don't traffic in the tabloids, Harvey.
But I can see how whoever planted this might find it amusing.
You know, the great Harvey Specter bullying a humble cab driver.
I mean, it's a no-win situation, really.
Well, maybe you didn't hear.
I won the no-win situation.
Did it ever occur to you that if you hadn't done that to me,
I actually would have owed you one?
Maybe if you didn't humiliate me in front of the associates--
Louis, for an average attorney, 100 million is a career case.

Yeah.
Can I ask you a question?
After all this, you really think I'm still buying the Mr. I-don't-give-a-crap thing?

You've already wasted ten minutes of my life.
Please tell me you didn't wait ten minutes just to scold me.
I've been waiting for you to bring the paperwork down so I can close a nine-figure licensing deal.
If your phone rings while I'm talking to Ray,
I'm throwing it out of the car while it's attached to your hand.

Okay, what was the name of the record label?
Marlin records.
Who covered it in the late '60s?
Ahh!
I want to say The Stones, but--
You need some guesses?
Oh!
Oh, my God.
Just like a private car service, huh?
Thinking you don't have to yield?
What?
Yield?
You ran a red light!
That light was yellow!
No, sir, it was not!
Are you calling me a liar?
- Back off.
- Mind your business, okay?
- No, I'm minding my business.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Anyone throws a punch, or I'm gonna introduce you to Mr. Taser.
Trade insurance,
I'll take reports, one at a time.
Yeah, as much as I'd like to help you out,
I'm late for a meeting.
No, no, no.
You're not going anywhere.
I need a statement from you too.
Here's mine.
I need you to babysit the client till I get there.
And don't mention the deal.
If she asks any questions, just nod your head and look pretty.
Ms. McAfee, I'm Mike Ross.
I work with Harvey.
Oh, you're the protege that he's been gushing about.
He was gushing?
Well, he mentioned that you existed.
For Harvey, that's gushing.
Uh, he's running a few minutes late today.
Um, car trouble.
I was just about to have tea with the girls.
Would you care to join me?
I'd love to.
Good.
And for heaven's sakes, call me Joy.
Okay, Joy.
These...
Are the girls.
Susie, Sarah,
Stacy, Sinclair, and Sabrina.
Susie, where are your manners?
Shake hands with this nice young man.
Mm...
Just kidding, I know they're dolls.
Oh.
They're named after my daughters.
I started the company because of them, really.
You know, dolls didn't used to be these cheap, plastic bimbos from China that we have today.
Your mother made them for you by hand.
I wanted my girls to have that same experience.
And here we are, 30 years later.
Every parent's worst nightmare.
What do you mean?
These little angels, they sell for $90 a pop.
I wasn't born with a butler, you know.
I gotta say, this is amazing, taking on a project like a licensing deal.
Why is that amazing?
Well, my grandmother could never pull this off.
She's been retired for ten years.
How is that treating her?
She lives near my apartment.
I get to see her once a week, so...
- That's very sweet of you.
- No.
No, it's not.
You know, whenever I needed her, she was there.
You know, no matter what.
She'd give me a hug, she'd tell me everything is gonna be all right.
And...
Even if it wasn't.
And now that she needs me, I am always at work.
And I'm--
I'm so sorry.
Yeah?
Never answer your phone in front of a client.
- But it's you.
- What's happening?
Well, actually we're in the middle of a tea party.
I knew you were the doll-playing type.
Put Joy on.
Ms. McAfee, it's Harvey.
Oh.
Joy, I'm sorry,
I have to reschedule.
No need to apologize.
I like this one.
I'll send him back after tea.
Tell me you didn't ask our client for a doggy bag.
What can I say?
Stacy insisted.
Just got off with Joy McAfee's general counsel.
It seems she had an epiphany.
She wants less on her plate, not more.
I thought you were going to close her.
We need that doll money.
I'm on top of it.
Harvey took five months to structure that deal.
Please don't make me set fire to your desk.
I--
All you had to do was have tea with the dolls.
Donna, schedule another tea party with Joy as soon as possible.
And text me the names of her girls.
Oh, what a shock.
You can't keep girls' names straight in your head.
Just yours, Debbie.
See, that's funny because your name is Donna.
Harvey Specter.
I got your order right here.
I didn't order a pizza.
You've been served.
Cab driver who hit Ray named me as a witness in a civil suit.
I need to pay Travis Bickle a visit.
Harvey, if you let me go talk to Joy,
I know I can fix this-- No.
You don't send a puppy to clean up its own mess.
Optimally, you don't even have a puppy.
Ross, rumor has it you talked a client out of $200 million.
The deal's not off the table, all right?
It's just a speed bump.
Dude, I think we just found him a new nickname.
Speed Bump!
I feel like I'm back in high school.
They called you Speed Bump in high school?
Kidding.
But if you need any boxes to pack up your office, just--
Ow.
Hmm, wait a minute, uh--
There.
I think that belongs to you.
It wouldn't hurt so much if you had thicker skin.
What do you want?
I wanna pay you back for posting bail.
Trevor, you've owed me 40 bucks since fifth grade.
I wrote it off, okay?
Look, I want a clean slate, okay?
So you don't want to see me, I'll mail you a check.
Okay.
Yeah, let's hang out tomorrow night.
Nothing crazy, though, all right?
I have to be up early.
We can crochet panty hose if that's what it takes to be cool.
I think we can do a little better than that.
Why don't we, uh...
Why don't we say Rex's, 7:30.
First six rounds are on me.
If you're serious about paying me back, the first 100 rounds are on you.
All right.
So it's the tough guy.
This is a matter for insurance, not a frivolous lawsuit.
You know, for your information,
I suffered emotional pain.
Emotional pain?
Rub this on your emotional pain.
You condescending son of a--
Look at me, I am gonna warn you once.
Do not pursue this matter.
You know, I have been held up at gunpoint three times.
So do you think a fancy suit and a $500 haircut, that's gonna scare me?
You take my driver to court, I'm gonna represent him myself.
And when you lose, you'll be covering my fee, which is gonna be a hell of a lot of haircuts.
Hmm, so you weren't a one-way fare.
Ray's worked for me eight years.
Then you don't have to worry about being a witness, because as his employer, you're liable for his actions.
You know, I think you've seen way too many reruns of Ally McBeal.
Hmm.
You know, I emigrated here after September 11th, and they shut the doors on everybody.
I couldn't pay for a lawyer, so I had to take them to court.
I sued for my citizenship, so I have a very special appreciation for the law.
I appreciate a good single malt.
I don't pretend I can make one.
I wiped the floor with the U.S. government, counselor.
I'm gonna do the same with you.
- Ray.
- Donna.
What are you doin' here?
I don't have you scheduled.
Uh, I need to see Harvey.
Oh, come on.
You know the rules.
No one sets foot in there without a warrant, a papal edict, or my say-so.
I just got named in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit.
The accident wasn't my fault.
Can I get in to see Harvey, please?
Okay, say no more.
I will get you in.
You are so beautiful when you're forceful.
I know you meant that as a compliment, but I don't appreciate limitations being placed on my beauty.
Harvey, I'm already losing money with my car in the shop.
A trial means I can't work.
And how do you think my name is gonna play in front of a New York jury?
Rahim Benghazi.
I may as well buy a one-way ticket to Guantanamo.
- Not gonna happen.
- If I lose,
I won't even be able to afford a livery license, let alone my insurance.
That's why I'm gonna be defending both of us.
Ray, this goes against every fiber of my being.
I'm taking your case pro bono.
I don't know what to say.
Absolutely nothing, I've got a reputation to maintain.
Besides, it's not gonna take long, okay?
I'm gonna get it dismissed.
Donna, call the court.
We need priority status on the docket.
Yeah, I already tried.
You drew Judge Palermo.
You know what you have to do, don't you?
Yeah.
The other thing that goes against every fiber of my being.
Louis, has anyone told you you're an exquisite soprano?
What do you want, Harvey?
You're right.
Why prolong my suffering?
I need you to get me in to see Judge Palermo.
You need my help, and you're not gonna pull rank on me?
Your case has nothing to do with firm business, does it?
What's it gonna take?
A mani-pedi?
Tickets to Celine?
I'll see what I can do.
And your pound of flesh?
I need my back scratched, I'll let you know.
Louis, unless that's a metaphor, the deal's off.
Huh.
Joy, when I told you that my grandmother didn't have much time,
I--I didn't realize that she's 15 years older than you.
Now, how would you know how old I am?
That is a very closely guarded secret.
I did some research.
Very resourceful.
I did it to assure myself that you can handle a heavier workload.
I appreciate that, but I'm not worried about my health.
Is it the money?
Because I can guarantee, 200 million up front is just 1/10 of what you stand to make on this deal.
Michael, my dolls eat better than most people.
I've got plenty of money.
This deal meant staying on for five more years and doubling my workload.
I am going to take my grandchildren on a cruise to Tahiti.
Tahiti?
You know, the licensing agreement includes a theme park.
You could-- you could take them there.
It's not about the deal.
I have had this same view for 25 years.
I need a change of scenery.
I am gonna speak to Harvey, and I'm gonna tell him that I want to sell the whole business.
So...
I just spoke to Judge Palermo.
And because he thinks I'm a good guy, and I told him I'd owe him one, your case is gonna be moved up way ahead.
Back scratch.
I don't have a firstborn, you know, so what exactly do you want for that?
No, you're not getting one of my ties.
No.
Your shoulder?
What-- your lapel--
Donna?
Oh, God.
Norma is going to Istanbul for two weeks, and you know that I'm not good with temps.
Oh, my God.
Ask me for something else.
Harvey, this is non-negotiable.
You owe me now.
Donna is one thing that I can't give you.
- Why not?
- For one thing, she'd never agree to it.
You're her boss.
You just tell her to do stuff.
I don't tell her to do anything.
She just does.
All right, fine.
You know what?
That's just...
Not a problem.
I will call Judge Palermo, and I'll tell him
I was mistaken, and then your hearing will be in,
I don't know, maybe six months?
I tell you what.
If you can convince her yourself, you have my blessing.
She's gonna love me so much, you're gonna fight to get her back.
Hi, Donna.
Harvey and I were just, uh, talking about you.
And-- No.
You don't even know what I was gonna say.
Yes, I do.
And how is that possible?
I read lips, I know body language, and I talk to Norma.
I'm not some token you win at a fair, Louis.
You're not--I know you're not.
You're not a token.
I'm a human being, and I--
Yes, you are.
I'm sorry, I just-- you know what, that just made me feel really...
Cheap.
I--
No, I'm just trying to tell you that you're really good at what you do, Donna.
So I'm gonna ask you--
It's like my soul hurts now.
No, Donna, listen, even if your soul hurts a little bit--
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It's gonna be fine.
Don't cry.
Please don't cry, Donna.
Oh, sh--.
I think I owe you one for that.
That was fun.
Wait a second, the-- the time that you cried, and then I let your parents stay in my condo--
Yup.

Oh, no.
I'm privy to all communication between you and the court.
Well, if your driving matched your legal knowledge, we wouldn't be here.
Your Honor.
This case should be dismissed.
It's a matter for insurance.
Insurance only covers repairs.
It does not deal with my losses.
What losses?
Because of the accident, I missed my chance to get my taxi medallion.
You can't just buy it next year?
The loan I got expires in one week.
On top of that, a medallion costs 300,000 this go-round.
Next year, 350.
So his entire claim rests upon the assumption that he would've won this year's medallion.
The hallmark of America is that the little guy gets to see justice done.
We are all equals in the eyes of the law.
That is why, out of all the countries in the world,

What do you got to say about that, counselor?
I say Atticus Finch makes a good speech here, but this is a fender-bender, not a multimillion-dollar lawsuit.
Vicarious liability applies to discrimination, harassment, and accidents.
Employers are responsible for their employees' negligence.
Court finds a reasonable suit here.

I am.
But I'm taking this on its merits.
And you better bring your "A" game tomorrow, 'cause he's got a legitimate claim.
He wants a trial?
I'll give him a goddamn trial.
Your Honor.
So how many cases have you won?
I only remember how many I've lost.
None.
Wait, what happened to the drinks?
I got a better idea.
Let's say we get a bottle and take the party back to your place?
Make it a bottle of Dom, and you're on.
All right, how about four bottles?
Come on.
You guys want to get a cab?
Definitely.
Definitely.
Cab, four bottles of Dom.
You want to spend any more of my money?

What was that about back there?
Look, I'm not playing with you, all right?

How did you know?
I didn't.
Until now.
I told you, a puppy can't clean up its own mess.
Mess?
All I did was tell her about my grandmother.
Your job is to make my life easier.
If you can't understand that, why did I hire you?
Police report summarized.
Traffic signal analysis.
Medallion bids, attendees, and results.
That's why you hired me.
I thought you were all over the Joy situation.
Instead, you're all over page six.
You wanted me to do pro bono work, this is it.
Pro bono enhances a firm's image.
This makes us look like wealthy bullies against an everyman cabbie.
Does that seem like it enhances our image to you?

Yeah.
Sorry about that.

Who was it?
Um, it's just a friend.
You know, an emergency.
What kind of emergency?
- Um--
- Was it a friend who almost got you busted for drug trafficking?
That friend?
Trevor?
He's not dealing anymore, Harvey.
So it was him.
He called you from jail?
You know, I make a living learning how to read people, Mike.
So if I saw it, Jessica did too.
Is that the kind of impression you want to leave around here?
This guy is not your friend.
He is an anchor dragging you down.
Get rid of him.
He is my oldest friend, Harvey.
I wasn't just gonna let him rot in jail.
What's gonna happen the next time?
'Cause there will be a next time.
You gonna bail him out?
Put yourself in jeopardy?
You know, if it weren't for Trevor, you and I never would've met.

I asked you, how'd you get that tear?
A couple of guys came to the firm.
They were looking for me.
I don't know what they wanted, but I'm...
I'm pretty sure it something to do with some shit Trevor did.
And that big brain of yours doesn't remember me saying to cut ties with that loser?
You know what?
You've been blowing off Joy's deal all week for your friend, okay?
So please.
First of all, Trevor's not your friend.
You want to know why I'm loyal to Ray?
I was taking a limo, and I left $3,000 in it.
Ray happened to be the driver.
He found it and tracked me down.
Not a nickel of it was missing, and his first reaction when this accident occurred was to ask if we were okay.
Now, what would Trevor's have been?
Cut him off.
Now, as far as the licensing deal goes, just because you think I'm blowing something off doesn't mean I am.
Now, watch and learn.
Everything's set for you to walk away.
We're selling your stake as a block.
Your, uh, headhunter's lining up your replacement as we speak.
Well, Harvey, this was the most wonderful surprise.
You're a long-time client who wants to be with her family.
It's the least I could do.
And you'll have all the free time in the world to spend with them.
Joey broke the lamp.
Oh, that's great.
Now, how soon can we send 'em home?
They're booked on the first flight out, tomorrow morning.
So when you had Donna text you the girls' names--
I was talking about her daughters.
And you were gonna fly them out all along.
Do you remember when I said,
"You don't send a puppy to clean up its own mess?"
Yes, Harvey, I do.
I'm not a puppy.
Court will come to order.
Mr. Santana, your opening statement, please.
Driving a cab is not very glamorous.
But it's an honest day's work.
Ever since I started, I looked forward to a time when I could tell customers that they were riding in my cab.
That I was an owner-operator.
So I scrimped, and I saved, until I finally had enough put away to buy a medallion.
But...
Because of the actions of this man,
I've lost that opportunity.
So make no mistake, this-- this trial is not about a busted headlight.
This is a trial about a broken dream.
Forget the case, they're gonna make him president.
Statements are like free throws--easy.
Nobody's playing defense.
Are we good at defense?
You would agree that chauffeur drivers cause more accidents--
Objection.
Badgering.
Sustained.
Objection.
Argumentative.
Leading the witness.
Ambiguous.
Privileged.
Inflammatory.
Sustained.
Anything further, Mr. Santana?
Yes, Your Honor, I would like to call to the stand Mr. Michael Ross, please.
Uh--
What time had you called for the limo on the morning of the accident?
Uh, we were supposed to leave at 8:30.
And what time did you get to work?
Objection.
Irrelevant.
It's highly relevant, Your Honor.
It speaks to the psychology of the driver,
Rahim Benghazi.
Overruled.
Answer Mr. Santana's question.
8:40.
So unless Mr. Benghazi made up for that lost time, you were going to be late for that meeting, correct?
Yes.
No further questions, Your Honor.
When the accident occurred, you were on your way to the medallion auction.
When and where was this auction to take place?
9:00 a.m., City Hall.
According to the police report, the accident occurred at 8:53 a.m.
That means you only had seven minutes to get downtown in rush hour traffic.
Objection, irrelevant.
I believe when I made the same objection, you told his honor it was highly relevant.
Overruled.
You were running late, only the stakes for you were much higher, weren't they?
These things never start on time.
Then why was the first medallion sold at 9:03 a.m.?
You were scared your chance at a medallion was going up in smoke, and you ran a red.
Then you used the accident to paint me and Ray Benghazi as a couple of scapegoats.
You can't prove that.
What color was the light?
I take the fifth.
You can't take the fifth, Mr. Santana.
This isn't a criminal case.
What color was the light?
He cut me off.
You claim to love our legal system so much, answer the question.
What color was the light?
What color was the light?
Your Honor?
Answer the question, Mr. Santana.
It just meant so much to me.
Your Honor, can I sidebar with opposing counsel?
We can roll the dice with the jury, but I'd rather settle.
Well, how much would I have to pay?
Nothing.
You take responsibility for the accident, and your insurance company makes Ray whole.
In return,
I waive my right to collect legal fees.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
I've got a reputation to maintain.
That goes for you too, judge.
Damn it, Trevor.
I left you like five messages.
Good to know your boy's flaky with everyone.
I was taking it personal.
What do you want?
Well, Trevor owes us $50,000 he's never paid, so you're gonna bail him out.
Listen,
I don't have that kind of money, okay?
I can't.
Well, if you're not down here in an hour with it, we're gonna take it out on Trevor.
Tell him where the money is.
Whatever you do, don't show up.
Trevor!
You have one hour.
Hello?
Hello?
What do you think you're doing, leaving in the middle of a trial?
I got some things to take care of.
You mean someone to take care of.
You never cut Trevor off, did you?
No, I didn't.
My friend's in trouble, and I'm gonna help him.
You know what?
This is what addicts do.
The second they start making progress, they screw up, because deep down they think it's only a matter of time until they fail.
They'd rather fall from the third floor than the penthouse.
Nothing you say can stop me.
Then tell me what the hell's going on.
He's clean.
No wires.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
You remember what happened with the guy.
He was 300 pounds.
Now, who'd you say you were again?
Trevor's lawyer.
Trevor didn't mention a lawyer.
He doesn't know he hired me.
Come on.
Open the briefcase.
Where's the goddamn money?
That photo is a screen shot, taken from my firm's security video.
We know what you look like.
And if Mike Ross doesn't hear from me in the next five minutes, he's calling the police.
No, man.
You're not comin' in here and threatening' us.
You're looking at kidnapping, extortion, and drug-dealing, and the district attorney happens to be number three on my speed dial.
Well, if we're looking at all that time, you might as well add murder.
I got a better idea.
Retainer agreement.
If you sign right here, you'll become one of my clients.
And I won't be able to testify against you, even if I wanted to.
What about the money?
This envelope contains $10,000.
Consider it a down payment on Trevor's debt.
Only here's the thing,
I don't do pro bono work.
And my retainer agreement requires a down payment of $10,000.
Now, as your attorney, my job is to give you advice.
So here's the deal.
Sign the agreement.
I thought I said not to come.
Remember that 40 bucks from the fifth grade you owe me?
If you were dead, how would I collect?
Oh, man.
I'm sorry, I just...
Put you in trouble just by hanging out with you.
So why'd you do it?
'Cause I'm a dick.
Bet you didn't think you'd have to save my ass so soon after bailing me out.
I wasn't the one who saved you.
Yeah.
Well, as a friend, the guy puts me to shame.
Harvey's not my friend, trust me.
Well, he didn't put his ass on the line because of me.
Listen, I pled you down to a misdemeanor--
- Ugh.
- Drunk and disorderly.
And I paid the fine.
I think it might be a good idea if you got out of town for a while.
Montana.
Well, you said you wanted a clean slate.
I figured 20 hours on a bus ought to do the trick.
Oh, yeah, it'll do me good.
Wait.
When I get back, you know who the first person I'm gonna call is.
Yeah.
The one person you know who'll answer.
For you.
What's this?
I'm very happy you took Ray on pro bono.
You, on the other hand, can afford our services.
You want me to pay me to represent me?
Mm-hmm.
Ten hours at $1,000 an hour.
Eh, yeah, I'll let you do the math.
You can't be serious.
I'll tell you what I am serious about.
I hear you're finally mentoring the kid.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Really, because I understand that you dropped the puppy analogy on him, which is exactly what I used on you.
May have slipped out by accident.
Well, accident, on purpose, the really important thing is, is that I'm taller than you.
Yeah.
Yup, you look much thinner in that.
You planted that story, be man enough to own it.
I don't traffic in the tabloids, Harvey.
But I can see how whoever planted this might find it amusing.
You know, the great Harvey Specter bullying a humble cab driver.
I mean, it's a no-win situation, really.
Well, maybe you didn't hear.
I won the no-win situation.
Did it ever occur to you that if you hadn't done that to me,
I actually would have owed you one?
Maybe if you didn't humiliate me in front of the associates--
Louis, for an average attorney, 100 million is a career case.
If I'm mocking you, it means I think you're above average.
But stress balls?
You're making it too easy.
You put Trevor on the bus to the boondocks?
Yeah.
Can I ask you a question?
After all this, you really think I'm still buying the Mr. I-don't-give-a-crap thing?
Joy sent a little token of her appreciation.
She got your hair just right.
Did she ever make one of these for you?
Not that you'll ever see.

My favorite part.
You don't know the lyrics, do you?
I don't even know the lyrics, Louis.
Now, are we practicing law down here or auditioning a chorus line?
It's called esprit de corps.
And I just got a $100 million jury award overturned.
I don't have to overturn awards like that because I've never lost one in the first place.
So, what is this?
A new cologne?
Or just a hint ofjealousy?
I'm surprised you, uh, don't recognize your wife's perfume.
I know.
You're not married.
It's still funny.
You do realize we're celebrating making fat people even fatter, right?
If you wanted to do good, you should have been a fake doctor.

Yep.
My mistake is now official.

And learn the goddamn lyrics to the Harvard song, will you?
Oakhurst Capital has agreed to a $200 million licensing deal.
We are at the goal line.
How are we on brand protection?
The contract is airtight.
The only issue here is to get the Joyful Toy Company to close.
I'll go over it with Joy one-on-one.
Protocol in a meeting is to put your phone on silent.
Oh.
Uh...
If it does ring, you answer it.
Not in here.
Don't feel the need to rush back when you're done.
Who is this?
Dude, it's Trevor.
Don't hang up.
Look, I only get one call.
I'm in jail.
I tried to hop this bus at Port Authority.
I was drunk.
It's all messed up.
Look, I know we haven't talked since we fought.
But I didn't know who else to call.
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I'm going to pay you back.
Good.
Your ball cost me everything I had in the bank.
The thing is, I don't have the money.
What are you talking about?
You were clearing $10,000 a month selling weed.
It went out as fast as it came in.
Came in?
I quit.
I'm not dealing anymore.
Bullshit.
I'm serious.
After we fought, things just started to fall apart.
Jenny broke up with me.
I didn't know.
Well, I just realized I needed to make a change.
I even sold my bong.
What have you done with my friend?
You should talk.
Look at you.
You look like Gordon Gekko's little brother.
Okay.
Are you working on Wall Street, man?
Why did you call me, Trevor?
You're the one person I knew would show up.
You want to ask me for anything?
Else?
Look.
All I care about right now is keeping my record clean.
You don't happen to know any good lawyers, do you?
No.
I don't.
See the money, wanna stay for your meal
Get another piece of pie for your wife
Everybody wanna know how it feel
Everybody wanna see what it's like
I'll even eat a bean pie I don't mind
Me and missy is so early
Busy, busy making money

All step back I'm 'bout to dance

Why the rush now?
You've already wasted ten minutes of my life.
Please tell me you didn't wait ten minutes just to scold me.
I've been waiting for you to bring the paperwork down so I can close a nine-figure licensing deal.
If your phone rings while I'm talking to Ray,
I'm throwing it out of the car while it's attached to your hand.
Eddie Hope and the Mannish Boys.
1959.
Three guesses.
Guesses?
Won't be a fool no more
You insult me, Harvey.
Don't worry, we won't be late.
Okay.
What was the name of the record label?
Marlin Records.
Who covered it in the late '60s?
Ah, I want to say The Stones, but...
You need some guesses?
Oh!
Oh, my God.
Just like a private car service, huh?
Thinking you don't have to yield?
What?
Yield?
You ran a red light.
That light was yellow.
No, sir, it was not.
Are you calling me a liar?
Back off.
Mind your business, okay?
Oh, I'm minding my business.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Anyone throws a punch, I'm going to introduce you to Mr. Taser.
Trade insurance.
I'll take reports one at a time.
As much as I'd like to help you out,
I'm late for a meeting.
Oh, no.
You're not going anywhere.
I need a statement from you, too.
Here is my information.
I need you to babysit the client until I get there.
Don't mention the deal.
She asks any questions, just nod your head and look pretty.
Ms. McAfee.
I'm Mike Ross.
I work with Harvey.
Oh.
You're the protégé that he's been gushing about.
He was gushing?
Well, he mentioned that you existed.
For Harvey, that's gushing.
Uh, he's running a few minutes late today.
Car trouble.
I was just about to have tea with the girls.
Would you care to join me?
I'd love to.
Good.
And for heaven's sakes, call me Joy.
Okay, Joy.
These are the girls.
Susie, Sarah, Stacy, Sinclair, and Sabrina.
Susie, where are your manners?
Shake hands with this nice young man.
Just kidding.
I know they're dolls.
Oh.
They're named after my daughters.
I started the company because of them, really.
You know, dolls didn't used to be these cheap, plastic bimbos from China that we have today.
Your mother made them for you by hand.
I wanted my girls to have that same experience.
And here we are, thirty years later.
Every parent's worst nightmare.
What do you mean?
These little angels, they sell for $90 a pop.
I wasn't born with a butler, you know.
I've got to say, this is amazing.
Taking on a project like a licensing deal.
Why is that amazing?
Well, my grandmother could never pull this off.
She's been retired for ten years.
How is that treating her?
She lives near my apartment.
I get to see her once a week.
So...
That's very sweet of you.
No.
No, it's not.
You know, whenever I needed her, she was there.
No matter what.
She'd give me a hug.
She'd tell me everything was going to be alright.
Even if it wasn't.
And now that she needs me,
I am always at work.
And I'm...
I'm so sorry.
Yeah.
Never answer your phone in front of a client.
But it's you.
What's happening?
Well, actually, we're in the middle of a tea party.
I knew you were the doll-playing type.
Put Joy on.
Ms. McAfee.
It's Harvey.
Oh.
Oh.
Joy, I'm sorry.
I have to reschedule.
No need to apologize.
I like this one.
I'll send him back after tea.
Tell me you didn't ask our client for a doggie bag.
What can I say?
Stacy insisted.
I just got off with Joy McAfee's general counsel.
It seems she had an epiphany.
She wants less on her plate, not more.
I thought you were going to close her.
We need that doll money.
I'm on top of it.
Harvey, it took five months to structure that deal.
Please don't make me set fire to your desk.
I...
All you had to do was have tea with the dolls.
Donna, schedule another tea party with Joy as soon as possible.
And text me the names of her girls.
Oh, what a shock.
You can't keep girls' names straight in your head.
Just yours, Debbie.
See, that's funny because your name is Donna.
Harvey Specter.
I got your order right here.
I didn't order a pizza.
You've been served.
The cab driver who hit Ray named me as a witness in a civil suit.
I need to pay Travis Bickle a visit.
Harvey, if you let me go talk to Joy,
I know I can fix this.
No.
You don't send a puppy to clean up its own mess.
Optimally, you don't even have a puppy.
Ross.
Rumor has it you talked a client out of $200 million.
The deal's not off the table, all right?
It's just a speed bump.
Dude, I think we just found him a new nickname.
Speed Bump.
I feel like I'm back in high school.
They called you Speed Bump in high school?
Kidding.
But if you need any boxes to pack up your office...
Ah.
Wait a minute.
There.
I think that belongs to you.
It wouldn't hurt so much if you had thicker skin.
What do you want?
I want to pay you back for posting bail.
Trevor, you've owed me forty bucks since fifth grade.
I wrote it off.
Okay?
Look, I want a clean slate.
Okay?
So, you don't want to see me, I'll mail you a check.
Okay.
Yeah.
Let's hang out tomorrow night.
Nothing crazy, though, all right?
I have to be up early.
We can crochet pantyhose if that's what it takes to be cool.
I think we can do a little better than that.
Why don't we, uh...
Why don't we say Rex's, 7:30?
First six rounds are on me.
If you're serious about paying me back, the first hundred rounds are on you.
Oh, it's the tough guy.
This is a matter for insurance.
Not a frivolous lawsuit.
You know, for your information, I suffered emotional pain.
Emotional pain?
Rub this on your emotional pain.
You condescending son of a...
Look at me.
I am going to warn you once.
Do not pursue this matter.
You know, I have been held up at gunpoint three times.
So, do you think a fancy suit and a $500 haircut, that's going to scare me?
You take my driver to court,
I'm going to represent him myself.
And when you lose, you'll be covering my fee.
Which is going to be a hell of a lot of haircuts.
Mmm.
So you weren't a one-way fare.
Ray's worked for me eight years.
Then you don't have to worry about being a witness.
Because as his employer, you're liable for his actions.
You know, I think you've seen way too many reruns of Ally McBeal.
You know, I immigrated here after September 11.
And they shut the doors on everybody.
I couldn't pay for a lawyer, so I had to take them to court.
I sued for my citizenship.
So I have a very special appreciation for the law.
I appreciate a good single malt.
I don't pretend I can make one.
I wiped the floor with the US government, Counselor.
I'm going to do the same with you.
Ray.
Donna.
What are you doing here?
I don't have you scheduled.
Uh, I need to see Harvey.
Oh, come on.
You know the rules.
No one sets foot in there without a warrant, a Papal edict, or my say-so.
I just got named in a multi-million dollar lawsuit.
The accident wasn't my fault.
Can I get in to see Harvey, please?
Okay, say no more.
I will get you in.
You are so beautiful when you're forceful.
I know you meant that as a compliment, but I don't appreciate limitations being placed on my beauty.
Harvey.
I'm already losing money with the car in the shop.
A trial means I can't work.
And how do you think my name is going to play in front of a New York jury?
Rahim Benghazi?
I may as well buy a one-way ticket to Guantanamo.
Not going to happen.
If I lose, I won't even be able to afford a livery license, let alone my insurance.
That's why I'm going to be defending both of us.
Ray, this goes against every fiber of my being.
I'm taking your case.
Pro bono.
I don't know what to say.
Absolutely nothing.
I've got a reputation to maintain.
Besides, it's not going to take long.
Okay?
I'm going to get it dismissed.
Donna, call the court.
We need priority status on the docket.
Yeah.
I already tried.
You drew Judge Palermo.
You know what you have to do, don't you?
Yeah.
The other thing that goes against every fiber of my being.
Louis, has anyone told you you're an exquisite soprano?
What do you want, Harvey?
You're right.
Why prolong my suffering?
I need you to get me in to see Judge Palermo.
You need my help, and you're not going to pull rank on me?
Your case has nothing to do with firm business, does it?
What's it going to take?
A mani-pedi?
Tickets to Celine?
I'll see what I can do.
And your pound of flesh?
I need my back scratched, I'll let you know.
Louis, unless that's a metaphor, the deal's off.
Huh.
Joy, when I told you that my grandmother didn't have much time,
I didn't realize that she's 15 years older than you.
Now how do you know how old I am?
That is a very closely guarded secret.
I did some research.
Very resourceful.
I did it to assure myself that you can handle a heavier workload.
I appreciate that.
But I'm not worried about my health.
Is it the money?
Because I can guarantee $200 million upfront is just a tenth of what you stand to make on this deal.
Michael, my dolls eat better than most people.
I've got plenty of money.
This deal meant staying on for five more years and doubling my workload.
I am going to take my grandchildren on a cruise to Tahiti.
Tahiti?
You know the licensing agreement includes a theme park.
You could take them there.
It's not about the deal.
I have had this same view for 25 years.
I need a change of scenery.
I'm going to speak to Harvey and I'm going to tell him that I want to sell the whole business.
So I just spoke to Judge Palermo.
And because he thinks I'm a good guy and I told him I'd owe him one, your case is going to be moved up.
Way ahead.
Back scratch.
I don't have a first born, you know.
So what exactly do you want for that?
No, you're not getting one of my ties.
No.
Your shoulder?
What...
Your lapel...
Donna?
God.
Norma is going to Istanbul for two weeks.
And you know that I'm not good with temps.
My God.
Ask me for something else.
Harvey, this is non-negotiable.
You owe me now.
Donna is one thing that I can't give you.
Why not?
For one thing, she'd never agree to it.
You're her boss.
You just tell her to do stuff.
I don't tell her to do anything.
She just does.
All right, fine.
You know what?
That's just not a problem.
I will call Judge Palermo, and I'll tell him I was mistaken.
And then, your hearing will be in,
I don't know, maybe six months?
I tell you what.
If you can convince her yourself, you have my blessing.
She's going to love me so much, you're going to fight to get her back.
Hi, Donna.
Harvey and I were just talking about you.
No.
You don't even know what I was going to say.
Yes, I do.
And how is that possible?
I read lips.
I know body language.
And I talk to Norma.
I'm not some token you win at a fair, Louis.
You...
I know you're not.
You're not a token.
I'm a human being, and I just...
Yes, you are.
I'm sorry.
I just...
You know what?
That just made me feel really... cheap.
No, I'm just trying to tell you that you're really good at what you do, Donna.
So I'm going to ask you...
It's like my soul hurts now.
No.
Donna, listen.
Even if your soul hurts a little bit...
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It's going to be fine.
Don't cry.
Please don't cry, Donna.
Oh, shit.
I think I owe you one for that.
That was fun.
Wait a second.
The time that you cried and then I let your parents stay at my condo?
Yep.
So you don't want to talk about it?
What is there to talk about?
I did exactly what my boss told me not to do, and it blew up in my face.
Dude, I told you I'm taking care of this.
For my last few hours of employment, please, I should pay.
Put the wallet away.
Ooh.
Dude, this is epic.
This is the scam we always talked about.
God, I bet you're getting laid left and right.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You lose appreciation after a while.
Come on.
Why did you put a phone number on there?
It's a real firm.
Oh, yeah?
Huh.
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm just calling the employee directory.
It's part of the scam, man.
They'll check your story.
Stop it.
What?
Trevor, stop.
Hang up the phone.
No.
Trevor, hang up the phone.
Stop.
What?
All right?
I'm working there.
Oh, yeah.
What, as a lawyer?
Are you...
Dude.
It's a long story.
Okay?
But you can't tell anyone.
Ever.
Okay?
That is awesome.
Man, I always said that if you quit smoking pot, you could do it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, that's right.
Yeah, you did.
Right before you passed me the bowl.
What?
No, I just...
I wish you trusted me enough to tell me.
I mean, all I did was set you up on a drug bust.
Oh, God.
That was too soon.
I'm sorry.
Hi, ladies.
How are you?
Um, I want to let you know, if you, either of you, ever get arrested for anything, you call this guy.
He's the best attorney in the city.
What would we get arrested for?
Um...
I don't know.
What are you thinking about doing?
Uh, as your attorney,
I would definitely advise you to do that.
Uh, four more.
- Yeah.
I must warn you that representing yourself at trial is not the...
What's he doing here?
You think you can schedule a meeting without me knowing it?
Oh, no.
I'm privy to all communication between you and the court.
Well, if your driving matched your legal knowledge, we wouldn't be here.
Your Honor.
This case should be dismissed.
It's a matter for insurance.
Insurance only covers repairs.
It does not deal with my losses.
What losses?
Because of that accident, I missed my chance to get my Taxi Medallion.
Can't you just buy it next year?
The loan I got expires in one week.
On top of that, a Medallion costs $300,000 this go round.
Next year, $350,000.
So his entire claim rests upon the assumption that he would have won this year's Medallion.
The hallmark of America is that the little guy gets to see justice done.
We are all equals in the eyes of the law.
That is why, out of all the countries in the world,
I chose to come here.
What do you have to say about that, Counselor?
I say Atticus Finch makes a good speech here.
But this is a fender bender, not a multi-million dollar law suit.
Vicarious liability applies to discrimination, harassment, and accidents.
Employers are responsible for their employees' negligence.
The court finds a reasonable suit here.
Trial starts tomorrow.
Thank you, Your Honor.
You're getting a good kick out of this, aren't you?
I am.
But I'm taking this on its merits.
And you better bring your A game tomorrow, because he's got a legitimate claim.
He wants a trial, I'll give him a goddamn trial.
Your Honor.
So, how many cases have you won?
I only remember how many I've lost.
None.
Well, what happened to the drinks?
I got a better idea.
Let's say we get a bottle and take the party back to your place.
Make it a bottle of Dom, and you're on.
All right.
How about four bottles?
Come on.
You guys want to get a cab?
Definitely.
Definitely.
Cab, four bottles of Dom...
You want to spend any more of my money?
Just relax.
Okay?
It's an investment in the evening.
And, uh, I just said the thing about the bottles to get the girls out of the bar.
Really?
Because it looked like you were trying to get away from those guys.
Taxi!
What guys?
The guys in the back.
You know what I'm talking about.
Come on.
Who are they?
Look.
Those two?
I...
I...
I don't know.
Where are all the cabs?
Well, it looked like they knew you.
And not in a very good way.
I...
I don't know.
Maybe they were, uh, flirting with our dates.
Okay?
I'd be pissed, too, if I watched those legs walk away from me.
How we doing, ladies?
My feet are killing me in these heels.
- I'm sorry.
Hey.
Trevor.
Come on.
Seriously.
Taxi!
Stop playing with me.
What was that about back there?
Look, I'm not playing with you.
All right?
But just, if you play your cards right, maybe you and, uh...
Maybe Marcella will...
Maybe she'll play with you.
Okay.
Now, it's going to be a tight squeeze.
Who wants to sit on my lap?
We don't go after him?
No, we're going to get to him through this guy.
A-ha, just like the good old days, huh?
Are you kidding me?
This is way better than the good old days.
I'm actually missing a shoe.
Hey, where are we?
Uh, I think we're in Hoboken.
You wanted to see me?
Did you go to see Joy after I told you not to?
How did you know?
I didn't.
Until now.
I told you.
A puppy can't clean up its own mess.
Mess?
All I did was tell her about my grandmother.
Your job is to make my life easier.
If you can't understand that, why did I hire you?
Police report summarized.
Traffic signal analysis.
Medallion bids, attendees, and results.
That's why you hired me.
I thought you were all over the Joy situation.
Instead, you're all over page six.
You wanted me to do pro bono work.
This is it.
Pro bono enhances a firm's image.
This makes us look like wealthy bullies against an everyman cabby.
Does that seem like it enhances our image to you?
I refuse to answer that on the grounds that I don't want to.
Someone had a fun night.
Answer another call you shouldn't have?
I...
I...
I didn't...
I was...
Piece of advice.
When the big dog asks the puppy something like that, it's a rhetorical question.
Got it.
Before you go...
The phone call.
The other day when you answered it during the meeting?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about that.
It won't happen again.
Who was it?
Um, it was just a friend.
You know, an emergency.
What kind of emergency?
Um...
Was it the friend who almost got you busted for drug trafficking?
That friend?
Trevor?
He's not dealing anymore, Harvey.
So, it was him.
He called you from jail?
You know, I make a living learning how to read people, Mike.
So if I saw it, Jessica did, too.
Is that the kind of impression that you want to leave around here?
This guy is not your friend.
He is an anchor dragging you down.
Get rid of him.
He is my oldest friend, Harvey.
I wasn't just going to let him rot in jail.
What's going to happen the next time?
Because there will be a next time.
You going to bail him out?
Put yourself in jeopardy?
You know, if it weren't for Trevor, you and I never would have met.
Cut him loose.
We're here to see Mike Ross.
He's an associate.
His friend, Trevor, referred us.
Thank you.
It looked like they knew you.
And not in a very good way.
Hey!
Hey!
Excuse me.
Officer.
Is Central Park that way?
Yeah, just go right there.
I'm sorry.
I'm really terrible with direction.
Is it this street right here?
This street, yes.
Right here.
Yeah.
Okay.
Trevor, it's Mike.
Call me back.
I need to know what the hell is going on.
Did you get the red velvet cupcakes?
Yes.
Three dozen.
Extra icing.
How the hell did that happen?
Okay.
You know what?
There.
Problem solved.
I asked you how'd you get that tear.
A couple of guys came to the firm.
They were looking for me.
I don't know what they wanted, but I'm pretty sure it has something to do with some shit Trevor did.
And that big brain of yours doesn't remember me saying to cut ties with that loser?
You know what?
You've been blowing off Joy's deal all week for your friend, okay?
So, please.
First of all, Trevor is not your friend.
You want to know why I'm loyal to Ray?
I was taking a limo, and I left $3,000 in it.
Ray happened to be the driver.
He found it and tracked me down.
Not a nickel of it was missing.
And his first reaction when this accident occurred was to ask if we were okay.
Now, what would Trevor's have been?
Cut him off.
And as far as the licensing deal goes, just because you think I'm blowing something off, doesn't mean I am.
Now watch and learn.
Everything's set for you to walk away.
We're selling your stake as a block.
Your headhunter is lining up your replacement as we speak.
Well, Harvey, this was the most wonderful surprise.
You're a long-time client who wants to be with her family.
It was the least I could do.
And you'll have all the free time in the world to spend with them.
- Joey broke the lamp.
Oh, that's great.
Now, how soon can we send them home?
They're booked on the first flight out tomorrow morning.
So when you had Donna text you the girls' names...
I was talking about her daughters.
And you were going to fly them out all along.
Do you remember when I said you don't send a puppy to clean up its own mess?
Yes, Harvey.
I do.
I'm not a puppy.
Court will come to order.
Mr. Santana, your opening statement, please.
Driving a cab isn't glamorous.
But it's an honest day's work.
Ever since I started, I've looked forward to a time when I could tell customers that they were riding in my cab.
That I was an owner-operator.
So, I scrimped and I saved until I finally had enough put away to buy a Medallion.
But because of the actions of these men,
I've lost that opportunity.
So make no mistake.
This trial is not about a busted headlight.
This is a trial about a broken dream.
Forget the case.
They're going to make him President.
Statements are like free throws.
Easy.
Nobody's playing defense.
Are we good at defense?
You would agree that chauffeured drivers cause more accidents?
Objection.
Badgering.
Sustained.
Objection.
Argumentative.
Leading the witness.
Ambiguous.
Privileged.
Inflammatory.
Sustained.
Anything further, Mr. Santana?
Yes, Your Honor.
I would like to call to the stand
Mr. Michael Ross, please.
What time had you called for the limo on the morning of the accident?
We were supposed to leave at 8:30.
And what time did you get to work?
Objection.
Irrelevant.
It's highly relevant, Your Honor.
It speaks to the psychology of the driver, Rahim Benghazi.
Overruled.
Answer Mr. Santana's question.
8:40.
So unless Mr. Benghazi made up for that lost time, you were going to be late for that meeting.
Correct?
Yes.
No further questions, Your Honor.
When the accident occurred, you were on your way to the Medallion auction.
When and where was this auction to take place?
9:00 a.m., City Hall.
According to the police report, the accident occurred at 8:53 a.m.
That means you only had seven minutes to get downtown in rush hour traffic.
Objection.
Irrelevant.
I believe when I made the same objection, you told his Honor it was highly relevant.
Overruled.
You were running late.
Only the stakes for you were much higher, weren't they?
These things never start on time.
Then, why was the first Medallion sold at 9:03 a.m.?
You were scared your chance at a Medallion was going up in smoke, and you ran a red.
Then, you used the accident to paint me and Ray Benghazi as a couple of scapegoats.
You can't prove that.
What color was the light?
I take the Fifth.
You can't take the Fifth, Mr. Santana.
This isn't a criminal case.
What color was the light?
He cut me off.
You claim to love our legal system so much, answer the question.
What color was the light?
What color was the light?
Your Honor?
Answer the question, Mr. Santana.
It just meant so much to me.
Your Honor?
Can I sidebar with opposing counsel?
We can roll the dice with the jury, but I'd rather settle.
How much would I have to pay?
Nothing.
You take responsibility for the accident, and your insurance company makes Ray whole.
In return, I waive my right to collect legal fees.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
I've got a reputation to maintain.
That goes for you, too, Judge.
Damn it, Trevor.
I left you, like, five messages.
Good to know your boy's flaky with everyone.
I was taking it personal.
What do you want?
Well, Trevor owes us $50,000.
He's never paid, so you're going to bail him out.
Listen, I don't have that kind of money.
Okay?
I can't.
Well, if you're not down here in an hour with it, we're going to take it out on Trevor.
Tell him where the money is.
Whatever you do, don't show up.
Trevor.
You have one hour.
Hello?
Hello.
What do you think you're doing, leaving in the middle of a trial?
I've got some things to take care of.
You mean someone to take care of.
You never cut Trevor off, did you?
No, I didn't.
My friend's in trouble, and I'm going to help him.
You know what?
This is what addicts do.
The second they start making progress, they screw up.
Because deep down, they think it's only a matter of time until they fail.
They'd rather fall from the third floor than the penthouse.
Nothing you say can stop me.
Then tell me what the hell is going on.
He's clean.
No wires.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Remember what happened with the guy.
He was 300 pounds.
Now who did you say you were again?
Trevor's lawyer.
Trevor didn't mention a lawyer.
He doesn't know he hired me.
Come on.
Open the briefcase.
Where's the goddamn money?
That photo is a screen-shot taken from my firm's security video.
We know what you look like.
And if Mike Ross doesn't hear from me in the next five minutes, he's calling the police.
No, man.
You're not coming in here and threatening us.
You're looking at kidnapping, extortion, and drug dealing.
And the District Attorney happens to be number three on my speed dial.
Well, if we're looking at all that time, you might as well add murder.
I've got a better idea.
Retainer agreement.
If you sign right here, you'll become one of my clients.
And I won't be able to testify against you even if I wanted to.
What about the money?
This envelope contains $10,000.
Consider it a down payment on Trevor's debt.
Only here's the thing.
I don't do pro bono work.
And my retainer agreement requires a down payment of $10,000.
Now, as your attorney, my job is to give you advice.
So, here's the deal.
Sign the agreement.
I thought I said not to come.
Remember that forty bucks from the fifth grade you owe me?
If you were dead, how would I collect?
Oh, man.
I'm sorry.
I just put you in trouble just by hanging out with you.
So, why did you do it?
Because I'm a dick.
I bet you didn't think you'd have to save my ass so soon after bailing me out.
I wasn't the one who saved you.
Yeah.
Wow.
As a friend, that guy puts me to shame.
Harvey's not my friend.
Trust me.
Well, he didn't put his ass on the line because of me.
Listen, I pled you down to a misdemeanor, drunk and disorderly, and I paid the fine.
I think it might be a good idea if you got out of town for a while.
Montana.
You said you wanted a clean slate.
I figured 20 hours on a bus ought to do the trick.
Oh, yeah.
It will do me good.
Wait.
When I get back, you know who the first person I'm going to call is.
Yeah.
The one person you know who'll answer it.
For you.
What's this?
I'm very happy you took Ray on pro bono.
You, on the other hand, can afford our services.
You want me to pay me to represent me?
Mmm-hmm.
Ten hours at a $1,000 an hour.
Yeah, I'll let you do the math.
You can't be serious.
I'll tell you what I am serious about.
I hear you're finally mentoring the kid.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Really?
Because I understand that you dropped the puppy analogy on him.
Which is exactly what I used on you.
It may have slipped out by accident.
On accident, on purpose...
The really important thing is that I'm taller than you.
Yeah.
Yep.
You look much thinner in that.
You planted that story.
Be man enough to own it.
I don't traffic in the tabloids, Harvey.
But I can see how whoever planted this might find it amusing.
The great Harvey Specter bullying a humble cab driver?
I mean, it's a no-win situation, really.
Well, maybe you didn't hear.
I won the no-win situation.
Did it ever occur to you that if you hadn't done that to me,
I actually would have owed you one?
Maybe if you didn't humiliate me in front of the associates.
Louis, for an average attorney, a $100 million is a career case.
If I'm mocking you, it means I think you're above average.
But stress balls?
You're making it too easy.
You put Trevor on the bus to the boondocks?
Yeah.
Can I ask you a question?
After all this, you really think I'm still buying the Mr. I-Don't-Give-a-Crap thing?
Joy sent a little token of her appreciation.
She got your hair just right.
Did she ever make one of these for you?
Not that you'll ever see.
Starring
TIME OF HONOR
We have to find the assailants.
That's why I've brought you.
We have to transfer the jumpers to Warsaw.
Where was the drop?
The commander knew.
We have to find it.
Take it easy, were on the same side.
And now give up your weapons.
WHO ARE YOU, MADAM?
EPISODE 42
- Hello, Obersturmbannführer.
- I'd rather you let me sleep.
- Do you know what time it is?
- An SS-man has been killed.
- Do you want to see it?
- Of course I do.
Will you let me dress?
Or shall I come in my dressing gown?
I'll wait in the car.
Greetings, Warsaw.
What was the officers name?
We don't know.
The culprits took his ID.
Culprits?
Police jargon is all very well, but this is a war.
OK.
And the attack on SchöbbI?
Nothing much.
I've questioned the witnesses.
Typical police work.
They weren't amateurs.
I've been to the scene.
- It was carried out to perfection.
- I hear some admiration
- in your voice.
- Not at all, sir.
-I like to know who I'm dealing with.
-OK.
I'm waiting for your report.
I'd like to begin the questioning.
Today.
I'd like to do it personally.
Yes sir.
I'll start work on it.
Wladek.
- Asleep?
- I can't.
Me either.
Bloody bad luck, eh?
They must have known.
They were waiting with that circus.
- Will they finish us off?
- I don't know.
Not at once.
If they wanted to, we'd be dead now.
Listen, it may sound stupid... but one of has to survive.
Get it?
Writing your will, Guzik?
We'll all live.
Get that straight.
Hold on.
Here's our chance.
Get it numbered.
Obersturmbannführer.
They took everything.
Weapons, documents and money.
Even boots.
- When was he found?
- Just before 5:00.
The Polish janitor went out to sweep.
Then he informed a patrol.
Where's the janitor?
- Shot in the head.
Point-blank.
- Did he live nearby?
- German officers don't live here.
- Got drunk and lost?
- Or had a date with...
- Your theories are a fantasy.
- Can we take the body, sir?
- Yes.
And the janitor too.
We have to find out everything:
where he served; his last orders.
- I'll start right away.
- See to it.
- And keep me informed of progress.
- Of course, sir.
And one more thing.
We won't inform Governor Fischer yet.
Not until we have more information.
Let's go to headquarters.
- Thank you very much.
- Heil Hitler.
Take photographs and paint samples.
Then paint it over.
You take the photographs.
He needs help.
Help him, something's wrong.
Don't move, I tell you.
Say goodbye to the colonel.
Drop the guns.
On your knees.
On your knees!
Lock him in the store.
I knew what was up.
We're leaving in a moment.
I see you've already met Luiz.
- Do you have a name?
- I'm Romek.
Warecki.
Don't worry, Romek.
He doesn't bite.
Go ahead.
- Nice.
- He's a champion.
18 wins in one season.
Won the first race at Sluzewiec.
- And now you're cooped up here.
- Maybe hell make a comeback.
Not a chance.
The Germans run the races.
There you go.
Hey!
It's for him.
He already likes you.
That's for you.
- Someone will get you papers.
- My sister's boyfriend would do it.
- I haven't seen him for two years.
- A fighter!
You need good papers.
Without them you're dead meat.
Mr Warecki...
I want to thank you.
Put it away, you might need it.
Come on.
Get in the car, please.
- Maybe they won't kill us.
- They're separating us.
Drive.
- How long has the pain lasted?
- It began in December.
- And her legs starting swelling up.
- I don't have dementia yet, Ludwik.
- Is this the last morphology?
- Yes.
- When will I die, doctor?
- Don't worry.
You're in good hands.
I'm afraid I have to leave you.
I have some medical instructions.
Your mothers condition is serious.
Kidney failure is highly likely.
I'll just write out a prescription.
Your mother needs permanent care.
A total cure is impossible.
But we can control
- the symptoms.
- I'll do what's necessary.
- You can leave your hospital work.
- We need a specialist.
We'll find one then.
I once knew a Polish doctor, a woman.
In Switzerland.
She worked for Prof. Heddelmann in Bonn.
We met in a Warsaw hospital.
A superb specialist.
- Are you in touch with her?
- Unfortunately not.
- I heard she's in Majdanek Camp.
- Could you get her out?
An order from you would help.
We don't have those medicines here.
I'll go back to your mother.
- Janek?
- Wladek?
- You should've coped by yourselves.
- But you butted in.
Maybe someone would've freed us.
Untie them.
- Who's in command here?
- Major Krawiec.
- Colonel Rybak.
Who's that?
- Cadet Jastrzab.
- Good.
Pity their leader escape.
- We'll catch him.
Sir, our comrades freed us.
Who are you?
What's your name?
Karolina Osmanska.
- Would you recognise the assailants?
- I don't think so.
I kept low.
You were hiding?
I expect more from my soldiers.
- We were pinned down, sir.
- Mind how you address me.
- You sure you didn't see anyone?
- I saw the ones running to the car.
Have a look at these photos.
Maybe you'll recognise someone.
What?
I think I saw him.
Oh.
An old friend.
Enter.
Please wait in the corridor.
We've named the dead SS-man.
Untersturmführer Arnold Wiese, 27.
- But there's more information.
- Go on.
He'd been dead for 24 hours.
It came out of the post-mortem.
Wiese was killed the morning before.
The body was moved in the night.
The paint on the wall was still wet.
- What are the Poles up to?
- I don't know.
You said they want to scare us, sir.
They don't need to drag corpses around after the curfew.
You're right.
- What did this Wiese do?
- He was a liaison officer.
Between Berlin, Warsaw and the East.
He'd just come back from Minsk.
Yes.
Yes sir.
Yes, Governor.
We'll be right there.
Fischer knows.
It's great to see you all again.
Wladek and Michal have joined us.
What about the other paratroopers?
They're being looked after.
You've been given the same address.
- Thank you.
- The units back together again.
- There's one more thing.
- Yes.
A private matter.
We want to find our mother.
- What is it?
- Where is she?
In Majdanek.
OK.
Get up.
Out.
Out.
Number.
- 32645.
- What?
32645.
Surname.
- Konarska.
- First name.
- Maria.
- Date and place of birth.
1891, Warsaw.
Were taking her.
Let's go.
Keep it up!
Does it stink?
Your choice.
It stank in the camp.
It smells of horses here.
Get it tidied.
We've got a job to do.
New stable lad?
Pretzel seller?
Back to work, Skinny.
And you back to the manure.
Don't get too interested.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Would you come in a second.
I have some documents for you.
Important, I guess.
I had to sign.
Come in.
Through there.
What are you doing?
Don't pretend you don't know.
Stop.
I see were on first-name terms.
You wanted serious missions.
Don't embarrass yourself.
Don't be such a prude.
That one upstairs isn't your wife.
A slut!
You can drop by from time to time.
Lena.
- Are you stalking me?
- Another parcel?
- Delivery in Warsaw.
- I told you not to take risks.
They aren't serious missions.
Don't you trust me?
- I'm just afraid for our child.
- Me too.
Wait, Lena.
One of our men gets killed every day.
It's got to stop.
- Our informants say that Wiese...
- I knew him personally.
He delivered papers for me to Berlin.
I demand you catch them fast.
- They must be caught and punished.
- You have my word.
That's not enough, Rainer.
I don't want things getting worse.
I may have to downgrade you.
And you won't go back to Salonika.
- Is that totally clear?
- Yes, sir.
That means you too, Brehm.
- That's all.
You may go.
- Heil Hitler.
- Why were you being held?
- I've already told you.
We want to establish what happened.
- I was travelling to Warsaw.
- With Germans?
- Delivering documents.
- What kind?
From Pustkow Camp.
I work there.
It's legal.
I'm not paid by London.
- I'm a widow.
- Who was your husband?
- Who was your husband?
- A captain.
Killed in September.
- Are you Volksdeutsche?
- How dare you?
- You work in a German office.
- I speak good German, that's all.
Get back to that trip.
What happened?
Soviet partisans attacked us.
Took me and the documents.
Then I was interrogated - like now.
I'm sorry.
I'm tired, can I go outside?
Please.
- Be my guest.
- Thank you.
- What do you think?
- Sounds reasonable to me.
A Polish secretary with the Soviets?
They wanted to take me and her to Moscow.
But why?
We have to check her story.
We'll find her.
I'd like us to clear up a few things.
We've not know each other long.
Were policemen and in the same mess.
- I suggest we make a deal.
- A deal?
We ought to help each other.
Not just professionally.
Excuse me, I don't get it.
To avoid unpleasant surprises.
Like being sent to the Eastern front.
Right?
- Do you get it now?
- Yes.
Now I do.
- Your brandy.
- Just in time.
There you go.
To our arrangement.
- Lars.
- Wilhelm.
Know anything about your neighbour?
Nothing really.
She's called Teresa... something.
She's from outside Warsaw.
Why?
Just asking.
She's pretty, isn't she?
Yes, she is.
Very.
- Good night.
- Bastard!
Pig!
- I don't like you either.
- You know I prefer brunettes.
Enter!
Another body's been found.
Heil Hitler.
- How did he die?
- Like Wiese.
A bullet in the head.
They took his gun and documents.
And the graffiti.
- Who found the body?
- Polish policemen, an hour ago.
But he might have been here longer.
Poles prefer not to get involved.
- Who owns that Opel?
- We don't know.
Question everyone you can.
I want to see those policemen.
They may as well do it again.
Increase the number of night patrols.
And quickly before Fischer finds out.
Captain.
- I've brought Maria Konarska.
- Thank you.
Wait outside.
Yes sir.
Maria, I'm so glad you're alive.
I'm running this hospital.
I started looking for you at once.
Don't worry.
You're safe.
Sit down.
Have some water.
You'll treat the governor's mother.
I can't do any more right now.
Maria.
Look at me.
Maria.
Thank you.
I'd like to do much more for you.
Here you are.
Enter.
You wanted to see me, Herr Schwerig?
Please leave us alone.
- You take bribes.
- Excuse me?
- From workers for the Reich.
- You're joking!
Do I look like a joker?
Mrs Piontek, I wasn't born yesterday.
Every Volksdeutsche takes bribes.
It would be better if you didn't.
- Herr Schwerig...
- I do the talking.
By tomorrow...
50 women to be transported.
That's the deadline.
Otherwise you'll be joining them.
- Clear?
- Of course, Herr Schwerig.
- You've chosen a charming place.
- Let's begin.
The target is Gerard Holtz.
Fifty-two years old.
He's the boss of a blackmail gang.
They hunt Poles hiding Jews.
They co-operate with the SS but sometimes kill their victims too.
To get their valuables.
They say Holtz keeps blank German documents hidden in his flat.
That would be an amazing haul.
Which is why Janek is going with us.
He'll supply new documents.
The sentence is signed.
To be carried out at once.
Don't go in, till I signal you.
Obersturmführer Heinar Ziege.
Killed between 6 and 7 a.m. It was his Opel,
- but he was killed somewhere else.
- They moved the body again?
So it would appear.
None of our Poles know about the operation.
They're hunting officers of the same rank as Schöbbl.
- Water?
- No thank you.
Ziegl worked in concentration camps since 38.
Dachau, Buchenwald, Belzec and then Auschwitz.
He was transferred to the Totenkopf 3rd SS Armoured Division.
- Why would he be in Warsaw, then?
- He had 5 days leave.
We'll be sent to the front soon too.
You have an original sense of humour.
Last one.
- What's the score?
- Well done, Michal. 4-0.
Good to see you're staying vigilant.
- I see everyone's here.
- But no Janek.
He had to take Ruda fresh documents.
There's a more urgent task for you.
Guarding the woman we released.
- Aren't you sure about her?
- Intelligence are checking.
She's never to remain alone.
- Who's first?
- Me.
OK.
Then Michal and then Bronek.
Change every 8 hours.
Here's the password and address.
Any questions?
No.
In that case that's all.
I'm going too.
Show me that address.
Bronek.
Have you seen Ruda?
Yes.
Why?
- She's changed a little.
- Has she got someone?
I don't think so.
Janek will know more.
- So long.
- So long.
Well.
Rematch?
No.
Mrs Malgorzata Suwalska?
- Yes.
What's it about?
- Papers, please.
Close the door.
- Everything should be in order.
- Yes, of course.
Everything is in order.
This is an official work order.
You're to work in the Reich.
You can take one suitcase.
- But...
- You have two minutes.
Well.
Close the door please.
-I've come about the furniture.
-There's only a cupboard and a table.
The keys.
She's in the drawing room.
Nice bit of stuff.
Wonder how she was caught.
See you.
See you.
Latest watchdog?
- Hello.
- Or maybe an admirer?
- Flowers?
- No.
- Maybe chocolates, or...
- Forgive me, but I'm tired.
Goodbye.
Wanda.
Excuse me, excuse me.
The Germans took her.
- What?
Where to?
- Do they ever explain?
- Mum, Mum?
What's the matter?
- The Germans have arrested Wanda.
Easy, easy, we have time.
You paid for the entire night.
Who said you could use my first name?
I'm sorry.
The punters like it.
I'm not an ordinary punter.
This is an honour for you.
I understand, Herr Holtz, but don't hit me, I won't be able to work.
Go and wash.
Just don't use my towel.
Use paper instead.
What?
What?
What?
It's here.
IDs, birth certificates, passes.
Great.
Were taking everything.
Pack them up.
Careful.
What is it?
Look at it later.
- Hope they brighten up your day.
- They already have.
You were recommended by Dr. Kirschner.
I believe in your expertise.
But don't you dare to abuse my trust.
You've got very nice hair.
It would be a pity to lose it.
- What is it?
- Another body.
Why was Neumeier questioned twice?
- It's working.
- Turn it off.

Gu Ae Jeong's amazing.
All right.
It's Gu Ae Jeong versus Shin Min Ah!
what's your choice?
Gu Ae Jeong!
-This is...
-It's totally ridiculous.
Dok Go Jin's taste has changed.
let's proceed to the final round.
No one expected Gu Ae Jeong to reach the final round.
Gu Ae Jeong's reached the final round.
it's Jeon Ji Hyeon versus Gu Ae Jeong!
And your choice is?
- Gu Ae Jeong!
- Gu Ae Jeong!
Is he serious about it?
how can you...
You're Dok Go Jin's ideal type?
You must be very famous!
My gosh!
He chose Gu Ae Jeong.
her luck has improved lately.
My ideal type is Gu Ae Jeong.
We know that already.
we do.
She's not just my ideal type.
The person whom I love right now is Gu Ae Jeong.
We have a pretty sensitive question next.
I'll ask you once more.
Are you and Gu Ae Jeong mutually in love and in a relationship?
we are in a relationship where we are mutually in love.
This is ridiculous.
Are you Dok Go Jin's girlfriend?
Yes.
That man is my boyfriend.
Are they putting up a show?
What is happening?
How can this be true?
let's take a look at some data on Gu Ae Jeong.
We know that she was a member of the National Treasure Girls.
That's right.
The National Treasure Girls had a hit song called "Heartbeat".
- Dok Go Jin is really cool.
- The person who made my heart race by singing that song is Gu Ae Jeong.
it's quite hard for the public to accept.
News of your romance will probably be the focus of all the media outlets.
I'll use this opportunity to ask everyone for their blessing.
I hope that everyone will give us unconditional support.
we understand.
Where is Ae Jeong right now?
At the potato soup restaurant.
What?
Does she know that you were going to reveal the relationship?
She does not know.
She's probably in great shock right now.
It's not just Gu Ae Jeong who is in shock.
I think the entire nation is in shock right now.
we also feel that things are getting a little unbelievable right now.
That's right.
I'm very curious. especially all the female viewers.
They must all be sighing right now.
Did you know about it long ago?
I'm sorry.
We'll have to fight another battle again.
What are you doing?
Why aren't you answering the call?
What shall I say?
They had developed feelings for each other and became lovers not long ago.
We hope everyone will give them support so that their relationship can develop smoothly.
Ok.
Reporter Lee.
I wanted to call you too.
Yes.
about that?
Reporter Choi.
- They developed feelings for each other.
Of course.
they are deeply in love.
- They became lovers not long ago.
Which part of Gu Ae Jeong captured your heart?
she's pretty.
She's extremely pretty like an idol singer. and couldn't control myself like I had broken down.
I think I'd still be happy.
That's how great it is.
Gu Ae Jeong... have found.
I love you.
Dokko is Ae Jeong's present.
I've clung onto you again this time round.
I can't take back what I said.
Take responsibility for that!
This is the future that I can give you.
Accept it.
Have you caught hold of me properly now?
You've finally been properly caught hold of?
Don't try to escape and ask me to let go of you again.
Escape?
Don't even dream about it.
I'll definitely not let go.
Because you are my man
Because you are my love you still remain and make me cry
Because you are my man
It's because you are still my man
I can't hold back...
I saw potato flowers today.
Where?
There was a photo of potato flowers at the potato soup restaurant.
Do you want to see it?
How I hope our potato will flower too.
But why does it look like that?
stamped on and hit a few times.
Will it flower safely?
It'll flower if we wait.
It fits just nice.
It's beautiful.

Dok Go Jin and Gu Ae Jeong passionately in love]
[Dok Go Jin's girlfriend is Gu Ae Jeong?
Dok Go Jin's fans are astounded]
[Dok Go Jin's girlfriend is Gu Ae Jeong?
Dok Go Jin's fans are astounded]
All the reports have words like "shocked" and "astounded" in their title.
No...
Are we committing an affair or something?
Is it that shocking and astonishing that we are going out?
This is all within expectations.
Top star Dok Go Jin's girlfriend is neither Shin Min Ah nor Han Ye Seul.
It's Gu Ae Jeong. it'd be a blow to my pride.
It's great that you managed to protect your pride.
right?
What did they say?
Did they scold me? being beaten every inch of your body from hand to toe.
Feels great.
Gu Ae Jeong.
I have reliable fans who will be our protectors.
They stayed up all night when I was undergoing surgery
They are faithful fans who support me every single day.
Those fans will be able to defend us to some extent.
here.
What are you doing? too.
we'll feel slightly better.
smile.
Smile.
leave on your own accord!
it seems like they'll break up soon.
It's understandable for a fan to get jealous like that.
Tolerate that much.
This one.
I think you two look good together.
See!
My fans have unconditional trust and love for me.
I'm disappointed with you.
You're an embarrassment.
the fox.
They're also scolding you.
Are you sure these are your faithful fans?
There are also fake fans.
This is no big deal.
and is feigning a relationship with Gu Ae Jeong to hide that fact?
I have to sue all those who wrote this kind of comment!
Don't read anymore too.
It's better to just not read or listen to their comments.
leave a comment there.
Say that it's not true.
Quick!
right?
Do you want to self-destruct?
too.
and you're already reacting like this.
you were really cool on yesterday's show.
I'm envious of her.
I think your current situation is the worst possible.
This is something I've set out to do even if it means risking everything.
so just let me know.
How bad is it?
seventeen have been lost.
Which is the loyal one that still remains?
An advertisement for moneylenders.
we'll look for you. "
Something along that line.
That one is a money lending advertisement which you have never thought of doing.
those advertisements will come sticking to me again.
it'll recover.
There is no next movie.
What? right?
There isn't any now.
Those producers who used to keep calling me won't answer my calls now. didn't I say that this is the worst situation ever?
Here.
It's really beautiful.
right? and it's from the person I like best. that's for sure.
my daughter.
Aigoo.
It must be a difficult time for you.
Are you all right? since I've received a marriage proposal.
are you happy?
I am happy.
Hap... py.
you have to start preparing for the wedding from scratch now. what can they do?
Ae Jeong unni received a marriage proposal.
They'll probably be holding the wedding ceremony within this month.
Did you come deliberately just to tell me that?
you looked quite calm while watching the program yesterday.
I'm telling you all that because I think you've managed to put away your feelings.
I've almost finished putting everything away.
I've started making preparations to leave.
Are you really leaving?
I'm also going to start having activities in China regularly.
You mean you're going to China?
Yes.
I'm in this movie which has filming locations in China.
let's meet up often.
right?
Yes.
The place where I'll be is about two hours from Beijing by train.
It's really far away.
China is an extremely large country.
it'll freshen you up.
We're really sorry that it messed up the filming of the program.
It's not like Gu Ae Jeong committed a vice like gambling or adultery.
To receive a confession from someone she likes isn't messing up the filming.
Thank you for saying that.
I was worried that this incident would cause her to be fired from this program.
Viewers on the program's online message board they will not watch this program again.
This is strange.
The viewership for Gu Ae Jeong's segment on the program has doubled.
Are they watching her even as they scold her? but I'm still able to continue with my "Searching for Tastes" program.
I'm sorry.
You've got to earn some money on my behalf.
Hang in there and persevere in keeping your work.
I will. and getting to meet people as we head to the market.
The people I meet there treat me really well.
Mat Jang Geum. * ( * The Taster Jang Geum )

Are you asking me to sign on this paper?
Please sign it quickly.
Mat Jjwang Geum.
Is it ok to progress so quickly? and we ended up coming all this way.
shouldn't you put aside your worries and just follow along?
Why are you rushing like this? and the most common remark is they don't think we'll last.
To show them we're more serious than boyfriend and girlfriend.
I'll make you my wife.
[Marriage Registration Form] [Husband:

[Wife:
Gu Ae Jeong]
Know that it's an honor.
Dok Go Jin and Gu Ae Jeong have registered their marriage.
What is the public's response towards this?
We're going to find out now.
I thought they wouldn't last long.
This is really shocking.
I still cannot believe that they are getting married...
This is a crazy pairing.
I prayed for him every day when he was about to undergo the heart surgery.
I think Gu Ae Jeong and Dok Go Jin look quite well together.
What do you mean?
He looks better with Kang Se Ri.
Why is it Gu Ae Jeong?
You first revealed the relationship on the TV talk show.
Now you're even announcing a wedding.
the entire nation falls into a state of panic.
Why are you straining yourself so hard?
Only if I keep on revealing things will the arrow be directed towards me?
Things have developed as you wished.
The scandal has been mainly about you recently. but I'm really upset that people are looking down on you.
How can my Dokko be mocked by elementary school kids?
they won't be arrested.
Children of that age are rash like that.
Kim Joon Sung has won the best actor award at the International Film Festival.
Kim Joon Sung?
If only we could win the role in Director Kim Ki Wook's new movie and advance to Cannes.
I've read the script for that. it'll surely be his first step towards the red carpet at Cannes.
Kim Joon Sung will surely get the role.
It's Kim Joon Sung?
When did the photo label change?
Advertisers react the fastest.
this nickname...
This person posted a strange comment again.
die!
Die!
How dare you stick to Dokko oppa?
!
- Dokko Love]
There are people asking them to die.
There are a few people who keep posting comments asking her to die.
What kind of people are they?
Shouldn't we hunt them down and sue them?
Doing that would have the opposite effect.
Rumor has spread that the two of you are preparing for a new program.
Our company has many artistes in Candy other than Harumi.
too.
we'll accept the others too!
seems to be very talented.
Min Ki is really charming.
She's really outstanding.
I'll leave her in your care.
let's meet again during the next program.
Yes.
- Goodbye.
- Yes.
Goodbye.
There are comments saying that Dok Go Jin has shot some adult video.
That kind of rumor is bound to happen once or twice when someone is famous.
But there is indeed a video of Dok Go hyung.
Really?
Have you watched it before?
It's not the kind of video you are imagining.
- Dok Go Jin's video?
- Look at yourself.
It's this kind of curiosity that gives rise to rumors.
You must have watched a lot of porn.
How interesting.
- Oh gosh!
- It's Dok Go Jin.
It's Dok Go Jin.
Oh my!
Why are they together?
She's driving me crazy.
What's wrong with him?
It feels really odd to be together in such a crowded place.
I feel like I have to hide and conceal myself.
I revealed our relationship so we could go out like this.
it'll be too unfair.
I am the Dok Go Jin who does whatever he wants.
Oh...
Seriously!
Which movie shall we watch then?
[Phungsan Dog]
Seems like it's a story about a dog.
I like stories about dogs.
How about this?
the lead character is similar to a dog in that they both don't speak.
Let's watch this.
[Phungsan Dog]
Do they still want to behave like that despite being scolded?
I'd just stay at home.
They're trying to gain attention by getting their photos taken.
You over there...
Don't listen to them.
shouldn't I listen?
Don't listen to words that make you upset.
How about listening to me sing "Heartbeat"?
I haven't sung it to you live before.
Will you sing it for me?
sing it then.
we didn't get along
We only fought and frustrated each...
It's ok.
It's so strange.
Suddenly our hearts connected.
I miss you like crazy.
My special someone.
You scared me.
Don't hover around here and move away.
You have to be careful in front of me from now on.
I'll just go and...
Do you get it?
Dok Go Creep.
It was a fib.
I'm going to call them and tell them everything.
- Come here!
- What are you doing?
Come over!
and couldn't control myself like I had broken down.
I think I'd still be happy.
That's how great it is.
Gu Ae Jeong... have found.
Gu Ae Jeong.
I love you.
...and my eyes closed and that you'll act first to give me a hug.
Gu Ae Jeong.
You should have sung for me sooner.
[Bon Entertainment] do you remember the CD which Dok Go hyung entrusted to you before his surgery?
what about it? there are a lot of people saying ridiculous things about it.
I want to show them the video.
Dok Go Jin's video?
it does sound very exciting. there's also one which says that they shot a video together.
that rumor has been floating around.
Dok Go Jin's video.
Please lend me that video.
They must be expecting a porn video so they'll be shocked when what appears is as innocent as *Pororo.
(*A Korean cartoon character)
Have you told other people about the content of the video?
ok?
Ok.
You may leave first.
Thanks for the hard work.
Dok Go Jin's video?
It sounds exciting.
It'll succeed.
Dok Go Jin's video?
Is there really such a thing?
There's a rumor that you are in it as well.
Are you?
What did I film? the first version would be you co-playing as Sailor Moon.
I will not show you any mercy tonight.
That's just my wish!
I like that.
Why am I Sailor Moon?
What else is there?
you are holding something.
What am I holding?
A rope.
He's tied up by a rope.
I'll tie you up with a rope tonight.
How do you like that?
Gu Ae Jeong.
What are you doing it so softly?
Do it more strongly.
More strongly!
Is Dok Go Jin some sort of pervert? it'll make you even more amazed.
don't tell me!
We never shot anything like that! since he won the best actor award at the International Film Festival.
Dok Go Jin must be upset about that.
Especially since he's caught in the video rumor.
Why isn't the situation gradually improving?
bad things just keep happening.
They must want to see you completely ruined in order to feel good.
I'm here.
Are you watching the TV?
What are you watching?
Why did you switch it off?
Because it's airing something I don't want to see.
It must be Kim Joon Sung's award ceremony airing on TV.
He seems upset.
Do you want to go for a stroll?
Shall we go and get some ingredients to make kimbap for tomorrow's picnic?
No.
cling onto him.
What's the matter?
Recharge.
Aren't you upset because of Kim Joon Sung?
Why would I be upset because of him? getting scolded every day.
I'll surely go to Cannes in the future.
and show you how great I am.
Here.
I'm glad that you are still as conceited as ever.
I'm angry.
MBS is annoying me.
Why?
The program you filmed with that anyone Oriental physician was just aired on TV.
I think they're airing it on purpose.
I looked up the program schedules.
it's airing for the entire day.
Was the program you were watching Couple Making?
That's right!
Why is it aired so frequently everywhere?
Complain and make them not air it.
Sue them for infringing your portrait rights.
Did you get angry after watching that?
are you mocking me?
Why are you so happy for?
so of course I'm happy. you wore a helmet and did a really sexy dance.
Do that once in front of me.
I don't want to.
Why not?
I'll lend you the helmet which you said you wanted to borrow from me that time.
Do it explosively.
I don't want to wear the helmet now.
Do you want to wear a cap then?
The cap you signed on.
When did I sign a cap for you?
I have one.
Here!
I shall now reveal my identity.
I was the only person who supported Gu Ae Jeong in Couple Making.
I'm DK1974.
I participated regularly in the popularity polls.
That's why I even won such prizes.
The popularity polls took place during the start of Couple Making.
Did you like me even then?
Gu Ae Jeong.
Shall we put this on and go for a picnic?
To somewhere with great scenery.
let's go somewhere with great scenery.
Gu Ae Jeong.
I'm saying this since the atmosphere is becoming better.
right?
Am I right?
I won't get angry.
I won't get angry.
I won't get angry.
- So?
- Hmm...
A little...
A little what?
I won't get angry.
I won't get angry.
I won't get angry about that anyone Oriental physician.
Are you angry?
I won't get angry.
- Do I look like I'm angry?
- Are you angry?
I'm not angry.
That anyone Oriental physician.
Disappear!
That anyone Oriental physician.
It's ok.
I'm on my way to the filming location.
Where is our Mat Jang Geum heading to today?
Do you like buckwheat noodles?
just bring some back first.
I'll comment on our Mat Jang Geum's capability as a food gourmet.
I'll finish filming and return around dinner time.
Goodbye.
are those potato flowers?
our potato is flowering.
But this is not the season for potato flowers.
our potato flower is in full bloom.
what is the meaning of 'ho gu' ?
( Korean for 'pushover' )
What?
Everyone is saying that you're a ho gu.
ho gu is short for *ho rang i mok gu meong.
(*Korean for 'tiger's throat') they'll surely die.
Post this in response to the comment.
Ok.
What's the matter?
Huh?
Gu Ae Jeong.
Gu...
Dok Go Jin.
You must be very shocked.
I'm al...
Thank goodness.
Gu Ae Jeong.
Thank you.
My Dokko must have been really worried.
I wasn't just worried.
I thought my heart was going to burst and I was going to die.
Are you all right?
It's thumping too quickly.
Is it?
Quickly try your mind control.
mind control.
I'm all right now.
Those scornful comments...
They're posting them again.
I brought some things from home.
Check if there's anything else she'll need.
wait a moment.
What are you doing?
There are some people who keep posting scornful comments about Ae Jeong.
How can they say such things to a person who just had an accident?
I'll report them to the website and get those comments deleted immediately.
Are they that harsh?
Why are you...?
she could have died.]
and wishing that she'd died?
]
[Why didn't she die?
!
]
what a pity.]
[It'd be great if Dok Go Jin could make a comeback soon.]
[I don't like seeing Gu Ae Jeong.
Guess she won't show her face for the time being.]
[Is this heaven's punishment for stealing Dokko oppa?
]
just disappear!
]
I won't put up with it any longer.
Track them all down and sue them. all we'll do is give them a verbal warning before letting them off. we'll be under fire by the public again.
It's better to just let it pass and not make a fuss.
I won't let it pass!
I'll sue them and make them receive punishment.
What action will Dok Go Jin take against them?
Please let us know.
Please express a stand.
Please give us some information.
Please turn towards us.

Shin Bo Yang.
What's your name?
- I'm Go Mi Gyung.
- Go Mi Gyung.
Was there any basis for what you wrote?
I heard that you work at a large corporation.
Why did you post this kind of comment?
I'm sorry.
You've got a good career and look so refined.
Why did you do such a thing?
Why did you do that?
What's wrong with you?
What do you work as?
I'm just an office worker. we're even more speechless about the situation.
The ones who kept asking her to die are actually junior high school students.
The one who accused her of unwed pregnancy is a normal housewife.
I read from the news articles that a few are even university lecturers and employees of large corporations.
why did they do it?
Do they have some vengeance against the two of them?
[Bon Entertainment]
All of them said they wish to meet with you personally and apologize.
They said they won't do it again and asked that you let them off.
Are you going to sue them?
I understand why you're angry.
You're trying to use this opportunity to put an end to all of this so that it won't be repeated in the future.
But I'm sure you know that's impossible.
Why did they do it?
No particular reason.
They said they did it without giving it a thought.
They said they're sorry.
Just withdraw the lawsuits.
Never.
I'll sue them till the very end.
too.
what will happen to the kind Dok Go Jin people see you as?
That's why I'll just be the righteous Dok Go Jin instead.
You're lying here right now.
Is this time to worry about image?
Hyungnim!
more trouble's happened.
What again?
What's happened this time?
Dok Go Jin's video is the top search phrase.
That kind of thing doesn't exist.
This must be another prank.
it'll definitely affect them badly. those celebrities' image will plunge.
should we try to watch it then?
It's widely circulated all over already.
We can watch it right away.
Are you going to watch it?
seriously.
Shall we take a look at the hot topic for today?

Cheers!
Thank you.
congratulations. and do things like venture into Japan?
I guess I'll slowly take over those roles.
There's still a long way to go before you get to do those things.
I was a manager when I joined this management company.
I've only been tasked with handling Ae Jeong's schedule.
Our work experience is different.
I passed through the official interviews and entered the company as an official employee.
But you?
You pulled strings to enter.
I still have greater influence in the company.
Do you know that the management company is controlled by Dok Go Jin?
Dok Go Jin is my brother-in-law.
I have influence too. the person whom Dokko hyungnim trusts most is... me.
Hey.
Jae Seok.
Do you actually think that the second-in-command at the company is you?
please call me Manager Kim.
Manager Gu.
Why are the two of you fighting over this?
Just act like how you usually do.
Fight over me.
- Over me.
- Stay out of this!
stay out of this!
do you have a girlfriend?
I don't.
how old are you this year?
I think you're just the person for my daughter.
[Resume]
What is this?
so I've prepared this in advance. and send it to this address.
My mother will contact you within a week.
But...
This...
I am going to start with the acupuncture.
Please don't talk.
Here.
She's so pretty.
you're so pretty.
you're really pretty.
I'll always support you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Hello.
- Hello.
What is your name?
you're really pretty.
three.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
have they?
Yes.
We can't let this continue.
I've got to gather more friends and promote it to them.
Dok Go Jin's father-in-law is here.
I came to confirm something.
Confirm what?
I heard rumors saying that my son-in-law ate medicine from your hospital and had my granddaughter.
Did you spread this rumor? didn't they say that it was effective?
They said that it was effective in curing colds.
Did they say that it was effective in other areas?
Please don't spread this kind of rumor again.
Ok? I'll sue you for doing that!
Seriously!
Why is he so arrogant that he has a top star as son-in-law?
Don't attend to that person or give him free herbal soup in the future!
I heard that Kang Se Ri comes here often.
Give it to Kang Se Ri.
Kang Se Ri.
Give Kang Se Ri a lot of the herbal soup!
Ok.
hiking the first thing in the morning is really killing my legs.
Will Yoon Pil Joo really come here?
I confirmed it with the staff at the hospital.
it'll be obvious what we're up to.
Let's go up there before we descend.
hurry.
He's here!
Where?
Aigoo.
What should I do?
Let's go down.
I can't hike up with him.
he's heading that way.
Are you ok?
I saw you heading in that direction just now.
Did you run all the way here?
Of course you'll fall if you ran on the mountain slope.
You saw it all?
So you saw me standing there and headed this way to avoid me deliberately?
Hold my hand.
so it's not easy to climb up.
Do you still want to go by this route?
I want to.
Isn't it beautiful?
It's really beautiful.
I brought a portable gas stove and pan.
Let's have some ramyun here.
We're not allowed to cook on the mountain.
Let's just descend and cook it somewhere else.
All right?
The scenery is really beautiful.
I'm so happy to have come to such a place with you.
What is this?
What is this?
this.
What is this?
repeat after me.
goldfish.
I think Dok Go Shi Hyun is a fool.
She can't say a single word.
the intellect of a baby who is only ten months old cannot be measured using that kind of picture flip cards.
Look at me.
(Baby talk) Ga ga.
(Baby talk) Bu dik gu bi di di di dik di dik... (Baby talk) Gu gu...
Aigoo.
See?
She's a genius.
She's normal.
drink a glass of milk.
Here.
Drink a glass.
it's the milk Uncle endorses.
- [Korean Milk]
My friends only drink that milk every day.
Is that so?
and sign my autograph on the photo label.
Distribute them.
Ok. it has the same marketing effect as launching an extensive advertisement campaign.
Of course.
I am Dok Go Jin. such that I'm the number one married man whom women want to steal away.
I also top the ranking for fathers who are helpless towards their daughters.
You really drive me crazy whenever you open your mouth. did you see the article talking about us in the newspaper?
What did they write about again?
That we're facing marital discord?
That we're getting a divorce?
That we're getting a separation.
[Dok Go Jin and Gu Ae Jeong in the midst of a separation?
]
Didn't you stay at a hotel at the city's outskirts while filming your new movie?
They wrote that we've already separated for three months.
We'll have to go for a picnic again. and show ourselves to them.
I think a picnic might be too weak.
what would be better?
Celebrities with a lot of children seem to have been better received by the public recently.
ding dong!
let's start on managing our image right away.
Then I'll have to recharge your battery to full.
Recharge.
In the process of recharging.
Fully charged!

- Gu Ae Jeong?
- Yes, Gu Ae Jeong's amazing.
All right.
It's Gu Ae Jeong versus Shin Min Ah!
Ok, what's your choice?
Gu Ae Jeong!
-This is...
-It's totally ridiculous.
Seems like after he went through that life-changing event,
Dok Go Jin's taste has changed.
In any case, we got it.
Now, let's proceed to the final round.
No one expected Gu Ae Jeong to reach the final round.
- That's right.
- Yes, Gu Ae Jeong's reached the final round.
Yes, for the final round, it's Jeon Ji Hyeon versus Gu Ae Jeong!
And your choice is?
- Gu Ae Jeong!
- Gu Ae Jeong!
Is he serious about it?
Lady, how can you...
You're Dok Go Jin's ideal type?
You must be very famous!
My gosh!
He chose Gu Ae Jeong.
From the look of this, her luck has improved lately.
My ideal type is Gu Ae Jeong.
We know that already.
Yes, we do.
She's not just my ideal type.
The person whom I love right now is Gu Ae Jeong.
We have a pretty sensitive question next.
In that case,
I'll ask you once more.
Are you and Gu Ae Jeong mutually in love and in a relationship?
You're right, we are in a relationship where we are mutually in love.
This is ridiculous.
Are you Dok Go Jin's girlfriend?
Yes.
That man is my boyfriend.
Are they putting up a show?
What is happening?
How can this be true?
Yes, let's take a look at some data on Gu Ae Jeong.
We know that she was a member of the National Treasure Girls.
That's right.
The National Treasure Girls had a hit song called "Heartbeat".
- Dok Go Jin is really cool.
- The person who made my heart race by singing that song is Gu Ae Jeong.
Although you've revealed your relationship with her, it's quite hard for the public to accept.
News of your romance will probably be the focus of all the media outlets.
I'll use this opportunity to ask everyone for their blessing.
I hope that everyone will give us unconditional support.
Yes, we understand.
Where is Ae Jeong right now?
At the potato soup restaurant.
What?
Does she know that you were going to reveal the relationship?
She does not know.
She's probably in great shock right now.
It's not just Gu Ae Jeong who is in shock.
I think the entire nation is in shock right now.
Actually, we also feel that things are getting a little unbelievable right now.
That's right.
I'm very curious.
I'm sure everyone watching is very shocked, especially all the female viewers.
They must all be sighing right now.
Did you know about it long ago?
I'm sorry.
We'll have to fight another battle again.
What are you doing?
Why aren't you answering the call?
What shall I say?
They had developed feelings for each other and became lovers not long ago.
We hope everyone will give them support so that their relationship can develop smoothly.
Ok.
Yes, Reporter Lee.
Yes, yes, I wanted to call you too.
Yes.
Oh, about that?
- Yes, Reporter Choi.
- They developed feelings for each other.
Of course.
- Yes, they are deeply in love.
- They became lovers not long ago.
All right, Dok Go Jin,
Which part of Gu Ae Jeong captured your heart?
Firstly, she's pretty.
She's extremely pretty like an idol singer.
I fell in love like I was under hypnosis, and couldn't control myself like I had broken down.
Even if it ended just like this, I think I'd still be happy.
That's how great it is.
Gu Ae Jeong... is the greatest love that I, Dok Go Jin, have found.
Gu Ae Jeong,
I love you.
Dokko is Ae Jeong's present.
I've clung onto you again this time round.
Having revealed everything in the program,
I can't take back what I said.
Take responsibility for that!
This is the future that I can give you.
Accept it.
Have you caught hold of me properly now?
You've finally been properly caught hold of?
Don't try to escape and ask me to let go of you again.
Escape?
Don't even dream about it.
I'll definitely not let go.
Because you are my man
Because you are my love
After sending you away and letting go, you still remain and make me cry
Because you are my man
It's because you are still my man
I can't hold back...
Dok Go Jin, I saw potato flowers today.
Where?
There was a photo of potato flowers at the potato soup restaurant.
Do you want to see it?
How I hope our potato will flower too.
But why does it look like that?
Because it was thrown around, stamped on and hit a few times.
Will it flower safely?
It'll flower if we wait.
It fits just nice.
It's beautiful.
[Shocking!
Dok Go Jin and Gu Ae Jeong passionately in love]
[Dok Go Jin's girlfriend is Gu Ae Jeong?
Dok Go Jin's fans are astounded]
[Dok Go Jin's girlfriend is Gu Ae Jeong?
Dok Go Jin's fans are astounded]
All the reports have words like "shocked" and "astounded" in their title.
No...
Are we committing an affair or something?
Is it that shocking and astonishing that we are going out?
This is all within expectations.
Top star Dok Go Jin's girlfriend is neither Shin Min Ah nor Han Ye Seul.
It's Gu Ae Jeong.
If they accepted it without feeling shocked, from my perspective, it'd be a blow to my pride.
It's great that you managed to protect your pride.
They've also posted a lot of comments on the reports, right?
What did they say?
Did they scold me?
It's better not to see them.
It feels like you've received a massage, being beaten every inch of your body from hand to toe.
Feels great.
But don't worry, Gu Ae Jeong.
I have reliable fans who will be our protectors.
They stayed up all night when I was undergoing surgery
They are faithful fans who support me every single day.
Those fans will be able to defend us to some extent.
Ok, here.
What are you doing?
If I post this up, fans who like me will post their reactions, too.
When we see that, we'll feel slightly better.
Now, smile.
Gu Ae Jeong, smile.
Smile.
Gu Ae Jeong, if you still have a conscience, leave on your own accord!
Even if we don't take action, it seems like they'll break up soon.
It's understandable for a fan to get jealous like that.
Tolerate that much.
This one.
I think you two look good together.
See!
My fans have unconditional trust and love for me.
Dok Go Jin, I'm disappointed with you.
You're an embarrassment.
The pitiful Dok Go Jin is seduced by Gu Ae Jeong, the fox.
They're also scolding you.
Are you sure these are your faithful fans?
There are also fake fans.
This is no big deal.
Did Dok Go Jin lose his sexual ability after the heart surgery, and is feigning a relationship with Gu Ae Jeong to hide that fact?
I have to sue all those who wrote this kind of comment!
Don't read anymore too.
It's better to just not read or listen to their comments.
Gu Ae Jeong, leave a comment there.
Say that it's not true.
Quick!
Hey, hey, hey, it's not true, right?
Do you want to self-destruct?
You have to get your senses together, too.
It's just starting, and you're already reacting like this.
Dokko, you were really cool on yesterday's show.
As a woman, although it may feel like Gu Ae Jeong's quite shameless,
I'm envious of her.
However, as the representative of the management company,
I think your current situation is the worst possible.
This is something I've set out to do even if it means risking everything.
All right, I've prepared myself for it, so just let me know.
How bad is it?
Of the eighteen advertisements that came to us, seventeen have been lost.
Which is the loyal one that still remains?
An advertisement for moneylenders.
" When you're going through the lowest point in life, we'll look for you. "
Something along that line.
That one is a money lending advertisement which you have never thought of doing.
Once my image recovers, those advertisements will come sticking to me again.
If my next movie becomes a hit, it'll recover.
There is no next movie.
What?
Even if the Cannes movie is lost, there are still many other scripts, right?
There isn't any now.
Those producers who used to keep calling me won't answer my calls now.
Dokko, didn't I say that this is the worst situation ever?
Here.
It's really beautiful.
Ae Jeong, I'll have to congratulate you now, right?
Unni, I've received a marriage proposal, and it's from the person I like best.
I don't care about what other people say, but my family has to congratulate me, that's for sure.
Congratulations, my daughter.
Aigoo.
It must be a difficult time for you.
Are you all right?
Father, please ask me if I'm happy, since I've received a marriage proposal.
Ae Jeong, are you happy?
Yeah, I am happy.
Hap... py.
Ae Jeong, you have to start preparing for the wedding from scratch now.
No matter what other people say now, once you two get married, what can they do?
Ae Jeong unni received a marriage proposal.
They'll probably be holding the wedding ceremony within this month.
Did you come deliberately just to tell me that?
Well, you looked quite calm while watching the program yesterday.
I'm telling you all that because I think you've managed to put away your feelings.
I've almost finished putting everything away.
I've started making preparations to leave.
Are you really leaving?
I'm also going to start having activities in China regularly.
You mean you're going to China?
Yes.
I'm in this movie which has filming locations in China.
Well, since we'll be close by each other, let's meet up often.
You'll be staying in Beijing, right?
Yes.
The place where I'll be is about two hours from Beijing by train.
It's really far away.
China is an extremely large country.
Drink this, it'll freshen you up.
We're really sorry that it messed up the filming of the program.
It's not like Gu Ae Jeong committed a vice like gambling or adultery.
To receive a confession from someone she likes isn't messing up the filming.
Thank you for saying that.
I was worried that this incident would cause her to be fired from this program.
Viewers on the program's online message board say that if Ae Jeong is not fired from the program, they will not watch this program again.
This is strange.
The viewership for Gu Ae Jeong's segment on the program has doubled.
Are they watching her even as they scold her?
You got fired from the advertisements and the movie offers, but I'm still able to continue with my "Searching for Tastes" program.
I'm sorry.
You've got to earn some money on my behalf.
Hang in there and persevere in keeping your work.
I will.
I like that program very much.
I like working with my colleagues, and getting to meet people as we head to the market.
The people I meet there treat me really well.
They call me Mat Jang Geum, Mat Jang Geum. * ( * The Taster Jang Geum )
Mat Jjang* Geum?
( * best ) Is she Dae Jang Geum's friend?
"Dae Jang Geum" means "The Great Jang Geum", a fictional Korean cook and the King's first female physician.
You can call her one of the imitations of Dae Jang Geum* .
The Mat Jang Geum who is better than Dae Jang Geum in searching for good food.
Oh, Mat Jjwang* Geum.
( *Jjwang is a colloquial expression for "awesome" )
The great Mat Jjwang Geum, please give me an autograph.
All right then.
[Marriage Registration Form]
[Marriage Registration Form]
Here.
Are you asking me to sign on this paper?
Please sign it quickly.
Mat Jjwang Geum.
Is it ok to progress so quickly?
When I first met you,
I gave you an autograph without much thought, and we ended up coming all this way.
Mat Jang Geum, shouldn't you put aside your worries and just follow along?
Why are you rushing like this?
I studied the public's reactions, and the most common remark is they don't think we'll last.
To show them we're more serious than boyfriend and girlfriend.
I'll make you my wife.
[Marriage Registration Form] [Husband:
Dok Go Jin]
You've already signed it?
When you first gave me your autograph back then, you told me not to hover around and to go away.
Because you didn't go away but instead, hovered around steadily, congratulations for becoming Dok Go Jin's wife.
There are many things to prepare for the wedding ceremony, so let's start off with registering our marriage, ok?
Here.
[Husband:
Dok Go Jin]
[Wife:
Gu Ae Jeong]
Know that it's an honor.
Dok Go Jin and Gu Ae Jeong have registered their marriage.
What is the public's response towards this?
We're going to find out now.
I thought they wouldn't last long.
This is really shocking.
I still cannot believe that they are getting married...
This is a crazy pairing.
I prayed for him every day when he was about to undergo the heart surgery.
I think Gu Ae Jeong and Dok Go Jin look quite well together.
What do you mean?
He looks better with Kang Se Ri.
Why is it Gu Ae Jeong?
You first revealed the relationship on the TV talk show.
Now you're even announcing a wedding.
Every time you reveal something, the entire nation falls into a state of panic.
Why are you straining yourself so hard?
Only if I keep on revealing things will the arrow be directed towards me?
Things have developed as you wished.
The scandal has been mainly about you recently.
I can put up with those scandals and rumors, but I'm really upset that people are looking down on you.
How can my Dokko be mocked by elementary school kids?
Even if I sued those elementary school kids, they won't be arrested.
Children of that age are rash like that.
While you're going through all these,
Kim Joon Sung has won the best actor award at the International Film Festival.
Kim Joon Sung?
If only we could win the role in Director Kim Ki Wook's new movie and advance to Cannes.
I've read the script for that.
No matter who takes that role, it'll surely be his first step towards the red carpet at Cannes.
Since you're not doing it, Kim Joon Sung will surely get the role.
It's Kim Joon Sung?
When did the photo label change?
Advertisers react the fastest.
Oh gosh, this nickname...
This person posted a strange comment again.
[Die, Gu Ae Jeong, die!
Die!
How dare you stick to Dokko oppa?
!
- Dokko Love]
There are people asking them to die.
There are a few people who keep posting comments asking her to die.
What kind of people are they?
Shouldn't we hunt them down and sue them?
Doing that would have the opposite effect.
Rumor has spread that the two of you are preparing for a new program.
Our company has many artistes in Candy other than Harumi.
Please include the rest in the show, too.
Ok, if Harumi agrees to participate in it, we'll accept the others too!
One of the members, Min Ki, seems to be very talented.
Min Ki is really charming.
She's really outstanding.
I'll leave her in your care.
Ok, let's meet again during the next program.
Yes.
- Goodbye.
- Yes.
Goodbye.
There are comments saying that Dok Go Jin has shot some adult video.
That kind of rumor is bound to happen once or twice when someone is famous.
But there is indeed a video of Dok Go hyung.
Really?
Have you watched it before?
It's not the kind of video you are imagining.
- Dok Go Jin's video?
- Look at yourself.
It's this kind of curiosity that gives rise to rumors.
You must have watched a lot of porn.
How interesting.
- Oh gosh!
- It's Dok Go Jin.
It's Dok Go Jin.
Oh my!
Why are they together?
She's driving me crazy.
What's wrong with him?
It feels really odd to be together in such a crowded place.
I feel like I have to hide and conceal myself.
I revealed our relationship so we could go out like this.
If we can't even do this, it'll be too unfair.
I am the Dok Go Jin who does whatever he wants.
Oh...
Seriously!
Which movie shall we watch then?
[Phungsan Dog]
Seems like it's a story about a dog.
I like stories about dogs.
How about this?
Well, the lead character is similar to a dog in that they both don't speak.
Let's watch this.
[Phungsan Dog]
Do they still want to behave like that despite being scolded?
If it was me, I'd just stay at home.
They're trying to gain attention by getting their photos taken.
You over there...
Don't listen to them.
Since they're doing that so I can hear, shouldn't I listen?
Don't listen to words that make you upset.
How about listening to me sing "Heartbeat"?
I haven't sung it to you live before.
Will you sing it for me?
Ok, sing it then.
At first, we didn't get along
We only fought and frustrated each...
It's ok.
It's so strange.
Suddenly our hearts connected.
When you're not around, I miss you like crazy.
My special someone.
You scared me.
Don't hover around here and move away.
You have to be careful in front of me from now on.
I'll just go and...
Do you get it?
Dok Go Creep.
It was a fib.
I'm going to call them and tell them everything.
- Come here!
- What are you doing?
Come over!
I fell in love like I was under hypnosis, and couldn't control myself like I had broken down.
Even if it ended just like this, I think I'd still be happy.
That's how great it is.
Gu Ae Jeong is the greatest love that I, Dok Go Jin, have found.
Gu Ae Jeong.
I love you.
...and my eyes closed and that you'll act first to give me a hug.
You sang it well, Gu Ae Jeong.
You should have sung for me sooner.
[Bon Entertainment]
Representative Moon, do you remember the CD which Dok Go hyung entrusted to you before his surgery?
Yes, what about it?
Because of the rumor about his video, there are a lot of people saying ridiculous things about it.
I want to show them the video.
Dok Go Jin's video?
When said in such a way, it does sound very exciting.
Among the rumors surrounding the two of them, there's also one which says that they shot a video together.
Yeah, that rumor has been floating around.
Dok Go Jin's video.
Please lend me that video.
They must be expecting a porn video so they'll be shocked when what appears is as innocent as *Pororo.
(*A Korean cartoon character)
Have you told other people about the content of the video?
Don't tell them, ok?
Ok.
You may leave first.
Thanks for the hard work.
Dok Go Jin's video?
It sounds exciting.
It'll succeed.
Dok Go Jin's video?
Is there really such a thing?
There's a rumor that you are in it as well.
Are you?
What did I film?
If we were to select the top three rumors surrounding Dok Go Jin's video, the first version would be you co-playing as Sailor Moon.
Dok Go Jin, in the name of love and righteousness,
I will not show you any mercy tonight.
That's just my wish!
I like that.
Why am I Sailor Moon?
What else is there?
In the second version, you are holding something.
What am I holding?
A rope.
He's tied up by a rope.
Dok Go Jin,
I'll tie you up with a rope tonight.
How do you like that?
I like that, Gu Ae Jeong.
What are you doing it so softly?
Do it more strongly.
More strongly!
Is Dok Go Jin some sort of pervert?
As for the third version, it'll make you even more amazed.
Unni, don't tell me!
We never shot anything like that!
In any case, the focus is now on Kim Joon Sung, since he won the best actor award at the International Film Festival.
Dok Go Jin must be upset about that.
Especially since he's caught in the video rumor.
Why isn't the situation gradually improving?
Instead, bad things just keep happening.
They must want to see you completely ruined in order to feel good.
I'm here.
Are you watching the TV?
What are you watching?
Why did you switch it off?
Because it's airing something I don't want to see.
It must be Kim Joon Sung's award ceremony airing on TV.
He seems upset.
Do you want to go for a stroll?
Shall we go and get some ingredients to make kimbap for tomorrow's picnic?
No.
Gu Ae Jeong, cling onto him.
What's the matter?
Recharge.
Aren't you upset because of Kim Joon Sung?
Why would I be upset because of him?
He received a much coveted award, but you're stuck here with me, getting scolded every day.
I'll surely go to Cannes in the future.
I'll bring you there too, and show you how great I am.
Here.
I'm glad that you are still as conceited as ever.
I'm angry.
MBS is annoying me.
Why?
The program you filmed with that anyone Oriental physician was just aired on TV.
I think they're airing it on purpose.
I looked up the program schedules.
If you combined the airtime here and there, it's airing for the entire day.
Was the program you were watching Couple Making?
That's right!
Why is it aired so frequently everywhere?
Complain and make them not air it.
Sue them for infringing your portrait rights.
Did you get angry after watching that?
What, are you mocking me?
Why are you so happy for?
No, you got jealous because you like me, so of course I'm happy.
I was watching the program, and in order to impress the Oriental physician, you wore a helmet and did a really sexy dance.
Do that once in front of me.
I don't want to.
Why not?
I'll lend you the helmet which you said you wanted to borrow from me that time.
Do it explosively.
I don't want to wear the helmet now.
Do you want to wear a cap then?
The cap you signed on.
When did I sign a cap for you?
I have one.
Here!
I shall now reveal my identity.
I was the only person who supported Gu Ae Jeong in Couple Making.
I'm DK1974.
I participated regularly in the popularity polls.
That's why I even won such prizes.
The popularity polls took place during the start of Couple Making.
Did you like me even then?
Gu Ae Jeong.
Shall we put this on and go for a picnic?
To somewhere with great scenery.
All right, let's go somewhere with great scenery.
Gu Ae Jeong.
I'm saying this since the atmosphere is becoming better.
You didn't have any feelings for that anyone Oriental physician back then, right?
Am I right?
It's ok, I won't get angry.
I won't get angry.
I won't get angry.
- So?
- Hmm...
A little...
A little what?
I won't get angry.
I won't get angry.
I won't get angry about that anyone Oriental physician.
Are you angry?
I won't get angry.
- Do I look like I'm angry?
- Are you angry?
No, I'm not angry.
That anyone Oriental physician.
Disappear!
That anyone Oriental physician.
It's ok.
Yes, I'm on my way to the filming location.
Where is our Mat Jang Geum heading to today?
Do you like buckwheat noodles?
Yeah, just bring some back first.
After I've tasted it,
I'll comment on our Mat Jang Geum's capability as a food gourmet.
I'll finish filming and return around dinner time.
Goodbye.
Hey, are those potato flowers?
Yes, our potato is flowering.
But this is not the season for potato flowers.
No, our potato flower is in full bloom.
Ahjussi, what is the meaning of 'ho gu' ?
( Korean for 'pushover' )
What?
Everyone is saying that you're a ho gu.
Ding Dong, ho gu is short for *ho rang i mok gu meong.
(*Korean for 'tiger's throat')
If they get trapped in there, they'll surely die.
Post this in response to the comment.
Ok.
What's the matter?
Huh?
Gu Ae Jeong.
Gu...
Dok Go Jin.
You must be very shocked.
I'm al...
Thank goodness.
Thank you, Gu Ae Jeong.
Thank you.
My Dokko must have been really worried.
I wasn't just worried.
I thought my heart was going to burst and I was going to die.
Are you all right?
It's thumping too quickly.
Is it?
Quickly try your mind control.
Oh, mind control.
I'm all right now.
Those scornful comments...
They're posting them again.
I brought some things from home.
Check if there's anything else she'll need.
Got it, wait a moment.
What are you doing?
There are some people who keep posting scornful comments about Ae Jeong.
How can they say such things to a person who just had an accident?
I'll report them to the website and get those comments deleted immediately.
Are they that harsh?
Why are you...?
[What a pity, she could have died.]
[Do you think Dok Go Jin is also regretting it, and wishing that she'd died?
]
[Why didn't she die?
!
]
[We could have sent her off at one go via the accident, what a pity.]
[It'd be great if Dok Go Jin could make a comeback soon.]
[I don't like seeing Gu Ae Jeong.
Guess she won't show her face for the time being.]
[Is this heaven's punishment for stealing Dokko oppa?
]
[Isn't this the curse from Dok Go Jin's fans?
] [Gu Ae Jeong, just disappear!
]
I won't put up with it any longer.
Track them all down and sue them.
Even if we tracked them down, all we'll do is give them a verbal warning before letting them off.
If we resort to taking legal action against them, we'll be under fire by the public again.
It's better to just let it pass and not make a fuss.
I won't let it pass!
I'll sue them and make them receive punishment.
What action will Dok Go Jin take against them?
Please let us know.
Please express a stand.
Please give us some information.
Please turn towards us.
[Notice of lawsuit]
I'm Shin Bo Yang.
Shin Bo Yang.
What's your name?
- I'm Go Mi Gyung.
- Go Mi Gyung.
Was there any basis for what you wrote?
I heard that you work at a large corporation.
Why did you post this kind of comment?
I'm sorry.
You've got a good career and look so refined.
Why did you do such a thing?
Why did you do that?
What's wrong with you?
What do you work as?
I'm just an office worker.
After tracking them down, we're even more speechless about the situation.
The ones who kept asking her to die are actually junior high school students.
The one who accused her of unwed pregnancy is a normal housewife.
I read from the news articles that a few are even university lecturers and employees of large corporations.
Seriously, why did they do it?
Do they have some vengeance against the two of them?
[Bon Entertainment]
All of them said they wish to meet with you personally and apologize.
They said they won't do it again and asked that you let them off.
Are you going to sue them?
I understand why you're angry.
You're trying to use this opportunity to put an end to all of this so that it won't be repeated in the future.
But I'm sure you know that's impossible.
Why did they do it?
No particular reason.
They said they did it without giving it a thought.
They said they're sorry.
Just withdraw the lawsuits.
Never.
I'll sue them till the very end.
I'll continue to sue anyone who does it in the future, too.
Then, what will happen to the kind Dok Go Jin people see you as?
That's why I'll just be the righteous Dok Go Jin instead.
You're lying here right now.
Is this time to worry about image?
Hyungnim!
Erm, more trouble's happened.
What again?
What's happened this time?
Dok Go Jin's video is the top search phrase.
That kind of thing doesn't exist.
This must be another prank.
Whether it's real or not, once news of it spreads, it'll definitely affect them badly.
Even when photo-shopped nude photos of female celebrities get circulated, those celebrities' image will plunge.
Aigoo, should we try to watch it then?
It's widely circulated all over already.
We can watch it right away.
Are you going to watch it?
I'm going crazy, seriously.
Shall we take a look at the hot topic for today?
It says Dok Go Jin's video here.
- Where?
- Over here, over here.
- Search that phrase.
- Ok.
- Search that phrase.
- Dok Go Jin's video.
It says Dok Go Jin's video here.
Come quickly.
- Dok Go Jin!
- Dok Go Jin?
Have you watched this video?
Which one?
Where, where?
It's all over the internet, come and watch it quickly!
- Dok Go Jin.
- Over here, over here.
What's this?
It's the hottest thing right now.
Is that so?
What is it about?
Did he really film it?
[Dok Go Jin's video]
[Dok Go Jin's video]
If this video is made public, the heart surgery most probably has failed, and I'm no longer of this world.
To the many of you who loved me,
I wish to entrust to you the person I loved.
In a way,
I received love from many of you because I, Dok Go Jin, was very well-managed.
On the other hand, the woman I loved was disliked by many of you due to all sorts of misunderstanding.
But if you get to know her, she, Gu Ae Jeong, is a very good woman.
Because she'll receive scorn and be misunderstood no matter what she does,
I'm leaving this as evidence.
Dok Go Jin truly loved Gu Ae Jeong.
Please watch over her so that she won't be scorned or misunderstood.
I'm asking this favor from all of you.
This...
I left this just in case something happened.
But the 'just in case' didn't happen, so why are you watching this?
That's true.
Whether you live or die, you'll still confess your love for me.
Just how much do you like me?
Know that it's an honor.
Don't forget me
Even if I only lived for a second
I'll be the one and only heart who loves you
For that one and only, I've concealed sorrowful tears and left
So please remember me
Gu Ae Jeong.
Representative, Representative.
The number of viewers for Dok Go hyungnim's video has now exceeded a hundred million.
It means that many people have seen Dok Go Jin's real feelings.
Many more people must have heard of it, too.
But then... why did talk about Dok Go hyungnim's video spread so quickly?
Isn't it a bit strange?
Is it?
I catch the smell of oil being added to fuel the fire.
The smell is really strong.
Watch me and learn, Kim Jae Seok.
Moon Jin Young is the best image maker in showbiz.
Thanks everyone.
Since the National Treasure Girls disbanded, this is the first time we're linked together in good news.
There was an article saying that although the National Treasure Girls have disbanded, the sense of loyalty, which is as valuable as a national treasure, has gathered again.
Have you read it?
Seriously speaking, it was a tough decision for me to be your bridesmaid.
With me agreeing to be your bridesmaid, you won't be scolded that harshly by fans.
- You're right.
- That's right.
You did something great, Kang Se Ri.
But then, Mi Na, what made you change your mind and return to Korea to be her bridesmaid?
That's the least I should do.
Are there a lot of reporters outside?
Of course.
Dok Go Jin called them, and the whole bunch of them came.
But seriously!
Why are all the bridesmaid's dresses so old fashioned?
This looks like what we wore when we were in National Treasure Girls.
Sorry about that.
Hey!
Shall we meet up occasionally?
It'll be fun if we form an informal group!
I am a top star.
Yeah, you're great.
Well, since you rose to the top position through the National Treasure Girls,
I'm also a little proud of you.
Of course you should.
I was the key member of the National Treasure Girls.
If you acknowledge that,
I'll consider joining your informal group.
Let's have some snacks.
Aigoo.
I bought this.
What is it?
Clover.
Do you remember?
We have to share the good fortune so that all things good will happen to us.
Here.
One, two, three.
It's tasty.
It's really tasty!
- It tastes the same as before.
- Yes.
It was also tasty back then.
I love this...
Memories from the past are coming back.
- You can't eat this.
- Ae Jeong unni, you can't eat it.
What if you can't fit into the gown?
Which gown are you wearing?
- Really.
- Definitely you can't.
- You won't be able to fit in if you eat this.
- Unni, wear the gown for us to take a look.
Gu Ae Jeong,
I see you on the news every day.
- You're getting married, right?
- Yes.
Aigoo, congratulations.
Thank you.
Go your way.
Goodbye.
Gu Ae Jeong.
It's been a while.
Seems like your leg is ok now.
Yes.
This time round, it has healed nicely without any lingering pain.
I took your advice and paid more attention to it, so it healed nicely.
I'm glad that it's not painful for you anymore.
It's not painful anymore.
I'm glad to see Nina smiling like this at the end.
I'm leaving for my studies in a few days.
Oh...
Are you going this time?
I'm not using it as an excuse or as an escape this time.
I'm joining a research institute which I really want to be a part of.
That's a great thing for you since you find studying easy and enjoyable.
I...
Can you do me a favor for the last time?
Please press at my Shin Jung* acupoint.
(*In ep. 4, Yoon Pil Joo said pressing this point helped soothe heartache)
Here?
Now, I've really put away all that had happened and calmed down.
Thank you for everything.
Thanks to you, the feeling of my heart racing as I entered into a really strange world,
is now imprinted here.
If I try to take it out sometimes, it'll probably hurt a little.
But it'll all be washed away one day.
Yoon Pil Joo...
I'm really thankful for your feelings towards me.
Hearing those words from you makes me happy.
Said to be the wedding ceremony of the century,
Dok Go Jin and Gu Ae Jeong's wedding is about to start.
We are now in front of the hotel where the wedding is being held.
Although the wedding ceremony is closed to the public, the groom and the bride will come out and say a few words to their fans before the ceremony starts.
Let's take a look at the wedding gown that Gu Ae Jeong is wearing at the wedding ceremony of Dok Go Jin and Gu Ae Jeong, one of showbiz's most talked-about couple.
Contrary to expectations, Gu Ae Jeong will be wearing a wedding gown designed by a local designer.
Let's take a look at the scene right now.
Why is it so tiring?
It's draining all my energy before the wedding ceremony.
It was difficult and exhausting to get to this stage, right?
But thanks to my excellent charger, my battery didn't die, and I managed to gain energy to come to this stage.
I'll also sing you a song of encouragement.
Shall I also show you a song of encouragement to give you energy?
What?
Here, look at this.
What is this?
A song of encouragement from fans around the world.
From fans?
Yeah.
You're no longer the Gu Ae Jeong who's disliked by people no matter what you do.
There are also many people sending us their blessings.
Gu Ae Jeong.
We conquered it.
Conquered.
You did that well.
Dok Go Jin, Gu Ae Jeong,
Congratulations on your marriage.
Please be happy.
I love the both of you!
Congratulations on your marriage.
- Hello.
- Be happy.
We love you so much.
Dok Go Jin, Gu Ae Jeong,
Congratulations.
All right, we'll have another round of shots.
Great.
Look here.
Please show the hand phone.
Please give another pose.
Ok.
Once more.
One more.
Yes.
- Great job.
- Ok.
- Thanks for the hard work.
- Thanks for the hard work.
- Thanks for the hard work.
- Thanks for the hard work.
- Thanks for the hard work.
- Thanks for the hard work.
Hyungnim, you looked really cool today.
Don't say such unnecessary things...
Thank you!
Hyungnim, Ginny said she wants to buy you dinner.
I'm going back first.
You take my place and enjoy dinner.
We can leave together.
Are you in a rush?
Yeah, I'm rushing to do something very urgent.
You poor youth.
Ok.
Ah, is that Dok Go Jin?
It's Dok Go Jin.
Dok Go Jin, Dok Go Jin!
Please look here!
Excuse me, please look here!
Because of you my chest, my heart goes "thump"...
Hello, Director?
Yes, I've looked at the script.
Yes, I'm going to the studio now.
Ok.
I'm going for a shoot.
I might be back late.
Ok?
The image that Dokko needs right now is the image of a warm, approachable family-oriented man.
So look for a way to build up that image.
Ok, we got it.
Representative,
I heard that one of cable programs on infant care is looking for a new host.
It'll be great if Ae Jeong noonim gets that role.
Good!
We have to catch hold of this opportunity.
Manager Kim Jae Seok, great job.
Ma-Manager?
Yes.
Manager Kim.
Ma-Manager?
You...
You mean me?
Oh!
Thank you, Representative!
Thank you!
I'm Manager Kim, I'm Manager Kim!
You're so dead.
Cheers!
Thank you.
Jae Seok, congratulations.
In that case, you'll be able to talent scout fresh faces, and do things like venture into Japan?
I guess I'll slowly take over those roles.
There's still a long way to go before you get to do those things.
I was a manager when I joined this management company.
But up till now, I've only been tasked with handling Ae Jeong's schedule.
Our work experience is different.
I passed through the official interviews and entered the company as an official employee.
But you?
You pulled strings to enter.
Although I pulled strings, I still have greater influence in the company.
Do you know that the management company is controlled by Dok Go Jin?
Dok Go Jin is my brother-in-law.
If you want to put it that way, I have influence too.
Other than Representative Moon, the person whom Dokko hyungnim trusts most is... me.
Hey.
Jae Seok.
Do you actually think that the second-in-command at the company is you?
In the future, please call me Manager Kim.
Manager Gu.
Why are the two of you fighting over this?
Just act like how you usually do.
Fight over me.
- Over me.
- Stay out of this!
Noona, stay out of this!
Doctor, do you have a girlfriend?
I don't.
My God, how old are you this year?
I think you're just the person for my daughter.
[Resume]
What is this?
Many people asked me about it, so I've prepared this in advance.
Fill in your daughter's details at the back of this, and send it to this address.
My mother will contact you within a week.
But...
This...
I am going to start with the acupuncture.
Please don't talk.
Here.
She's so pretty.
Unni, you're so pretty.
Unni, you're really pretty.
I'll always support you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Hello.
- Hello.
What is your name?
Noona, you're really pretty.
One, two, three.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
The Kong Jin Pills haven't been selling well recently, have they?
Yes.
We can't let this continue.
I've got to gather more friends and promote it to them.
My God, Dok Go Jin's father-in-law is here.
I came to confirm something.
Confirm what?
I heard rumors saying that my son-in-law ate medicine from your hospital and had my granddaughter.
Did you spread this rumor?
No, I mean, the herbal soup I gave them for free the last time, didn't they say that it was effective?
They said that it was effective in curing colds.
Did they say that it was effective in other areas?
Please don't spread this kind of rumor again.
Ok?
If it spoils my daughter and my son-in-law's image,
I'll sue you for doing that!
Seriously!
Why is he so arrogant that he has a top star as son-in-law?
Don't attend to that person or give him free herbal soup in the future!
I heard that Kang Se Ri comes here often.
Give it to Kang Se Ri.
Kang Se Ri.
Give Kang Se Ri a lot of the herbal soup!
Ok.
Unni, hiking the first thing in the morning is really killing my legs.
Will Yoon Pil Joo really come here?
I confirmed it with the staff at the hospital.
Hey, if we just stand here, it'll be obvious what we're up to.
Let's go up there before we descend.
Hurry, hurry.
He's here!
Where?
Aigoo.
What should I do?
Let's go down.
No, if I start to descend, I can't hike up with him.
Unni, he's heading that way.
Are you ok?
I saw you heading in that direction just now.
Did you run all the way here?
Of course you'll fall if you ran on the mountain slope.
You saw it all?
So you saw me standing there and headed this way to avoid me deliberately?
Hold my hand.
This route is steep and rough, so it's not easy to climb up.
Do you still want to go by this route?
Yes, I want to.
Isn't it beautiful?
It's really beautiful.
Yoon Pil Joo, I brought a portable gas stove and pan.
Let's have some ramyun here.
We're not allowed to cook on the mountain.
Let's just descend and cook it somewhere else.
All right?
The scenery is really beautiful.
I'm so happy to have come to such a place with you.
What is this?
What is this?
Read it, this.
What is this?
Shi Hyun, Shi Hyun, repeat after me, repeat after me.
Goldfish, goldfish.
Uncle, I think Dok Go Shi Hyun is a fool.
She can't say a single word.
Ding Dong, the intellect of a baby who is only ten months old cannot be measured using that kind of picture flip cards.
Look at me.
(Baby talk) Ga ga.
(Baby talk) Bu dik gu bi di di di dik di dik... (Baby talk) Gu gu...
Aigoo.
See?
She's a genius.
She's normal.
Hyung Gyu, drink a glass of milk.
Here.
Drink a glass.
- Oh, it's the milk Uncle endorses.
- [Korean Milk]
My friends only drink that milk every day.
Is that so?
I'll send you a few boxes of the milk, and sign my autograph on the photo label.
Distribute them.
Ok.
Whenever your face is printed on a merchandise, it has the same marketing effect as launching an extensive advertisement campaign.
Of course.
I am Dok Go Jin.
My body is so perfect from head to toe, such that I'm the number one married man whom women want to steal away.
I also top the ranking for fathers who are helpless towards their daughters.
You really drive me crazy whenever you open your mouth.
The perfect Dok Gok Jin, did you see the article talking about us in the newspaper?
What did they write about again?
That we're facing marital discord?
That we're getting a divorce?
That we're getting a separation.
[Dok Go Jin and Gu Ae Jeong in the midst of a separation?
]
Didn't you stay at a hotel at the city's outskirts while filming your new movie?
They wrote that we've already separated for three months.
We'll have to go for a picnic again.
We have to appear in front of many people, and show ourselves to them.
I think a picnic might be too weak.
In that case, what would be better?
Celebrities with a lot of children seem to have been better received by the public recently.
Oh, ding dong!
Gu Ae Jeong, let's start on managing our image right away.
Then I'll have to recharge your battery to full.
Recharge.
In the process of recharging.
Fully charged!

Aigoo, aigoo.
Father and Mother are here.
Look at me, look at me.
Shi Hyun!
Shi Hyun!
(Baby talk) Bang bang bang bang bang...
- I'll carry her.
- Shi Hyun, Father's going to carry you.
- All right, your father will do that.
- I'll do that.
Know that it's an honor to have watched such a drama.
Conquered!
- Conquered!
- Conquered!
Shi Hyun.
Conquered!
Thank you to all who loved and supported The Greatest Love.

Okay.
How in the world did you manage to convince me to do this?
'Cause it's your 60th birthday.
Uh-huh.
And I'm Daddy's little girl.
I love you, too, sweetie.
I'll see you on the other side.
Yeah.
One.

Hello?
Hello, Judge Kamalei.
Yes.
Who's this?
Your daughter's quite the adventurer, isn't she?
Where...
Who-who are you?
Tell me, Your Honor, what was the last thing you said to her before she left the platform?
Who the hell is this?
I hope you said good-bye.

You ready to go see Uncle Matty or what?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
He's the coolest ever.
- He's what?
- The coolest ever.
Coolest ever?
You know, a less secure father might take that personally.
I always considered myself to be the coolest ever.
No?
Okay, I guess I'm not.
Go ahead.
Come in!
Uncle Matt?
Who's the greatest uncle in the whole wide world?
Uncle Matt!
Is this for me?
No.
This is for your dad.
Hurricane Matty strikes again.
Huh?
Hey.
What'd I tell you about spoiling her?
I am not spoiling her.
You're not?
No.
Okay.
A little bit.
Come here, I love you.
Been too long, huh?
Hasn't been that long.
No, it actually has.
My going-away party was a year ago.
No, you have not been out here for a year.
I know, it feels like ten.
I can't believe that you came all the way to Hawaii.
Yeah.
Well...
She's worth it.
How's things with Rachel?
They are, uh... they're getting better.
We actually have conversations, and I don't feel like a blood vessel's gonna explode out of my neck, so that's good.
- Good.
Progress.
- Yeah, absolutely.
So?
Why the, uh, why the sudden visit?
You're on business, right?
What do you mean?
What, a guy can't drop in on his bro?
No.
A guy can drop in on his bro, but not you, okay?
'Cause last time you dropped in on me, you crashed Dad's car into a tree.
Let the IROC go, Danny.
Okay?
I came here to have fun.
Proof.
Right here.
We are going to swim with dolphins, we are going to feed sharks, hot air ballooning.
This place has everything.
Yeah, they got everything.
I mean, they got tsunamis, they got giant centipedes...
You know what your problem is?
Your issue?
Lack of adventurous spirit.
You're a spoilsport!
Am I right, Gracie?
Yeah.
Hold on a second.
When?
Okay.
Guys, I got bad news.
I gotta go to work.
Grace, gotta take you back to Mom, okay?
Wait a second.
She can hang with me.
- You're gonna babysit?
- Yeah.
We can hang out for the day, and then we'll meet you for dinner.
What do you think, Gracie?
Mm-hmm.
All right.
But listen, no funny stuff.
No trouble, okay?
I won't.
I know you won't.
I'm talking to him.
All right.
Come on.
I'll see you guys later.
Stay out of trouble.
We need to cause trouble, right now.
Yes.
I heard that.
Chin.
Hey, listen, I think we need to expand the grid search to a half-mile radius.
What did you find?
The end of the zip line here, it's all charred, and there's a, uh... a residue, a film, all over it.
You think it was an explosive?
Yeah, I do.
Could've been a shape charge that went high order.
I also found evidence of an electronic trigger.
Probably short-wave.
Somebody blew the zip line out, Chin, and they had to have been close by to do it.
Okay.
I'll see what I can find.
We know this is hard, but... can you tell us about the phone call?
It was an unknown number.
He had a thin, raspy voice.
Didn't recognize it.
He knew I was a judge.
He called me "Your Honor."
I think he was watching us.
One minute Katie was waving good-bye... then the next...
I'm sorry.
You've got to excuse me.
Single father, one kid.
Yeah.
He just lost the only family he had.
Do you think the daughter was a target, or just... collateral damage?
No, I think from the phone call the father was definitely the target.
The killer was taunting him.
He knew his name, his number, exactly where he'd be.
Definitely premeditated.
Yeah.
I want a full protective detail on the judge, 24/7.
For all we know, this whack job's not done.
So I found these tire tracks in an area that's usually off limits to vehicles.
They're recent, and they're well within sight of the platform.
You get a hit from the HPD database?
Yeah.
According to the size, depth, and tread pattern, it looks like our suspect was driving a late-model SUV or a light pickup.
Once we get a suspect, we can pull a match.
Okay, Danny.
Any luck tracing the phone call to the judge?
No, the phone's a burner.
Completely untraceable.
But, uh, the HPD bomb squad they checked out the fragments that you found, and they said it's from an RF receiver usually found in walkie-talkies or remote-controlled cars.
They're doing chemical analysis on the explosives right now.
Kono, what do you got?
I've been trying to get a hold of the judge's threat file, but the deputy prosecutor's been in court all day.
- Threat file?
- The prosecutor's office has a team of investigators whose sole job is to keep track of any written or verbal threats against the bench.
Basically, just weed out the whack jobs, right?
So depending on how heavy the threat, they either do or do not pass it on to the Feds.
So what we're looking for right now is someone who matches our killer's profile so far:
male, violent, history with explosives, and an axe to grind.
Makes sense.
With cops, judges, anyone who puts away hardened criminals, suspect pool's going to be pretty deep.
Okay, so if we're focusing on violent felony cases the judge has presided over, how deep is this pool that we're talking about?
Okay.
Uh, we need to whittle this down.
In the meantime, let's make sure Judge Kamalei's personal security detail has a picture of every one of these guys.
When this killer comes back for the judge, we're going to be ready.
Yeah.
All right.
Thanks, Chin.
HPD is in place.
The judge is secure.
Kono and I are going to go see Deputy Prosecutor Chen tomorrow, try to narrow down our suspects.
We'll take all the help we can get.
You know, I really appreciate this escort through the Hilton.
I'm just stopping in to pick up Grace.
It's no big deal.
Besides, I want to meet your brother.
Well, be warned.
Mr. Wall Street has quite a personality.
Runs in the family, huh?
Disorder.
Personality dis... order.
Hey, Rach.
What are you doing here?
Mmm, it's nice to see you, too, Daniel.
I invited her.
Come on, it's been a long time since we've had a family meal.
It'll be just like old times.
Steven.
My brother Matthew.
Matthew...
Good to meet you.
Great to meet you.
Well, can you stay awhile?
Uh... no Stan?
Well, he's in Boston on business.
Again?
Daniel.
What?
Hey, so, uh, listen, I'll leave you to it.
You stay, Danny.
Come on, come on.
Steve.
Even cops can spare a half hour to grab some food, come on.
Come on, hang out, I got Danny's favorite.
I got surf and turf.
Yeah.
What do you think?
I could eat.
Surf?
Or, uh...
I could eat surf.
Surf?
Okay.
Come on.
Can I...?
Thank you.
I'm telling you something.
He would do it every, every time.
Every time.
No, he didn't.
He did not!
Not every time.
Okay, Danny, tell them about the time at the zoo.
Again with the...
Every time with the zoo.
Okay?
You were...
He was causing a disturbance.
You handcuffed me to the monkey cages.
Hey, I...
I was doing my job.
Danny, you were nine!
What are you talking about?
They were plastic handcuffs.
Just so you know.
So you were a cop back then?
Oh, yeah.
My parents would say, you know,
"Where's, uh, where's your brother?" Danny would say,
"Guess we lost him."
You are horrible, Daniel.
Oh, I always would come back for you.
Didn't I?
You know what, take my hand.
Didn't I, huh?
That is true.
That is true.
If you remembered where you left me.
I love you.
Look at this...
look at this little cutie-patootie.
Oh, my gosh.
I know, she is so tired.
She drank several, several sodas.
Hey.
See these two guys over Rachel's right shoulder?
Goofy aloha shirt and cheap shoes?
Yeah.
Look like Feds, huh?
Mm-hmm.
They watching us?
I don't know.
Guy on the right walked out of my brother's room in a waiter outfit earlier today.
Really?
Yeah.
Looks like they're getting up.
What do you want to do?
Say hello?
I think we should say hello.
Hey, uh, we'll be right back.
All right.
One second.
Okay.
Hey.
Gentlemen.
Special Agent Edward Kipton.
this is Special Agent Adam Markowitz.
FBI.
We know.
What do you want with my brother?
I'm sorry.
It's an active investigation.
You know how it is.
Oh, okay.
Um, listen, we have, on this Island, what is called...
What does the government call it?
It's called full immunity and means.
Full immunity and means.
So...
I'll give her a call.
Just do yourself a favor, okay, and just tell me why you're following my brother.
We don't have to do all this.
Governor Jameson please.
Right, you have the governor on speed dial?
Exactly.
Hello, Governor.
Yes, ma'am.
No, I'm standing with a couple of FBI agents here who are refusing to share information about a case.
Why are you smiling?
He's not kidding.
He did this to me.
No.
Yes, ma'am.
No, we tried.
Mm-hmm.
Yes, ma'am.
It's for you.
Okay.
Who is this?
Yeah, right.
It's good.
My name?
Kipton.
Edward Kipton.
Um...
Yes.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm terribly sorry.
Of course.
Of course.
Now, answer the man's question.
Matthew Williams is the focus of a federal investigation.
He's being accused of defrauding his investors out of millions of dollars.
Whoa.
Defrauding?
No, no, no, that's impossible.
Not according to the SEC and the dozen forensic accountants they have going through his books.
Okay, well, you and you and the SEC are all wrong, okay?
My brother runs a hedge fund.
And contrary to the talking heads on television, that does not make him a thief, you understand?
We're not here to argue.
Our job is to make sure that your brother doesn't take his vacation overseas before the indictment comes down.
So...
Indictment?
...if you hear anything about his travel plans, I'd appreciate it if you'd give us a call, okay?
And, Danny, if you say anything to your brother, we will prosecute you for obstruction.
I'm sure you will.
See if your fairy godmother can get you out of that.
Listen to me.
I know my kid brother, okay.
He's a lot of things, but he is not a criminal.
Okay, okay.
Maybe he was set up.
Yeah, maybe.
Listen to me, all right, let me tell you something about my brother, okay?
When Rachel and I split up, all right,
I took a room at a motel right down the block, because I wanted to be close to Grace.
This two-star dump.
My brother-- every single night, he would come over with a six-pack of beer and all the time in the world.
Never once, not one time, did I catch him looking at his watch, okay?
He just sat there talk to me every single night.
He'd fall asleep sitting up in a chair.
Wake up the next morning, go straight to work.
Every day, okay, for six months he did this.
For six months he talked me off the ledge, all right?
I'm telling you, I would not have gotten through that if it wasn't for him, okay?
He didn't do this.
Okay.
All right, fine.
You... you got to talk to him.
Yeah.
I just don't think that this is a one-time conversation.
That's fine.
Listen, you talk to him, take all the time you need.
Family's first, right?
There he is.
Steve, I'd like you to meet Deputy Prosecutor Jim Chen.
Steve McGarrett.
How do you do?
Thanks for meeting me like this.
I'm just on my way to a lunch.
No, no problem.
I appreciate it.
Listen, did you get a chance to pull
Judge Kamalei's threat file?
It's all here.
Kamalei's known as a hanging judge.
Put away a lot of violent offenders.
Not many get back out on the street.
Anyone on here stand out?
Several.
But if I were a betting man,
I'd say Drew Parisi fits the M.O. How so?
Arson conviction.
After his ex dumped him,
Parisi rigged her house to burn down.
I'm sorry, you said he rigged her house?
This guy has technical skills?
Not only that,
Jim said apparently this guy was so pissed when the verdict was delivered, he attacked the judge in open court.
It took a bailiff and two armed officers to restrain him.
And he just got paroled?
Three weeks ago.
Only in America.
Yeah, only in America.
You know his parole officer?
Already spoke to him.
Parisi is staying at an old girlfriend's place in Wahiawa.
Hey, stop by the house on Sunday.
Your mother would love to see you.
Will do.
See you then.
Hello.
Very sweet.
A lunch with your son.
You must love him very much.
Who is this?
But a pat on the back?
You should have given him a hug.
Please, don't do this.
I hope you said good-bye.
Five-O!
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!
Kyle!
Get out of the car!
Hey.
What did he say about the call?
Same as Kamalei.
Unknown number, male voice.
"Hope you said good-bye."
You okay?
Yeah, I will be once we find this scumbag.
Well, we know it's not Parisi.
No, we were right there with him at the exact time the bomb went off.
That's right, and if it was detonated by a remote trigger, then the bomber had to have been close by.
Right.
Is that a piece of the RF receiver?
Yeah, it is.
This one's largely intact, and we got a partial serial number right there.
Nice.
I'll run it down, see if we can find out where it came from.
All right.
Hey, how goes the canvass?
Good.
Got a lot of foot traffic.
Tourists taking photos.
So I collected all their cameras and cell phones, see what we get.
Well, one thing's for sure.
This isn't just about Judge Kamalei anymore.
That's right.
If we want to figure out who this bomber is, we have to look at cases involving Kamalei and Chen.
My question is, if it's about revenge, why not go after them?
Why target their kids?
I understand.
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
I'm going to see you in a little bit.
Yeah.
I got to go.
I-I've got to go.
What's happening?
Hey.
Um, I wasn't expecting to see you for a little bit.
I'm sorry.
A guy can't drop in on his brother?
I see what you did there-- clever.
Thank you.
What are you doing, business?
Uh, that?
Uh, new client.
Lives up on the North Shore.
I thought you were on vacation.
I am.
This, uh, this just came up.
Who's, uh...
Who's this new client?
Uh, clients of mine mentioned my name to him.
He's, uh, he's got nine figures.
Made a small fortune through the family business.
So now he's looking for some tax shelter ideas.
What is his family business?
A little of everything-- shipping, utilities, real estate stuff.
It's just a coincidence he's here in Hawaii?
What's with the third degree, Magnum?
Are you looking to poach my client?
Yeah, I'm trying to poach your client.
I'm checking on my little brother's career.
Is that all right?
Checking up on me-
- I like that.
Apparently, this guy's on a schedule.
He needs to meet right now, so... can we hang later?
Yeah, whatever you need.
All right.
You all right?
I'm in Hawaii, with my big brother.
I'll see you in a little bit.
All right.
I cross-referenced Judge Kamalei's threat file with cases both he and Chen had in common, focusing on violent offenders and parolees.
Okay, any matches?
No.
So I started focusing on the cameras and cell phones
I collected from the crime scene.
All right, so several tourists took photos just before or after the explosion.
All from different angles.
Okay, so what you're saying is the killer might actually be in here somewhere?
Exactly.
From the size of the tires, we're looking for an SUV.
What's that right there?
Blow that up, Kono.
Put it up here for me.
The wheel wells are all muddy.
What about the treads?
The tires are a match to the treads found near the zip line platform.
Did you get a clear shot of the plates?
No.
But hey, what's that?
That could be a rental tag.
Okay, contact every rental company on the Island.
I want the name of anybody driving a rental that make, model and color, okay?
All right, you got it.
Danny, everything okay with your brother?
It's, uh, it's fine.
I think I'm going to be a little while, though.
Why?
What are you going to do?
I got it.
Don't worry about it.
It's nothing.
Uh, okay, I know what nothing means, so...
Nothing means nothing, Steven, okay?
I'm fine.
Okay, you know what, stop, don't go anywhere.
I'm going to be there soon.
I tracked down this serial number.
It's to a circuit board for a remote control airplane.
A T-9 Sabrecat.
I hear you're one of the only shops on the Island that sell 'em, yeah?
Yeah.
Sell any lately?
Guy came looking to buy last week.
Oh, yeah.
What he look like?
Haole.
Dark hair, goatee.
He was dressed full-on
Paniolo style, boots and everything.
Definitely no local.
How you know that?
The tan lines, the clothes.
This cowboy-- he buy any of them?
Three of them.
Three?
Yep.
Paid in cash.
And get this-- the remote control to that plane has a range of a thousand feet.
Those tire tracks I found near the zip line platform are well within that.
Well, then it looks like we have one less target.
Okay, would you please slow down.
You're getting too close.
Danny, relax.
He doesn't know this truck.
That's a good point.
Stop.
He's pulling into that driveway.
Yeah, hello.
Is this Waioleka Charters?
Yes, thank you.
This is Clarence Clemons from Matthew Williams' office.
I'm just calling to check on his itinerary.
No listing?
Okay.
Hey, could you guys just tell me one more time, where do you fly out of?
Kaleola Airport.
Thank you very much.
This is so sick that I'm doing this.
MAN Hands up.
Matthew...
Come.
Come in.
Good to see you.
We have much business to discuss.
What happened?
You lose the signal?
Yeah.
He said he was going to a business meeting.
Who pats you down before a business meeting, hmm?
Someone who doesn't want to get caught.
Who is responsible for this suntan lotion job here?
You missed a huge spot on your nose, monkey.
I didn't know you were joining us.
Sorry, man.
Slipped my mind.
How did your meeting go?
Really great, yeah.
Guy wanted to park $30 mil in some tax-free munies.
I'm like, "Really?
Well, bonds are dead money right now."
$30 mil?
That's impressive.
What can I say?
I'm good at my job.
Time for a swim.
What is it that you do, exactly?
You just help the rich get out of paying their taxes or what?
In all fairness, I'd like to get everybody out of their taxes, not just the rich.
You know, people don't pay taxes, then cops don't get paid, firefighters like Pop.
You ever think about that?
Man, I'm kidding.
Come on!
Relax!
It's the beach.
Uncle Matt!
Fish!
Where is that fish?
!
Let me see it!
I'm coming to get it!
Right here?
And what was that all about?
What was what all about?
I assume you've heard the term "passive-aggressive"?
I wasn't being passive-aggressive.
No, you were being aggressive-aggressive.
The question is why?
I don't know.
He just gets under my skin sometimes.
Daniel, you can't lie to me.
What's wrong?
All right, I'm gonna tell you something.
I need you to keep it between us, okay?
Okay?
The other night when Steve and I left dinner, the FBI was watching us.
They're after Matt.
What?
They claim he's been scamming his clients out of their life savings.
Apparently, an indictment is on its way.
Do you believe he's guilty?
I don't want to.
I'm waiting for a callback from a buddy at the SEC.
What does Matt have to say about all of this?
I have not spoken to him about it.
Daniel...
What do you want me to do, Rachel?
What do I do?
It's an active federal investigation.
I'm a cop.
He's your brother.
Wave.
Wave to them.
Hey, I'll tell you, man.
Remember that time at the, uh...oh, the Stone Pony?
We snuck in to see Bruce.
And that weird bouncer with the three chicks?
You want a beer?
No, I'm good.
Hey, I want to, uh...
I want to talk to you about something.
Sit down for a second.
It's about Rachel, isn't it?
I knew you still loved her.
I knew by the way that you looked at her at dinner last night.
I know you.
It's not about Rachel.
So I'm just gonna ask you once... and I want you to tell me the truth.
What's going on with you?
Nothing.
Why?
Why?
Because I spoke to a friend at the SEC.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about your indictment.
Matt, you've been stealing money from your clients, huh?
Danny, that...
that's insane, okay?
It's just... doesn't even...
Don't lie to me.
I'm not lying!
Listen to me!
Who do you think you're talking to, huh?
!
You think you're talking to one of your dopey clients?
!
I'm your brother!
You don't lie to me!
What do you want to hear, that I took the money?
Fine.
I took the money.
What were you thinking about?
You do something that stupid, you think about Mom?
You think about Dad?
You think about our sisters?
I know.
You know they're gonna come knocking at Mom's door?
Calling her in the middle of the night asking for statements?
I know, okay?
I made a mistake.
Is that what you've been waiting for?
What, you think I get a kick out of this?
I enjoy this?
I think that you like to be the guy that everybody thinks does everything right, but we both know that you made mistakes.
Why?
Why?
That's all I want to know.
Why?
I lost $58 million in one day.
And I had to cover it.
So I took some money from my other clients' accounts.
I fixed statements.
I was hoping that if I could cover my tracks, that no one would be the wiser, and then one lie led to another and then the next one and the next.
Why didn't you come to me?
You're a cop.
I knew that you would...
I'm your brother.
I would have helped you.
I thought about turning myself in, then I just couldn't.
Why'd you come to Hawaii?
To cut another deal, and try to buy my way out, but, uh... it fell through.
Okay.
Okay, here's what...
Okay, we're getting on a plane together and we're going back to New York, okay?
You're gonna talk to the FBI, you're gonna talk to the SEC and you're going to cop to everything, you understand?
I'll go to jail.
Yeah, you're probably gonna go to jail.
Minimum-security.
All right, we're gonna get you a good lawyer.
All right, I'm personally gonna talk to the district attorney, and I'm gonna be there with you and we're gonna get through this together.
This is gonna kill Mom and Dad.
Okay, listen to me.
Um, we got a long road ahead.
We're going back home.
I want you to pack a bag.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
I cross-checked red SUV rentals with cases that involved both Kamalei and Chen, and I got a hit.
Travis Roan, age 49, current resident of Cheyenne, Wyoming.
No local address.
And he used to work on a demo team.
So he knows his way around a construction site.
And he spent seven years in the Wyoming State Pen for aggravated assault.
Okay, but Wyoming?
I don't understand.
Was he tried here?
No, but his son was.
Thomas Roan.
Yeah. 20 years old.
Got 18 months for a DUI, then got stabbed in a mess hall fight.
Died in prison ten days ago.
Oh, man.
And Kamalei and Chen put him there, right?
This guy's looking for payback for his dead son.
So I pulled Thomas' case and I spoke to the judge trying to figure out our last potential target.
Maybe an arresting officer, a key witness.
But all Judge Kamalei can remember about the case was the flood of appeals that came after his verdict.
Who filed the appeals?
Thomas' mom.
Court paperwork shows a local address for her.
Maybe she can help us find Travis Roan.
I can't believe it.
Oh, my God, those poor children.
Do you know where Travis is right now?
Back in Wyoming, I thought.
He was only in town for Thomas' funeral.
We're very sorry to hear about what happened to your son.
Thomas couldn't wait to leave Cheyenne.
Said this place was like paradise.
Then first semester, he got pulled over for a DUI.
The judge and that prosecutor had to make an example of him.
What do you mean by that?
It was the third DUI that week right in the heart of Waikiki.
It didn't help that Thomas was underage and hit a fancy car.
So instead of probation or getting his license revoked...
He got 18 months.
I tried to appeal, moved down here to do so.
How did your ex-husband take that?
Hard.
They wouldn't even let him visit his son.
Former felons aren't allowed.
Thomas was only 13 when his father went away to Rawlins.
They wrote letters and such, but they hadn't seen each other since.
Ma'am, did Travis ever... did he ever make any threats or maybe mention anybody else that he blamed for Thomas' death?
No.
No, the only thing he kept saying at the funeral was he never got to say good-bye.
Mrs. Roan, this is very important.
We need to know where Travis was staying.
We're clear.
He was just here.
The sink's still wet, looks like he shaved.
I got a photo and letters from Thomas to his dad.
Chin, I got the kits.
The last remote is gone.
We're running out of time.
Hold on, I got something here.
These letters...
Roan's blaming someone named "Meachum."
Says, "She sold me out.
She convinced me to take the deal."
That's his lawyer.
Public defender.
Right.
Our next target.
Pi'ikoi Middle School?
Yeah, I'm, like, two minutes away from there.
Why?
Because that's where our suspect is headed.
He's after Brian Meachum, the public defender's kid.
All right.
You got an ID on this guy?
Yeah, the guy's name is Travis Roan.
He's driving a red SUV, it's a rental.
I'm sending you a picture right now.
Danny, listen to me, okay?
Get a visual on this guy, and then proceed with extreme caution.
He is highly unstable, and he's carrying explosives.
Looking for this, Mr. Meachum?
Yeah.
Found it by the gym.
Somebody must be messing with you.
Thanks.
You be careful, now.
Your homework.
Always remember to double-check it.
Right.
Thanks again.
Kono, any luck reaching Diana Meachum?
No, straight to voice mail.
But DMV database shows she's driving a beige minivan, license plate:
Charlie, Bravo, zero, three, two, five.
Okay, got it.
Listen, remember that transmitter is only good for a thousand feet, okay?
You locate the Meachums,
Roan can't be far away, so be careful.
Why do you always set your phone on vibrate?
It's a little embarrassing when it goes off in court.
Maybe you should answer it.
This is Diana.
Mrs. Meachum.
This is Lieutenant Commander Steve McGarrett from Five-O.
You're in danger right now.
You need to get out of your car, and move away, right away.
Don't touch anything.
Brian, get out of the car right now.
Get out.
Just go.
Go.
Get the Meachums.
Steve, over here.
Five-O, hands where I can see them.
Hey.
I need you to step out of the car slowly, all right?
That boy... he's only 13 years old.
Just like Thomas was when I last saw him.
Just like Thomas.
Now he's gone.
He's gone.
I lost him.
I lost him.
I lost him.
Get out of the car, out, out, out, out.
Now.
Get down on the ground.
Hands behind your back.
I gotta go pick up my brother.
He was going to run.
Can you believe that?
Charter company got back to me with the flight manifest, and he used our third-grade gym teacher's name to book the flight.
He was going to skip out first thing in the morning.
Sorry, man.
Yeah, me, too.
Let me give you guys a ride to the airport.
Nah, you don't have to do that.
Come on.
Come on, we'll talk in the truck.
He's not here.
MAN 2:
Where the hell did he go?
Five-O!
Hey, hey, hey!
Stand down.
Stand down.
Where the hell is he?
Hmm?
What'd you say to him?
What's going on?
What are you talking about?
Well, we lost the tail on your brother.
Phone's dead, he switched cars, and when we got to the meet, there was no one there.
He tipped them off before the deal ever went down.
Stop.
Stop, okay?
I have no idea what you're saying to me right now.
You understand?
What meet?
What deal?
What are you talking about?
Come here.
The footage is courtesy of the DEA.
Guy in the black shirt is Pedro Fuentes, accountant for the third most powerful cartel in Columbia.
And your brother...
is making a deal to launder his drug money.
How much can you handle?
Ten?
Ten million should be fine.
Once I get it in and out of Singapore.
And the meet was supposed to go down today.
You had no idea?
We had it all set up.
We were gonna take them all down as soon as we saw the money.
Yeah, except sometime today, your brother changed the plan.
And now they've all gone under.
If you have any idea where your brother is, you need to tell us right now, Detective.
I have no clue.
You understand me?
What?
You gotta tell him.
You... you gotta tell him.
I gotta tell him what?
Tell him what you told me.
His brother's got plans to leave the Island.
McGarrett, you know where Williams is?
Yeah, I do.
He's got a boat near Kawela Bay, on the North Shore, okay?
I'm sorry, Danny.
All right, you heard him, let's go, people!
Thank you.
MATT Hey, this is Matt.
You know what to do.
Matty.
Matty.
Matthew Williams, hey!
You going to shoot me, Danny?
I should shoot you, you stupid son of a bitch.
Huh?
Laundering money for drug dealers?
What the hell's the matter with you?
I had no choice.
You did have a choice.
You had a choice.
I gave you a choice!
I said I was gonna help you.
I said I was gonna get you through this.
Didn't I?
It's not that simple, Danny.
This isn't you beating up Cousin Jimmy because he stole my bike.
Matthew, listen to me, you are going to turn yourself in.
You are gonna turn yourself in!
Go to federal prison?
I'd never survive, Danny.
I'm not strong enough.
I'm not you!
What the hell is the matter with you?
Huh?
What'd you do?
Huh?
You went through with it?
What is that?
Is that getaway money?
It wasn't supposed to be a getaway, Danny.
I was trying to f...
I was trying to fix things.
Trying to fix things?
So what are you going to do?
Huh?
Just going to run away?
You're going to fly off and you're going to forget about us?
Huh?
Is that your plan?
Hey!
I'm asking you a question!
What about Mom and Dad?
Huh?
What about Grace?
We're your family, Matty.
This ends one of two ways, big brother.
You either shoot me, or you say good-bye.

Okay, how in the world did you manage to convince me to do this?
- Because it's your 60th birthday.
- Uh-huh.
- And I'm Daddy's little girl.
Ha-ha-ha.
- And I love you too, sweetie.
- Here you go.
- I'll see you on the other side.
- Yeah.
- One, two, three!
Aah!
- Hello?
Hello, Judge Kamalei.
Yes.
Who's this?
Your daughter's quite the adventurer, isn't she?
- Where?
Who are you?
- Tell me, Your Honor, what was the last thing you said to her before she left the platform?
- Who the hell is this?
- Aah!
I hope you said goodbye.
- Katie!
She's down!
Katie!
You ready to go see Uncle Matty or what?
- Yeah.
He's the coolest ever.
- Yeah?
- He's what?
- The coolest ever.
The coolest ever?
You know, a less secure father might take that personally.
I always considered myself to be the coolest ever.
No?
Okay, I guess I'm wrong.
Go ahead.
Come in.
Uncle Matt?
Who's the greatest uncle in the whole wide world?

I love you.
- It's been too long, huh?
- It hasn't been that long.
No, it actually has.
Uh, my going-away party was a year ago.
- You have not been out here for a year.
- I know.
It feels like ten.
I can't believe you came all the way to Hawaii.
Yeah, well, it was worth it.
- How's things with Rachel?
- They are, uh...
They're getting better.
We actually have conversations and I don't feel like a blood vessel is gonna explode out of my neck.
- So that's good.
- Progress.
Yeah, absolutely.
So why the, uh, sudden visit?
You're on business, right?
What, you mean a guy can't drop in on his bro?
No, a guy can drop in on his bro, but not you.
Last time you dropped in on me, you crashed Dad's car into a tree.
Let the IROC go, Danny.
Okay?
I came here to have fun.
Proof, right here.
We are going to swim with dolphins.
We are going to feed sharks, hot-air ballooning.
- This place has everything.
- Yeah, they got everything.
I mean, they got tsunamis, they got giant centipedes...
You know what your problem is, your issue?
Lack of adventurous spirit.
- You're a spoilsport.
Right, Gracie?
Yeah.
One second.
All right, we need to play with all of this today.
- We'll start with...
- Sounds like fun.
You're getting so big.
Okay.
Guys, I got bad news.
I gotta go to work.
Grace, I gotta take you back to Mom, okay?
Wait.
She can hang with me.
- You're gonna babysit?
- Yeah.
We can hang out for the day.
And then we'll meet you for dinner.
What do you think, Gracie?
All right.
Listen, no funny stuff.
- No trouble, okay?
- I won't.
I know you won't.
I'm talking to him.
- All right, come on.
- All right.
I'll see you guys later.
Stay out of trouble.
- We need to cause trouble right now.
- Yeah.
Yes.
I heard that.
Chin.
Hey, listen, I think we need to expand the grid search
- to a half-mile radius.
What did you find?
The end of the zip line here, it's all charred and there's a, uh...
There's a residue, a film all over it.
- You think it was an explosive?
- Yeah, I do.
Could have been a shaped charge that went high-order.
I also found evidence of an electronic trigger, probably shortwave.
Somebody blew the zip line out.
They had to have been close by to do it.
I'll see what I can find.
We know this is hard, but can you tell us about the phone call?
It was an unknown number.
He had a thin, raspy voice.
Didn't recognize it.
He knew I was a judge, called me "Your Honor."
I think he was watching us.
One minute, Katie was waving goodbye.
And then the next...
I'm sorry.
You've gotta excuse me.
Single father, one kid.
Yeah.
He's lost the only family he had.
Do you think the daughter was a target or just collateral damage?
No, I think from the phone call, the father was definitely the target.
I think the killer was taunting him.
He knew his name, his number, exactly where he'd be.
Definitely premeditated, yeah.
I want a full protective detail on the judge 24/7.
For all we know, this whack job's not done.
So I found these tire tracks in an area that's usually off limits to vehicles.
They're recent and they're well within sight of the platform.
- You get a hit from H.P.D. database?
- Yeah.
According to the size, depth and tread pattern, looks like our suspect was driving a late-model SUV or a light pickup.
Once we get a suspect, we can pull a match.
Okay, Danny, any luck tracing the phone call to the judge?
No, the phone's a burner.
It's completely untraceable.
But the H.P. D bomb squad, they checked out the fragments that you found and they said it's from an RF receiver usually found in walkie-talkies or remote-control cars.
They're doing chemical analysis on the explosives right now.
Kono, what do you got?
Been trying to get a hold of the judge's threat file.
- Deputy prosecutor's in court all day.
- Threat file?
Prosecutor's Office has a team of investigators whose sole job is to keep track of written or verbal threats against the bench.
Basically just weed out the whack jobs.
So depending on how heavy the threat, they either do or do not pass it on to the feds.
What we're looking for is someone who matches our killer's profile so far:
male, violent, history with explosives, and an axe to grind.
Makes sense.
With cops, judges, anyone who puts away hardened criminals, suspect pool will be pretty deep.
So if we're focusing on violent felony cases the judge has presided over, how deep is this pool that we're talking about?
Ugh.
Okay, uh, we need to whittle this down.
In the meantime, let's make sure Judge Kamalei's personal security detail has a picture of every one of these guys.
When this killer comes back for the judge, we're gonna be ready.
Yeah, all right.
Thanks, Chin.
H.P. D is in place.
The judge is secure.
All right, Kono and I are gonna go see Deputy Prosecutor Chen tomorrow.
- Try to narrow down our suspects.
- I'll take all the help we can get.
I appreciate this escort through the Hilton.
- I'm just stopping in to pick up Grace.
- It's no big deal.
Besides, I wanna meet your brother.
All right, well, be warned.
Mr. Wall Street has quite a personality.
- Runs in the family, huh?
- Disorder.
Personality disorder.
There's a thing called...
- You should see that.
Ahem.
We...
Steve.
Hey, Rach.
What are you doing here?
- It's nice to see you too, Daniel.
I invited her.
Come on, it's been a long time since we've had a family meal.
It'll be just like old times.
Steven, my brother Matthew.
Matthew...
- Good to meet you.
- Great to meet you.
- Can you stay a while?
- Uh, no Stan?
- He's in Boston on business.
- Again?
- Daniel.
- What?
Hey, so, listen, I'll leave you to it.
You stay, Danny.
Come on, Steve.
Even cops can spare a half-hour to grab some food.
Hang out.
I got Danny's favorite.
I got surf and turf.
Yeah.
- What do you think?
- I could eat.
Surf or, uh?
- I could eat surf.
- Surf?
Okay.
Can I?
Come on.
This is very pink.
Must mean it's tasty.
No, you didn't.
I'm telling you something, he would do it every, every time.
- Every time.
- No, he didn't.
He did not.
Not every time.
Okay, Danny, tell them about the time at the zoo.
Every time with the zoo.
Okay?
You were...
He was causing a disturbance.
You handcuffed me to the monkey cages.
- Hey, I...
I was doing my job.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Dude, you were 9!
What are you talking about?
They were plastic handcuffs, just so you know.
So you were a cop back then?
My parents would say, you know, "Where's your brother?"
Danny would say, "Guess we lost him."
You are horrible, Danny.
Well, I always would come back for you, didn't I?
- Take my hand.
That is true.
- Didn't I?
If you remembered where you left me.
I love you.
Look at this cutie patootie.
Oh, she is so tired.
She drank several, several sodas.
I don't know how she's asleep.
Hey, ahem.
You see these two guys over Rachel's right shoulder?
- Goofy aloha shirt with cheap shoes?
- Yeah.
- Look like Feds, huh?
Mm-hm.
- They watching us?
I don't know.
The guy on the right walked out of my brother's room in a waiter outfit earlier today.
- Really?
Yeah.
They're getting up.
What do you want to do?
- Say hello?
- I think we should say hello.
- Hey, we'll be right back.
All right.
- One second.
- Okay.
Hey.
Special Agent Edward Kipton.
This is Special Agent Adam Markowitz.
FBI, we know.
What do you want with my brother?
I'm sorry.
It's an active investigation.
- You know how it is.
Oh, okay.
Um...
Listen, we have on this island what is called...
What does the governor call it?
- It's called "full immunity and means."
- Full immunity and means.
I'll give her a call.
It's all good.
Just do yourself a favor.
Okay?
Tell me why you're following my brother and we don't do this.
- Governor Jameson please.
- You have the governor on speed-dial?
That's exactly right.
- Hello, governor.
Yes, ma'am.
No, I'm standing with a couple of FBI agents here who are refusing to share information about a case.
Why are you smiling?
He's not kidding.
He did this to me.
No, yes, ma'am.
No, we tried.
- Yes ma'am.
It's for you.
- Okay.
Who is this?
Heh, heh, heh.
Yeah, right.
It's good.
My name?
Kipton, Edward Kipton.
Uh...
Yes.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm terribly sorry.
Of course.
Of course.
Now, answer the man's question.
Matthew Williams is the focus of a federal investigation.
He's being accused of defrauding his investors
- out of millions of dollars.
- Whoa.
Defrauding?
No, no, no.
That's impossible.
Well, not according to the SEC and the dozen forensic accountants going through his books.
Okay, well, you and you and the SEC are all wrong.
Okay?
My brother runs a hedge fund.
And contrary to the talking heads on television, that does not make him a thief.
We're not here to argue.
Our job is to make sure your brother doesn't take his vacation overseas
- before the indictment comes down.
- Wait a minute.
Indictment?
You hear anything about his travel plans,
I'd appreciate it if you'd give us a call.
And, Danny, if you say anything to your brother,
- we will prosecute you for obstruction.
- I'm sure you will.
See if your fairy godmother can get you out of that.
Listen to me.
I know my kid brother.
Okay?
He's a lot of things, but he is not a criminal.
Okay.
Okay.
- Maybe he was set up.
- Yeah, maybe.
Listen to me, all right?
Let me tell you something about my brother, okay?
When Rachel and I split up, all right,
I took a room at a motel right down the block, because I wanted to be close to Grace, this two-star dump.
My brother, every single night, would come over with a six-pack of beer and all the time in the world.
Never once, not one time did I catch him looking at his watch.
Okay?
He just sat there and talked to me every single night.
He'd fall asleep sitting up in a chair, wake up the next morning and go straight to work.
Every day.
For six months, he did this.
For six months, he talked me off the ledge.
I'm telling you, I would not have gotten through that if it wasn't for him.
Okay, he didn't do this.
Okay.
All right, fine.
You gotta talk to him.
Yeah, I just don't think that this is a one-time conversation.
So that's fine.
Listen, you talk to him.
Take all the time you need.
Family's first, right?
There he is.
Steve, I'd like you to meet Deputy Prosecutor Jim Chen.
- McGarrett.
How do you do?
- Thanks for meeting me like this.
- I'm just on my way to a lunch.
- No problem.
I appreciate it.
Listen, did you get a chance to pull Judge Kamalei's threat file?
It's all here.
Kamalei's known as a hanging judge.
Put away a lot of violent offenders.
Not many get back out on the street.
- Anybody on here stand out?
- Several.
But if I were a betting man, I'd say Drew Parisi fits the m.o.
- How so?
- Arson conviction.
After his ex dumped him, Parisi rigged her house to burn down.
You said he rigged her house?
This guy has technical skills?
Not only that, Jim said this guy was so pissed when the verdict was delivered, he attacked the judge in open court.
Took a bailiff and two officers to restrain him.
- And he just got paroled?
- Three weeks ago.
- Only in America.
- Yeah, only in America.
- You know his parole officer?
- Already spoke to him.
Parisi's staying at an old girlfriend's place in Wahiawa.
Hey, stop by the house on Sunday.
Your mother would love to see you.
Will do.
See you then.
- Hello?
- Very sweet.
A lunch with your son.
You must love him very much.
- Who is this?
- But a pat on the back?
You should have given him a hug.
- Please, don't do this.
- I hope you said goodbye.
Five-0.
Show me your hands.
Show me your hands.
Oh, God.
Get out of the car!
No!
- Hey.
Hey.
- What'd he say about the call?
- Same as Kamalei.
Unknown number, male voice.
"Hope you said goodbye."
- You okay?
- I will be once we find this scumbag.
Well, we know it's not Parisi.
No.
We were there with him at the exact time the bomb went off.
That's right.
And if it was detonated by a remote trigger, then the bomber had to have been close by.
- Is that a piece of the RF receiver?
- Yeah, it is.
This one's largely intact.
Got a partial serial number right there.
I'll run it down, see if we can find out where it came from.
All right.
Hey, how goes the canvassing?
Good.
Got a lot of foot traffic, tourists taking photos.
So I collected all their cameras and cell phones.
See what we get.
One thing's for sure.
This isn't just about Kamalei anymore.
That's right.
If we wanna figure out who this bomber is, we have to look at cases involving Kamalei and Chen.
My question is, if it's about revenge, why not go after them?
Why target their kids?
I understand.
Yes.
I'm gonna see you in a little bit.
Yeah, I gotta go.
I've gotta go.
What's happening?
Hey, um, I wasn't expecting to see you for a little bit.
I'm sorry.
A guy can't drop in on his brother?
- I see what you did there.
Clever.
- Thank you.
What, uh...?
What are you doing, business?
Oh, that?
Uh, new client.
Lives up on the North Shore.
- I thought you were on vacation.
- I am.
This, uh, just came up.
Who's, um...?
Who's this new client?
Ah, clients of mine mentioned my name to him.
He's got nine figures.
Made a small fortune through the family business.
So now he's looking for some tax shelter ideas.
What is his family business?
A little of everything.
Shipping, utilities, real estate stuff.
It's just a coincidence he's here in Hawaii?
What's with the third degree, Magnum?
- You looking to poach my client?
- I'm trying to poach your client.
I'm checking on my little brother's career.
All right?
Checking up on me.
I like that.
Apparently this guy's on a schedule.
He needs to meet right now.
So can we hang later?
- Yeah, whatever you need.
- All right.
- You all right?
- I'm in Hawaii with my big brother.
- I'll see you in a little bit.
- All right.
I cross-referenced Judge Kamalei's threat file with cases both he and Chen had in common, focusing on violent offenders and parolees.
- Okay, any matches?
- No.
So I started focusing on the cameras and cell phones
I collected from the crime scene.
All right, so several tourists took photos just before or after the explosion, all from different angles.
So, what you're saying is the killer might actually be in here somewhere?
Exactly.
And from the size of the tires, we're looking for an SUV.
What's that right there?
Blow that up, Kono.
Put it up here for me.
The wheel wells are all muddy.
What about the treads?
The tires are a match to the treads found near the zip line platform.
- Did you get a clear shot of the plates?
- No.
But, hey, what's that?
That could be a rental tag.
Okay.
Contact every rental company on the island.
I want the name of anybody driving a rental, that make, model and color.
All right.
You got it.
Danny, everything okay with your brother?
It was...
It's fine.
I think I'm gonna be a little while though.
- Why?
What are you gonna do?
- I got it.
Don't worry about it.
- It's nothing.
- Okay, I know what "nothing" means.
"Nothing" means nothing, Steven.
Okay?
I'm fine.
Okay, you know what?
Stop.
Don't go anywhere.
I'm gonna be there soon.
I tracked down this serial number.
It's to a circuit board for a remote-control airplane, T-9 Sabrecat.
You're one of the only shops on the island
- that sell them, yeah?
- Yeah.
Sell any lately?
Guy came looking to buy last week.
Oh, yeah.
What'd he look like?
Haole.
Dark hair.
Goatee.
He was dressed full-on paniolo style, boots and everything.
- Definitely no local.
- How you know that?
The tan lines, the clothes.
- This cowboy, he buy any of them?
- Three of them.
- Three?
Yup.
He paid in cash.
And get this.
The remote control to that plane has a range of a 1,000 feet.
Those tire tracks I found near the zip line platform, well within that.
Well, that looks like we have one last target.
Okay, would you please slow down?
You're getting too close.
Danny, relax.
He doesn't know this truck.
Good point.
Hold up.
Stop.
He's pulling into that driveway.
Yeah, hello.
Is this Waioleka Charters?
Yes, thank you.
This is, uh, Clarence Clemmons from Matthew Williams' office.
I'm just calling to check on his itinerary.
No listing, huh?
Hey, could you guys just tell me one more time, where do you fly out of?
Kaleola Airport.
Thank you very much.
This is so sick that I'm doing this.
Hands up.
Spread your legs.
Matthew.
- Come.
Come in.
He's clean.
It's good to see you.
Much business to discuss.
What happened?
Did you lose the signal?
Yeah, he said he was going to a business meeting.
Who pats you down before a business meeting?
Someone who doesn't wanna get caught.
Who is responsible for this suntan lotion job here?
You missed a huge spot on your nose, monkey.
Come here.
- Didn't know you were joining us.
- Sorry, slipped my mind.
How'd your meeting go?
Really great, yeah.
Guy wanted to park 30 mill in tax-free munies.
I'm like, "Really?
Well, bonds are dead money right now."
- Thirty mill, that's impressive.
- What can I say?
I'm good at my job.
- Ha, ha.
- Time for a swim.
What is it that you do exactly?
I mean, you just help the rich get out of paying their taxes or what?
In all fairness, I'd like to get everybody out of their taxes, not just the rich.
Well, if people don't pay taxes, then cops don't get paid, fire-fighters, like Pop.
- You ever think about that?
- Man, I'm kidding.
Come on, relax.
It's the beach.
Uncle Matt, fish.
Where is that fish?
Let me see it.
Aah!
Right here?
And what was that all about?
- What was what all about?
I assume you've heard the term passive-aggressive.
I wasn't being passive-aggressive.
No, you were being aggressive-aggressive.
The question is, why?
I don't know.
He just gets under my skin sometimes.
Daniel, you can't lie to me.
What's wrong?
I'm gonna tell you something.
I'm gonna need you to keep it between us.
Okay?
Okay?
The other night when Steve and I left dinner, the FBI was watching us.
They're after Matt.
- What?
- They claim that he's been scamming his clients out of their life savings.
Apparently an indictment is on its way.
And do you believe he's guilty?
I don't want to.
I'm waiting for a call back from a buddy at the SEC.
What does Matt have to say about this?
- I have not spoken to him about it.
- Daniel.
Well, what do you want me to do, Rachel?
What do I do?
I mean, it's an active federal investigation.
- I'm a cop.
- He's your brother.
Wave.
Wave to them.
Hey, I'll tell you man, remember that time at the, uh?
Oh, The Stone Pony?
We snuck in to see Bruce.
That weird bouncer with the three chicks?
- You want a beer?
- No, I'm good.
Hey, I wanna talk to you about something.
Come sit down for a second.
It's about Rachel, isn't it?
I knew you still loved her.
I knew by the way you looked at her at dinner last night,
- I knew it.
- It's not about Rachel.
So I'm just gonna ask you once.
And I want you to tell me the truth.
What's going on with you?
Nothing.
Why?
Why?
Because I spoke to a friend at the SEC.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about your indictment.
Matt, you been stealing money from your clients, huh?
Danny, that's insane, okay?
It's just, it doesn't even...
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not lying.
Listen to me.
Who you think you're talking to, huh?
You think you're talking to one of your dopey clients?
- I'm your brother.
You don't lie to me.
- Want to hear that I took the money?
Fine, I took the money.
What were you thinking about?
You do something that stupid, you think about Mom?
You think about Dad?
You think about our sisters?
- I know.
- They're gonna knock on Mom's door, call in the middle of the night for statements...
I know.
I made a mistake.
Is that what you've been waiting for?
Think I get a kick out of this?
I enjoy this?
I think that you like to be the guy that everybody thinks does everything right.
But we both know that you made mistakes.
Why?
Why?
That's all I want to know.
Why?
I lost $58 million in one day.
And I had to cover it.
So I took some money from my other clients' accounts.
I fixed statements.
I was hoping that if I could cover my tracks, that no one would be the wiser.
And then one lie led to another and then the next one and the next.
- Why didn't you come to me?
- You're a cop.
- I knew that you would...
- Hold on.
I would have helped you.
I thought about turning myself in.
Then I just couldn't.
Why'd you come to Hawaii?
To cut another deal and try to buy my way out.
But, uh, it fell through.
Okay.
Okay.
Here's what, okay?
We're getting on a plane together and we're going back to New York.
Okay?
You're gonna talk to the FBI.
You're gonna talk to the SEC.
And you're going to cop to everything.
- You understand?
- I'll go to jail.
Yeah, you're probably gonna go to jail, minimum security.
All right, we're gonna get you a good lawyer.
All right, I'm personally gonna talk to the district attorney and I'm gonna be there with you and we are gonna get through this together.
This is gonna kill Mom and Dad.
Ahem.
Okay, listen to me.
Um...
We got a long road ahead.
All right?
We're going back home.
I want you to pack a bag.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
I cross-checked red SUV rentals with cases that involved both Kamalei and Chen and I got a hit.
Travis Roan, age 49.
Current resident of Cheyenne, Wyoming.
No local address and he used to work on a demo team.
So he knows his way around a construction site and spent seven years in a Wyoming State Pen for aggravated assault.
Okay, but Wyoming, I don't understand.
Was he tried here?
No, but his son was.
- Thomas Roan.
- 20 years old.
- Got 18 months for a DUI.
- What?
Then got stabbed in a mess hall fight.
- Died in prison ten days ago.
- Oh, man.
And Kamalei and Chen put him there, right?
This guy's looking for payback for his dead son.
So I pulled Thomas' case and I spoke to the judge trying to figure out our last potential target.
Maybe an arresting officer, a key witness.
But all Judge Kamalei remembers about the case was the flood of appeals that came after his verdict.
- Who filed the appeals?
- Thomas' mom.
Court paperwork shows a local address for her.
Maybe she can help us find Travis Roan.
I can't believe it.
My God, those poor children.
Do you know where Travis is right now?
Back in Wyoming, I thought.
He was only in town for Thomas' funeral.
We're very sorry to hear about what happened about your son.
Thomas couldn't wait to leave Cheyenne.
Said this place was like paradise.
Then first semester, he got pulled over for a DUI.
The judge and that prosecutor had to make an example of him.
What do you mean by that?
It was the third DUI that week right in the heart of Waikiki.
Didn't help that Thomas was underage and hit a fancy car.
So instead of probation and getting his license revoked...
He got 18 months.
I tried to appeal.
Moved down here to do so.
- How did your ex-husband take that?
- Hard.
They wouldn't even let him visit his son.
Former felons aren't allowed.
Thomas was only 13 when his father went away to Rawlins.
They wrote letters and such, but they hadn't seen each other since.
Ma'am, uh, did Travis ever...?
Did he ever make any threats or maybe mention anybody else
- that he blamed for Thomas' death?
- No.
No, the only thing he kept saying at the funeral was he never got to say goodbye.
Mrs. Roan, this is very important.
We need to know where Travis was staying.
We're clear.
He was just here.
The sink's still wet.
Looks like he shaved.
I got a photo and letters from Thomas to his dad.
Okay.
Chin, I got the kits.
The last remote is gone.
We're running out of time.
Hold on, I got something here.
In these letters, Roan is blaming somebody named Meachum.
Says "She sold me out.
She convinced me to take the deal."
- That's his lawyer.
- The public defender.
Our next target.
Pi'ikoi Middle School.
Yeah, I'm like two minutes away from there.
- Why?
- That's where our suspect is headed.
He's after Brian Meachum, the public defender's kid.
All right, you got an ID on this guy?
Yeah, the guy's name is Travis Roan.
He's driving a red SUV.
It's a rental.
I'm sending over a picture right now.
Danny, listen to me, okay?
Get a visual on this guy and then proceed with extreme caution.
He is highly unstable and he's carrying explosives.
Looking for this, Mr. Meachum?
- Yeah.
- Found it by the gym.
Somebody must be messing with you.
Thanks.
You be careful now.
Your homework, always remember to double-check it.
Right.
Thanks again.
Kono, any luck reaching Dianna Meachum?
No, straight to voice mail.
But DMV database shows she's driving a beige minivan, license plate Charlie, Bravo, Zero, Three, Two, Five.
Okay, got it.
Remember that transmitter's only good for 1,000 feet.
Okay?
You locate the Meachums, Roan can't be far away.
So be careful.
Hey, why do you always set your phone to vibrate?
A little embarrassing when it goes off in court.
Maybe you should answer it.
- This is Dianna.
- Mrs. Meachum.
This is Lieutenant Commander Steve McGarrett from Five-0.
You're in danger right now.
You need to get out of your car...
- Brian, get out of the car.
Right now.
- Just don't touch anything.
Just go.
- Get the Meachums.
Come on, this way.
Steve, over here.
Five-0.
Hands where I can see them.
Hey, I need you to step out of the car slowly, all right?
That boy, he's only 13 years old.
Just like Thomas was when I last saw him.
Just like Thomas.
Now he's gone.
He's gone.
I lost him.
I lost him.
Go.
Out of the car.
Out of the car.
Out, out, out.
Get down.
Down.
Get down on the ground.
- Hands behind your back.
- Unh.
I gotta go pick up my brother.
He was gonna run.
Can you believe that?
The charter company got back to me with the flight manifest.
And he used a third-grade gym teacher's name to book the flight.
He was gonna skip out first thing in the morning.
- Sorry, man.
- Yeah, me too.
Let me give you a ride to the airport.
- You don't have to do that.
- Come on.
We'll talk in the truck.
He's not here.
Where the hell did he go?
Five-0!
Hey, hey, hey.
Five-0.
Hey, put your gun down!
Hey, hey, hey.
Stand down.
Stand down.
Where the hell is he?
What did you say to him?
- What's going on?
- What are you talking about?
We lost the tail on your brother.
Phone's dead.
He switched cars.
When we got to the meet, there was no one there.
He tipped them off before the deal went down.
Stop, stop, okay?
I have no idea what you're saying to me to right now.
What meet?
What deal?
What are you talking about?
Come here.
The footage is courtesy of the DEA.
Guy in the black shirt is Pedro Fuentes, accountant for the third most powerful cartel in Columbia.
And your brother is making a deal to launder his drug money.
How much can you handle, ten?
Ten million should be fine, once I get it in and out of Singapore.
And the meet was supposed to go down today.
You had no idea?
We had it all set up to take them all down as soon as we saw the money.
Yeah, except sometime today, your brother changed the plan.
And now they've all gone under.
If you have any idea where your brother is, you need to tell us right now, detective.
I have no clue, you understand me?
- What?
- You gotta tell them.
- You gotta tell them.
- I gotta tell them what?
Tell them what you told me.
That your brother's got plans to leave the island.
McGarrett, you know where Williams is?
Yeah, I do.
He's got a boat in Kawela Bay on the North Shore, okay?
I'm sorry, Danny.
All right, you heard him.
Let's go, people.
Thank you.
Hey, this is Matt.
You know what to do.
Matty.
Matty.
Mathew Williams, hey!
Gonna shoot me, Danny?
I should shoot you, you stupid son of a bitch.
Laundering money for drug dealers?
What the hell's the matter with you?
- I had no choice.
- You did have a choice.
You had a choice.
I gave you a choice.
I said I was gonna help you.
I said I'd get you through this.
Didn't I?
It's not that simple, Danny.
This isn't you beating up cousin Jimmy because he stole my bike.
Matthew, listen to me.
You are gonna turn yourself in.
You are gonna turn yourself in!
Go to federal prison?
I'd never survive, Danny.
I'm not strong enough.
I'm not you!
What the hell is the matter with you?
Huh?
What'd you do?
You went through with it?
What is that?
What is that, getaway money?
It wasn't supposed to be a getaway, Danny.
I was trying to...
I was trying to fix things.
You're trying to fix things?
So, what are you gonna do, huh?
Just gonna run away?
You're gonna fly off?
You're gonna forget about us?
Is that your plan?
Hey, I'm asking you a question.
What about Mom and Dad, huh?
What about Grace?
We're your family, Matty.
This ends one of two ways, big brother.
You either shoot me or you say goodbye.
Danny, what's happened?
He's gone.
Matty's gone.
I lost him.
Gentlemen, I want you to take a good look at this pie chart.
It represents all the money in the world.
Now, can you see which portion is controlled by De Longpre International?
De Longpre International?
Oh, you can't?
Well, maybe I should zoom in.
Oh, look.
There it is.
There's our piece of the pie.
Doesn't seem like enough for a meal, does it?
All the other companies have their bellies full of money pie while Daddy's up here with his tummy grumbling!
Now, who wants to take responsibility for this?
Anyone?
!
Anyone?
!
No one?
!
All right, then I'll decide.
Mark, it's you.
You're fired.
Um, I'm Mark.
Okay.
Then who are you?
My name's Todd.
Well, Todd, today's your lucky day-- Mark here just saved your job.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an appointment with a yummy fruit cup.
Brian.
Spoon me.
What a moron.
Does he have any clue what this company does?
Okay, okay, enough.
Thankfully, we only have to do that once a month.
But remember, his father built this company from the ground up, so we have to maintain the illusion that he has a job here.
Now, let's get ready for the real meeting.
Mark, you actually are fired, though.
De Longpre accidentally nailed that one.

You like this here by the window, Pat?
I could probably just scootch in next to Joel.
Allen Gregory, we should probably just go to our normal table.
Shut the hell up.
I'm trying to work this.
- Uh, what are you doing?
Oh, don't mind us, Joel.
Just looking for a place to land here.
Well, I am minding you, because this is our table.
Joel, let him sit.
I'm sorry.
What'd you say, girl?
Um...
let him sit?
Yeah, that's what I thought you said:
"Let him sit."
And then what?
Let him move in to my house?
- Let him have sex with my mom?
- Well, no, I didn't think...
That's right, you didn't think.
Uh-oh, looks like somebody better get in between you two.
Lez eat!
Hold up.
Hold up.
Incoming!
His underwear's not dry no more 'cause there's chocolate milks inside!
So, what-what did we decide on, the usual table?
I know you wanted to set up shop here, but... it's kind of tight.
I don't want to eat all, like...
You know?
All right, time for workies.
What's on the agenda this afternoon?
Well, first of all, guess who made the front page of the Journal again.
You did!
Mm.
Not a bad shot.
Does my neck look young?
Uh... yes, it loo... young.
Because when I was on the cover last month, my neck didn't look that young.
And I think the readers felt that!
Oh, me, too.
But I think here it comes off extremely young, sir
Like, how young?
Uh... like, mid-30s?
Mm...
Like, early thir...
Mm?
I think mid to late...
Mm...
Probably early...
Twenties...
Twenties.
Twenties.
Yes!
Is that a 21-year-old neck I'm looking at?
Brian!
21!
You!
Maybe I'd buy 25.
Yeah, well...
Okay, next.
Whadda we got, whadda we got, whadda we got, what do we got?
Well, the Atlanta office has a problem that's got them totally stumped.
Red pape..
or blue paper?
Mm...
For anything specific, or...?
Just in general.
Right.
Okay.
Bl.
Wait!
No.
Yes!
Blue!
Wow!
You just nailed that, sir.
That's why, that is why
I'm an assistant and you're Super-CEO.
That's exactly why, Brian.
Hey, this sounds important.
I'll get it.
Hello?
I'll tell him.
There's been a crisis in Japanese markets.
They need you to make a decision: buy or sell?
How about... both?
Yoshi?
He says both.
You brilliant son of a bitch!
You saved the company again!
Aw, you helped.
And there she blows.
There's the day.
Sorry.
I can never remember.
What's the code for the elevator?
You... just hit the down button.
The down button.
Gotcha.
All right, here's tonight's homework.
Geen, sweetheart, think we could button up that blouse all the way to the neck?
Catching those weird bumps from the saline bags.
Trying to bang off a couple of e-mails here, baby.
Okay, I don't have...
It's not worth it.
Okay, Joel Zadak is out sick today, so could someone volunteer to bring him his homework, please?
Oh, me, me, me, me, me...
I mean, uh,
I guess I'll do it.
I'm gonna have to move something...
Can I?
Get away with a 10:00 a.m....
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I live on his street.
Well, that's very sweet...
Patrick.
Thank you...
Patrick.
Patrick, a word outside, please?
Hand it over.
But Ms. Winthrop said I should bring it...
I don't care what that filthy whore said.
I'm bringing Joel his homework.
But it's easier if I...
Patrick, you have no idea how close you are right now.
Close to...
Patrick.
What am I close to?
Patrick.
Okay, I got the Wall Street Journals.
Oh, what are all these?
I just said it-- the 50 copies like you asked for.
What?
!
I didn't ask for 'em.
But since they're here, what's going on with them?
Nothing.
They're just here now.
♪ Julie!
Just in time!
♪
Guess who's got the neck of a teenager on the front page of the Wall Street Journal.
Please don't make me play this game again.
That isn't my neck.
Wait a second.
That isn't my face.
That's some army guy's neck and face!
Why doesn't this look like the one I got at work?
Uh, Richard, this isn't a real Wall Street Journal.
At all.
Ooh, look at this hotshot, huh, Pilar?
He knows what a newspaper looks like!
He's right, Dad.
Yes, that one looks fake.
Okay, Pilar, that's all for the day.
Thank you so much.
Something does seem off.
Its fakeness?
Not sure what.
Anyway...
Richard, aren't you at all curious why someone made this?
Yes, I am.
Anyway...
I think we should go down to your office and find out what's going on.
Mm, I don't know if my office is even happening anymore today.
It's... 3:30.
I'm pretty sure it's still happening.
Or... is this happening?
Beep!
Get the car.
Oh, my God!
Not yet, buddy.
You're still with us.
Brought over a few zinc geltabs.
Think you can keep these babies down?
What are you doing here?
Oh, just watching you sleep.
And Gina asked me to bring you your homework-- and I was, like,
I'll do it for Zadak, not for you, you stuck-up bitch, and...
How long have you been in my room?
About ten, 15.
Plus, I watched Castle with your dad for a hot 45.
He is the best, right?
Okay, if you don't get out of my face,
I'm gonna put your face...
Lost it.
Through the wall?
No, it was something better than that.
Into your fist?
What?
Why would I say it like that?
The order is all wrong.
All wrong.
Right.
You'd probably start...
Start with the fist.
End with the face, yeah.
Right.
It's okay, buddy, you're off your game.
I need you to focus on getting well.
And in the meantime,
I'll hold it down at school, whatever.
You stay here until I get back tomorrow.
Don't come back here.
I'll come back here, fill you on school stuff, let you know what Guillermo and Ian are getting all mixed up into, and after that, if we want to throw in Kate and Leopold, we'll throw in Kate and Leopold.
We're not watching Kate and Leopold.
We'll watch ten minutes of Kate and Leopold, we'll see how you like it, and then we'll watch the rest.
Hello, Jennifer.
Oh.
Hello, Mr. De Longpre.
Sir, Mr. De Longpre's here.
I know he was here this morning;
I'm telling you
I just saw him.
I'm in position.
Oops.
Excuse me.
- Ah, cart.
Now we're screwed.
- Yep.
Well, no, we can just walk over here.
Oh, all... uh...
Oh, good.
You made it.
Yeah, sorry, Mr. De Longpre, door's on the fritz.
Afraid it's gonna be a few days before it's operational.
Again?
!
Why is this always happening?
Richard, they're doing this.
There's no such thing as a door on the fritz.
But the man said.
Go in there.
Bzzz!
That was him.
He made that sound with his mouth.
You can open that door.
Julian!
- Actually, it's Brian.
- Brian!
Hey, guys.
How you holding up?
- Hi, Allen Gregory.
- Holding up?
What do you mean?
Look at you, falling apart on us already.
Maybe this'll help.
I saw Joel last night.
He said he doesn't want to miss anything while he's out sick.
He thinks I should be his eyes and ears until he comes back.
I don't understand.
Yeah, that seems kind of weird.
So you're disagreeing with Joel on this?
You're saying Joel's wrong?
You're challenging his authority and you hate Joel?
Just trying to get it all down for him.
Well, I-I guess if he really said so.
Wonderful.
I'm gonna escort Brinique to class.
So let's reconvene at the cafeteria.
Our usual table, where we always sit together?
Hey!
Eyes straight ahead!
She's not a piece of meat, you animal!
Thanks for that.
Oh, absolutely.
A lot more where that came from.
Hey!
Oh, were you not...
Sorry about that.
He wasn't looking.
False alarm.
Okay.
This is me.
Oh.
Social studies!
You good?
Got everything?
Books?
Yep.
In my bag.
Okay, I'm gonna write down my cell.
If you need anything, you call this number, you hear me?
Yeah, okay.
Thanks.
You're really nice, Allen Gregory.
Oh, stop.
Get to class, you.
Wow!
You were talking to Brinique?
Oh, was I?
Yeah.
Brinique, she's a good kid.
I think she kind of likes you.
What did you say?
Don't you ever say that again!
Everything I do, I do it for Joel!
He's coming back, and until that day, what's his is his, capisce?
I'm sorry, Allen Gregory.
Hey, it's all right.
You're just a baby-- you didn't know any better.
I demand to know what's going on!
I just walked in on my assistant making a fake newspaper.
My phone isn't connected to anything!
I'm Super-CEO!
I want answers or I get my dad in here!
All right, have a seat.
The thing is, Richard...
Start talking!
I am talking.
The thing is, Super-CEO isn't a real position.
You don't actually do anything here.
That's ridiculous.
I choose red or blue paper.
And I've never been wrong.
Your father has us give you pointless jobs like that to distract you, because he doesn't think you can handle any real ones.
Poo!
I can do any job at this company.
I can do your job, I can do my assistant's job.
I can be the guy who takes the cars when you walk in and drives them around all day.
I demand to be given some real responsibilities!
I know things.
Squeeze me out, and I'll take this whole company down with me.
What do you know?
Well, I know that the founder's son took out his wiener at the shareholders' meeting.
That was you.
You did that.
Right!
That's how I know.
All right, tomorrow we'll give this a try, see what you're made of.
You will see what I'm made of, so get everybody ready.
I will.
Oh, you want me to... now?
Uh, everyone?
Richard De Longpre will be coming in tomorrow to show us what he's made of.
Mm-hmm.
So, get ready for that.
Thank you.
Guillermo, look at you trying brie for the first time.
What do you think, my man?
It's my new favorite cheese.
Damn right it is, you silly freak.
Now give me a sound bite I can take back to Joel.
You can express to Joel that it tastes good in my mouth?
Perfect.
He'll love that.
Hi, Allen Gregory.
Here's that get-well card for Zadak you asked for.
Thank you, Patrick.
I will take that and in turn give you this.
I got to say, Allen Gregory, it's pretty cool having you around.
- It is enjoyable, Allen Gregory.
- Yeah, it really is pretty cool.
Aw, you guys, cut it out.
Um, Allen Gregory, what if I said I didn't want Joel to come back?
Aw, Little 'Niquey,
I see what's going on here.
Joel's gone, and you're feeling that void.
But I like you...
Shush-ush-ush-ush.
You don't.
I mean, you do-- how could you not?
-- but you don't.
Now write something nice on that card, you doof.
That a girl.
Guillermo, baby, go ahead and swallow that coleslaw down and give this a monster lick for me, pal.
Okay, so let's start with third quarter estimates.
Idea.
Books you can read in the shower.
Whoo!
Where did that come from?
Do you know what this company even does?
Yikes, buddy, seems like you should have worked that out on your own time.
Okay, let's just go over the Nike account.
Todd, are you all set to finalize that deal today?
Yes, it's all in place;
I just have to make a call...
That account is mine and you know it!
Richard.
No, no, no!
You need a guy with big ideas, and I'm the only one who's got 'em.
Elliptical machine for dogs!
Richard, please sit down.
That's what they told Rosa Parks, and she sat down, all right, but I won't.
Fine.
Todd, Richard's handling the account now.
Richard, Todd already put the deal together, so all you have to do is confirm it by phone.
All right, guess I'll try and squeeze it in.
Ugh, this Nike account's busting my balls.
You feel me, Todd?
Okay, what else, what else, what else?
Ian's new sweater-- covered that.
Oh, this was crazy-- at lunch,
Guillermo got a Tater Tot with a piece of corn inside.
His face was like, "What?"
I was all, "I am telling Joel about that."
Please get out of here now.
Starting to drift off, huh?
Okay, one more order of business.
Brought you a little get-well card.
It's from all of us but purchased and coordinated by me specifically.
See what I wrote?
Read it out loud.
That's okay, I have it memorized.
"Dear J, I am so sick of you being sick, so you better get better."
And that's from right here, padre.
Brinique wants to break up with me.
Brinique's breaking up with you?
I am baffled, because there were honestly no warning signs.
D-Did she mention why or...?
She just wrote she found someone else.
Doesn't say who.
Okay, yes, that is a relief to whoever that is.
Well, I guess we can go ahead and rule out the definitely nots, starting with the two big dogs in this room.
Hey, you think Ian's trying to make a move?
Does he have the rocks?
Things were fine before I left.
Okay, listen, if you cry,
I'm seriously going to lose it all over the place.
I cannot handle that right now because I am sitting here, watching my best friend in the universe go through this, and I am just like...
I'm not crying.
Oh, good, you've always been the stronger of the two of us, J.
I'm coming back to school tomorrow.
I'll talk to her then.
Tomorrow?
No.
No, no, no, stop that, stop.
I'm gonna tuck you in here like a little cocoon so you can wake up a little butterfly.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
Ju-Just tucking you in.
Keeps the heat from escaping.
Don't ever do that again.
Right, gotcha.
So we've discovered the line, I guess.
I got to say, this whole real-job thing feels pretty much the same, except now my door locks from the inside.
Well, the Nike rep is supposed to call any minute.
Remember, all you have to do is agree to the terms, okay?
Mr. De Longpre?
What does the VH stand for?
What?
In VH1.
Hmm, let's table that.
Richard De Longpre.
I'm on the phone.
Mr. De Longpre, Dan Pearson from Nike.
Can the pleasantries, Pearson!
You know what I want.
Well, the deal I had arranged with Todd had us offering 400,000 per...
Todd's out, and it's 500,000 now.
500,000?
That's what I heard myself saying.
Wow, that is high, uh, but our companies have been doing business together for a long time.
Uh, I guess we can agree to that.
Not so fast, pal.
You bit on that offer pretty quick.
Big mistake 'cause now it's ten million.
Okay, I'm not sure what's going on.
I'm hanging up.
I'm hanging up first!
Got those bastards on the run.
Sir, I really think you should...
Relax, Chippy.
They're shaking in their boots.
In a little while they'll call back, beg us to let 'em sign.
All we have to do is wait.
We lost Nike!
Ah, damn.
C-T, maybe pull a couple weights off for me, drop it down to 210.
Whoa, Allen Gregory, you usually kill it on the press.
Something wrong?
I don't know, it's just not working out like I thought it would.
Why?
You're in tight with Guillermo and Ian, right?
Got Brinique begging for it.
What else you want?
I guess I just thought we'd be doing it together.
Me and you?
I don't know, I work here most days.
I mean, I could probably get out to...
No, no, no, me and Zadak.
Ah... check this out.
In 20 years you're gonna look back and realize that your elementary school popularity was the most important thing that ever happened to you.
You got to put this kid in the ground.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
When he shows up at school, you show him that you got his girl and you got his crew and you step on his neck.
You got the juice now, AG.
You gonna give that up just so you can be friends with Zadak?
But I'm not even interested in Brinique.
Hey, I wasn't all that interested in Christina Ricci, but you do it for your career.
I'll tell you a story.
Just let me make sure I'm not calling her by accident in my pocket.
Wait, do I have a phone?
I can't go in there.
They're just going to yell at me and give me less stuff to do.
Well, yeah, I'm sure they'll do both of those things.
And since I'm the coward that I am,
I'll probably just take it in the rump and limp on out of there.
Or you fix it.
You get Nike back.
Oh, Jeremy, and how am I supposed to do that?
You'll figure it out, and after you do, you'll demand another monster account and another one after that and another one after that because you're the super-CEO of De Longpre International.
It's a fake title.
Only if you allow it to be.
Now, you go in there and you show them it's real.
So Zadak comes back today, huh?
What's it been, two days?
Feels more like two years.
I like it better without him.
Is that so crazy?
It's not crazy, Guillermo.
I feel the same way.
And I guess you're going through with the whole breakup?
Uh-huh, yeah.
Ah, Brinique-- little sweet, black Brinique.
Look, there is Joel coming through the door right now.
Hey, guys, somebody move over.
Daddy's back.
Brinique, what's the deal, babe?
Why won't anyone look at me?
Oh, my God, please don't cry.
Ugh, you can't let this happen, you big sap.
Joel, so glad you're back, pal.
I was starting to think I'd have to hang out with these chumps forever.
Who's a chump-- me?
Like this rube going on and on about his truck collection.
We get it, man, you like trucks.
Well, guess what-- four is not a collection.
I hate trucks, and I have seven!
And look at this big old churro, strung out on brie like a frigging junkie.
Fun fact about brie-- it's $6.50 a pound.
If you were $6.50 a pound, you'd cost a billion pesos.
'Cause your currency's worthless.
Allen Gregory, why are you doing this?
I'm sorry, what'd you say?
I just don't understand.
That's right, you don't.
Remember when I walked you to class?
Well, guess what.
It was on my way.
Yep, these losers are all yours.
No, Allen Gregory, you're the loser.
These are my friends, and no one talks to my friends like that.
Do it.
Say it with me, guys.
Incoming!
His underpants are yet again wet with milks.
Thanks for sticking up for me.
You got it.
So, Guillermo, you had a corn in your Tater Tot?
Tell me the whole story, go.
Welcome back, sir, back where you belong.
Hey, Allen Gregory, I saw what happened over there.
Don't worry, I'll still be your fr...
Take off your pants and give them to me.
Richard, we need to know what happened.
Okay, okay, here's how it went.
I'm on the phone, all set to close the deal, but then this guy comes over and starts chanting,
"Ten mil, ten mil!"
And I'm shaking my head like, "No, thanks,"
but then he starts going like this.
And I'm thinking, "I'd better do it or this maniac is gonna punch me."
Okay, none of that is true.
Look, Richard, we're not looking for excuses right now.
We need answers--- what are we going to do?
Without Nike, our three-year projections will tank.
He doesn't even know what our company does!
Somebody's got to be held accountable.
How are you going to fix this?
What could you possibly have said?
A very frustrating situation.
He's an idiot.
How are you going to fix this?
Richard, Richard.
Richard?
Blue?
What was that?
Blue paper?
You think we should try the blue paper?
Yeah?
Hello, Nike?
Richard says blue.
We're back.
Whoo!
There he is.
So he bought it?
He bought it.
Nice work.
So how'd it go?
You show 'em who's boss?
I sure did.
Rich, I'm really proud of you.
Well, I guess I deserve that.
Now take me home, Jeremy.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Gentlemen, I want you to take a good look at this pie chart.
It represents all the money in the world.
Now, can you see which portion is controlled by De Longpre International?
De Longpre International?
Oh, you can't?
Well, maybe I should zoom in.
Oh, look.
There it is.
There's our piece of the pie.
Doesn't seem like enough for a meal, does it?
All the other companies have their bellies full of money pie while Daddy's up here with his tummy grumbling!
Now, who wants to take responsibility for this?
Anyone?
!
Anyone?
!
No one?
!
All right, then I'll decide.
Mark, it's you.
You're fired.
Um, I'm Mark.
Okay.
Then who are you?
My name's Todd.
Well, Todd, today's your lucky day-- Mark here just saved your job.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an appointment with a yummy fruit cup.
Brian.
(high-pitched):
Spoon me.
What a moron.
Does he have any clue what this company does?
Okay, okay, enough.
Thankfully, we only have to do that once a month.
But remember, his father built this company from the ground up, so we have to maintain the illusion that he has a job here.
Now, let's get ready for the real meeting.
Mark, you actually are fired, though.
De Longpre accidentally nailed that one.

You like this here by the window, Pat?
I could probably just scootch in next to Joel.
Allen Gregory, we should probably just go to our normal table.
(whispers):
Shut the hell up.
I'm trying to work this.
- Uh, what are you doing?
Oh, don't mind us, Joel.
Just looking for a place to land here.
Well, I am minding you, because this is our table.
GIRL:
Joel, let him sit.
I'm sorry.
What'd you say, girl?
Um...
let him sit?
Yeah, that's what I thought you said:
"Let him sit."
And then what?
Let him move in to my house?
- Let him have sex with my mom?
- Well, no, I didn't think...
That's right, you didn't think.
Uh-oh, looks like somebody better get in between you two.
Lez eat!
Hold up.
Hold up.
Incoming!
(kids laughing)
His underwear's not dry no more 'cause there's chocolate milks inside!
So, what-what did we decide on, the usual table?
I know you wanted to set up shop here, but... it's kind of tight.
I don't want to eat all, like... (grunting)
(chuckles):
You know?
RICHARD:
All right, time for workies.
What's on the agenda this afternoon?
Well, first of all, guess who made the front page of the Journal again.
You did!
RICHARD:
Mm.
Not a bad shot.
Does my neck look young?
Uh... yes, it loo... young.
Because when I was on the cover last month, my neck didn't look that young.
And I think the readers felt that!
Oh, me, too.
But I think here it comes off extremely young, sir
Like, how young?
Uh... like, mid-30s?
Mm...
Like, early thir...
Mm?
I think mid to late...
Mm...
Probably early...
Twenties...
Twenties.
Twenties.
Yes!
Is that a 21-year-old neck I'm looking at?
Brian!
21!
You!
Maybe I'd buy 25.
(laughing) Yeah, well...
Okay, next.
Whadda we got, whadda we got, whadda we got, what do we got?
Well, the Atlanta office has a problem that's got them totally stumped.
Red pape..
or blue paper?
Mm...
For anything specific, or...?
Just in general.
Right.
Okay.
Bl.
Wait!
No.
Yes!
Blue!
Wow!
You just nailed that, sir.
That's why, that is why
I'm an assistant and you're Super-CEO.
That's exactly why, Brian.
(phone ringing) Hey, this sounds important.
I'll get it.
Hello?
I'll tell him.
There's been a crisis in Japanese markets.
They need you to make a decision: buy or sell?
How about... both?
Yoshi?
He says both.
You brilliant son of a bitch!
You saved the company again!
Aw, you helped.
(beeping)
And there she blows.
There's the day.
Sorry.
I can never remember.
What's the code for the elevator?
You... just hit the down button.
The down button.
Gotcha.
(birds chirping)
All right, here's tonight's homework.
Geen, sweetheart, think we could button up that blouse all the way to the neck?
Catching those weird bumps from the saline bags.
Trying to bang off a couple of e-mails here, baby.
Okay, I don't have... (quietly):
It's not worth it.
Okay, Joel Zadak is out sick today, so could someone volunteer to bring him his homework, please?
Oh, me, me, me, me, me... (clears throat) I mean, uh,
(chuckles):
I guess I'll do it.
I'm gonna have to move something...
Can I?
Get away with a 10:00 a.m....
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I live on his street.
Well, that's very sweet...
Patrick.
Thank you...
Patrick.
Patrick, a word outside, please?
(echoing thud) Hand it over.
But Ms. Winthrop said I should bring it...
I don't care what that filthy whore said.
I'm bringing Joel his homework.
But it's easier if I...
Patrick, you have no idea how close you are right now.
Close to...
Patrick.
What am I close to?
Patrick.
(bell dings) Okay, I got the Wall Street Journals.
Oh, what are all these?
I just said it-- the 50 copies like you asked for.
What?
!
I didn't ask for 'em.
But since they're here, what's going on with them?
Nothing.
They're just here now.
♪ Julie!
Just in time!
♪
Guess who's got the neck of a teenager on the front page of the Wall Street Journal.
Please don't make me play this game again.
That isn't my neck.
Wait a second.
That isn't my face.
That's some army guy's neck and face!
Why doesn't this look like the one I got at work?
Uh, Richard, this isn't a real Wall Street Journal.
At all.
Ooh, look at this hotshot, huh, Pilar?
He knows what a newspaper looks like!
He's right, Dad.
Yes, that one looks fake.
Okay, Pilar, that's all for the day.
Thank you so much.
Something does seem off.
Its fakeness?
Not sure what.
Anyway...
Richard, aren't you at all curious why someone made this?
Yes, I am.
Anyway...
I think we should go down to your office and find out what's going on.
Mm, I don't know if my office is even happening anymore today.
It's... 3:30.
I'm pretty sure it's still happening.
Or... is this happening?
Beep!
Get the car.
(birds chirping)
Oh, my God!
Not yet, buddy.
You're still with us.
Brought over a few zinc geltabs.
Think you can keep these babies down?
What are you doing here?
Oh, just watching you sleep.
And Gina asked me to bring you your homework-- and I was, like,
I'll do it for Zadak, not for you, you stuck-up bitch, and...
How long have you been in my room?
About ten, 15.
Plus, I watched Castle with your dad for a hot 45.
He is the best, right?
Okay, if you don't get out of my face,
I'm gonna put your face... (sighs) Lost it.
Through the wall?
No, it was something better than that.
Into your fist?
What?
Why would I say it like that?
The order is all wrong.
All wrong.
Right.
You'd probably start...
Start with the fist.
End with the face, yeah.
Right.
It's okay, buddy, you're off your game.
I need you to focus on getting well.
And in the meantime,
I'll hold it down at school, whatever.
You stay here until I get back tomorrow.
Don't come back here.
I'll come back here, fill you on school stuff, let you know what Guillermo and Ian are getting all mixed up into, and after that, if we want to throw in Kate and Leopold, we'll throw in Kate and Leopold.
We're not watching Kate and Leopold.
We'll watch ten minutes of Kate and Leopold, we'll see how you like it, and then we'll watch the rest.
(groans)
(elevator bell dings)
Hello, Jennifer.
Oh.
Hello, Mr. De Longpre.
Sir, Mr. De Longpre's here.
I know he was here this morning;
I'm telling you
I just saw him.
I'm in position.
Oops.
Excuse me.
- Ah, cart.
Now we're screwed.
- Yep.
Well, no, we can just walk over here.
Oh, all... uh...
Oh, good.
You made it.
Yeah, sorry, Mr. De Longpre, door's on the fritz.
Afraid it's gonna be a few days before it's operational.
Again?
!
Why is this always happening?
Richard, they're doing this.
There's no such thing as a door on the fritz.
But the man said.
Go in there.
Bzzz!
(gasps)
That was him.
He made that sound with his mouth.
You can open that door.
Julian!
- Actually, it's Brian.
- Brian!
Hey, guys.
How you holding up?
- Hi, Allen Gregory.
- Holding up?
What do you mean?
(sighs) Look at you, falling apart on us already.
Maybe this'll help.
I saw Joel last night.
He said he doesn't want to miss anything while he's out sick.
He thinks I should be his eyes and ears until he comes back.
I don't understand.
Yeah, that seems kind of weird.
So you're disagreeing with Joel on this?
You're saying Joel's wrong?
You're challenging his authority and you hate Joel?
Just trying to get it all down for him.
Well, I-I guess if he really said so.
Wonderful.
I'm gonna escort Brinique to class.
So let's reconvene at the cafeteria.
Our usual table, where we always sit together?
Hey!
Eyes straight ahead!
She's not a piece of meat, you animal!
Thanks for that.
Oh, absolutely.
A lot more where that came from.
Hey!
Oh, were you not...
Sorry about that.
He wasn't looking.
False alarm.
Okay.
This is me.
Oh.
(goofy voice):
Social studies!
(giggles)
You good?
Got everything?
Books?
Yep.
In my bag.
Okay, I'm gonna write down my cell.
If you need anything, you call this number, you hear me?
Yeah, okay.
Thanks.
You're really nice, Allen Gregory.
Oh, stop.
Get to class, you.
Wow!
You were talking to Brinique?
Oh, was I?
Yeah.
Brinique, she's a good kid.
I think she kind of likes you.
What did you say?
(gasps)
Don't you ever say that again!
Everything I do, I do it for Joel!
He's coming back, and until that day, what's his is his, capisce?
I'm sorry, Allen Gregory.
Hey, it's all right.
You're just a baby-- you didn't know any better.
I demand to know what's going on!
I just walked in on my assistant making a fake newspaper.
My phone isn't connected to anything!
I'm Super-CEO!
I want answers or I get my dad in here!
All right, have a seat.
The thing is, Richard...
Start talking!
I am talking.
The thing is, Super-CEO isn't a real position.
You don't actually do anything here.
That's ridiculous.
I choose red or blue paper.
And I've never been wrong.
Your father has us give you pointless jobs like that to distract you, because he doesn't think you can handle any real ones.
Poo!
I can do any job at this company.
I can do your job, I can do my assistant's job.
I can be the guy who takes the cars when you walk in and drives them around all day.
I demand to be given some real responsibilities!
I know things.
Squeeze me out, and I'll take this whole company down with me.
What do you know?
Well, I know that the founder's son took out his wiener at the shareholders' meeting.
That was you.
You did that.
Right!
That's how I know.
All right, tomorrow we'll give this a try, see what you're made of.
You will see what I'm made of, so get everybody ready.
I will.
Oh, you want me to... now?
(dial tone) Uh, everyone?
Richard De Longpre will be coming in tomorrow to show us what he's made of.
Mm-hmm.
So, get ready for that.
Thank you.
(door closes)
(sighs)
Guillermo, look at you trying brie for the first time.
What do you think, my man?
It's my new favorite cheese.
Damn right it is, you silly freak.
Now give me a sound bite I can take back to Joel.
You can express to Joel that it tastes good in my mouth?
Perfect.
He'll love that.
PATRICK:
Hi, Allen Gregory.
Here's that get-well card for Zadak you asked for.
(in funny voice):
Thank you, Patrick.
I will take that and in turn give you this.
(laughter)
I got to say, Allen Gregory, it's pretty cool having you around.
- It is enjoyable, Allen Gregory.
- Yeah, it really is pretty cool.
Aw, you guys, cut it out.
Um, Allen Gregory, what if I said I didn't want Joel to come back?
Aw, Little 'Niquey,
I see what's going on here.
Joel's gone, and you're feeling that void.
But I like you...
Shush-ush-ush-ush.
You don't.
I mean, you do-- how could you not?
-- but you don't.
Now write something nice on that card, you doof.
That a girl.
Guillermo, baby, go ahead and swallow that coleslaw down and give this a monster lick for me, pal.
Okay, so let's start with third quarter estimates.
Idea.
Books you can read in the shower.
Whoo!
Where did that come from?
Do you know what this company even does?
Yikes, buddy, seems like you should have worked that out on your own time.
Okay, let's just go over the Nike account.
Todd, are you all set to finalize that deal today?
Yes, it's all in place;
I just have to make a call...
That account is mine and you know it!
Richard.
No, no, no!
You need a guy with big ideas, and I'm the only one who's got 'em.
Elliptical machine for dogs!
Richard, please sit down.
That's what they told Rosa Parks, and she sat down, all right, but I won't.
(sighs) Fine.
Todd, Richard's handling the account now.
Richard, Todd already put the deal together, so all you have to do is confirm it by phone.
All right, guess I'll try and squeeze it in.
Ugh, this Nike account's busting my balls.
You feel me, Todd?
ALLEN GREGORY:
Okay, what else, what else, what else?
Ian's new sweater-- covered that.
Oh, this was crazy-- at lunch,
Guillermo got a Tater Tot with a piece of corn inside.
(laughing):
His face was like, "What?"
I was all, "I am telling Joel about that."
Please get out of here now.
Starting to drift off, huh?
Okay, one more order of business.
Brought you a little get-well card.
It's from all of us but purchased and coordinated by me specifically.
See what I wrote?
Read it out loud.
That's okay, I have it memorized.
"Dear J, I am so sick of you being sick, so you better get better."
And that's from right here, padre.
Brinique wants to break up with me.
Brinique's breaking up with you?
I am baffled, because there were honestly no warning signs.
D-Did she mention why or...?
She just wrote she found someone else.
Doesn't say who.
Okay, yes, that is a relief to whoever that is.
Well, I guess we can go ahead and rule out the definitely nots, starting with the two big dogs in this room.
Hey, you think Ian's trying to make a move?
Does he have the rocks?
Things were fine before I left.
Okay, listen, if you cry,
I'm seriously going to lose it all over the place.
I cannot handle that right now because I am sitting here, watching my best friend in the universe go through this, and I am just like...
I'm not crying.
Oh, good, you've always been the stronger of the two of us, J.
I'm coming back to school tomorrow.
I'll talk to her then.
Tomorrow?
No.
No, no, no, stop that, stop.
I'm gonna tuck you in here like a little cocoon so you can wake up a little butterfly.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
Ju-Just tucking you in.
Keeps the heat from escaping.
Don't ever do that again.
Right, gotcha.
So we've discovered the line, I guess.
I got to say, this whole real-job thing feels pretty much the same, except now my door locks from the inside.
Well, the Nike rep is supposed to call any minute.
Remember, all you have to do is agree to the terms, okay?
Mr. De Longpre?
What does the VH stand for?
What?
In VH1.
(phone rings)
Hmm, let's table that.
Richard De Longpre.
I'm on the phone.
Mr. De Longpre, Dan Pearson from Nike.
Can the pleasantries, Pearson!
You know what I want.
Well, the deal I had arranged with Todd had us offering 400,000 per...
Todd's out, and it's 500,000 now.
500,000?
That's what I heard myself saying.
Wow, that is high, uh, but our companies have been doing business together for a long time.
Uh, I guess we can agree to that.
Not so fast, pal.
You bit on that offer pretty quick.
Big mistake 'cause now it's ten million.
Okay, I'm not sure what's going on.
I'm hanging up.
I'm hanging up first!
Got those bastards on the run.
Sir, I really think you should...
Relax, Chippy.
They're shaking in their boots.
In a little while they'll call back, beg us to let 'em sign.
All we have to do is wait.
We lost Nike!
Ah, damn.
(grunting)
(exhales)
C-T, maybe pull a couple weights off for me, drop it down to 210.
Whoa, Allen Gregory, you usually kill it on the press.
Something wrong?
I don't know, it's just not working out like I thought it would.
Why?
You're in tight with Guillermo and Ian, right?
Got Brinique begging for it.
What else you want?
I guess I just thought we'd be doing it together.
Me and you?
I don't know, I work here most days.
I mean, I could probably get out to...
No, no, no, me and Zadak.
Ah... check this out.
In 20 years you're gonna look back and realize that your elementary school popularity was the most important thing that ever happened to you.
You got to put this kid in the ground.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
When he shows up at school, you show him that you got his girl and you got his crew and you step on his neck.
You got the juice now, AG.
You gonna give that up just so you can be friends with Zadak?
But I'm not even interested in Brinique.
Hey, I wasn't all that interested in Christina Ricci, but you do it for your career.
I'll tell you a story.
Just let me make sure I'm not calling her by accident in my pocket.
Wait, do I have a phone?
I can't go in there.
They're just going to yell at me and give me less stuff to do.
Well, yeah, I'm sure they'll do both of those things.
And since I'm the coward that I am,
I'll probably just take it in the rump and limp on out of there.
Or you fix it.
You get Nike back.
Oh, Jeremy, and how am I supposed to do that?
You'll figure it out, and after you do, you'll demand another monster account and another one after that and another one after that because you're the super-CEO of De Longpre International.
It's a fake title.
Only if you allow it to be.
Now, you go in there and you show them it's real.
So Zadak comes back today, huh?
What's it been, two days?
Feels more like two years.
I like it better without him.
Is that so crazy?
It's not crazy, Guillermo.
I feel the same way.
And I guess you're going through with the whole breakup?
Uh-huh, yeah.
Ah, Brinique-- little sweet, black Brinique.
Look, there is Joel coming through the door right now.
Hey, guys, somebody move over.
Daddy's back.
Brinique, what's the deal, babe?
Why won't anyone look at me?
Oh, my God, please don't cry.
Ugh, you can't let this happen, you big sap.
Joel, so glad you're back, pal.
I was starting to think I'd have to hang out with these chumps forever.
Who's a chump-- me?
Like this rube going on and on about his truck collection.
We get it, man, you like trucks.
Well, guess what-- four is not a collection.
I hate trucks, and I have seven!
(whimpers) And look at this big old churro, strung out on brie like a frigging junkie.
Fun fact about brie-- it's $6.50 a pound.
If you were $6.50 a pound, you'd cost a billion pesos.
'Cause your currency's worthless.
Allen Gregory, why are you doing this?
I'm sorry, what'd you say?
I just don't understand.
That's right, you don't.
Remember when I walked you to class?
Well, guess what.
It was on my way.
(sniffles)
Yep, these losers are all yours.
No, Allen Gregory, you're the loser.
These are my friends, and no one talks to my friends like that.
Do it.
Say it with me, guys.
ALL:
Incoming!
(laughter)
GUILLERMO:
His underpants are yet again wet with milks.
Thanks for sticking up for me.
You got it.
So, Guillermo, you had a corn in your Tater Tot?
Tell me the whole story, go.
Welcome back, sir, back where you belong.
Hey, Allen Gregory, I saw what happened over there.
Don't worry, I'll still be your fr...
Take off your pants and give them to me.
(indistinct chatter)
Richard, we need to know what happened.
Okay, okay, here's how it went.
I'm on the phone, all set to close the deal, but then this guy comes over and starts chanting,
"Ten mil, ten mil!"
And I'm shaking my head like, "No, thanks,"
but then he starts going like this.
And I'm thinking, "I'd better do it or this maniac is gonna punch me."
Okay, none of that is true.
Look, Richard, we're not looking for excuses right now.
We need answers--- what are we going to do?
Without Nike, our three-year projections will tank.
He doesn't even know what our company does!
Somebody's got to be held accountable.
How are you going to fix this?
What could you possibly have said?
A very frustrating situation.
He's an idiot.
How are you going to fix this?
Richard, Richard.
Richard?
Blue?
What was that?
Blue paper?
You think we should try the blue paper?
Yeah?
Hello, Nike?
Richard says blue.
We're back.
(overlapping chatter)
Whoo!
There he is.
So he bought it?
He bought it.
Nice work.
So how'd it go?
You show 'em who's boss?
I sure did.
Rich, I'm really proud of you.
Well, I guess I deserve that.
Now take me home, Jeremy.

Everybody go easy on Jeremy.
He's a fragile bunny right now since he got fired from another temp job.
I didn't get fired.
That's what a temp job is.
It's temporary.
It just ends.
That's right, kids.
There's nothing to worry about.
The jobs just end for no reason.
Okay, that's not what I'm...
Bup-bup-bup, silver lining.
Now you'll be home more.
The only reason I haven't been home is because you've been forcing me to get a job.
Well, one man's force is another man's pleasure.
Okay.
Oh, speaking of jobless humps,
I fired the maid this morning.
You did?
!
I'm so proud of you!
Must've been one of those temp jobs.
You fired her?
Why?
I walked in the bathroom and let's just say, what happens in Margarita, doesn't stay in Margarita.
Especially Baja shrimp.
You fired the housekeeper for using the bathroom.
Yeah, what's up?
What's the confusion?
Well, what are we gonna do about this?
Hmm.
Well, I guess we're just gonna have to clean up after ourselves.
Okay, let's grab this here, put that on that,
I guess that works.
Ugh!
I cannot do this every day.
Cleaning is hard.
I mean what could I do?
I had to let her go, P.
Was it easy?
No.
Did a little part of me enjoy it?
Of course.
And that's what scares me.
Was she sad about being fired?
Hmm, that's a good question.
Do maids have emotions?
Oh, my God, Patrick!
Um, excuse me, señor?
I don't know his name.
As you can see, my friend has some sort of palsy and knocked over his soda.
Why are you telling me?
How long is your break, old man?
But I do not work here.
No, not anymore you don't.
What does this mean?
I'll tell you what it means.
You're fired.
But I am a student at the school.
You know what?
Maybe it's best that you go before we have to involve security or Immigration.
That got his legs moving, huh?
Hi, Jeremy De Longpre.
I got a call that you had another temp job for me.
It's housekeeping work.
Here's the address.
You need directions?
Uh, I think there's a mistake.
This is my house.
You want directions or not?
No.
Again, I live there.
Do you have anything else?
Oh, yeah, there's plenty of other options.
Left fielder for the Yankees-- would that work for you?
Or hang on-- looks like Bon Jovi needs a new guitarist.
What's wrong with Sambora-- oh, you're being sarcastic.
If you don't want it, that's your biz.
But step aside, 'cause there are plenty of people who do.
Excuse me.
You no take job?
No.
I take job.
Super.
Here are your directions.
Traffic can be a bear that time of day, so please plan accordingly.
Allen Gregory, I've always felt like this goes without saying, but you cannot fire a student!
I know that, Gina!
I didn't fire a student!
He's in the cafeteria every day so I know he works there, but I never see him work, which is why I had to fire him.
Just because Guillermo's Hispanic, it doesn't mean he works in the cafeteria.
Whoa, Gyna, why bring race into it?
Just because he works in the cafeteria doesn't mean he's Hispanic, you monster.
Guillermo is Hispanic.
But he doesn't work in the cafeteria.
Right, because I fired him.
It's like we're talking in circles here.
You know what?
I would send you to detention, but that wouldn't teach you anything.
So you are gonna write a 50-word essay explaining what happened today, and why it was wrong, and what you learned from it.
And what if I don't?
You'll get a failing grade, and I'll see you here in my classroom again next year.
So just a tight fiddy then?
What?
Yay!
Oh.
Yay.
What's going on?
You're a working man now, bubba!
Congrats on the new temp job.
You knew about this?
I set it up, silly!
You needed a job, we needed a housekeeper.
I scratch my back, you scratch mine!
Richard, aren't you at all uncomfortable with the idea of me being our housekeeper?
Oh, I miss my Jerry-Berry.
Look, I know you feel like you have to work, but if you work here, at least we'll get to be together.
Yeah.
Look, it's only temporary.
And as long as we keep our work lives and our personal lives completely separate, I think we can make this work.
Don't you?
I have concerns.
Patrick, I can't hand this in.
Half of this makes it seem like it was my fault.
The other half reads like a freakin' apology!
Well, maybe you should write it?
Maybe...
Maybe I-- okay.
No, no, seriously, take another pass, shoot me a copy tonight,
I'll send you some notes, do another pass,
I'll send you some more notes, pass, notes, pass, notes, pass, notes, trust the process.
Hmm, what was that all about, my prince?
I got into trouble at school.
Aw, boo.
There was this Hispanic cafeteria worker chumming it up with the students instead of doing his job.
So I fired his ass.
That's my boy.
Well, no wonder you got in trouble.
I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to be firing people.
Oh, you're pretty sure?
!
I'm not supposed to be firing people, Jeremy?
!
I got in trouble because Gina insists that this Guillermo guy is a student and not a cafeteria worker, and it was racist of me to think that.
Now I've got to write an essay about it.
Psh!
Okay, I think I'm starting to see what happened.
Allen Gregory, you do know that not all Hispanic people are service workers?
What do you mean?
I think what he's saying is that since he's the maid--
- I hired him as our maid, by the way.
- Oh, nice.
Since he's the maid, it's racist to think that white people can't do it, too.
No, that's not what I'm saying at all.
I think we're reinforcing bad behavior, Rich.
You've sheltered him too much.
Well, I think you've missed the point completely, Jeremy.
This teacher is out of control!
My son's a racist, giving assignments.
Who does she think she is?
You know what I say to that?
You up her with your own assignment.
You go in there and prove that you're right, as always.
Yeah, he's not sheltered.
You know what?
That's a great idea.
Thanks, Dad.
Rich, I'm kind of worried that we may have sent him in the wrong direction there.
Seems like a weird thing to worry about with this glitter all over the floor.
Okay, Val, in this scene, I need you to smile.
But God help me, if I see that smile,
I'm gonna slap it off your face.
- Gotcha.
Totally fair.
- Now take it from the top.
What is going on here?
Patrick?
Hey, Ms. Winthrop.
We have to keep it down because Allen Gregory is holding auditions for his assignment.
Allen Gregory, your assignment was an essay.
Patrick?
Allen Gregory felt like your essay idea didn't really pop, and that the assignment kind of wanted to be a breathtaking stage production.
So he didn't do the-- what am I doing?
You didn't do the assignment?
I did the assignment behind the assignment.
Instead of writing 50 words,
I banged out 50 pages of searing social commentary.
I'm putting on a play.
What kind of play?
The kind of play that shows the world what happened here yesterday.
'Cause I'm not racist, Gina.
And it hurts me that anyone would think that.
Well, I suppose as long as you take the assignment seriously, it could be a good learning opportunity.
But I'm gonna need to read it.
Patrick, give her the script.
I'm not allowed to give out the script.
Oh, but he just said...
Thanks so much, Gina!
There it is.
Oh.
Hey, Allen Gregory.
Hey there.
I've got good news, guys.
Val, you got the part.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this.
Well, believe it.
And, Beth, I've got two words for you, honey:
stage crew.
How does that hit you?
That hits me in the sweet spot, actually.
You bet it does.
Okay, see you guys at rehearsal.
Julie!
Coming to wash that crap off your face?
What crap?
Oh, that is your face.
My bad.
So you're actually gonna be in his play.
Well, Val is.
I didn't get the part.
That's nothing to hang your head about, Beth.
Without the crew, I'm nothing.
This whole thing is ridiculous.
You know Guillermo.
He doesn't work in the school.
We thought that, too, Jules.
But then we read the script.
It makes a pretty compelling case.
Ugh!
Ooh, you might want to... use a different one.
Please?
Well, this feels better to us, right?
Uh, not really.
I don't know why I can't just clean in my normal clothes, Richard.
Ooh, "Richard." That sounds a little informal, huh?
You know what might also help?
If you called me "Mr. De Longpre"
while you're on the clock.
I'm not gonna do that.
Mm, yeah.
Mr. De Longpre is your name, too.
How about "Mr. Richard" then?
Or how about we just do none of this?
Okay.
I mean, I was trying to make it so that we could spend more time together, but guess that was silly of me.
No.
It wasn't silly.
I'm sorry.
Let's give it another try.
Let's give it another try...?
Let's give it another try, Mr. Richard.
There, now was that so hard, Yeremy?
Did you just call me Yeremy?
What am I doing here?
You fired me.
But I'm rehiring you.
Not as a janitor this time, but as an actor in a play about you being a janitor.
But what if I don't want...
Oh, good, Gina, hop on up real quick.
Yeah, I got your note.
Patrick doesn't look like he had a seizure.
What's going on?
Just keep it loose, informal, just like we're talking, conversational.
Wait, are you auditioning me?
So go ahead and tell us your name, sweetheart.
There's a character named Gina?
I'm in your play?
Well, not yet.
Let's see how this goes.
And then we'll probably need to have a little chit-chat about you losing, what, 75, 80 pounds, mostly around your ass and face.
Allen Gregory, you are way out of line!
Okay, give me that again, but don't make that gargoyle face.
This is ridiculous.
Buh!
No!
Unsalvageable.
Thanks for coming in anyway though, Gine.
We've got all your info, right?
We know how to get ahold of you?
We won't need to, but-but we do just in case?
Okay.
Just so you know, I was in plays in college, and I could do this if I wanted to, it's just not appropriate.
Eee-yi.
Now, who am I gonna get that can summon that same sense of revulsion from the audience?
I'm not gonna be in your play.
It's absurd.
Wait, Julie.
You know how no one knows you exist, like at all, like you're just a huge zero?
What if I told you that could all very slightly change?
I'd say I don't care.
Julie, please?
I'm offering you a lead role.
After playing this part, instead of people walking right through you, they'll walk right by you, and maybe they'll even say,
"Oh, hey, look, there's that weird Asian girl.
You know, from the play."
I guess I'd like that.
Well, you can have it.
And more.
Not much more.
Something along those lines.
Be realistic.
It's not gonna be a lot more.
It'll be very slightly more.
Mm-mm, uh.
Mm.
Ah.
Okay, what is it now, Mr. Richard?
You know what I think happened?
I think that you were so focused on getting the corners right this time-- and you did that, hooray-- but now those pillows have kind of fallen by the wayside.
The pillows haven't moved.
Well, maybe they just looked right because the corners were such a disaster.
Which is a shame because your first four attempts, you just crushed the corners and the pillows.
But, of course, that's when we were having those comforter issues.
Of course.
Okay, you know what?
It's 5:00.
I'll try again tomorrow.
What are you doing?
!
I thought you'd want to take a little napsy-doodle.
After such a long day.
I spent all afternoon making the bed!
Okay, whoa.
That's the maid talking.
I don't want to feel the stress of your job, Jeremy.
Leave your work at work.
Richard, you sound like a crazy person.
This is where I work.
No, this is where the maid works.
I'm both people!
Well now who sounds like a crazy person?
!
Who sounds crazy now, Jeremy?
!
Okay, I think I know what will make you feel better.
Here.
Put this on.
That's my maid uniform.
I just took it off.
No.
This is a sexy maid outfit.
For role-play, dumbo!
It's tear-away, and guess what else?
Oh, please tell me it has a...
* Butt-less!
*
Byoo!
Byoo, byoo, byoo!
Okay, let's take it from the top, G.
Hola, Guillermo.
Missed you at the janitor meeting last night.
What was up with that?
You're always there.
Okay, this is not true.
I have told you, I am not a janitor.
This is play is racist.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You can't stop rehearsal and start throwing around "capital R" bombs, Guillermo.
That can be hurtful.
Come on, man, be professional.
If you have a thought, write it down on a Post-It, slide that Post-It over to me.
I'll carefully crumple it up, throw it in the garbage, you take out that garbage later, and no one's feelings get hurt.
- Okay.
I'm not going to take out the garbage, and I'm certainly not going to play this part.
Hmm.
You just gave me an idea.
Guillermo, you're fired again, and Val, you're playing Guillermo.
Ooh, I like it, I like it, I like it.
Right?
'Cause I don't even think the audience would notice.
Guillermo, is that kind of what you were saying?
What?
No, not really.
Perfect, the show goes on.
No, no.
No!
Oh, honey, honey, honey, honey.
Someone was supposed to call you and tell you that you sucked and didn't get the part.
Well, I don't care because it's not happening.
What are you babbling about right now?
I just read it.
It's incredibly insensitive, irresponsible, and it's just wrong.
And there's no way I'm letting you do it.
This play is off.
Wait.
She got the part?
!
Who do you think you are shutting down my production?
Trust me, I'm doing it for your own good.
I know you want these kids to like you, Allen Gregory.
And this is not gonna do it.
If people see this, they will be very upset.
I'm used to people being jealous of me, babe.
It comes with all this.
I shouldn't have let it get this far.
The play is off.
Oh, is it?
What are you doing?
Getting Rossmyre on the phone.
Take his temperature on this whole thing.
Allen Gregory, the superintendent of the school system doesn't have time...
You got the Boss-myre.
How's she hanging', big dog?
A little to the left and just above my knee.
I have really short thighs.
What can I do for you, Allen Gregory?
Well, that depends.
Does the name Gina Winthrop mean anything to you?
Boy, does it.
Means about ten crying phone calls a night since I broke up with her.
You did not break up with me because we were never dating.
Ho!
Am I on speaker?
Hey, Gina!
You're a tough lady to get a hold of.
Did you change your number?
Of course I did.
You're supposed to report that to the school system.
Did you know that your dad doesn't even have it?
Okay, Stewart...
Mr. Rossmyre,
I think Allen Gregory is calling because he expects you'll overrule my objections to his play.
Well, I'd like to hear about your objections.
Maybe over a nice piece of swordfish?
And then dinner?
You hear that one, Allen Gregory?
Loud and clear, Boss-myre.
I am not having dinner with you.
The last time I made that mistake,
I blacked out for five hours because someone slipped something into my drink.
Well, I already said, under oath, that it wasn't me.
Okay, okay, you know what?
You want to let this play go on, that's fine.
They can boo you off the stage for all I care.
Boo me?
Okay.
Yeah, boo you.
Because this play shows that you are a racist.
And you don't even know it.
I wash my hands of the whole thing.
And the dinner?
Gina?
Did Allen Gregory just storm out?
Your paycheck is here.
Open it, open it, open it!
Hmm.
What is this?
!
We pay the maid $300 a day.
Yeah, I know.
But you're making less than that?
Well, the temp agency takes a cut, and then, Uncle Sam takes a cut.
Well, then, I hate to say this, but you're gonna have to see if you can get some doubles.
If I get doubles, I'll make a little bit more, but it will cost you a lot more.
Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie, you're very handsome, but you don't know the first thing about business.
You get paid extra for overtime, right?
Of course.
Well, there you go.
Where, Richard?
!
Where do I go?
!
You know, I don't think I like your tone, Yeremy.
Well, I'm positive that I hate yours.
Uh-oh, the big maid is standing his ground.
But I'd be careful if I were you.
'Cause that's the kind of thing that gets people fired around here.
Oh, is it?
Well, let me save you the trouble.
You're a terrible boss, Mr. Richard.
Like off the charts.
But guess what?
Right now...
you're an even worse husband.
I quit.
Carl-Trent, do you think I'm racist?
What?
!
You?
!
No, no, no, no.
How do you know?
Because I'm black.
We decide.
You know, I was once in your shoes.
1997, I'm at The Grill with Jerry Bruckheimer...
Waiting on him?
Yeah, but he waves me over, says, "CT, what you got for me?"
- Wants to hear the specials?
- Yeah, but instead I throw him a title.
Six Dead Bitches.
A rom-com.
Uh-huh.
Did he go for it?
Oh, no.
He passed before the appetizers came.
So you know what I did?
You ate his appetizers?
Yeah, but I also went ahead and made that movie myself.
Because I had a vision, just like you.
And I didn't let anything get in the way of that.
You go out there, AG... and you share your vision with the world.
Oh, they put you here?
Well, no, they didn't put me anywhere.
It's a first-grade play.
You can sit wherever you want.
Oh.
I didn't realize maids were so knowledgeable about the theater.
Ooh.
Look at me, Mr. Butterfingers over here.
Oh, it's okay.
There's a gentleman here whose job it is to clean up your mess.
Excuse me, Señor?
Could you come over here for a second?
Why don't you go ahead and clean it up yourself, gringo?
That's an interesting accent.
What am I hearing there, pal?
Illegal Hispanic.
Oh, well I'll be.
You are Hispanic.
That's funny, I just saw you as a janitor.
A janitor I'm gonna have to fire for not doing his job.
Well, would you buy this as an excuse for my blatant laziness?
I'm a student here, not a janitor.
That may be enough to fool stupid-ass Gina, but sorry, Papi.
You ain't fooling me.
Okay, here's the deal-- I'm completely useless.
I don't know what my purpose is on this earth.
That being said, you cannot fire him.
You need to treat him different because he looks different.
Well, Gina, I couldn't disagree more.
It would be unfair not to fire him and let him keep his job because he's Hispanic.
So I say we send this sack of sweat packing.
Who's with me?
He's racist!
Hey.
Why is everybody...?
What's the problem?
Stop.
Please be quiet, crowd.
Hello.
I am the real Guillermo.
Not the character of Guillermo.
The content of this play does not ring true to me.
It's all lies.
I am seven years old.
I do not work in the school system.
It's racist to think that just because I am a Mexican means I work in the cafeteria.
In addition to this what I have said, it's wrong to treat service workers like they're less than you, no matter what their race is.
And racism-- it's bad.
You okay?
Play was kind of racist, huh?
Yeah.
'Cause I guess it turns out
Guillermo is a student in the school?
Yes, I told you that he was a student.
I know someone told me that.
I forget who it was.
So what do I do?
I think you should go out there and apologize to Guillermo, and to everyone else.
I hate to say this, like it actually makes me physically sick to my stomach-- but I think you might be right.
Here we go.
What's going on?
Everyone thinks Guillermo's speech was part of the play.
They loved it.
Okay, Allen Gregory, this doesn't change anything.
You tell them the truth.
Right.
Okay.
Uh... so...
Gina Winthrop has made me realize that... that the play was-was wrong.
What?
Why would you say something like that?
What was wrong about it?
What are you teaching these kids?
Well, it was extremely racist, and...
Maybe you didn't grasp the concept, Gina.
It was a commentary on being racist.
That's why you broke the fourth wall with the big man in the end, right, Allen Gregory?
No, he didn't know why he was doing it.
Well, that's what
I was going for.
I wasn't sure it landed...
Landed here.
And over here.
I got it.
No, that's not what he meant.
Gina, it seemed to have resonated with them.
Okay.
If you did it on purpose, then I'd like to know why.
What was the thinking behind breaking the fourth wall, Allen Gregory?
Huh?
Well, the story was all about breaking down walls, so I figured...
why not break down the last one?
Right, Guillermo?
What is it?
Makes sense to me.
Me, too.
I buy it.
Geen?
Did that answer your question, or...?
Ugh.
I better go slip something...
I mean, give her something that'll calm her down.
I have to admit,
I liked being up on the stage in front of the people.
I ate that spotlight up with a big old spoon.
Yeah, you did, big boy.
How'd she taste?
Delicious.
Lord O'Malley!
That play really struck a chord in me.
I think I owe you an apology, sir.
It was wrong of me to treat you the way I did.
Oh, thanks, Rich.
I appreciate that.
So I'm sorry... that I fired you.
Well, you didn't really fire me.
I kind of quit.
Ah, you say "tomato," I say * bee-boop. *
Guillermo!
You were so great!
Oh, thanks, Mr. De Longpre.
That's Val, Dad.
Julie, coming out of nowhere!
Did you catch the play?
- I was in it, too.
- Oh.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Their impulses are spontaneous.
They are like the 'hook' in music terms that... go straight to the heart of a song without a usual build-up.

CHEER GIRKS
What are you staring at?
Him.
He's been trying for five minutes.
He doesn't know how to tie shoe laces.
He's crying.
He's not a kid anymore.
Let cheer him on!
Forget it.
He's simply stupid.
Why did you punch me...?
!
Those who ridicule the week are not cheer girls!
"Tie your shoes securely... make your footing steady and strong.
And put your feet forward firmly, steadily and gingerly.
One thousand miles start from the first step forward."
Sorry, I don't mean to overstay..
I'm glad that you feel very comfortable here.
Please take as much time as you like.
Hello there.
Good Evening.
Hi girls!
How did your cheering go?
We did 23 today..
Wow!
23 cheers a day!
.
That's cool.
Isn't that the highest number?
.
We did 26 at the end of last year.
Oh yes, I remember now.
You are terrific human beings.
I tip my hat to you girls.
Chiharu is the one to be admired.
We just tag along.
She's a cheering genius.
In terms of my respect, she ranks 2nd only to Hayao Miyazaki.
"Chiharu is super!
.
Chiharu is great!
Ciharu's cheer makes the world go round!
.
She's the most powerful cheering queen!"
You're embarrassing me.
You two worked hard today..
Tonight's dinner is on me.
"Rally, ho!"
Your usual?
Yep, but add fried calamari and spam to my usual.
I'll have a double portion of my usual.
Hey, I'm paying for it.
Take it easy.
Oh, yes.
I have a favor to ask you.
Go ahead.
This raspberry jam from Romania.
The lid is so tight that it refuses to open.
See how tight this Lid is?
Energize me.
"Every lid in the world should open.
A lid that does not open is not a lid.
Flex your upper arm and power yourself up.
Muscle, max, hustle, go, go!"
Oh yeah!
I'm energized!
It's open!
I did it!
Now I can taste the Romanian jam I've been dreaming of.
Taste good?
.
Just so so.
Thank you for your help.
I'd tried many times but your cheering helped me.
Trust your own power and offer gratitude to the universe,... a miracle does happen.
I'm too full to finish two portions.
Do you have anyone you want to cheer?
.
Let's see...
Oh yes.
He's the one.
Koganezaki of the Kawasaki Elephants.
Oh yes, you are a die-hard fan of his.
He's 50 years old, isn't he?
He's 52 and a grandfather now.
Never heard of a pro ball play.er old enough to have a grandchild.
If your mind stay. strong even if the body gets weak,...
You can keep shining.
When I see him go sliding head first....
I can't hold back my tears.
He really inspires me.
He's your spiritual master, isn't he?
But he's been in a slump this season.
He was sent down to the minors last month.
I really want to cheer him.
Hey, he's over there.
Are you Mr. Koganezaki?
Yes.
I believe you aren't placing.... enough weight on your pivot foot when at bat.
You are too conscious of your balance,... that prevents you from raising your left leg.
That's why you're hitting the ball with your upper body only.
Also, your batting stance is too narrow,... that's why your Left shoulder tends to move forward.
Why did you...?
!
You are not his batting coach.
I was a softball play.er in middle school.
Mamiko was.
She read the entire Dokaben series.
Don't misunderstand our mission.
We are here to cheer him.
We're the cheer girls and can't cross the line.
I was wrong.
Dark night is followed by bright morning.
Rain eventually stops.
Spring always comes after winter.
"Hit the ball out of here, Koganezaki!
Keep hitting balls far out!
Keep the slump out of you.
Bring back your glory days one more time, Koganezaki!
The older you get, the more home runs you'll hit!"
Wow!
Huge!
Can I finish it?
.
We didn't order these large portions.
It's on me.
These dolls are for you as well.
Cool!
It looks just like you.
It's so cute.
Did you make those 'kokeshi' dolls?
It's my only hobby.
You must like your face a lot.
Thanks.
I'll place it on top of my TV..
I can't 'cause my TV.
has a thin screen.
Why are you treating us to all these things?
I want to thank you girls on behalf of Mr. Koganezaki.
I'm so moved by your kind hearts and what you did for him.
I see.
Good deeds deserve a good reward.
Thank you for the meal.
We'll dig in now.
Why did you...?
!
Did you forget our basic principle?
What we do is strictly a volunteer activity..
The moment we allow an exception, corruption sets in.
She is so inflexible.
She's an old maid type.
We'll have the meals you prepared for us.
We'll pay. for the meals and the extra portions.
Please donate those dolls to poor children.
You win.
Boy, you girls rock!
I'm proud of having the pure hearted Chiharu... as my friend.
I'll follow her even if she can be violent at times.
Let's have the meals before they get cold.
Wow!
.
I'm so excited to have this curried rice.
I'll eat it Like Indian people do.
Don't use your Left hand.
That's the hand to wipe your ass.
Oh no.
Namaste!
May.
I help you?
Can you cheer me up?
Yes... but how?
.
I killed a person.
I am sorry,.... but I.....
I've ne..never... met a real murderer before.
I did not kill him myself.
One of my subordinates made a huge mistake.
So I yelled at him, "You don't deserve to live..."
He hung himself that night.
Since then I've been wracked with guilt and can't sleep.
Can you help me?
"What's done is done.
The guilt won't change a thing.
But you can change your future.
Let go of your guilt.
You've suffered enough.
Leave the past and move on."
You were originally cheerleaders right?
Yes, we're regular cheerleaders at the University.
During this difficult time,... we realized that there are many who need good cheering.
It's said that over 30,000 people commit suicide every year.
We don't have financial power or professional know-how.
But we can help people with our cheerleading.
You are so wonderful!
.
You are goddesses coming down on this desert-like world!
You are bodhisattvas and angels.
I'm really impressed.
Tell me how you are helping...
Why are you showing me that?
What?
.
What's the reason?
Are you pointing out that I'm an actor... trying hard to be on TV., yet you did it without trying?
If I show my jealousy, will you then be satisfied?
No way...
You looked so pleased when you were praised.
When he called you "the goddess", you seemed to be in heaven.
No, that's not true.
We don't seek any praise.
You are not honest at all.
It's creepy..
Kike a member of a cult.
Come on.
What a turn on that a TV. celeb is in front of me!
Don't push me away..
You've just hurt a man's pride with a judo-overthrow.
Get out.
Never come back!
Hey "big shot"... it was just a "local" TV. station.
You are a narcissist.
"Doing it for the sake of people and the world."?
No, you're showing off.
You're super egocentric.
Don't deceive people with your stupid acts.
A hypocrite!
A hypocrite!
I'm in trouble.
I'm falling.
My mental state is falling apart quickly.
If it keeps up,... the bad neurotransmitter will take over my brain.
And pull me back where I was before.
I shouldn't keep a gloomy face.
I should force myself to smile.
I'll watch a comedy show on TV and bring back my smile.
What made you to retire from your profession?
When I was practicing at the riverside,... some girls in weird clothes approached me... and mocked me with a strange dance.
They must've thought... it was comical to see an old man hanging on to baseball.
It was discouraging to see them mocking me like that.
So I decided to call it quits that day.
Those heartless girls hurt your professional pride... and made you retire.
No!
We did not mock him!
Can't believe Chiharu shut herself in for two weeks.
To tell you the truth,... she used to be Like that in high school.
Oh my..
Really?
.
She tried very hard to change herself while at college.
She constantly applied herself to change.
She reinvented herself into who she is now.
Hello, I can't answer your call right now.
Please leave your message after a beep.
Hello, this is Hoshimura whom you helped the other day..
Thank you very much for your heart-felt cheering.
The reason I am calling you... is that...
I need your help one more time.
I'm trying to challenge something, but don't have courage to do it.
We are closed for business.
What did you...?
!
Get up Chiharu!
You buried the depressed Chiharu in your hometown 2 years ago.
Chiharu is Super!
Chiharu is great!
Chiharu's cheer makes the world go around.
She is the powerful cheering queen of the world.
Chiharu!
Mr. Hoshimura... what are you going to challenge?
I'll explain it when we get there.
What a view!
.
It's much nicer to see Tokyo from above than from below.
Mr. Hoshimura...
The thing that you said you don't have the courage... to do...
Yes,...
I need your help to crossover to a non-suffering world.
You must be joking!
Don't get us involved in such heavy stuff!
If you want to die, do it alone.
Let's get out of here.
No, Mamiko.
Let's help him.
Are you stupid?
!
.
Cheering him for killing himself?
.
Not that.
We need to cheer him to Live.
Let's cheer him in the way.
he wants to Live again.
Right, Chiharu?
He wants us to cheer him to die.
Yes, but...
Rather than weighing in on the social norm,...
We place our priority. on the person's ardent wish.
Mr. Hoshimura, get over there and get ready.
- By the way...
-Yes?
Don't you want to know why I want to kill myself?
.
Or to listen to my childhood traumatic experience...
Not really.
If we do, we may. loose our focus.
If it turns out that way., then...
Let's be more rational about it.
Jump off, jump off Hoshimura!
Hooray.!
Hooray!
.
Hoshimura!
Jump off!
Jump off!
Jump off...
Jump off...
By the way....
Yes?
Shall we take a break?
Can't take a break while trying to kill yourself.
Don't you get hungry, girls?
I'll go and get take-out meals.
Are you serious about...
What did you...?
!
Murderer!
You're a murderer!
I won't forgive anyone who beats up Chiharu!
I will kill you!
No, I will Live.
Live!
I want to Live.
Sorry.
When I have a desire to Live, I suddenly get a sexual urge.
It's been six months since I've got sexual urge.
Yea!
Yea!
The mission is complete.
All's well that ends well.

I've got to kill myself.
My name is Konosuke Muratsubaki.
I am a shy and quiet high school student.
I'm nobody with a crush on a classmates.
Her name is Kaori Shiroyama.
She's the most beautiful girl in the school... and a moderator of the school's photo club.
She's a prize beyond my reach.
To me, she is my noble lady.
She is my lord.
No, she is a princess.
I fell in love with someone who is out of my league.
I'm not lucky enough to have her as my girl.
But I wish I could talk to her just once.
Everyone is assigned to a team for the School Festival.
Anyone who's not listed?
Each team must submit their themes by next week.
The meeting is adjourned.
My name is missing...
I was hoping to join her team.
Kaori, let's go.
OK.
Just a second.
Your new shots?
Let me see.
Sure.
What makes those who stand out different than me?
Who's he?
.
Muratsubaki.
Unexciting subject.
You think so?
Why did you take his photo?
He is someone so low-key..
He's not noticeable.
We joked about him being a wall flower.
Like a recluse, social withdrawal.
But if you take a close look at him,... he's very beautiful.
- Really?
.
-Yes.
I've got to kill myself.
I can't.
I'm so scared to die.
Hello.
Konosuke.
I rented an adult video.
Let's watch it together.
Can't.
I'm getting ready to kill myself.
Kill yourself?
.
That's cool!
I'm busy..
See 'ya.
Hey, before wasting yourself, let me work on you.
"Work on me"?
When you die, your face becomes stiff.
No way!
.
Where were you calling me from?
Go home!
Out of my house!
Ahh....
What a feeling!
Here, it's done.
I've noticed that you have a beautiful face.
I was right.
You're right.
With your face made up,...
Let's go on a date tomorrow.
-What?
- Hey, you're going to die.
Let me enjoy a date with a gorgeous chick just once.
I deserved it because I've let you watch loads of porn free.
I don't Like it.
Everyone is staring at me.
I must Look creepy..
No.
It's because you Look pretty..
Let's walk arm in arm.
No, Let's stop now.
Excuse me, but she's so cute.
I'm from Kyun Kyun fashion magazine.
Would you Like to pose for our readers' model section?
You are gorgeous!
Here take my business card.
No, you can't take her photo.
She's mine!
I don't like that, either.
I can't hold it any longer!
Excuse me, but can you pose for my camera?
Oh, she's cute.
Sure.
Why not.
It's so amazing.
Usually nobody pays attention to me.
Now everyone's eyes are on me.
I guess each person has something special to shine.
Kato, teach me how to put on make-up.
I guess I have to.
I wonder what if...
I disguise myself as a girl, and show up in front of Kaori.
I got a lot of attention when I do that,... perhaps Kaori would talk to me.
Umm...that may. work.
but two females having a date?
But me as a male won't work, either.
You're right.
Right.
It's a great idea, eh?
You're a genius!
You can say. that!
I'll act on it.
I'll definitely do it today.
Watch out!
Are you all right?
Fantastic!
Can you be my model?
Now we meet everyday.
for photo shoots.
We've developed a model and photographer relationship.
Worked together, and at times, we even argued.
As we spent days together, our friendship grew.
Miyu is the best!
To please Kaori,...
I try very hard to make myself into a beautiful woman.
Ouch!
That's so painful, Kato!
Oh poor thing!
I'll make you feel better.
Get out of here!
I love subjects that are beautiful.
Miyu, a fair maiden sent from heaven.
Love to spend my shooting time with Miyu.
I wonder who she is.
Why is she helping me so much?
I want to know more about her.
Miyu, this is for you.
Thanks.
Hey!
.
You have big hands!
Big?
.
They were crushed and flattened when I was small.
By a heavy object...
Can I compare mine with yours?
Wow!
So big!
Can I ask you something?
Of course.
Why are you helping us every day?
.
I came and Looked for you 'cause I wanted to be your model.
You knew that I take photos?
Ye..yes, of course.
I saw your blog...
I'm a big fan of yours.
You make me so happy!
.
And sad at the same time.
Did I say. something to upset you?
I'm so moved to know that I have a fan.
By the way., are you free tomorrow?
.
Let's change location site.
Let's go to mountain.
Hi.
Who is he?
Your boyfriend?
Yes, I am.

That's great.
Thank you for helping us.
It's so beautiful.
Let's take some shots here.
Kaori is really into shooting photos today.
She must be really enjoying it.
Kato is a great help.
He's really talented.
I've come to respect him.
You Look so cute!
Still thirsty.
I'll go get some juice.
OK.
It looks nice up there.
Shall we go up?
Sure.
Oh no, it's getting late.
It's getting dark and dangerous.
Let's go home.
Miyu....
Kaori...
Kaori!
Where is she?
Did Kaori get lost?
I can't let it happen to her.
Miyu!
Kaori, is that you?
Where are you?
Are you all right!
?
Yes, I'm barely hanging on.
I'll help you!
Thank you!
The root is...
H..hold on!
I'll find some rope.
It can't be...
Is she dead?
!
.
I can't see her anymore?
No...no way.
I haven't done anything nice to her yet,... and I've been lying to her...
I couldn't be worse.
Miyu...
Kaori?
It wasn't as deep as I thought it would be.
I'm fine.
I'll be right down.
Miyu, I'm here.
I thought you were dead.
I don't want to lose you.
Don't die on me.
You are overreacting.
I'm fine.
Thank you.
I'm happy. to know that I've someone who cares about me.

Miyu is here.
Where?
- It's him.
-What're you talking about?
Hello, I'm Miyu.

Shall we go?
Don't you think that I am kind of strange?
.
Why do you ask?
It's obvious.
I've noticed that you are beautiful.
What?
.
That's right.
Both Miyu and you Muratsubaki are beautiful.
You don't mind that I dress up as a girl?
What does Miyu think?
She enjoys it very much.
I feel the same way..
I'm so relieved.
Why?
.
Well...
I was worried... and scared how you'd react.
I Like both Miyu and Muratsubaki.

You asked for my full name, but can't give me yours?
Sorry, that's our policy.
Listen Miss,...
You asked for my name first and I obliged.

Mr. Kasai,...

I wasn't upset about the electricity. being shut-off.
What ticked me off was your rep's attitude.

You need to do more to train your customer reps.
You're absolutely right.
We regret our rep's unpleasant attitude with you.
As the manager of the Customer Call Center,...
I am the one to be blamed.

You do use the electricity.
It means you are obliged to pay..

Chiharu is the one to be admired.
We just tag along.
She's a cheering genius.
In terms of my respect, she ranks 2nd only to Hayao Miyazaki.
"Chiharu is super!
Chiharu is great!
Ciharu's cheer makes the world go round!
She's the most powerful cheering queen!"
You're embarrassing me.
You two worked hard today Tonight's dinner is on me.
"Rally, ho!"
Your usual?
Yep, but add fried calamari and spam to my usual.
I'll have a double portion of my usual.
Hey, I'm paying for it.
Take it easy
Oh,yes.
I have a favour to ask you.
Go ahead.
This raspberry jam from Romania.
The lid is so tight that it refuses to open.
See how tight this lid is?
Energise me.
"Every lid in the world should open.
A lid that does not open is not a lid.
Flex your upper arm and power yourself up.
Muscle, max, hustle, go, go!"
Oh yeah!
I'm energised!
It's open!
I did id
Now I can taste the Romanian jam I've been dreaming of.
Taste good?
Just so so.
Thank you for your help.
I'd tried many times but your cheering helped me.
Trust your own power and offer gratitude to the universe,... a miracle does happen.
I'm too full to finish two portions.
Do you have anyone you want to cheer?
Let's see...
Oh yes.
He's the one.
Koganezaki of the Kawasaki Elephants.
Oh yes, you are a die-hard fan of his.
He's 50 years old,isn't he?
He's 52 and a grandfather now
Never heard of a pro ball player old enough to have a grandchild.
If your mind stays strong even if the body gets weak,...
You can keep shining.
When I see him go sliding head firsg...
I can't hold back my tears.
He really inspires me.
He's your spiritual master;
isn't he?
But he's been in a slump this season.
He was sent down to the minors last month.
I really want to cheer him.
Hey he's over there.
Are you Mr. Koganezaki?
Yes.
I believe you aren't placing .... enough weight on your pivot foot when at bat.
You are too conscious of your balance,... that prevents you from raising your left leg.
That's why you're hitting the ball with your upper body only
Also,your batting stance is too narrow... that's why your left shoulder tends to move forward.
Why did you...7!
You are not his batting coach.
I was a softball player in middle school.
Mamiko was.
She read the entire Dokaben series.
Don't misunderstand our mission.
We are here to cheer him.
We're the cheer girls and can't cross the line.
I was wrong.
Dark night is followed by bright morning.
Rain eventually stops.
Spring always comes after winter:
"Hit the ball out of here, Koganezaki!
Keep hitting balls far out!
Keep the slump out of you.
Bring back your glory days one more time, Koganezaki!
The older you get, the more home runs you'H hit!"
Wow!
Huge!
Can I finish it?
We didn't order these large portions.
It's on me.
These dolls are for you as well.
Cool!
It looks just like you.
it's so cute.
Did you make those 'kokeshi' dolls?
It's my only hobby
You must like your face a lot.
Thanks.
I'll place it on top of myTV
I can't 'cause myTV has a thin screen.
Why are you treating us to all these things?
I want to thank you girls on behalf of Mu Koganezaki.
I'm so moved by your kind hearts and what you did for him.
I see.
Good deeds deserve a good reward.
Thank you for the meal.
We'll dig in now
Why did you...7!
Did you forget our basic principle?
What we do is strictly a volunteer activity
The moment we allow an exception,corruption sets in.
She is so inflexible.
She's an old maid type.
We'll have the meals you prepared for us.
We'll pay for the meals and the extra portions.
Please donate those dolls to poor children.
You win.
Boy you girls rock!
I'm proud of having the pure hearted Chiharu... as my friend.
I'll follow her even if she can be violent at times.
Let's have the meals before they get cold.
Wow!
I'm so excited to have this curried rice.
I'll eat it like Indian people do.
Don't use your left hand.
That's the hand to wipe your ass.
Oh no.Namaste!
May I help you?
Can you cheer me up?
Yes... but how?
I killed a person.
I am sorry .... but I .....
I've ne..ne'velt..
Meta real murderer before.
I did not kill him myself.
One of my subordinates made a huge mistake.
So I yelled at him, "You don't deserve to live..."
He hung himself that night
Since then I've been wracked with guilt and can't sleep.
Can you help me?
"What's done is done.
The guilt won't change a thing.
But you can change your future.
Let go of your guilt.
You've suffered enough.
Leave the past and move on."
You were originally cheerleaders right?
Yes, we're regular cheerleaders at the University
During this difficult tim e,... we realised that there are many who need good cheering.
It's said that over 30,000 people commit suicide every year;
We don't have financial power or professional know-how
But we can help people with our cheerleading.
You are so wonderful!
You are goddesses coming down on this desert-like world!
You are bodhisattvas and angels.
I'm really impressed.
Tell me how you are helping...
Why are you showing me that?
What?
What's the reason?
Are you pointing out that I'm an actor..
Trying hard to be on TY yet you did it without trying?
If I show my jealousy will you then be satisfied?
No
You looked so pleased when you were praised.
When he called you "the goddess", you seemed to be in heaven.
No, that's not true.
We don't seek any praise.
You are not honest at all.
It's creepy
Like a member of a cult.
Come on.
What a turn on that atv celeb is in front of me!
Don't push me away
You've just hurt a man's pride with ajudo-overthrow.
Get out.
Never come back!
Hey "big shot"... it was just a "local"TV station.
You are a narcissist.
"Doing it for the sake of people and the world."?
No,you're showing off.
You're super egocentric.
Don't deceive people with your stupid acts.
A hypocrite!
A hypocrite!
I'm in trouble.
I'm falling.
My mental state is falling apart quickly.
If it keeps up,... the bad neurotransmitter will take over my brain.
And pull me back where I was before.
I shouldn't keep a gloomy face.
I should force myself to smile.
VH watch a comedy show onw and bring back my smile.
What made you to retire from your profession?
When I was practicing at the riverside,... some girls in weird clothes approached me... and mocked me with a strange dance.
They must've thought... it was comical to see an old man hanging on to baseball.
It was discouraging to see them mocking me like that
So I decided to call it quits that day
Those heartless girls hurt your professional pride... and made you retire.
No!
We did not mock him!
Can't believe Chiharu shut herself in for two weeks.
To tell you the truth,... she used to be like that in high school.
Oh my.
Really?
She tried very hard to change herself while at college.
She constantly applied herself to change.
She reinvented herself into who she is now
HeHo,I can't answer your call right now
Please leave your message after a beep.
Hello, this is Hoshimura whom you helped the other day.
Thank you very much for your heart-felt cheering.
The reason I am calling you... is that...
I need your help one more time.
I'm trying to challenge something, but don't have courage to do it
We are closed for business.
What did you...7!
Get up Chiharu!
You buried the depressed Chiharu in your hometown 2 years ago.
Chiharu is Super!
Chiharu is great!
Chiharu's cheer makes the world go around.
She is the powerful cheering queen of the world.
Chiharu!
Ml:
Hoshimura... what are you going to challenge?
I'll explain it when we get there.
Whataview!
It's much nicer to seeTokyo from above than from below
Ml:
Hoshimura...
The thing that you said you don't have the courage... to do...
Yes,...
I need your help to crossover to a non-suffering world.
You must bejoking!
Don't get us involved in such heavy stuff!
If you want to die, do it alone.
Let's get out of here.
No, Mamiko.
Let's help him.
Are you stupid?
!
Cheering him for killing himself?
!
Not that We need to cheer him to live.
Let's cheer him in the way he wants to live again.
Right, Chiharu?
He wants us to cheer him to die.
Yes, but...
Rather than weighing in on the social norm,...
We place our priority on the person's ardent wish.
Mr Hoshimura, get over there and get ready
- By the
-Yes?
Don't you want to know why I want to kill myself?
Or to listen to my childhood traumatic experience...
Not really
If we do,we may loose our focus.
If it turns out that way then...
Let's be more rational about it
jump off,jump off Hoshimura!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Hoshimura!
Jump off!
]ump off!
Jump off...]ump off...
By the way..
Yes?
Shall we take a break?
Can't take a break while trying to kill yourself.
Don't you get hungry girls?
I'll go and get take-out meals.
Are you serious about...
What did you...7!
Murderer!
You're a murderer!
I won't forgive anyone who beats up Chiharu!
I will kill you!
No, I will live.
Live!
I want to live.
Sorry
When I have a desire to live, I suddenly get a sexual urge.
It's been six months since I've got sexual urge.
Yea!
Yea!
The mission is complete.
All's well that ends well.

I've got to kill myself I
My name is Konosuke Muratsubaki.
I am a shy and quiet high school student.
I'm nobody with a crush on a classmates.
Her name is Kaori Shiroyama.
She's the most beautiful girl in the school... and a moderator of the school's photo club.
She's a prize beyond my reach.
To me, she is my noble lady.
She is my lord.
No, she is a princess.
I fell in love with someone who is out of my league.
I'm not lucky enough to have her as my girl.
But I wish I could talk to her just once.
Everyone is assigned to a team for the School Festival.
Anyone who's not listed?
Each team must submit their themes by next week
The meeting is adjourned.
My name is missing...
I was hoping to join her team.
Kaori, let's go.
OK.]ustasecond.
Your new shots?
Let me see.
Sure.
What makes those who stand out different than me?
Who's he?
Muratsubaki.
Unexciting subject
You think so?
Why did you take his photo?
He is someone so low-key He's not noticeable.
Wejoked about him being a wall flower:
Like a recluse, social withdrawal.
But if you take a close look at him,... he's very beautiful.
- Really?
-Yes.
I've got to kill myself I
I can't.
I'm so scared to die.
Hello.
Konosuke.
I rented an adult video.
Let's watch it together.
Can't.
I'm getting ready to kill m/self
Kill yourself?
That's cool!
I'm busy See 'ya.
Hey before wasting yourself, let me work on you.
"Work on me"?
When you die, your face becomes stiff.
No way!
Where were you calling me from?
Go home!
Out of my house!
Ahh ....
What a feeling!
Here,it's done.
I've noticed that you have a beautiful face.
I was right
You're right.
With your face made up,... let's go on a date tomorrow
-What]
- Hey you're going to die.
Let me enjoy a date with a gorgeous chick just once.
I deserved it because I've let you watch loads of porn free.
I don'tlike it
Everyone is staring at me.
I must look creepy
No. it's because you look pretty
Let's walk arm in arm.
No,let's stop now
Excuse me, but she's so cute.
I'm from Kyun Kyun fashion magazine.
Would you like to pose for our readers' model section?
You are gorgeous!
Here take my business card.
No,you can't take her photo.
She's mine!
I don't like that, either;
I can't hold it any longer!
Excuse me, but can you pose for my camera]
Oh, she's cute.
Sure.Why not.
It's so amazing.
Usually nobody pays attention to me.
Now everyone's eyes are on me.
I guess each person has something special to shine.
Kato, teach me how to put on make-up.
I guess I have to.
I wonder what if..
I disguise myself as a girl, and show up in front of Kaori.
I got a lot of attention when I do that... perhaps Kaori would talk to me.
Umm...that may work.
But two females having a date?
But me as a male won't work, either.
You're right.
Right.
It's a great idea, eh?
You're a genius!
You can say that!
L'H act on it
VH definitely do it today
Watch out!
Are you all right?
Fantastic!
Can you be my model?
Now we meet everyday for photo shoots.
We've developed a model and photographer relationship.
Worked together and at times, we even argued.
As we spent days togethe;
our friendship grew
Miyu is the best!
To please Kaori,...
I try very hard to make m/self into a beautiful woman.
Ouch!
That's so painful, Kato!
Oh poor thing!
I'll make you feel better:
Get out of here!
I love subjects that are beautiful.
Miyu, a fair maiden sent from heaven.
Love to spend my shooting time with Miyu.
I wonder who she is.
Why is she helping me so much?
I want to know more about hen
Miyu,this is for you.

They were crushed and flattened when I was small.
By a heavy object..
Can I com pare mine with yours?
Wow!

I'm fine.
I'll be right down.

I wasn't upset about the electricity being shut-off.
What ticked me off was your rep's attitude.
I didn't sense any sincerity from her:
Moreover; she cut me off while I was speaking to her:
You need to do more to train your customer reps.
You're absolutely right.
We regret our rep's unpleasant attitude with you.
As the manager of the Customer Call Centelg...
I am the one to be blamed.

Go home.

It all started when you didn't pay the bill!
You do use the electricity
It means you are obliged to pay
When I kept apologising, you acted like you were right.

Think of this place as your office.
Thank you very much!
Thank you!
I'm leaving for home.
Good-bye.
Did you clean the toilet today?
No,I didn't.
Because the toilet seat was up.
You must have put it up.
No, it was already up.
Well,I might have cleaned it.
You don't remember?
Have some been
By the way..
I passed by Ml:
Hirata on my way home.
You did?
I wonder where he was coming from... in the opposite direction?
I wonder; too.
He must have had some errands to do.
Perhaps he was walking for exercise on his way home?
Maybe fooling around with someone?
That's possible.
Good morning!
Morning.
Ml:
Hirata...
I'm off to grocery shop.
All right.
See you later:
See you later:
- I'm back.
-Welcome back.
I brought you a companion.
Nice to meet you.
My name is Kido.
The same here.
I'm Hirata.
Did you enjoy the album?
I'm sorryl took the liberty
Oh no,not at all.
Aren't they cute?
Yes, thefre very cute.
I love pets.
Do you,Mr:
Kido?
I prefer dogs.
Did you keep all of them?
Yes,before we moved here.
They all were stray cats.
22 of them, I remember:
22 cats!
7
You lived in so called "The House Full of Cats".
My old neighbours called it that.
There were lots of complaints.
We're forced to move out of the house.
I see.
I just couldn't ignore the poor things.
So I always took them in.
What're you doing here?
What're you doing?
What're you doing here?
What're you doing up there?
It's lunch time!
You must be hungry by now
Don't be bashful.
Please enjoy Come on.Take a bite.
Thanks!
Good,eh?
Oh, Mn Hirata.
Here you go.
Let me take your photo.
You look too serious.
Smile,smile.
Oh yes,smile.
You still look stiff.
Let's see,try to lean on the wall.
That's right...
Get back to the standing pose.
Say Cheese.
Thank you.
Next,Ml:
Kido.
Just be natural.
- Mrs. Okada...
-You scared me.
Yes, Ml:
Hirata]
Is there anything we can help you with?
No, it's OK.
Don't worry about it.
We just sit around doing nothing.
You are so nice to let us stay and even feeding us lunch.
We feel that..
We want to do something for you.
I've already taken care of the housework
Sorry I have nothing for you to do now
I see.
There is something you can do now
That...
Yes, you leave it to us.
Attack!
Listen!
It got away
Where has it gone?
There...
Charge!
Captain,we've spotted the enemy
We await your command.
Ml:
Sano and Ml:
Kitamura go over there.
Nakanishi, you follow me.
Kido, guard the door:
-Yes, captain.
-The rest,wait for my command.
Yes, Captain.
Do not let the enemy come close to Mrs. Okada.
Yes, sir:
You let the enemy escape.
Never expected that thing would fly
Where has it gone?
- it's disgusting
- Coward, show yourself.
Oh no!
Mr. Hirata!
W..what..what7
Ohh...my back!
It's gotten inside my jacket.
Ouch...
Ouch!
That hurts!
I'm sorry
There!
Hunt it down!
Yes!
We gotit!
Mn O...
O kada...
What's going on here?
Yocchan...
Welcome back.
You should've let me know you are coming home early
You've been acting strangely... so I left my office early to check on you.
You are sneaky
Sneaky?
Who?
...me?
I am sorry
I felt so bad to see them sitting outside all day long.
I just couldn't ignore their plight.
It's the same as with the stray cats.
It's that old habit of yours.
Don't get involved again,will you?
I am so sorry
Won't do that again.
Okay
Thank you.
I love you,Yocchan.
I love you too.
Did you get a sun tan?
Sun tan?
N...no, I don't think so.
Yocchan... you are hiding something from me, aren't you?
- I'm off to work.
- Have a nice day
Good morning.
Good morning.
Morning.
Good morning!

Fifth Column has claimed responsibility for the peace ambassadors murders earlier this morning.
Cohn is out of control.
That could have been Tyler.
I want you to get close to Eli Cohn.
You will help me destroy them.
We're all on the same side.
Unlike you, we don't kill innocent people.
Church officials have issued a statement condemning all anti-V rhetoric from clergy worldwide.
I'm not gonna stop speaking out.
It's priests like him that are inciting the Fifth Column.
Stop!
This is the house of God!
That's Tyler's phone.
I feel like I'm losing him.
I need help.
I did what I had to do to protect our species.
Welcome to the future, Chad... our future, man and visitor.
This... is Concordia.
Concordia.
Interesting name.
From your Roman mythology, meaning a peaceful and harmonious coexistence.
Man and visitor working side by side to build thousands of these centers, creating jobs and supporting prosperity across the world.
Concordia will employ massive numbers of men and women.
Humans will be constructing the buildings, staffing the centers of learning and technology.
We've made agreements with nations around the world to build Concordia on land that is currently abandoned or in disrepair.
So Concordia is like a...
A worldwide urban renewal project.
Exactly.
I'll be hosting a gala tonight here in New York to formally announce Concordia, and tomorrow, a renaissance begins across the entire planet.
We will celebrate our future, shared by mankind and Visitors...
Together.
Stop!
This is the house of God!
This is Joe.
Leave a message.
Joe, it's me.
I need to see you.
It's about our son.
Hey, you.
Happy Birthday.
Thanks, mom.
Okay.
Well, it always tastes better than it looks.
Breakfast birthday cake...
Evans family tradition.
Yeah, well, when we were a family.
Oh, I'm...
I'm sorry, mom.
I
- I just...
I don't know.
I thought that maybe dad would call by now, that's all.
Hey, it's okay.
He will.
It's early, right?
Have a piece of cake.
Um, actually, I have to meet Lisa at the peace ambassador center.
Tyler, they're killing peace ambassadors... kids your age.
Mom, I'm not a kid anymore.
You're right.
You're a man now.
Listen, I need you to remember that there are consequences for the choices we make.
You may be 18, but I am still your mother.
I will always be here for you.
Thanks, mom.
Thomas, as my chief engineer,
I'm relying on you to make sure
- that Concordia stays on schedule.
- It is, my queen.
Landing sites have been selected for every ship in the fleet in preparation for our invasion.
Perfect.
With the release of red rain, the human women are almost ready for breeding.
As soon as Joshua is able to eradicate the human soul, we can proceed.
I fear tonight's gala is a tempting target for the Fifth Column.
A disturbance could hinder public acceptance of Concordia and delay our plans.
The Fifth Column and Eli Cohn will not be a problem.
Ryan Nichols will make sure of that.
You wanted to see me.
Yeah.
Thanks for coming.
I don't understand.
I thought you were with, uh, agent Evans.
I am, but she doesn't know I'm here.
I want this to be kept private, Eli, just between us.
So what do you want from me?
I have a daughter.
Anna's holding her hostage up on that ship.
And the only way I can get her back is to take Anna down.
Our group is too small to do it alone.
You have a bigger network.
We need to work together so we can strike hard.
Well, Erica made it very clear that her cooperation last time was a one-shot deal,
that our ideological viewpoints of this fight are diametrically opposed.
Use me.
I can bridge both sides.
She trusts you?
Absolutely.
Good.
As the head of the FBI Fifth Column task force, she could be quite helpful.
You call her.
Get your team together.
Tonight...
We're taking Anna down for good.
We get the wiretap on father Landry yet?
Not yet.
Judge has the paper.
Evans, Bolling, clear your schedules.
You're running security for Anna's big shindig tonight.
Guest list.
Paul, it's gonna take weeks to run this many names.
Hey, uh, isn't that your ex?
Yeah.
A problem with Tyler.
I had to bring in the heavy artillery.
Heard about you two.
Sorry it didn't work out.
Federal officer married to a civilian...
It's always tough.
Runs a little deeper than that.
I'll only be a minute.
- Hi.
- Hey.
What's going on with Tyler?
It will be easier to explain after I show you this.
They've been here for decades, Joe.
Anna's waging a war against mankind, and for some reason, she's targeting our son.
I know it's a lot to grasp.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's a hell of a lot.
This, um, missing ladder within Ty's D.N.A...
Why would they do that?
We think that they wanna put something else in there...
Something not from you or me.
This is crazy.
The high levels of phosphorus in my blood, the preeclampsia...
The visitors did that.
They have been messing with Tyler since before he was born.
And what does...
What does Tyler know about all this?
Nothing, and we can't tell him.
If Anna ever thought that he knew, his life would be in danger.
And then you let...
you let him date one of them?
We can trust Lisa.
Who else knows about the visitors,
- about what they really are?
- There's a small group of us.
We have to be careful who we tell.
I need your help.
What do you think I can do and why do you think I can help?
The one thing that Tyler wants more than anything else is his family back together.
And that is the one thing that Anna can't give him.
I need you with me, Joe.
Lisa, what are you doing?
It's for Tyler.
Today is his 18th birthday.
It would raise suspicion if his girlfriend didn't give him a present.
Now that Tyler is 18, he will no longer be bound to do as his parents command.
He'll be able to make his own choices, and we must make sure he chooses us.
How can we be sure he'll do that?
Because I can give him something humanity cannot...
A future.
Interesting piece this morning, Chad.
You really think this Concordia project is all world peace, jobs for everyone, chicken in every pot?
Anna hasn't promised anything she didn't deliver so far.
Well, all the same, a lot of people are asking hard questions about her, but not you.
I'm not sure you're the guy to do it.
What's that supposed to mean, Neil?
A few months ago, everybody and their mother was drinking the V kool-aid.
Now people aren't so sure.
Ratings are slipping.
I wanna change the format of "Prime Focus"... add a, uh, critical voice to face off against you.
A kind of point/counterpoint?
Exactly.
We're bringing in talent from Boston, Philly, and D.C. this afternoon.
I'd like you to screen-test if somebody looks promising.
Whatever you need.
I'm surprised you're good with this.
Didn't figure you'd be so willing to share a spotlight.
Bring 'em on.
Going one-on-one with the other side is only gonna make me look better.
Hey.
Hey.
Happy Birthday.
Oh.
Thanks.
I wanted to get you something that will always remind you of us.
I love it...
And you.
Tyler...
Um...
Yesterday at the church...
Tyler.
Hey.
Lisa, you remember Tyler's dad?
Hi, kiddo.
Happy Birthday.
Look, I know things didn't go...
Too well last time.
I've been...
I've been talking to your mom, and I've been thinking about it so much since I saw you last.
You might not believe it, but when I turned 18,
I
- I just...
I was so much like you.
I...
My old man...
He wasn't there for me either.
Sound familiar?
Go ahead.
Open it.
Just, uh, open it up.
After graduation, I set out on that route on that '82 Harley shovelhead.
Couple months on the road by myself, and it was the best time of my life because I found out who I really was.
The bike's yours.
I restored it for you myself.
But that's not a real gift.
This is.
You have a couple of months between high school and college, and I thought...
We both want for you to take some time to yourself, think about your future.
I will worry...
Every second that you're gone, but... make the trip.
And we'll be here for you when you get back.
Yeah.
I want another chance, Ty.
Tyler is too important.
With our plans accelerated, we need him here now.
We must make sure he's ready.
Can we stop him?
He appears to be giving his parents' gift serious consideration.
But he has yet to see my gift.
I've only got a minute.
Kendrick has me working security for Anna's gala, celebrate her latest "gift. "
What if I told you that we can ensure that Anna never gave another "gift" to earth?
I went to see Eli Cohn.
Without telling us.
Yeah, last time I checked, we're all Fifth Column.
Let's hear him out.
Eli wants our help...
To assassinate Anna.
How?
A bomb.
He wouldn't tell me more until he knows that we're in.
We're not.
He's insane!
The collateral damage alone...
Which is exactly why he needs us.
With you handling security, we can minimize the collateral...
Minimize?
Ryan, we're talking about 300 innocent people.
No, no, Eli's right.
Now's the time to strike.
We know exactly where Anna's gonna be, and you're handling security.
We may never get another opportunity like this again.
Erica...
Lisa would be queen.
I'd get my daughter back, and Tyler...
Tyler would be safe.
Eli's giving us a chance, and I'm taking it...
With or without you.
Then you mean without me, too.
I'm with the lizard.
As much as I would love to take Anna out,
I can't agree to this.
Erica, we can end this war in one swift blow.
This is our shot.
Yeah, and how many innocents go with her?
Don't do this, Ryan.
Don't put me in a position tonight where I have to make a choice.
Because if I have to...
I will take you down.
What just happened in there?
We can't fall apart, not now.
I am not the one who changed the game plan.
Every day, Anna's grip on Tyler grows stronger and stronger.
You said it yourself, Jack...
no innocent lives.
Look, I know it wasn't easy.
We made the right choice.
Erica, I...
Joe.
Yeah.
Where are you?
I'll be right there.
What's going on?
Tyler got a call from Anna.
Said she had a birthday gift for him.
Erica, what a surprise.
I thought you would be busy with preparations for tonight.
I am.
Uh, Joe called.
He said Tyler was so excited.
I wanted us to all come up here, see this gift as a family.
I'm Joe Evans.
I'm Tyler's father.
Erica tells me that you've taken quite an interest in our son.
Tyler's special...
Which is why I wanted to present this very important birthday gift to him.
I'd like you to meet Thomas, my chief engineer.
Pleasure to meet you, Tyler.
Mr. and Mrs. Evans.
Wait.
So you, like, uh, designed the ship?
I did.
Anna tells me that you are the perfect candidate to become part of Concordia.
How would you like to be the first human to pilot one of our shuttles?
Happy Birthday, Tyler.
Thank... thank you.
Mother, how generous of you.
You will live here, and I will personally oversee your training.
For how long?
He's got school.
We'll work around his school schedule.
Soon enough, you'll be at the controls of your own shuttle.
Thank you so much.
Would you like a tour of the cockpit?
Yeah.
Well...
Thank you, Anna, uh, for giving our son this incredible opportunity.
Thank you for allowing me to play a role in his life.
Now if you'll excuse me, I must prepare for tonight.
I don't know what it means, but my mother said with Concordia starting, whatever she needs Tyler for, she needs him now.
Every plan she has pulls him farther and farther away from us.
How are we gonna protect him now?
Come on, Kerry.
You've gotta admit that Concordia, with cutting-edge technology, dynamic learning opportunities, and real jobs in a harsh economy is a home run for the visitors.
When newcomers arrive on your shores, you have to be careful...
Beware of Greeks bearing gifts?
Exactly.
The Trojan horse filled with soldiers, smallpox-infected blankets for the native Americans...
These gifts didn't work out too well for the recipients, did they?
But Anna has demonstrated the utility of her gifts.
We have clean air and revitalized deserts to prove it.
And I'm sure the native Americans were warm in their blankets before they started dying in them.
Cut.
That was great.
The public deserves to hear both sides.
It's good TV.
Kerry, job's yours if you want it.
Hey.
You've been gone a long time.
Everything okay with Ty?
Yeah.
He hasn't seen his dad for a while.
I wanted to be there for him, but I am up to speed.
Let's get the briefing started.
Great.
Nice to see you again, Marcus.
All right, people.
With the recent increase in Fifth Column attacks, protocol tonight will be security level one.
If I may, assistant director Kendrick...
Before we begin, Anna would like to say a few words.
I'd like to thank the entire FBI and most especially the Fifth Column task force for agreeing to provide security at this very important event.
We're happy to assist any way we can.
Thank you, agent Evans.
I know pulling together security on such short notice is no easy task.
Don't worry, Anna.
Everyone in this room has only one goal... your safety.
You changed your mind about the assassination.
Why?
Anna's plans for Tyler have accelerated, and like Hobbes said, we have an opportunity we may not get again.
I'm glad to see you're coming around to my way of thinking.
But we do it our way.
Without risking any innocent lives... no bombs.
We use a sharpshooter.
Hobbes can make the shot.
Our team has to be perfectly coordinated, because all eyes will be on us.
And media from all around the world.
We will have metal detectors at the security checkpoints and an ion scanner that will detect microscopic residue of explosives from clothing.
And we'll have a hard-line perimeter that no one will get through.
The event was organized last-minute, creating vulnerabilities we can exploit if we work together.
I'm only gonna have one shot to take Anna down.
Tell me where to place it.
To the right of her sternum.
Opposite side of the human heart.
The perimeter...
It's too far out.
Shot's gonna have to come from inside.
Okay, so how does he get in?
Hobbes?
Well, father, if you bring a noisy rabble to the west of... here, since you've joined me on the FBI bad boy list,
Erica's gonna have to send agents to deal with you.
They'll pull them from the security line, leaving a hole for Hobbes to get inside.
Once there, I'll give him access into the building.
I know that speaking out against the visitors will directly contradict your orders from the Vatican.
We're all putting everything on the line to stop Anna.
I'm just...
You can count on me.
Shot's too important.
You're gonna need a spotter... me.
And my men are gonna be among your rabble, making sure that the cops have a nice, long time away from their posts.
Good.
Our team's working as one... for tonight.
Marcus, your security officers informed me that Anna's personal safety will be handled by visitor guards.
That is correct.
Anna will never be left unprotected.
Anna's guards will know me by sight.
Which is why you're not gonna be there.
Anyone spots you, we're toast.
Okay, what about Chad?
He'll be covering the event.
Should we... should we tell him?
The fewer people who know about this, the less chance we have of getting caught.
Disposable, untraceable.
All information flows through me.
We toss them when we're done.
You ready for this?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a nice plan.
May just work.
Good.
Any questions?
No, you and your team have been very thorough.
Knowing you're in charge, agent Evans,
I'm sure Anna will feel much safer.
Marcus tells me everything is ready for tonight's announcement.
And Concordia's structures will be completed by the time the effects of red sky have readied the humans for breeding.
Your design is commendable.
They'll never know its true purpose until it's too late.
The landing function is interwoven into the building's infrastructure.
Once the cloaked ships set down, the next phase of the invasion may begin.
Then our soldiers can collect their women and prepare them for what's to come.
The humans think they're building their future, when in fact, they're digging their own graves.
Do you remember the day that we brought him home from the...
Wow.
You never dressed like that for work before.
Thanks for noticing.
Heard anything from Ty?
Um... he called.
He's staying overnight with Lisa.
At least I know she won't let anything happen to him.
Look... just, um...
Be careful.
Okay?
I will.
Listen, you have a long drive back.
Did, uh... do you wanna crash on the couch?
You sure?
Yeah.
Your daughter likes to be held.
Look how happy she is.
I got word you wanted to see me.
What is it, Ryan?
Torn by your decision?
Don't be.
Choosing your daughter over the humans was the right thing to do.
But you have to keep up your end of the bargain.
What else do you want?
You have infiltrated the Fifth Column.
I wanna know if there are any threats against us for tonight.
I purposely announced the gala last minute so there wouldn't be time to coordinate any violence.
There's nothing that I'm aware of.
I'm not deep enough to be privileged with that information.
Get in deeper.
Her disease is getting worse.
Poor thing.
Only my bliss and my bliss alone can alleviate her pain.
Then do it.
Don't let her suffer.
There, there.
All better...
For now.
I bet the president couldn't set up such a big party so fast.
Welcome to Anna's world.
Whatever she wants to happen...
Happens.
What are you doing here?
Talked Neil to getting me on the list.
Thought if I'm going to be covering Anna, I shouldn't miss it.
Think you can get me an introduction?
It's an honor to meet you, Anna.
Would you mind if I asked you one question off the record?
Kerry.
Ask anything you wish.
You gave us the healing centers and then red rain, and you cleaned our oceans and you brought life back to our deserts, but what's the real purpose behind all this generosity?
I don't understand your question.
Well, sometimes when people are given things they didn't ask for, there's a larger motive behind it.
In human culture, perhaps, but we've never given anything that wasn't needed.
Ask Chad.
We are of peace... always.
Thank you, Anna.
Great party.
The presentation will begin soon.
I hope you enjoy it.
All right, it's a go.
Keep it peaceful!
But keep it strong, okay?
Come on!
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
We've got some protesters to the east gate.
Requesting backup.
I just got a...
I know.
It's a protest.
South quadrant.
The good father Landry.
Peel off a couple of our guys, shut it down before it gets out of control.
I'm on my way.
Okay.
Let's go.
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
What do you got?
We've got a situation.
We're gonna need everybody down here.
It's a celebration unlike any other tonight, as visitor high commander Anna prepares to present her latest gift to humanity...
Concordia.
Anna is making her way to the podium now.
Only my bliss can alleviate her pain.
Ryan Nichols just reported in.
The Fifth Column is positioned to assassinate you.
We must proceed.
No.
I will take your place.
You are the target, not me.
What's happening?
I don't like this.
Marcus said something to Anna.
I think someone tipped them off.
Anna wishes to thank you all for coming.
However, she elected not to speak tonight and asked that I take her place.
We need to abort.
Negative.
We have a shot at Marcus.
That is not the plan.
Tell her Erica if we can't cut the head off the beast, we can at least rob it of its right hand.
We're never gonna have this opportunity again.
We've gotta take the shot.
To exemplify Concordia's spirit of cooperation between visitors and humans,
I would like to introduce to you an extraordinary young man...
It's war, Erica.
No retreat.
Think of what they have planned for your son... for humanity.
Fine.
Do it.
Now.
The first human to ever pilot a V shuttle...
Tyler Evans.
Abort, abort!
Hobbes can make the shot.
No, not if it means risking my son's life.
Your son's life is at risk if we don't take the shot.
We're taking it.
Tell her that I've got this.
Let me get him out of there.
When you have a clear shot, take it.
A clear shot.
Confirm.
Clear shot.
Confirmed.
Tyler!
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Tyler's mother, special agent Erica Evans.
This is a special moment...
Tyler, the first human shuttle pilot and Erica, head of the Fifth Column task force, a key figure in protecting our presence on this lovely planet.
Needless to say, the Evans family is a model of what Concordia stands for.
We've gotta get out of here now!
Joshua said that Marcus is alive, but his condition is critical.
His injuries were deep and intricate and despite our healing technologies, he may not survive.
Concordia must move forward despite this setback.
I need someone I can trust at my side to take Marcus' place.
Thank you, Thomas.
Tyler has informed us that he will not be joining our program as we had hoped.
I know that he was vital to your plan.
Tyler's important to us.
He's the one Lisa has chosen.
But he's not our only option.
There are others.
I'm so glad you decided not to do the shuttle program, Ty.
We got a lot of catching up to do.
You know...
When I saw the blood hit mom, all I could think was...
I don't wanna lose you guys.
Okay.
Prepare to be amazed.
Lug.
Thanks, mom.
Happy Birthday, Tyler.
Make a wish.
You're lucky you even have a job right now.
You know that?
You and Evans both.
What the hell happened tonight?
I don't know.
But I can think of a few colorful things to call it.
I have a theory.
Let's hear it.
I gave Erica a lot of rope today, and she took it.
Yeah, I've seen it.
Yeah, but you haven't seen this one.
It was taken this morning when she was supposed to be with her kid.
Surveillance unit had it for me when I got back here tonight.
What's your point?
This wasn't Lee Harvey Oswald in the school book depository.
It was a highly coordinated plan, multiple parties acting together.
Father's Landry protest was no coincidence.
It was a planned distraction.
Now I let him go because I wanna catch a bigger fish.
What are you saying, Chris?
It's a request to the Justice Department for a formal investigation into special agent Erica Evans.
I don't like it either, Paul.
But we can't ignore this any longer.
I heard all about what you did tonight, Jack.
You know what the consequences are for something like this.
The Vatican was clear.
I only did and said what I believe in.
I don't understand.
You'll be laicized.
You'll never wear the collar again.
They can take my collar.
But they can't take my faith.
You lied to me.
You knew about the assassination attempt before I left.
It may cost Marcus' life.
I'm sorry, Anna.
You were right.
I don't have anyone.
Okay?
That's why I warned you.
That's why I saved your life.
Now please.
Bliss my daughter.
I'll give you whatever you want, whoever you want.
Yes.
You will.
Thank you...
My queen.
Marcus' condition remains unknown at this time following the attempt on his life earlier tonight.
Stay tuned to WNT for continuing live coverage of all of the events surrounding tonight's gala.
Who the hell tipped Anna off?
There were only two people who had the information and the means to alert Anna.
Oh, correction.
One person...
And one reptile.
And I damn well know it wasn't Erica.
Ryan.
Previously on V...
Fifth Column has claimed responsibility for the peace ambassadors murders earlier this morning.
Cohn is out of control.
That could have been Tyler.
I want you to get close to Eli Cohn.
You will help me destroy them.
We're all on the same side.
Unlike you, we don't kill innocent people.
Church officials have issued a statement condemning all anti-V rhetoric from clergy worldwide.
I'm not gonna stop speaking out.
It's priests like him that are inciting the Fifth Column.
Stop!
This is the house of God!
That's Tyler's phone.
I feel like I'm losing him.
I need help.
I did what I had to do to protect our species.
Welcome to the future, Chad... our future, man and visitor.
This... is Concordia.
Concordia.
Interesting name.
From your Roman mythology, meaning a peaceful and harmonious coexistence.
Man and visitor working side by side to build thousands of these centers, creating jobs and supporting prosperity across the world.
Concordia will employ massive numbers of men and women.
Humans will be constructing the buildings, staffing the centers of learning and technology.
We've made agreements with nations around the world to build Concordia on land that is currently abandoned or in disrepair.
So Concordia is like a...
A worldwide urban renewal project.
Exactly.
I'll be hosting a gala tonight here in New York to formally announce Concordia, and tomorrow, a renaissance begins across the entire planet.
We will celebrate our future, shared by mankind and Visitors...
Together.
Stop!
This is the house of God!
This is Joe.
Leave a message.
Joe, it's me.
I need to see you.
It's about our son.
Hey, you.
Happy Birthday.
Thanks, mom.
Okay.
Well, it always tastes better than it looks.
Breakfast birthday cake...
Evans family tradition.
Yeah, well, when we were a family.
Oh, I'm...
I'm sorry, mom.
I-I just...
I don't know.
I thought that maybe dad would call by now, that's all.
Hey, it's okay.
He will.
It's early, right?
Have a piece of cake.
Um, actually, I have to meet Lisa at the peace ambassador center.
Tyler, they're killing peace ambassadors... kids your age.
Mom, I'm not a kid anymore.
You're right.
You're a man now.
Listen, I need you to remember that there are consequences for the choices we make.
You may be 18, but I am still your mother.
I will always be here for you.
Thanks, mom.
Thomas, as my chief engineer,
I'm relying on you to make sure
- that Concordia stays on schedule.
- It is, my queen.
Landing sites have been selected for every ship in the fleet in preparation for our invasion.
Perfect.
With the release of red rain, the human women are almost ready for breeding.
As soon as Joshua is able to eradicate the human soul, we can proceed.
I fear tonight's gala is a tempting target for the Fifth Column.
A disturbance could hinder public acceptance of Concordia and delay our plans.
The Fifth Column and Eli Cohn will not be a problem.
Ryan Nichols will make sure of that.
You wanted to see me.
Yeah.
Thanks for coming.
I don't understand.
I thought you were with, uh, agent Evans.
I am, but she doesn't know I'm here.
I want this to be kept private, Eli, just between us.
So what do you want from me?
I have a daughter.
Anna's holding her hostage up on that ship.
And the only way I can get her back is to take Anna down.
Our group is too small to do it alone.
You have a bigger network.
We need to work together so we can strike hard.
Well, Erica made it very clear that her cooperation last time was a one-shot deal,
that our ideological viewpoints of this fight are diametrically opposed.
Use me.
I can bridge both sides.
She trusts you?
Absolutely.
Good.
As the head of the FBI Fifth Column task force, she could be quite helpful.
You call her.
Get your team together.
Tonight...
We're taking Anna down for good.
We get the wiretap on father Landry yet?
Not yet.
Judge has the paper.
Evans, Bolling, clear your schedules.
You're running security for Anna's big shindig tonight.
Guest list.
Paul, it's gonna take weeks to run this many names.
Hey, uh, isn't that your ex?
Yeah.
A problem with Tyler.
I had to bring in the heavy artillery.
Heard about you two.
Sorry it didn't work out.
Federal officer married to a civilian...
It's always tough.
Runs a little deeper than that.
I'll only be a minute.
- Hi.
- Hey.
What's going on with Tyler?
It will be easier to explain after I show you this.
They've been here for decades, Joe.
Anna's waging a war against mankind, and for some reason, she's targeting our son.
I know it's a lot to grasp.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's a hell of a lot.
This, um, missing ladder within Ty's D.N.A....
Why would they do that?
We think that they wanna put something else in there...
Something not from you or me.
This is crazy.
The high levels of phosphorus in my blood, the preeclampsia...
The visitors did that.
They have been messing with Tyler since before he was born.
And what does...
What does Tyler know about all this?
Nothing, and we can't tell him.
If Anna ever thought that he knew, his life would be in danger.
And then you let...
you let him date one of them?
We can trust Lisa.
Who else knows about the visitors,
- about what they really are?
- There's a small group of us.
We have to be careful who we tell.
I need your help.
What do you think I can do and why do you think I can help?
The one thing that Tyler wants more than anything else is his family back together.
And that is the one thing that Anna can't give him.
I need you with me, Joe.
Lisa, what are you doing?
It's for Tyler.
Today is his 18th birthday.
It would raise suspicion if his girlfriend didn't give him a present.
Now that Tyler is 18, he will no longer be bound to do as his parents command.
He'll be able to make his own choices, and we must make sure he chooses us.
How can we be sure he'll do that?
Because I can give him something humanity cannot...
A future.
Interesting piece this morning, Chad.
You really think this Concordia project is all world peace, jobs for everyone, chicken in every pot?
Anna hasn't promised anything she didn't deliver so far.
Well, all the same, a lot of people are asking hard questions about her, but not you.
I'm not sure you're the guy to do it.
What's that supposed to mean, Neil?
A few months ago, everybody and their mother was drinking the V kool-aid.
Now people aren't so sure.
Ratings are slipping.
I wanna change the format of "Prime Focus"... add a, uh, critical voice to face off against you.
A kind of point/counterpoint?
Exactly.
We're bringing in talent from Boston, Philly, and D.C. this afternoon.
I'd like you to screen-test if somebody looks promising.
Whatever you need.
I'm surprised you're good with this.
Didn't figure you'd be so willing to share a spotlight.
Bring 'em on.
Going one-on-one with the other side is only gonna make me look better.
Hey.
Hey.
Happy Birthday.
Oh.
Thanks.
I wanted to get you something that will always remind you of us.
I love it...
And you.
Tyler...
Um...
Yesterday at the church...
Tyler.
Hey.
Lisa, you remember Tyler's dad?
Hi, kiddo.
Happy Birthday.
Look, I know things didn't go...
Too well last time.
I've been...
I've been talking to your mom, and I've been thinking about it so much since I saw you last.
You might not believe it, but when I turned 18,
I-I just...
I was so much like you.
I...
My old man...
He wasn't there for me either.
Sound familiar?
Go ahead.
Open it.
Just, uh, open it up.
After graduation, I set out on that route on that '82 Harley shovelhead.
Couple months on the road by myself, and it was the best time of my life because I found out who I really was.
The bike's yours.
I restored it for you myself.
But that's not a real gift.
This is.
You have a couple of months between high school and college, and I thought...
We both want for you to take some time to yourself, think about your future.
I will worry...
Every second that you're gone, but... make the trip.
And we'll be here for you when you get back.
Yeah.
I want another chance, Ty.
Tyler is too important.
With our plans accelerated, we need him here now.
We must make sure he's ready.
Can we stop him?
He appears to be giving his parents' gift serious consideration.
But he has yet to see my gift.
I've only got a minute.
Kendrick has me working security for Anna's gala, celebrate her latest "gift."
What if I told you that we can ensure that Anna never gave another "gift" to earth?
I went to see Eli Cohn.
Without telling us.
Yeah, last time I checked, we're all Fifth Column.
Let's hear him out.
Eli wants our help...
To assassinate Anna.
How?
A bomb.
He wouldn't tell me more until he knows that we're in.
We're not.
He's insane!
The collateral damage alone...
Which is exactly why he needs us.
With you handling security, we can minimize the collateral...
Minimize?
Ryan, we're talking about 300 innocent people.
No, no, Eli's right.
Now's the time to strike.
We know exactly where Anna's gonna be, and you're handling security.
We may never get another opportunity like this again.
Erica...
Lisa would be queen.
I'd get my daughter back, and Tyler...
Tyler would be safe.
Eli's giving us a chance, and I'm taking it...
With or without you.
Then you mean without me, too.
I'm with the lizard.
As much as I would love to take Anna out,
I can't agree to this.
Erica, we can end this war in one swift blow.
This is our shot.
Yeah, and how many innocents go with her?
Don't do this, Ryan.
Don't put me in a position tonight where I have to make a choice.
Because if I have to...
I will take you down.
What just happened in there?
We can't fall apart, not now.
I am not the one who changed the game plan.
Every day, Anna's grip on Tyler grows stronger and stronger.
You said it yourself, Jack...
no innocent lives.
Look, I know it wasn't easy.
We made the right choice.
Erica, I...
Joe.
Yeah.
Where are you?
I'll be right there.
What's going on?
Tyler got a call from Anna.
Said she had a birthday gift for him.
Erica, what a surprise.
I thought you would be busy with preparations for tonight.
I am.
Uh, Joe called.
He said Tyler was so excited.
I wanted us to all come up here, see this gift as a family.
I'm Joe Evans.
I'm Tyler's father.
Erica tells me that you've taken quite an interest in our son.
Tyler's special...
Which is why I wanted to present this very important birthday gift to him.
I'd like you to meet Thomas, my chief engineer.
Pleasure to meet you, Tyler.
Mr. and Mrs. Evans.
Wait.
So you, like, uh, designed the ship?
I did.
Anna tells me that you are the perfect candidate to become part of Concordia.
How would you like to be the first human to pilot one of our shuttles?
Happy Birthday, Tyler.
Thank... thank you.
Mother, how generous of you.
You will live here, and I will personally oversee your training.
For how long?
He's got school.
We'll work around his school schedule.
Soon enough, you'll be at the controls of your own shuttle.
Thank you so much.
Would you like a tour of the cockpit?
Yeah.
Well...
Thank you, Anna, uh, for giving our son this incredible opportunity.
Thank you for allowing me to play a role in his life.
Now if you'll excuse me, I must prepare for tonight.
I don't know what it means, but my mother said with Concordia starting, whatever she needs Tyler for, she needs him now.
Every plan she has pulls him farther and farther away from us.
How are we gonna protect him now?
Come on, Kerry.
You've gotta admit that Concordia, with cutting-edge technology, dynamic learning opportunities, and real jobs in a harsh economy is a home run for the visitors.
When newcomers arrive on your shores, you have to be careful...
Beware of Greeks bearing gifts?
Exactly.
The Trojan horse filled with soldiers, smallpox-infected blankets for the native Americans...
These gifts didn't work out too well for the recipients, did they?
But Anna has demonstrated the utility of her gifts.
We have clean air and revitalized deserts to prove it.
And I'm sure the native Americans were warm in their blankets before they started dying in them.
Cut.
That was great.
The public deserves to hear both sides.
It's good TV.
Kerry, job's yours if you want it.
Hey.
You've been gone a long time.
Everything okay with Ty?
Yeah.
He hasn't seen his dad for a while.
I wanted to be there for him, but I am up to speed.
Let's get the briefing started.
Great.
Nice to see you again, Marcus.
All right, people.
With the recent increase in Fifth Column attacks, protocol tonight will be security level one.
If I may, assistant director Kendrick...
Before we begin, Anna would like to say a few words.
I'd like to thank the entire FBI and most especially the Fifth Column task force for agreeing to provide security at this very important event.
We're happy to assist any way we can.
Thank you, agent Evans.
I know pulling together security on such short notice is no easy task.
Don't worry, Anna.
Everyone in this room has only one goal... your safety.
You changed your mind about the assassination.
Why?
Anna's plans for Tyler have accelerated, and like Hobbes said, we have an opportunity we may not get again.
I'm glad to see you're coming around to my way of thinking.
But we do it our way.
Without risking any innocent lives... no bombs.
We use a sharpshooter.
Hobbes can make the shot.
Our team has to be perfectly coordinated, because all eyes will be on us.
And media from all around the world.
We will have metal detectors at the security checkpoints and an ion scanner that will detect microscopic residue of explosives from clothing.
And we'll have a hard-line perimeter that no one will get through.
The event was organized last-minute, creating vulnerabilities we can exploit if we work together.
I'm only gonna have one shot to take Anna down.
Tell me where to place it.
To the right of her sternum.
Opposite side of the human heart.
The perimeter...
It's too far out.
Shot's gonna have to come from inside.
Okay, so how does he get in?
Hobbes?
Well, father, if you bring a noisy rabble to the west of... here, since you've joined me on the FBI bad boy list,
Erica's gonna have to send agents to deal with you.
They'll pull them from the security line, leaving a hole for Hobbes to get inside.
Once there, I'll give him access into the building.
I know that speaking out against the visitors will directly contradict your orders from the Vatican.
We're all putting everything on the line to stop Anna.
I'm just...
You can count on me.
Shot's too important.
You're gonna need a spotter... me.
And my men are gonna be among your rabble, making sure that the cops have a nice, long time away from their posts.
Good.
Our team's working as one... for tonight.
Marcus, your security officers informed me that Anna's personal safety will be handled by visitor guards.
That is correct.
Anna will never be left unprotected.
Anna's guards will know me by sight.
Which is why you're not gonna be there.
Anyone spots you, we're toast.
Okay, what about Chad?
He'll be covering the event.
Should we... should we tell him?
The fewer people who know about this, the less chance we have of getting caught.
Disposable, untraceable.
All information flows through me.
We toss them when we're done.
You ready for this?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a nice plan.
May just work.
Good.
Any questions?
No, you and your team have been very thorough.
Knowing you're in charge, agent Evans,
I'm sure Anna will feel much safer.
Marcus tells me everything is ready for tonight's announcement.
And Concordia's structures will be completed by the time the effects of red sky have readied the humans for breeding.
Your design is commendable.
They'll never know its true purpose until it's too late.
The landing function is interwoven into the building's infrastructure.
Once the cloaked ships set down, the next phase of the invasion may begin.
Then our soldiers can collect their women and prepare them for what's to come.
The humans think they're building their future, when in fact, they're digging their own graves.
Do you remember the day that we brought him home from the...
Wow.
You never dressed like that for work before.
Thanks for noticing.
Heard anything from Ty?
Um... he called.
He's staying overnight with Lisa.
At least I know she won't let anything happen to him.
Look... just, um...
Be careful.
Okay?
I will.
Listen, you have a long drive back.
Did, uh... do you wanna crash on the couch?
You sure?
Yeah.
Your daughter likes to be held.
Look how happy she is.
I got word you wanted to see me.
What is it, Ryan?
Torn by your decision?
Don't be.
Choosing your daughter over the humans was the right thing to do.
But you have to keep up your end of the bargain.
What else do you want?
You have infiltrated the Fifth Column.
I wanna know if there are any threats against us for tonight.
I purposely announced the gala last minute so there wouldn't be time to coordinate any violence.
There's nothing that I'm aware of.
I'm not deep enough to be privileged with that information.
Get in deeper.
Her disease is getting worse.
Poor thing.
Only my bliss and my bliss alone can alleviate her pain.
Then do it.
Don't let her suffer.
There, there.
All better...
For now.
I bet the president couldn't set up such a big party so fast.
Welcome to Anna's world.
Whatever she wants to happen...
Happens.
What are you doing here?
Talked Neil to getting me on the list.
Thought if I'm going to be covering Anna, I shouldn't miss it.
Think you can get me an introduction?
It's an honor to meet you, Anna.
Would you mind if I asked you one question off the record?
Kerry.
Ask anything you wish.
You gave us the healing centers and then red rain, and you cleaned our oceans and you brought life back to our deserts, but what's the real purpose behind all this generosity?
I don't understand your question.
Well, sometimes when people are given things they didn't ask for, there's a larger motive behind it.
In human culture, perhaps, but we've never given anything that wasn't needed.
Ask Chad.
We are of peace... always.
Thank you, Anna.
Great party.
The presentation will begin soon.
I hope you enjoy it.
All right, it's a go.
Keep it peaceful!
But keep it strong, okay?
Come on!
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
We've got some protesters to the east gate.
Requesting backup.
I just got a...
I know.
It's a protest.
South quadrant.
The good father Landry.
Peel off a couple of our guys, shut it down before it gets out of control.
I'm on my way.
Okay.
Let's go.
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
What do you got?
We've got a situation.
We're gonna need everybody down here.
It's a celebration unlike any other tonight, as visitor high commander Anna prepares to present her latest gift to humanity...
Concordia.
Anna is making her way to the podium now.
Only my bliss can alleviate her pain.
Ryan Nichols just reported in.
The Fifth Column is positioned to assassinate you.
We must proceed.
No.
I will take your place.
You are the target, not me.
What's happening?
I don't like this.
Marcus said something to Anna.
I think someone tipped them off.
Anna wishes to thank you all for coming.
However, she elected not to speak tonight and asked that I take her place.
We need to abort.
Negative.
We have a shot at Marcus.
That is not the plan.
Tell her Erica if we can't cut the head off the beast, we can at least rob it of its right hand.
We're never gonna have this opportunity again.
We've gotta take the shot.
To exemplify Concordia's spirit of cooperation between visitors and humans,
I would like to introduce to you an extraordinary young man...
It's war, Erica.
No retreat.
Think of what they have planned for your son... for humanity.
Fine.
Do it.
Now.
The first human to ever pilot a V shuttle...
Tyler Evans.
Abort, abort!
Hobbes can make the shot.
No, not if it means risking my son's life.
Your son's life is at risk if we don't take the shot.
We're taking it.
Tell her that I've got this.
Let me get him out of there.
When you have a clear shot, take it.
A clear shot.
Confirm.
Clear shot.
Confirmed.
Tyler!
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Tyler's mother, special agent Erica Evans.
This is a special moment...
Tyler, the first human shuttle pilot and Erica, head of the Fifth Column task force, a key figure in protecting our presence on this lovely planet.
Needless to say, the Evans family is a model of what Concordia stands for.
We've gotta get out of here now!
Joshua said that Marcus is alive, but his condition is critical.
His injuries were deep and intricate and despite our healing technologies, he may not survive.
Concordia must move forward despite this setback.
I need someone I can trust at my side to take Marcus' place.
Thank you, Thomas.
Tyler has informed us that he will not be joining our program as we had hoped.
I know that he was vital to your plan.
Tyler's important to us.
He's the one Lisa has chosen.
But he's not our only option.
There are others.
I'm so glad you decided not to do the shuttle program, Ty.
We got a lot of catching up to do.
You know...
When I saw the blood hit mom, all I could think was...
I don't wanna lose you guys.
Okay.
Prepare to be amazed.
Lug.
Thanks, mom.
Happy Birthday, Tyler.
Make a wish.
You're lucky you even have a job right now.
You know that?
You and Evans both.
What the hell happened tonight?
I don't know.
But I can think of a few colorful things to call it.
I have a theory.
Let's hear it.
I gave Erica a lot of rope today, and she took it.
Yeah, I've seen it.
Yeah, but you haven't seen this one.
It was taken this morning when she was supposed to be with her kid.
Surveillance unit had it for me when I got back here tonight.
What's your point?
This wasn't Lee Harvey Oswald in the school book depository.
It was a highly coordinated plan, multiple parties acting together.
Father's Landry protest was no coincidence.
It was a planned distraction.
Now I let him go because I wanna catch a bigger fish.
What are you saying, Chris?
It's a request to the Justice Department for a formal investigation into special agent Erica Evans.
I don't like it either, Paul.
But we can't ignore this any longer.
I heard all about what you did tonight, Jack.
You know what the consequences are for something like this.
The Vatican was clear.
I only did and said what I believe in.
I don't understand.
You'll be laicized.
You'll never wear the collar again.
They can take my collar.
But they can't take my faith.
You lied to me.
You knew about the assassination attempt before I left.
It may cost Marcus' life.
I'm sorry, Anna.
You were right.
I don't have anyone.
Okay?
That's why I warned you.
That's why I saved your life.
Now please.
Bliss my daughter.
I'll give you whatever you want, whoever you want.
Yes.
You will.
Thank you...
My queen.
Marcus' condition remains unknown at this time following the attempt on his life earlier tonight.
Stay tuned to WNT for continuing live coverage of all of the events surrounding tonight's gala.
Who the hell tipped Anna off?
There were only two people who had the information and the means to alert Anna.
Oh, correction.
One person...
And one reptile.
And I damn well know it wasn't Erica.
Ryan.
NARRATOR:
Previously on V:
CHAD [ON TV]:
Fifth Column has claimed responsibility for the Peace Ambassador murders.
Cohrs out of control.
Could've been Tyler.
Get close to Eli Cohn.
You will help me destroy them.
- We're on the same side.
- We don't kill innocent people.
Church officials have issued a statement condemning all anti-V rhetoric from clergy worldwide.
I'm not gonna stop.
It's priests like him that are inciting the Fifth Column.
TRAVIS:
This is a house of God!
That's Tyler's phone.
I'm losing him.
I need help.
I did what I had to do to protect our species.
ANNA:
Welcome to the future, Chad.
Our future.
Man and Visitor.
This is Concordia.
Concordia.
Interesting name.
From your Roman mythology, meaning a peaceful and harmonious coexistence.
Man and Visitor working side by side to build thousands of these centers creating jobs and supporting prosperity across the world.
Concordia will employ massive numbers of men and women.
Humans will be constructing the buildings staffing the centers of learning and technology.
We've made agreements with nations around the world to build Concordia on land that is abandoned or in disrepair.
So Concordia's like a worldwide urban-renewal project?
Exactly.
I'll be hosting a gala tonight in New York to formally announce Concordia.
And tomorrow, a renaissance begins across the entire planet.
We will celebrate our future, shared by mankind and Visitors together.
[TV CLICKS OFF]
TRAVIS:
This is a house of God!
[LINE RINGS]
JOE [ON RECORDING]:
This is Joe.
Leave a message.
Joe, it's me.
I need to see you.
It's about our son.
Hey, you.
- Happy birthday.
- Heh.
- Thanks, Mom.
Heh.
- Okay.
[TYLER CHUCKLES]
[ERICA CHUCKLES]
Well, it always tastes better than it looks.
Breakfast birthday cake.
Evans family tradition.
Yeah, well, when we were a family.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mom.
I just...
I don't know, I thought Dad would call by now.
Hey, it's okay.
He will.
It's early, right?
Have a piece of cake.
Actually, I have to meet Lisa at the Peace Ambassador Center.
Tyler, they're killing Peace Ambassadors.
Kids your age.
Mom, I'm not a kid anymore.
You're right.
You're a man now.
I need you to remember that there are consequences for the choices we make.
You may be 18, but I am still your mother.
I will always be here for you.
Thanks, Mom.
Thomas, as my chief engineer, I'm relying on you to make sure Concordia stays on schedule.
THOMAS:
It is, my queen.
Landing sites have been selected for every ship in preparation for our invasion.
ANNA:
Perfect.
With the release of Red Rain the human women are almost ready for breeding.
As soon as Joshua is able to eradicate the human soul, we can proceed.
Tonight's gala is a tempting target for the Fifth Column.
A disturbance could hinder public acceptance of Concordia and delay our plans.
The Fifth Column and Eli Cohn will not be a problem.
Ryan Nichols will make sure of that.
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.
Thanks for coming.
I don't understand.
I thought you were with Agent Evans.
I am.
But she doesn't know I'm here.
I want this to be kept private, Eli.
Just between us.
So, what do you want from me?
I have a daughter.
Anna's holding her hostage on that ship.
Now, the only way I can get her back is to take Anna down.
Our group is too small to do it alone.
You have a bigger network.
We need to work together so we can strike hard.
Erica made it very clear that her cooperation last time was a one-shot deal.
That our ideological viewpoints of this fight are diametrically opposed.
Use me.
I can bridge both sides.
She trusts you?
Absolutely.
Good.
As the head of the FBI Fifth Column Task Force, she could be quite helpful.
You call her.
Get your team together.
Tonight we're taking Anna down for good.
We get the wiretap on Father Landry yet?
Not yet.
Judge has the paper.
Evans, Bolling, clear your schedules.
You're running security for Anna's big shindig tonight.
Guest list.
Paul, it's gonna take weeks to run this many names.
Hey, isn't that your ex?
Yeah.
Problem with Tyler.
Had to bring in the heavy artillery.
Heard about you two.
Sorry it didn't work out.
Federal officer married to a civilian, that's always tough.
Runs a little deeper than that.
I'll only be a minute.
- Hi.
- Hey.
What's going on with Tyler?
It will be easier to explain after I show you this.
ERICA:
They've been here for decades, Joe.
Anna's waging a war against mankind and for some reason, she's targeting our son.
- I know it's a lot to grasp.
- Yeah.
Yeah, it's a hell of a lot.
This missing ladder in Ty's DNA, why would they do that?
We think they wanna put something else in there.
Something not from you or me.
This is crazy.
The high levels of phosphorous in my blood, the preeclampsia the Visitors did that.
They have been messing with Tyler since before he was born.
What does Tyler know about all this?
Nothing.
And we can't tell him.
If Anna ever thought that he knew, his life would be in danger.
And yet you let him date one of them?
We can trust Lisa.
Who else knows about the Visitors, what they are?
There's a small group of us.
We have to be careful who we tell.
I need your help.
What do you think I can do?
Why do you think I can help?
The one thing that Tyler wants more than anything else is his family back together.
And that is the one thing that Anna can't give him.
I need you with me, Joe.
ANNA:
Lisa, what are you doing?
It's for Tyler.
Today is his 18th birthday.
It would raise suspicion if his girlfriend didn't give him a present.
Now that Tyler is 18 he will no longer be bound to do as his parents command.
He'll be able to make his own choices.
And we must make sure he chooses us.
How can we be sure he'll do that?
Because I can give him something humanity cannot.
A future.
Interesting piece this morning, Chad.
You think this Concordia project is all world peace jobs for everyone, chicken in every pot?
Anna hasn't promised anything she didn't deliver.
All the same, a lot of people are asking questions about her.
But not you.
And I'm not sure you're the guy to do it.
What's that supposed to mean, Neil?
A few months ago, everybody and their mother was drinking the V Kool-Aid.
Now people aren't so sure.
Ratings are slipping.
I wanna change the format of Prime Focus.
Add a critical voice to face off against you.
- A kind of point-counterpoint?
- Exactly.
We're bringing in talent from Boston, Philly and D.C. This afternoon.
Screen-test if somebody looks promising.
Whatever you need.
I'm surprised you're good with this.
Didrt figure you'd be so willing to share the spotlight.
Bring them on.
Going one-on-one with the other side is only gonna make me look better.
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Happy birthday.
- Oh.
Thanks.
I wanted to get you something that will always remind you of us.
[DEVICE CHIRPS]
I love it.
And you.
Tyler.
Um...
- Yesterday at the church...
ERICA:
Tyler?
Hey.
Lisa, you remember Tyler's dad?
Hey, kiddo.
Happy birthday.
Look, I know things didn't go too well last time.
And I've been talking to your mom and thinking about it since I saw you last.
You might not believe it, but when I turned 18 I was so much like you.
My old man he wasrt there for me either.
Sound familiar?
- Go ahead.
Just open it up.
- Open it.
After graduation, I set out on that route on that '82 Harley Shovelhead.
Couple months on the road by myself.
And it was the best time of my life.
Because I found out who I really was.
The bike's yours.
I restored it for you myself.
- But that's not our real gift.
- This is.
You have a couple of months between high school and college and I thought...
We both want for you to take some time to yourself, think about your future.
I will worry every second that you're gone but make the trip.
And we'll be here when you get back.
ERICA:
Yeah.
I want another chance, Ty.
Tyler is too important.
With our plans accelerated, we need him here now.
We must make sure he's ready.
Can we stop him?
He appears to be giving his parents' gift serious consideration.
But he has yet to see my gift.
I've only got a minute.
Kendrick has me working security for Anna's gala, celebrate her latest gift.
What if I told you we can ensure that Anna never gave another gift to Earth?
- I went to see Cohn.
- Without telling us.
- Last I checked, we're all Fifth Column.
- Let's hear him out.
Eli wants our help.
To assassinate Anna.
- How?
- A bomb.
- He wouldn't tell me more until we're in.
- We're not.
He's insane.
- The collateral damage alone...
- Which is exactly why he needs us.
With you handling security, we minimize collateral.
Minimize?
Ryan, we're talking about 300 innocent people.
No, no.
Eli's right.
Now's the time to strike.
We know exactly where Anna's gonna be.
And you're handling security.
We may never get an opportunity like this again.
Erica, Lisa would be queen.
I'd get my daughter back.
And Tyler...
Tyler would be safe.
Eli's giving us a chance and I'm taking it.
With or without you.
Then you mean without me too.
I'm with the lizard.
As much as I would love to take Anna out I can't agree to this.
Erica, we can end this war with one swift blow.
- This is our shot.
- And how many innocents go with her?
ERICA:
Don't do this, Ryan.
Don't put me in a position tonight where I have to make a choice.
Because if I have to I will take you down.
What just happened?
We can't fall apart, not now.
I am not the one who changed the plan.
Every day, Anna's grip on Tyler grows stronger and stronger.
You said it yourself, Jack.
No innocent lives.
Look, I know it wasrt easy.
- You made the right choice.
- Erica, I...
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
Joe.
Yeah.
Where are you?
I'll be right there.
- What's going on?
- Tyler got a call from Anna.
Said she had a birthday gift for him.
Erica, what a surprise.
I thought you would be busy with preparations.
I am.
Joe called.
He said Tyler was so excited.
I wanted us to all come up here, see this gift as a family.
I'm Joe Evans.
I'm Tyler's father.
Erica tells me you've taken quite an interest in our son.
Tyler is special.
Which is why I wanted to present this very important birthday gift to him.
I'd like you to meet Thomas, my chief engineer.
Pleasure to meet you, Tyler.
Mr. And Mrs. Evans.
Wait, so you, like, designed this ship?
- I did.
- Heh.
THOMAS:
Anna tells me that you're the perfect candidate to become part of Concordia.
How would you like to be the first human to pilot one of our shuttles?
Happy birthday, Tyler.
Thank you...
Thank you.
Mother, how generous of you.
You will live here, and I will personally oversee your training.
- For how long?
- He's got school.
We'll work around his school schedule.
Soon enough you'll be at the controls of your own shuttle.
Thank you so much.
Would you like a tour of the cockpit?
- Yeah.
- Come.
Thank you, Anna, for giving our son this incredible opportunity.
Thank you for allowing me to play a role in his life.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I must prepare for tonight.
I don't know what it means, but my mother said, with Concordia starting whatever she needs Tyler for, she needs him now.
Every plan she has pulls him farther and farther away from us.
How are we gonna protect him now?
Come on, Kerry, you've gotta admit that Concordia with cutting-edge technology dynamic learning opportunities, real jobs in a harsh economy is a home run for the Visitors.
When newcomers arrive, you have to be careful...
- Beware of Greeks bearing gifts?
- Exactly.
The Trojan horse filled with soldiers.
Smallpox-infected blankets for Native Americans.
These gifts didn't work out too well for the recipients.
But Anna has demonstrated the utility of her gifts.
We have clean air and revitalized deserts to prove it.
I'm sure Native Americans were warm in their blankets before they started dying.
NEIL:
Cut.
CAMERAMAN:
We're clear.
That was great.
The public deserves to hear both sides.
It's good TV.
Kerry, the job's yours if you want it.
[PHONES RINGING]
Hey.
You've been gone a long time.
Everything okay with Ty?
He hasn't seen his dad for a while.
I wanted to be there.
I'm up to speed.
Let's get the briefing started.
Great.
ERICA:
Nice to see you again, Marcus.
All right, people.
With the recent increase in Fifth Column attacks protocol will be Security Level One.
If I may, Assistant Director Kendrick.
Before we begin, Anna would like to say a few words.
I'd like to thank the entire FBI most especially the Fifth Column Task Force for providing security at this very important event.
We're happy to assist any way we can.
ANNA:
Thank you, Agent Evans.
I know pulling together security on such short notice is no easy task.
Don't worry, Anna.
Everyone in this room has only one goal:
Your safety.
You changed your mind about the assassination.
Why?
Anna's plans for Tyler have accelerated.
And like Hobbes said, we have an opportunity we may not get again.
Glad to see you're coming around.
But we do it our way.
Without risking any innocent lives.
- No bombs.
- We use a sharpshooter.
Hobbes can make the shot.
Our team has to be perfectly coordinated.
Because all eyes will be on us.
And media from all around the world.
We'll have metal detectors at checkpoints and an ion scanner that will detect microscopic residue of explosives.
And we'll have a hard-line perimeter that no one will get through.
The event was organized last-minute, creating vulnerabilities we can exploit.
I'm only gonna have one shot to take Anna down.
Tell me where to place it.
To the right of her sternum.
Opposite side of the human heart.
The perimeter, it's too far out.
- Shot's gonna have to come from inside.
- Okay, so how does he get in?
ERICA:
Hobbes?
Well, Father, if you bring a noisy rabble to the west of here since you've joined me on the FBI bad-boy list Erica will send agents to deal with you.
They'll pull them from security, leaving a hole for Hobbes to get inside.
Once there, I'll give him access into the building.
I know speaking out against the Visitors will directly contradict your orders from the Vatican.
We're all putting everything on the line to stop Anna.
I'm just...
You can count on me.
The shot's too important.
You're gonna need a spotter.
Me.
My men will be among your rabble making sure the cops have a nice long time away.
Good.
Our teams working as one.
For tonight.
Marcus, your security officers informed me that Anna's personal safety will be handled by Visitor guards.
- Correct.
Anna will never be left unprotected.
- Anna's guards will know me by sight.
ERICA:
You're not gonna be there.
- Anyone spots you, we're toast.
- What about Chad?
He'll be covering the event.
Should we tell him?
The fewer people who know about this, the less chance we have of getting caught.
Disposable.
Untraceable.
All information flows through me.
We toss them when we're done.
- You ready for this?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- It's a nice plan.
May just work.
Good.
Any questions?
No, you and your team have been very thorough.
Knowing you're in charge, Agent Evans, I am sure Anna will feel much safer.
ANNA:
Marcus tells me everything is ready for tonight's announcement.
Concordia's structures will be completed by the time the effects of Red Sky have readied the humans for breeding.
Your design is commendable.
They'll never know its true purpose until it's too late.
The landing function is interwoven into the building's infrastructure.
Once the cloaked ships set down the next phase of the invasion may begin.
Then our soldiers can collect their women and prepare them for what's to come.
The humans think they're building their future when in fact they're digging their own graves.
[JOE CHUCKLES]
Oh, God.
Do you remember the day that we brought him home from the...?
Wow.
You've never dressed like that for work before.
Thanks for noticing.
Have you heard anything from Ty?
Um...
He called.
He's staying overnight with Lisa.
At least I know she won't let anything happen to him.
[JOE SIGHS]
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
JOE:
Listen, um you be careful, okay?
I will.
Listen, you have a long drive back.
Do you wanna crash on the couch?
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Your daughter likes to be held.
- Look how happy she is.
- I got word you wanted to see me.
What is it, Ryan?
Torn by your decision?
Don't be.
Choosing your daughter over the humans was the right thing to do.
But you have to keep up your end of the bargain.
What else do you want?
You've infiltrated the Fifth Column.
I wanna know if there are any threats against us for tonight.
I announced the gala last-minute so there wouldn't be time to coordinate any violence.
[BABY CRYING]
There's nothing that I'm aware of.
I'm not deep enough to be privileged with that information.
Get in deeper.
Her disease is getting worse, poor thing.
Only my Bliss, and my Bliss alone, can alleviate the pain.
Then do it.
Don't let her suffer.
[BABY WAILING]
[BABY STOPS CRYING]
[BABY COOING]
There, there.
All better for now.
[GUESTS CHATTERING]
I bet the president couldn't set up such a big party so fast.
Welcome to Anna's world.
Whatever she wants to happen happens.
- What are you doing here?
- Talked Neil into getting me on the list.
Thought, if I'm gonna be covering Anna, I shouldn't miss it.
Think you can get me an introduction?
It's an honor to meet you, Anna.
Would you mind if I asked you one question off the record?
Kerry.
Ask anything you wish.
You gave us the Healing Centers and then Red Rain.
You cleaned our oceans and brought life to our deserts.
But what's the real purpose behind all this generosity?
I don't understand your question.
When people are given things they didn't ask for there's a larger motive behind it.
In human culture, perhaps.
But we've never given anything that wasrt needed.
Ask Chad.
We are of peace.
Always.
Thank you, Anna.
Great party.
The presentation will begin soon.
I hope you enjoy it.
[CELL PHONE BEEPS]
[GROUP CHATTERING]
JACK:
All right, let's go.
Keep it peaceful, but keep it strong, okay?
Come on.
AGENT [OVER COMM]:
Father Landry's organizing protestors at the east gate.
Requesting backup.
- I just got a...
- I know.
Protest, south quadrant.
Good Father Landry.
Peel off a couple of our guys, shut it down.
- I'm on my way.
- Okay.
[CELL PHONE BEEPS]
Let's go.
CROWD [CHANTING]:
V's go home.
V's go home.
COP 1:
Whoa, back it up, please.
CROWD:
V's go home.
V's go home.
V's go home.
COP 2:
Moving in.
CROWD:
V's go home.
- What do you got?
- Got a situation.
We're gonna need everybody you got down here.
[ON TV] It's a celebration unlike any other tonight as Visitor High Commander Anna prepares to present her latest gift to humanity:
Concordia.
Anna is making her way to the podium now.
ANNA:
Only my Bliss can alleviate her pain.
EMCEE:
Ladies and gentlemen, here to launch the Concordia project please welcome to the podium High Commander Anna.
[LOUD CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Ryan just reported in.
The Fifth Column is positioned to assassinate you.
- We must proceed.
- No.
I will take your place.
You are the target, not me.
- What's happening?
I don't like this.
- Marcus said something to Anna.
I think someone tipped them off.
Anna wishes to thank you all for coming however she elected not to speak tonight and asked that I take her place.
- We need to abort.
- Negative.
- We have a shot at Marcus.
ERICA:
That is not the plan.
If we can't cut the head off the beast we can at least rob it of its right hand.
We'll never have this opportunity again.
We gotta take the shot.
To exemplify Concordia's spirit of cooperation between Visitors and humans I'd like to introduce to you an extraordinary young man.
It's war, Erica.
No retreat.
Think of what they have planned for your son.
For humanity.
Fine.
Do it.
Now.
The first human to ever pilot a V shuttle:
Tyler Evans.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Abort.
Abort.
Hobbes can make the shot.
Not if it means risking my sors life.
Your sors life is at risk if we don't take the shot.
- We're taking it.
- Tell Erica I've got this.
Let me get him out of there.
When you have a clear shot, take it.
A clear shot.
Confirm.
Clear shot.
Confirmed.
MARCUS:
Thank you.
Tyler!
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Tyler's mother, Special Agent Erica Evans.
This is a special moment.
Tyler, the first human shuttle pilot and Erica, head of the Fifth Column Task Force a key figure in protecting our presence on this lovely planet.
Needless to say, the Evans family is a model of what Concordia stands for.
MAN:
Move!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Secure the area!
[PEOPLE SCREAMING]
We're good.
We've gotta get out of here now.
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
THOMAS:
Joshua said that Marcus is alive but his condition is critical.
His injuries were deep and intricate and despite our healing technologies, he may not survive.
Concordia must move forward despite this setback.
I need someone I can trust at my side, to take Marcus' place.
Thank you, Thomas.
Tyler has informed us that he will not be joining our program as we had hoped.
I know that he was vital to your plan.
Tyler is important to us.
He's the one Lisa has chosen.
But he's not our only option.
There are others.
I'm so glad you decided not to do the shuttle program, Ty.
We got a lot of catching up to do.
You know, when I saw the blood hit Mom all I could think was I don't wanna lose you guys.
Okay.
Prepare to be amazed.
- Look at that.
- Thanks, Mom.
Happy birthday, Tyler.
Make a wish.
You're lucky you have a job right now, you know that?
You and Evans both.
- What the hell happened tonight?
- I don't know.
But I can think of a few colorful things to call it.
I have a theory.
Let's hear it.
I gave Erica a lot of rope today, and she took it.
- Yeah, I've seen it.
- Yeah, but you haven't seen this one.
It was taken this morning when she was supposed to be with her kid.
Surveillance unit had it for me when I got back here tonight.
What's your point?
This wasrt Lee Harvey Oswald and the school book depository.
It was a highly coordinated plan, multiple parties acting together.
Father Landry's protest was no coincidence.
It was a planned distraction.
Now, I let him go because I wanna catch a bigger fish.
What are you saying, Chris?
Request to the Justice Department for a formal investigation into Special Agent Erica Evans.
I don't like it either, Paul.
But we can't ignore this any longer.
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
I heard all about what you did tonight, Jack.
You know what the consequences are for something like this.
The Vatican was clear.
I only did and said what I believe in.
I don't understand.
You'll be laicized.
You'll never wear the collar again.
They can take my collar but they can't take my faith.
[DOOR OPENS]
You lied to me.
You knew about the assassination attempt before I left.
It may cost Marcus his life.
I'm sorry, Anna.
You were right.
I don't have anyone.
Okay?
That's why I warned you.
That's why I saved your life.
Now, please, Bliss my daughter.
[BABY CRYING]
I'll give you whatever you want.
Whoever you want.
Yes you will.
[CRYING]
[STOPS CRYING]
Thank you my queen.
[BABY BABBLING]
Marcus' condition remains unknown at this time following the attempt on his life earlier tonight.
Stay tuned to WNT for continuing live coverage of all of the events surrounding tonight's gala.
[TV CLICKS OFF]
Who the hell tipped Anna off?
There were only two people who had the information and the means to alert her.
Or correction:
One person and one reptile.
I know damn well it wasrt Erica.
Ryan.
[English
- US
- SDH]
Previously on V...
Fifth Column has claimed responsibility for the peace ambassadors murders earlier this morning.
Cohn is out of control.
- That could have been Tyler.
- I want you to get close to Eli Cohn.
- You will help me destroy them.
- We're all on the same side.
Unlike you, we don't kill innocent people.
Church officials have issued a statement condemning all anti-V rhetoric from clergy worldwide.
I'm not gonna stop speaking out.
It's priests like him that are inciting the Fifth Column.
Stop!
This is the house of God!
That's Tyler's phone.
I feel like I'm losing him.
I need help.
I did what I had to do to protect our species.
Welcome to the future, Chad... our future, man and Visitor.
This... is Concordia.
Concordia.
Interesting name.
From your Roman mythology, meaning a peaceful and harmonious coexistence.
Man and Visitor working side by side to build thousands of these centers, creating jobs and supporting prosperity across the world.
Concordia will employ massive numbers of men and women.
Humans will be constructing the buildings, staffing the centers of learning and technology.
We've made agreements with nations around the world to build Concordia on land that is currently abandoned or in disrepair.
So Concordia is like a...
A worldwide urban renewal project.
Exactly.
I'll be hosting a gala tonight here in New York to formally announce Concordia, and tomorrow, a renaissance begins across the entire planet.
We will celebrate our future, shared by mankind and Visitors...
Together.
Stop!
This is the house of God!
This is Joe.
Leave a message.
Joe, it's me.
I need to see you.
It's about our son.
Hey, you.
Happy Birthday.
Thanks, Mom.
Okay.
Well, it always tastes better than it looks.
Breakfast birthday cake...
Evans family tradition.
Yeah, well, when we were a family.
Oh, I'm...
I'm sorry, Mom.
I...
I just...
I don't know.
I thought that maybe Dad would call by now, that's all.
Hey, it's okay.
He will.
It's early, right?
Have a piece of cake.
Um, actually, I have to meet Lisa at the peace ambassador center.
Tyler, they're killing peace ambassadors...
Kids your age.
Mom, I'm not a kid anymore.
You're right.
You're a man now.
Listen, I need you to remember that there are consequences for the choices we make.
You may be eighteen, but I am still your mother.
I will always be here for you.
Thanks, Mom.
Thomas, as my chief engineer,
I'm relying on you to make sure
- that Concordia stays on schedule.
- It is, my Queen.
Landing sites have been selected for every ship in the fleet in preparation for our invasion.
Perfect.
With the release of red rain, the human women are almost ready for breeding.
As soon as Joshua is able to eradicate the human soul, we can proceed.
I fear tonight's gala is a tempting target for the Fifth Column.
A disturbance could hinder public acceptance of Concordia and delay our plans.
The Fifth Column and Eli Cohn will not be a problem.
Ryan Nichols will make sure of that.
You wanted to see me.
- Yeah.
Thanks for coming.
- I don't understand.
I thought you were with, uh, Agent Evans.
I am, but she doesn't know I'm here.
I want this to be kept private, Eli, just between us.
So what do you want from me?
I have a daughter.
Anna's holding her hostage up on that ship.
And the only way I can get her back is to take Anna down.
Our group is too small to do it alone.
You have a bigger network.
We need to work together so we can strike hard.
Well, Erica made it very clear that her cooperation last time was a one-shot deal,
that our ideological viewpoints of this fight are diametrically opposed.
Use me.
I can bridge both sides.
She trusts you?
Absolutely.
Good.
As the head of the FBI Fifth Column task force, she could be quite helpful.
You call her.
Get your team together.
Tonight...
We're taking Anna down for good.
We get the wiretap on Father Landry yet?
Not yet.
Judge has the papers.
Evans, Bolling, clear your schedules.
You're running security for Anna's big shindig tonight.
Guest list.
Paul, it's gonna take weeks to run this many names.
Hey, uh, isn't that your ex?
Yeah.
A problem with Tyler.
I had to bring in the heavy artillery.
Heard about you two.
Sorry it didn't work out.
Federal officer married to a civilian...
It's always tough.
Runs a little deeper than that.
I'll only be a minute.
- Hi.
- Hey.
What's going on with Tyler?
It will be easier to explain after I show you this.
They've been here for decades, Joe.
Anna's waging a war against mankind, and for some reason, she's targeting our son.
- I know it's a lot to grasp.
- Yeah.
Yeah, it's a hell of a lot.
This, um, missing ladder within Ty's D.N.A...
Why would they do that?
We think that they wanna put something else in there...
- Something not from you or me.
- This is crazy.
The high levels of phosphorus in my blood, the preeclampsia...
The Visitors did that.
They have been messing with Tyler since before he was born.
And what does...
What does Tyler know about all this?
Nothing, and we can't tell him.
If Anna ever thought that he knew, his life would be in danger.
And then you let...
You let him date one of them?
We can trust Lisa.
Who else knows about the Visitors,
- about what they really are?
- There's a small group of us.
We have to be careful who we tell.
I need your help.
What do you think I can do and why do you think I can help?
The one thing that Tyler wants more than anything else is his family back together.
And that is the one thing that Anna can't give him.
I need you with me, Joe.
Lisa, what are you doing?
It's for Tyler.
Today is his eighteenth birthday.
It would raise suspicion if his girlfriend didn't give him a present.
Now that Tyler is eighteen, he will no longer be bound to do as his parents command.
He'll be able to make his own choices, and we must make sure he chooses us.
How can we be sure he'll do that?
Because I can give him something humanity cannot...
A future.
Interesting piece this morning, Chad.
You really think this Concordia project is all world peace, jobs for everyone, chicken in every pot?
Anna hasn't promised anything she didn't deliver so far.
Well, all the same, a lot of people are asking hard questions about her, but not you.
I'm not sure you're the guy to do it.
What's that supposed to mean, Neil?
A few months ago, everybody and their mother was drinking the V kool-aid.
Now people aren't so sure.
Ratings are slipping.
I wanna change the format of Prime Focus... add a, uh, critical voice to face off against you.
- A kind of point/counterpoint?
- Exactly.
We're bringing in talent from Boston, Philly, and D.C. this afternoon.
I'd like you to screen-test if somebody looks promising.
Whatever you need.
I'm surprised you're good with this.
Didn't figure you'd be so willing to share a spotlight.
Bring 'em on.
Going one-on-one with the other side is only gonna make me look better.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Happy Birthday.
Oh.
Thanks.
I wanted to get you something that will always remind you of us.
I love it...
And you.
Tyler...
Um...
Yesterday at the church...
Tyler.
Hey.
Lisa, you remember Tyler's dad?
Hi, Kiddo.
Happy Birthday.
Look, I know things didn't go... too well last time.
I've been...
I've been talking to your mom, and I've been thinking about it so much since I saw you last.
You might not believe it, but when I turned eighteen,
I...
I just...
I was so much like you.
I...
My old man...
He wasn't there for me either.
Sound familiar?
- Go ahead.
- Open it.
Just, uh, open it up.
After graduation, I set out on that route on that '82 Harley shovelhead.
Couple months on the road by myself, and it was the best time of my life because I found out who I really was.
The bike's yours.
I restored it for you myself.
But that's not a real gift.
This is.
You have a couple of months between high school and college, and I thought...
We both want for you to take some time to yourself, think about your future.
I will worry...
Every second that you're gone, but...
Make the trip.
- And we'll be here for you when you get back.
- Yeah.
I want another chance, Ty.
Tyler is too important.
With our plans accelerated, we need him here now.
We must make sure he's ready.
Can we stop him?
He appears to be giving his parents' gift serious consideration.
But he has yet to see my gift.
I've only got a minute.
Kendrick has me working security for Anna's gala, celebrate her latest "gift."
What if I told you that we can ensure that Anna never gave another "gift" to Earth?
- I went to see Eli Cohn.
- Without telling us.
Yeah, last time I checked, we're all Fifth Column.
Let's hear him out.
Eli wants our help...
To assassinate Anna.
- How?
- A bomb.
He wouldn't tell me more until he knows that we're in.
We're not.
He's insane!
The collateral damage alone...
Which is exactly why he needs us.
With you handling security, we can minimize the collateral...
Minimize?
Ryan, we're talking about three hundred innocent people.
No, no, Eli's right.
Now's the time to strike.
We know exactly where Anna's gonna be, and you're handling security.
We may never get another opportunity like this again.
Erica...
Lisa would be queen.
I'd get my daughter back, and Tyler...
Tyler would be safe.
Eli's giving us a chance, and I'm taking it...
- With or without you.
- Then you mean without me, too.
I'm with the lizard.
As much as I would love to take Anna out,
I can't agree to this.
Erica, we can end this war in one swift blow.
This is our shot.
Yeah, and how many innocents go with her?
Don't do this, Ryan.
Don't put me in a position tonight where I have to make a choice.
Because if I have to...
I will take you down.
What just happened in there?
We can't fall apart, not now.
I am not the one who changed the game plan.
Every day, Anna's grip on Tyler grows stronger and stronger.
You said it yourself, Jack...
No innocent lives.
Look, I know it wasn't easy.
We made the right choice.
Erica, I...
Joe.
Yeah.
Where are you?
I'll be right there.
- What's going on?
- Tyler got a call from Anna.
Said she had a birthday gift for him.
Erica, what a surprise.
I thought you would be busy with preparations for tonight.
I am.
Uh, Joe called.
He said Tyler was so excited.
I wanted us to all come up here, see this gift as a family.
I'm Joe Evans.
I'm Tyler's father.
Erica tells me that you've taken quite an interest in our son.
Tyler's special...
Which is why I wanted to present this very important birthday gift to him.
I'd like you to meet Thomas, my chief engineer.
Pleasure to meet you, Tyler.
Mr. and Mrs. Evans.
Wait.
So you, like, uh, designed the ship?
I did.
Anna tells me that you are the perfect candidate to become part of Concordia.
How would you like to be the first human to pilot one of our shuttles?
Happy Birthday, Tyler.
Thank...
Thank you.
Mother, how generous of you.
You will live here, and I will personally oversee your training.
- For how long?
- He's got school.
We'll work around his school schedule.
Soon enough, you'll be at the controls of your own shuttle.
Thank you so much.
- Would you like a tour of the cockpit?
- Yeah.
Well...
Thank you, Anna, uh, for giving our son this incredible opportunity.
Thank you for allowing me to play a role in his life.
Now if you'll excuse me, I must prepare for tonight.
I don't know what it means, but my mother said with Concordia starting, whatever she needs Tyler for, she needs him now.
Every plan she has pulls him farther and farther away from us.
How are we gonna protect him now?
Come on, Kerry.
You've gotta admit that Concordia, with cutting-edge technology, dynamic learning opportunities, and real jobs in a harsh economy is a home run for the Visitors.
When newcomers arrive on your shores,
- you have to be careful...
- Beware of Greeks bearing gifts?
Exactly.
The Trojan horse filled with soldiers, smallpox-infected blankets for the Native Americans...
These "gifts" didn't work out too well for the recipients, did they?
But Anna has demonstrated the utility of her gifts.
We have clean air and revitalized deserts to prove it.
And I'm sure the Native Americans were warm in their blankets before they started dying in them.
Cut.
That was great.
The public deserves to hear both sides.
It's good TV.
Kerry, job's yours if you want it.
Hey.
You've been gone a long time.
- Everything okay with Ty?
- Yeah.
He hasn't seen his dad for a while.
I wanted to be there for him, but I am up to speed.
- Let's get the briefing started.
- Great.
Nice to see you again, Marcus.
All right, people.
With the recent increase in Fifth Column attacks, protocol tonight will be security level one.
If I may, Assistant Director Kendrick...
Before we begin, Anna would like to say a few words.
I'd like to thank the entire FBI and most especially the Fifth Column task force for agreeing to provide security at this very important event.
We're happy to assist any way we can.
Thank you, Agent Evans.
I know pulling together security on such short notice is no easy task.
Don't worry, Anna.
Everyone in this room has only one goal:
Your safety.
You changed your mind about the assassination.
Why?
Anna's plans for Tyler have accelerated, and like Hobbes said, we have an opportunity we may not get again.
I'm glad to see you're coming around to my way of thinking.
But we do it our way.
Without risking any innocent lives...
No bombs.
We use a sharpshooter.
Hobbes can make the shot.
Our team has to be perfectly coordinated, because all eyes will be on us.
And media from all around the world.
We will have metal detectors at the security checkpoints and an ion scanner that will detect microscopic residue of explosives from clothing.
And we'll have a hard-line perimeter
- that no one will get through.
- The event was organized last-minute, creating vulnerabilities we can exploit if we work together.
I'm only gonna have one shot to take Anna down.
Tell me where to place it.
To the right of her sternum.
Opposite side of the human heart.
The perimeter...
It's too far out.
Shot's gonna have to come from inside.
- Okay, so how does he get in?
- Hobbes?
Well, Father, if you bring a noisy rabble to the west of... here, since you've joined me on the FBI bad boy list,
Erica's gonna have to send agents to deal with you.
They'll pull them from the security line, leaving a hole for Hobbes to get inside.
Once there, I'll give him access into the building.
I know that speaking out against the Visitors will directly contradict your orders from the Vatican.
We're all putting everything on the line to stop Anna.
I'm just...
You can count on me.
Shot's too important.
You're gonna need a spotter... me.
And my men are gonna be among your rabble, making sure that the cops have a nice, long time away from their posts.
Good.
Our team's working as one... for tonight.
Marcus, your security officers informed me that Anna's personal safety will be handled by Visitor guards.
That is correct.
Anna will never be left unprotected.
- Anna's guards will know me by sight.
- Which is why you're not gonna be there.
Anyone spots you, we're toast.
Okay, what about Chad?
He'll be covering the event.
Should we...
Should we tell him?
The fewer people who know about this, the less chance we have of getting caught.
Disposable, untraceable.
All information flows through me.
We toss them when we're done.
You ready for this?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a nice plan.
May just work.
Good.
Any questions?
No, you and your team have been very thorough.
Knowing you're in charge, Agent Evans,
I'm sure Anna will feel much safer.
Marcus tells me everything is ready for tonight's announcement.
And Concordia's structures will be completed by the time the effects of red sky have readied the humans for breeding.
Your design is commendable.
They'll never know its true purpose until it's too late.
The landing function is interwoven into the building's infrastructure.
Once the cloaked ships set down, the next phase of the invasion may begin.
Then our soldiers can collect their women and prepare them for what's to come.
The humans think they're building their future, when in fact, they're digging their own graves.
Do you remember the day that we brought him home from the...
Wow.
- You never dressed like that for work before.
- Thanks for noticing.
Heard anything from Ty?
Um...
He called.
He's staying overnight with Lisa.
At least I know she won't let anything happen to him.
Look...
Just, um...
Be careful.
Okay?
I will.
Listen, you have a long drive back.
Did, uh...
Do you wanna crash on the couch?
You sure?
Yeah.
Your daughter likes to be held.
- Look how happy she is.
- I got word you wanted to see me.
What is it, Ryan?
Torn by your decision?
Don't be.
Choosing your daughter over the humans was the right thing to do.
But you have to keep up your end of the bargain.
What else do you want?
You have infiltrated the Fifth Column.
I wanna know if there are any threats against us for tonight.
I purposely announced the gala last minute so there wouldn't be time to coordinate any violence.
There's nothing that I'm aware of.
I'm not deep enough to be privileged with that information.
Get in deeper.
Her disease is getting worse.
Poor thing.
Only my bliss and my bliss alone can alleviate her pain.
Then do it.
Don't let her suffer.
There, there.
All better...
For now.
I bet the President couldn't set up such a big party so fast.
Welcome to Anna's world.
Whatever she wants to happen...
Happens.
What are you doing here?
Talked Neil to getting me on the list.
Thought if I'm going to be covering Anna, I shouldn't miss it.
Think you can get me an introduction?
It's an honor to meet you, Anna.
Would you mind if I asked you one question off the record?
Kerry.
Ask anything you wish.
You gave us the healing centers and then red rain, and you cleaned our oceans and you brought life back to our deserts, but what's the real purpose behind all this generosity?
I don't understand your question.
Well, sometimes when people are given things they didn't ask for, there's a larger motive behind it.
In human culture, perhaps, but we've never given anything that wasn't needed.
Ask Chad.
We are of peace...
Always.
Thank you, Anna.
Great party.
The presentation will begin soon.
I hope you enjoy it.
All right, it's a go.
Keep it peaceful!
But keep it strong, okay?
- Come on!
- V's, go home!
V's, go home!
Father Landry's organizing some protesters at the east gate.
Requesting backup.
- I just got a...
- I know.
It's a protest.
- South quadrant.
The good Father Landry.
- Peel off a couple of our guys, shut it down
- before it gets out of control.
- I'm on my way.
Let's go.
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
V's, go home!
What do you got?
We've got a situation.
We're gonna need everybody down here.
It's a celebration unlike any other tonight, as Visitor High Commander Anna prepares to present her latest gift to humanity...
Concordia.
Anna is making her way to the podium now.
Only my bliss can alleviate her pain.
Ladies and gentlemen, here to launch the Concordia Project, please welcome to the podium
High Commander Anna.
Ryan Nichols just reported in.
The Fifth Column is positioned to assassinate you.
We must proceed.
No.
I will take your place.
You are the target, not me.
What's happening?
I don't like this.
Marcus said something to Anna.
I think someone tipped them off.
Anna wishes to thank you all for coming.
However, she elected not to speak tonight and asked that I take her place.
We need to abort.
Negative.
We have a shot at Marcus.
That is not the plan.
Tell her Erica if we can't cut the head off the beast, we can at least rob it of its right hand.
We're never gonna have this opportunity again.
We've gotta take the shot.
To exemplify Concordia's spirit of cooperation between Visitors and humans,
I would like to introduce to you an extraordinary young man...
It's war, Erica.
No retreat.
Think of what they have planned for your son...
For humanity.
Fine.
Do it.
Now.
The first human to ever pilot a V shuttle...
Tyler Evans.
Abort, abort!
Hobbes can make the shot.
No, not if it means risking my son's life.
Your son's life is at risk if we don't take the shot.
We're taking it.
Tell her that I've got this.
Let me get him out of there.
When you have a clear shot, take it.
A clear shot.
Confirm.
Clear shot.
Confirmed.
Tyler!
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Tyler's mother, Special Agent Erica Evans.
This is a special moment...
Tyler, the first human shuttle pilot and Erica, head of the Fifth Column task force, a key figure in protecting our presence on this lovely planet.
Needless to say, the Evans family is a model of what Concordia stands for.
We've gotta get out of here now!
Joshua said that Marcus is alive, but his condition is critical.
His injuries were deep and intricate and despite our healing technologies, he may not survive.
Concordia must move forward despite this setback.
I need someone I can trust at my side to take Marcus' place.
Thank you, Thomas.
Tyler has informed us that he will not be joining our program as we had hoped.
I know that he was vital to your plan.
Tyler's important to us.
He's the one Lisa has chosen.
But he's not our only option.
There are others.
I'm so glad you decided not to do the shuttle program, Ty.
We got a lot of catching up to do.
You know...
When I saw the blood hit Mom, all I could think was...
I don't wanna lose you guys.
Okay.
Prepare to be amazed.
Look.
Thanks, Mom.
Happy Birthday, Tyler.
Make a wish.
You're lucky you even have a job right now.
You know that?
You and Evans both.
What the hell happened tonight?
I don't know.
But I can think of a few colorful things to call it.
I have a theory.
Let's hear it.
I gave Erica a lot of rope today, and she took it.
Yeah, I've seen it.
Yeah, but you haven't seen this one.
It was taken this morning when she was supposed to be with her kid.
Surveillance unit had it for me when I got back here tonight.
What's your point?
This wasn't Lee Harvey Oswald in the school book depository.
It was a highly coordinated plan, multiple parties acting together.
Father's Landry protest was no coincidence.
It was a planned distraction.
Now I let him go because I wanna catch a bigger fish.
What are you saying, Chris?
It's a request to the Justice Department for a formal investigation into Special Agent Erica Evans.
I don't like it either, Paul.
But we can't ignore this any longer.
I heard all about what you did tonight, Jack.
You know what the consequences are for something like this.
The Vatican was clear.
I only did and said what I believe in.
I don't understand.
You'll be laicized.
You'll never wear the collar again.
They can take my collar.
But they can't take my faith.
You lied to me.
You knew about the assassination attempt before I left.
It may cost Marcus' life.
I'm sorry, Anna.
You were right.
I don't have anyone.
Okay?
That's why I warned you.
That's why I saved your life.
Now please.
Bliss my daughter.
I'll give you whatever you want, whoever you want.
Yes.
You will.
Thank you...
My Queen.
Marcus' condition remains unknown at this time following the attempt on his life earlier tonight.
Stay tuned to WNT for continuing live coverage of all of the events surrounding tonight's gala.
Who the hell tipped Anna off?
There were only two people who had the information and the means to alert Anna.
Oh, correction.
One person...
And one reptile.
And I damn well know it wasn't Erica.
Ryan.
Fifth Column has claimed responsibility for the Peace Ambassador murders.
Cohn's out of control.
Could've been Tyler.
Get close to Eli Cohn.
You will help me destroy them.
- We're on the same side.
- We don't kill innocent people.
Church officials have issued a statement condemning all anti-V rhetoric from clergy worldwide.
I'm not gonna stop.
It's priests like him that are inciting the Fifth Column.
This is a house of God!
That's Tyler's phone.
I'm losing him.
I need help.
I did what I had to do to protect our species.
Welcome to the future, Chad.
Our future.
Man and Visitor.
This is Concordia.
Concordia.
Interesting name.
From your Roman mythology, meaning a peaceful and harmonious coexistence.
Man and Visitor working side by side to build thousands of these centers creating jobs and supporting prosperity across the world.
Concordia will employ massive numbers of men and women.
Humans will be constructing the buildings staffing the centers of learning and technology.
We've made agreements with nations around the world to build Concordia on land that is abandoned or in disrepair.
So Concordia's like a worldwide urban-renewal project?
Exactly.
I'll be hosting a gala tonight in New York to formally announce Concordia.
And tomorrow, a renaissance begins across the entire planet.
We will celebrate our future, shared by mankind and Visitors together.
This is a house of God!
This is Joe.
Leave a message.
Joe, it's me.
I need to see you.
It's about our son.
Hey, you.
- Happy birthday.
- Heh.
- Thanks, Mom.
Heh.
- Okay.
Well, it always tastes better than it looks.
Breakfast birthday cake.
Evans family tradition.
Yeah, well, when we were a family.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mom.
I just...
I don't know, I thought Dad would call by now.
Hey, it's okay.
He will.
It's early, right?
Have a piece of cake.
Actually, I have to meet Lisa at the Peace Ambassador Center.
Tyler, they're killing Peace Ambassadors.
Kids your age.
Mom, I'm not a kid anymore.
You're right.
You're a man now.
I need you to remember that there are consequences for the choices we make.
You may be 18, but I am still your mother.
I will always be here for you.
Thanks, Mom.
Thomas, as my chief engineer, I'm relying on you to make sure Concordia stays on schedule.
It is, my queen.
Landing sites have been selected for every ship...
- ...in preparation for our invasion.
- Perfect.
With the release of Red Rain the human women are almost ready for breeding.
As soon as Joshua is able to eradicate the human soul, we can proceed.
Tonight's gala is a tempting target for the Fifth Column.
A disturbance could hinder public acceptance of Concordia and delay our plans.
The Fifth Column and Eli Cohn will not be a problem.
Ryan Nichols will make sure of that.
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.
Thanks for coming.
I don't understand.
I thought you were with Agent Evans.
I am.
But she doesn't know I'm here.
I want this to be kept private, Eli.
Just between us.
So, what do you want from me?
I have a daughter.
Anna's holding her hostage on that ship.
Now, the only way I can get her back is to take Anna down.
Our group is too small to do it alone.
You have a bigger network.
We need to work together so we can strike hard.
Erica made it very clear that her cooperation last time was a one-shot deal.
That our ideological viewpoints of this fight are diametrically opposed.
Use me.
I can bridge both sides.
She trusts you?
Absolutely.
Good.
As the head of the FBI Fifth Column Task Force, she could be quite helpful.
You call her.
Get your team together.
Tonight we're taking Anna down for good.
We get the wiretap on Father Landry yet?
Not yet.
Judge has the paper.
Evans, Bolling, clear your schedules.
You're running security for Anna's big shindig tonight.
Guest list.
Paul, it's gonna take weeks to run this many names.
Hey, isn't that your ex?
Yeah.
Problem with Tyler.
Had to bring in the heavy artillery.
Heard about you two.
Sorry it didn't work out.
Federal officer married to a civilian, that's always tough.
Runs a little deeper than that.
I'll only be a minute.
- Hi.
- Hey.
What's going on with Tyler?
It will be easier to explain after I show you this.
They've been here for decades, Joe.
Anna's waging a war against mankind and for some reason, she's targeting our son.
- I know it's a lot to grasp.
- Yeah.
Yeah, it's a hell of a lot.
This missing ladder in Ty's DNA, why would they do that?
We think they wanna put something else in there.
Something not from you or me.
This is crazy.
The high levels of phosphorous in my blood, the preeclampsia the Visitors did that.
They have been messing with Tyler since before he was born.
What does Tyler know about all this?
Nothing.
And we can't tell him.
If Anna ever thought that he knew, his life would be in danger.
And yet you let him date one of them?
We can trust Lisa.
Who else knows about the Visitors, what they are?
There's a small group of us.
We have to be careful who we tell.
I need your help.
What do you think I can do?
Why do you think I can help?
The one thing that Tyler wants more than anything else is his family back together.
And that is the one thing that Anna can't give him.
I need you with me, Joe.
Lisa, what are you doing?
It's for Tyler.
Today is his 18th birthday.
It would raise suspicion if his girlfriend didn't give him a present.
Now that Tyler is 18 he will no longer be bound to do as his parents command.
He'll be able to make his own choices.
And we must make sure he chooses us.
How can we be sure he'll do that?
Because I can give him something humanity cannot.
A future.
Interesting piece this morning, Chad.
You think this Concordia project is all world peace jobs for everyone, chicken in every pot?
Anna hasn't promised anything she didn't deliver.
All the same, a lot of people are asking questions about her.
But not you.
And I'm not sure you're the guy to do it.
What's that supposed to mean, Neil?
A few months ago, everybody and their mother was drinking the V Kool-Aid.
Now people aren't so sure.
Ratings are slipping.
I wanna change the format of Prime Focus.
Add a critical voice to face off against you.
- A kind of point-counterpoint?
- Exactly.
We're bringing in talent from Boston, Philly and D.C. This afternoon.
Screen-test if somebody looks promising.
Whatever you need.
I'm surprised you're good with this.
Didn't figure you'd be so willing to share the spotlight.
Bring them on.
Going one-on-one with the other side is only gonna make me look better.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Happy birthday.
- Oh.
Thanks.
I wanted to get you something that will always remind you of us.
I love it.
And you.
Tyler.
Um...
- Yesterday at the church...
- Tyler?
Hey.
Lisa, you remember Tyler's dad?
Hey, kiddo.
Happy birthday.
Look, I know things didn't go too well last time.
And I've been talking to your mom and thinking about it since I saw you last.
You might not believe it, but when I turned 18 I was so much like you.
My old man he wasn't there for me either.
Sound familiar?
- Go ahead.
Just open it up.
- Open it.
After graduation, I set out on that route on that '82 Harley Shovelhead.
Couple months on the road by myself.
And it was the best time of my life.
Because I found out who I really was.
The bike's yours.
I restored it for you myself.
- But that's not our real gift.
- This is.
You have a couple of months between high school and college and I thought...
We both want for you to take some time to yourself, think about your future.
I will worry every second that you're gone but make the trip.
And we'll be here when you get back.
Yeah.
I want another chance, Ty.
Tyler is too important.
With our plans accelerated, we need him here now.
We must make sure he's ready.
Can we stop him?
He appears to be giving his parents' gift serious consideration.
But he has yet to see my gift.
I've only got a minute.
Kendrick has me working security for Anna's gala, celebrate her latest gift.
What if I told you we can ensure that Anna never gave another gift to Earth?
- I went to see Cohn.
- Without telling us.
- Last I checked, we're all Fifth Column.
- Let's hear him out.
Eli wants our help.
To assassinate Anna.
- How?
- A bomb.
- He wouldn't tell me more until we're in.
- We're not.
He's insane.
- The collateral damage alone...
- Which is exactly why he needs us.
With you handling security, we minimize collateral.
Minimize?
Ryan, we're talking about 300 innocent people.
No, no.
Eli's right.
Now's the time to strike.
We know exactly where Anna's gonna be.
And you're handling security.
We may never get an opportunity like this again.
Erica, Lisa would be queen.
I'd get my daughter back.
And Tyler...
Tyler would be safe.
Eli's giving us a chance and I'm taking it.
With or without you.
Then you mean without me too.
I'm with the lizard.
As much as I would love to take Anna out I can't agree to this.
Erica, we can end this war with one swift blow.
- This is our shot.
- And how many innocents go with her?
Don't do this, Ryan.
Don't put me in a position tonight where I have to make a choice.
Because if I have to I will take you down.
What just happened?
We can't fall apart, not now.
I am not the one who changed the plan.
Every day, Anna's grip on Tyler grows stronger and stronger.
You said it yourself, Jack.
No innocent lives.
Look, I know it wasn't easy.
- You made the right choice.
- Erica, I...
Joe.
Yeah.
Where are you?
I'll be right there.
- What's going on?
- Tyler got a call from Anna.
Said she had a birthday gift for him.
Erica, what a surprise.
I thought you would be busy with preparations.
I am.
Joe called.
He said Tyler was so excited.
I wanted us to all come up here, see this gift as a family.
I'm Joe Evans.
I'm Tyler's father.
Erica tells me you've taken quite an interest in our son.
Tyler is special.
Which is why I wanted to present this very important birthday gift to him.
I'd like you to meet Thomas, my chief engineer.
Pleasure to meet you, Tyler.
Mr. And Mrs. Evans.
Wait, so you, like, designed this ship?
- I did.
- Heh.
Anna tells me that you're the perfect candidate to become part of Concordia.
How would you like to be the first human to pilot one of our shuttles?
Happy birthday, Tyler.
Thank you...
Thank you.
Mother, how generous of you.
You will live here, and I will personally oversee your training.
- For how long?
- He's got school.
We'll work around his school schedule.
Soon enough you'll be at the controls of your own shuttle.
Thank you so much.
Would you like a tour of the cockpit?
- Yeah.
- Come.
Thank you, Anna, for giving our son this incredible opportunity.
Thank you for allowing me to play a role in his life.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I must prepare for tonight.
I don't know what it means, but my mother said, with Concordia starting whatever she needs Tyler for, she needs him now.
Every plan she has pulls him farther and farther away from us.
How are we gonna protect him now?
Come on, Kerry, you've gotta admit that Concordia with cutting-edge technology dynamic learning opportunities, real jobs in a harsh economy is a home run for the Visitors.
When newcomers arrive, you have to be careful...
- Beware of Greeks bearing gifts?
- Exactly.
The Trojan horse filled with soldiers.
Smallpox-infected blankets for Native Americans.
These gifts didn't work out too well for the recipients.
But Anna has demonstrated the utility of her gifts.
We have clean air and revitalized deserts to prove it.
I'm sure Native Americans were warm in their blankets before they started dying.
- Cut.
- We're clear.
That was great.
The public deserves to hear both sides.
It's good TV.
Kerry, the job's yours if you want it.
Hey.
You've been gone a long time.
Everything okay with Ty?
He hasn't seen his dad for a while.
I wanted to be there.
I'm up to speed.
Let's get the briefing started.
Great.
Nice to see you again, Marcus.
All right, people.
With the recent increase in Fifth Column attacks protocol will be Security Level One.
If I may, Assistant Director Kendrick.
Before we begin, Anna would like to say a few words.
I'd like to thank the entire FBI most especially the Fifth Column Task Force for providing security at this very important event.
We're happy to assist any way we can.
Thank you, Agent Evans.
I know pulling together security on such short notice is no easy task.
Don't worry, Anna.
Everyone in this room Your safety.
You changed your mind about the assassination.
Why?
Anna's plans for Tyler have accelerated.
And like Hobbes said, we have an opportunity we may not get again.
Glad to see you're coming around.
But we do it our way.
Without risking any innocent lives.
- No bombs.
- We use a sharpshooter.
Hobbes can make the shot.
Our team has to be perfectly coordinated.
Because all eyes will be on us.
And media from all around the world.
We'll have metal detectors at checkpoints and an ion scanner that will detect microscopic residue of explosives.
And we'll have a hard-line perimeter that no one will get through.
The event was organized last-minute, creating vulnerabilities we can exploit.
I'm only gonna have one shot to take Anna down.
Tell me where to place it.
To the right of her sternum.
Opposite side of the human heart.
The perimeter, it's too far out.
- Shot's gonna have to come from inside.
- Okay, so how does he get in?
Hobbes?
Well, Father, if you bring a noisy rabble to the west of here since you've joined me on the FBI bad-boy list Erica will send agents to deal with you.
They'll pull them from security, leaving a hole for Hobbes to get inside.
Once there, I'll give him access into the building.
I know speaking out against the Visitors will directly contradict your orders from the Vatican.
We're all putting everything on the line to stop Anna.
I'm just...
You can count on me.
The shot's too important.
You're gonna need a spotter.
Me.
My men will be among your rabble making sure the cops have a nice long time away.
Good.
Our teams working as one.
For tonight.
Marcus, your security officers informed me that Anna's personal safety will be handled by Visitor guards.
- Correct.
Anna will never be left unprotected.
- Anna's guards will know me by sight.
- You're not gonna be there.
- Anyone spots you, we're toast.
- What about Chad?
He'll be covering the event.
Should we tell him?
The fewer people who know about this, the less chance we have of getting caught.
Disposable.
Untraceable.
All information flows through me.
We toss them when we're done.
- You ready for this?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- It's a nice plan.
May just work.
Good.
Any questions?
No, you and your team have been very thorough.
Knowing you're in charge, Agent Evans, I am sure Anna will feel much safer.
Marcus tells me everything is ready for tonight's announcement.
Concordia's structures will be completed by the time the effects of Red Sky have readied the humans for breeding.
Your design is commendable.
They'll never know its true purpose until it's too late.
The landing function is interwoven into the building's infrastructure.
Once the cloaked ships set down the next phase of the invasion may begin.
Then our soldiers can collect their women and prepare them for what's to come.
The humans think they're building their future when in fact they're digging their own graves.
Oh, God.
Do you remember the day that we brought him home from the...?
Wow.
You've never dressed like that for work before.
Thanks for noticing.
Have you heard anything from Ty?
Um...
He called.
He's staying overnight with Lisa.
At least I know she won't let anything happen to him.
Listen, um you be careful, okay?
I will.
Listen, you have a long drive back.
Do you wanna crash on the couch?
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Your daughter likes to be held.
- Look how happy she is.
- I got word you wanted to see me.
What is it, Ryan?
Torn by your decision?
Don't be.
Choosing your daughter over the humans was the right thing to do.
But you have to keep up your end of the bargain.
What else do you want?
You've infiltrated the Fifth Column.
I wanna know if there are any threats against us for tonight.
I announced the gala last-minute so there wouldn't be time to coordinate any violence.
There's nothing that I'm aware of.
I'm not deep enough to be privileged with that information.
Get in deeper.
Her disease is getting worse, poor thing.
Only my Bliss, and my Bliss alone, can alleviate the pain.
Then do it.
Don't let her suffer.
There, there.
All better for now.
I bet the president couldn't set up such a big party so fast.
Welcome to Anna's world.
Whatever she wants to happen happens.
- What are you doing here?
- Talked Neil into getting me on the list.
Thought, if I'm gonna be covering Anna, I shouldn't miss it.
Think you can get me an introduction?
It's an honor to meet you, Anna.
Would you mind if I asked you one question off the record?
Kerry.
Ask anything you wish.
You gave us the Healing Centers and then Red Rain.
You cleaned our oceans and brought life to our deserts.
But what's the real purpose behind all this generosity?
I don't understand your question.
When people are given things they didn't ask for there's a larger motive behind it.
In human culture, perhaps.
But we've never given anything that wasn't needed.
Ask Chad.
We are of peace.
Always.
Thank you, Anna.
Great party.
The presentation will begin soon.
I hope you enjoy it.
All right, let's go.
Keep it peaceful, but keep it strong, okay?
Come on.
Father Landry's organizing protestors at the east gate.
Requesting backup.
- I just got a...
- I know.
Protest, south quadrant.
Good Father Landry.
Peel off a couple of our guys, shut it down.
- I'm on my way.
- Okay.
Let's go.
V's go home.
V's go home.
Whoa, back it up, please.
V's go home.
V's go home.
V's go home.
Moving in.
V's go home.
- What do you got?
- Got a situation.
We're gonna need everybody you got down here.
It's a celebration unlike any other tonight as Visitor High Commander Anna prepares to present her latest gift Concordia.
Anna is making her way to the podium now.
Only my Bliss can alleviate her pain.
Ladies and gentlemen, here to launch the Concordia project please welcome to the podium High Commander Anna.
Ryan just reported in.
The Fifth Column is positioned to assassinate you.
- We must proceed.
- No.
I will take your place.
You are the target, not me.
- What's happening?
I don't like this.
- Marcus said something to Anna.
I think someone tipped them off.
Anna wishes to thank you all for coming however she elected not to speak tonight and asked that I take her place.
- We need to abort.
- Negative.
- We have a shot at Marcus.
- That is not the plan.
If we can't cut the head off the beast we can at least rob it of its right hand.
We'll never have this opportunity again.
We gotta take the shot.
To exemplify Concordia's spirit of cooperation between Visitors and humans I'd like to introduce to you an extraordinary young man.
It's war, Erica.
No retreat.
Think of what they have planned for your son.
For humanity.
Fine.
Do it.
Now.
The first human to ever pilot a V shuttle:
Tyler Evans.
Abort.
Abort.
Hobbes can make the shot.
Not if it means risking my son's life.
Your son's life is at risk if we don't take the shot.
- We're taking it.
- Tell Erica I've got this.
Let me get him out of there.
When you have a clear shot, take it.
A clear shot.
Confirm.
Clear shot.
Confirmed.
Thank you.
Tyler!
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Tyler's mother, Special Agent Erica Evans.
This is a special moment.
Tyler, the first human shuttle pilot and Erica, head of the Fifth Column Task Force a key figure in protecting our presence on this lovely planet.
Needless to say, the Evans family is a model of what Concordia stands for.
Move!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Secure the area!
We're good.
We've gotta get out of here now.
Joshua said that Marcus is alive but his condition is critical.
His injuries were deep and intricate and despite our healing technologies, he may not survive.
Concordia must move forward despite this setback.
I need someone I can trust at my side, to take Marcus' place.
Thank you, Thomas.
Tyler has informed us that he will not be joining our program as we had hoped.
I know that he was vital to your plan.
Tyler is important to us.
He's the one Lisa has chosen.
But he's not our only option.
There are others.
I'm so glad you decided not to do the shuttle program, Ty.
We got a lot of catching up to do.
You know, when I saw the blood hit Mom all I could think was I don't wanna lose you guys.
Okay.
Prepare to be amazed.
- Look at that.
- Thanks, Mom.
Happy birthday, Tyler.
Make a wish.
You're lucky you have a job right now, you know that?
You and Evans both.
- What the hell happened tonight?
- I don't know.
But I can think of a few colorful things to call it.
I have a theory.
Let's hear it.
I gave Erica a lot of rope today, and she took it.
- Yeah, I've seen it.
- Yeah, but you haven't seen this one.
It was taken this morning when she was supposed to be with her kid.
Surveillance unit had it for me when I got back here tonight.
What's your point?
This wasn't Lee Harvey Oswald and the school book depository.
It was a highly coordinated plan, multiple parties acting together.
Father Landry's protest was no coincidence.
It was a planned distraction.
Now, I let him go because I wanna catch a bigger fish.
What are you saying, Chris?
Request to the Justice Department for a formal investigation into Special Agent Erica Evans.
I don't like it either, Paul.
But we can't ignore this any longer.
I heard all about what you did tonight, Jack.
You know what the consequences are for something like this.
The Vatican was clear.
I only did and said what I believe in.
I don't understand.
You'll be laicized.
You'll never wear the collar again.
They can take my collar but they can't take my faith.
You lied to me.
You knew about the assassination attempt before I left.
It may cost Marcus his life.
I'm sorry, Anna.
You were right.
I don't have anyone.
Okay?
That's why I warned you.
That's why I saved your life.
Now, please, Bliss my daughter.
I'll give you whatever you want.
Whoever you want.
Yes you will.
Thank you my queen.
Marcus' condition remains unknown at this time following the attempt on his life earlier tonight.
Stay tuned to WNT for continuing live coverage of all of the events surrounding tonight's gala.
Who the hell tipped Anna off?
There were only two people who had the information and the means to alert her.
One person and one reptile.
I know damn well it wasn't Erica.
Ryan.

That's Mark's father.
Where?
All the bodyguards?
Uh-huh?
He's royalty.
He's royal?
How royal?
Like, King of Ukata royal.
Huh.
West Africa.
Atlantic coast.
Interesting.
Wow.
Ms. Google Maps herself.
My father had a weakness for expensive, exotic locations.
We safaried.
Um, Kate, your ex is here, and he's spotted us.
Have you talked to him since you gave him the ring back?
Well, he's e-mailed me randomly, asking me to play on his pickup team again.
Said they didn't have enough good point guards.
Mm. 'Cause he's still watching us.
He looks good.
All right, guys?
Love y'all, but stop.
My relationship with Ray...
Is...
Finished.
Bosley!
Come on!

Hey!
Hey, Mark!

Miami Beach P.D. Stand down.

Charlies Angels 2011 Season 01, Episode 07 Royal Angels November 10, 2011
Thank you.
I'm taking this case.
I was here when it happened.
The perimeter's secure, and I got four pretty reliable witnesses right in front of me.
Where did the shots come from?
It must have been very high up, good vantage point.
Maybe somewhere in those upper stands.
Shooter probably walked right out looking like a worried fan.
The King was taken down by two bullets, center mass.
Clearly a professional.
I heard four shots.
Then where are the other two bullets?
Bos, where were you and Mark playing?
John, that's a crime scene.
You...
Kate...
We were shooting around right over here.
Shots rang out.
I took him down about here.
Which means...
The assassin was targeting Mark, too.
Where did security take him?
Hey, Ray.
Hi, I'm Detective Millard.
And who are you?
Kate Prince.
Yes, that Kate Prince.
They're witnesses in connection with the case.
Ah.
Thank you.
Mark's too rattled to talk.
Plus, we've got uninvited company.
Carter.
Always nice to see the FBI taking an interest in a case that might generate headlines.
Ray, it's always nice to see Miami Beach P.D.
trying to work cases they don't have the resources to handle.
I've got the resources.
Ah.
Murder of a foreign national's big stuff.
You think you're gonna find the answers before I do?
Guarantee it.
Care to put some money on that?
Who's the guy in the fancy suit?
That's Richard Mbakwe, the King's Chief of Staff and Mark's godfather.
He'll be in charge here.
Mr. Mbakwe,
I'm sorry for your loss.
Ah, Coach Bosley.
Mark's favorite days at practice are when you're working with the team.
These are my colleagues...
Abby Sampson, Eve French, and Kate Prince.
Is Mark around?
We think he might be in danger.
We really need to talk to him.
No one's talking to my witness without my permission.
Too bad he's not your witness.
Mr. Mbakwe, we're private detectives.
We're just here to offer you our services.
I would be most grateful.
Mark's in the back.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Now he's our client.
We'll talk to him whether you like it or not.
Mark?
He's gone.
Think the FBI would be a little better at protection detail.
Our client's disappeared.
With a target on his back he doesn't even know about.
We need to find him before someone else does.
Mark is the sole heir to the throne.
King Abrahim established a tenuous peace between the warring tribes, but their loyalty is tied to his family alone.
So if something happened to Mark, it could trigger a civil war.
News reports are saying that a man was killed during practice.
But the victim's identity hasn't been released.
And it won't be.
I spoke to some of my contacts at the Pentagon.
D.O.J. and Homeland will stay out of this in the short term, and the FBI and police have agreed to a 48-hour news blackout.
Unfortunately, social media hasn't.
We need to move on this quickly.
If word of the assassination gets out...
All hell would break loose in Ukata.
Mark's immediate return to Ukata and acceptance of the throne is the only way to guarantee the country's stability.
We'll do everything we can, sir.
So where do we start?
Bos, you know Mark well.
What was his story?
Well, he's been in the states since he was 9.
Uh, boarding schools followed by M.S.U.
He really tries to keep the whole royalty thing pretty quiet.
Just wants to be one of the guys.
Sounds like any college kid.
Except that he isn't.
Yeah, exactly.
He had the perks of being a prince.
What did you want to be at 20?
- Nascar driver.
- Sharpshooter.
Acknowledged by my father.
Note that none of you said heir to an unstable country.
Aha!
There are no secure passwords.
What are you up to?
Well, Mark didn't talk about himself much, but he's a college kid in 2011.
Anything we need to know about him is in one place.
Who's the hottie?
Dominique Berry.
These photos are in her album.
And posted a week ago.
Look at the album title...
"Best day ever!"
Three exclamation marks.
Looks like she's into him.
Sounds like young love to me.
And according to employment records, she's a South Beach lifeguard.
Tower 76.
There she is.
Yep.
Is it just me, or does Dominique look a little nervous?
She's watching the beach more than she is the ocean.
Dominique Berry?
Yes.
We're looking for Mark Bakale.
Sorry.
Who are you?
I'm his basketball coach.
Have you seen him?
No, I haven't seen him in a while.
Are you sure about that?
It's important.
Yeah, I'm sure.
I haven't seen him.
Sir, you can't go in there.
That's...
Mark.
Coach.
What are you doing here?
I should ask you the same thing.
Look, I was surrounded by my father's men, people I've known since I was a boy.
Suddenly they're looking at me differently.
One called me "Your Highness."
I just had to get out of there.
We have to get you to a safe place.
Wait.
Why?
Because they're after me, too, I'm thinking.
Yeah.
They are.
So who's coming for me?
We don't know that yet.
If you have any ideas of somebody who could be or anyone, you gotta let us know.
My father sent me to the United States as a kid to get away from everything back at home.
I really don't know what he deals with other than what I read about.
If we made the connection between you and Dominique, somebody else could, too.
Then she comes with us.
Of course she does.
Let's go.
The cops didn't find anything in the footage on the third floor deck where you saw the muzzle flash.
I'm sure of what I saw.
I know, Abbs, but what you saw wasn't exactly where you saw it.
Thebanner.
It's reflective.
Yeah, you're right.
And it's at an angle, so...
Our shooter was in a different section.
There's our shooter.
Searching through the surveillance footage.
Hold on.
Our shooter is...
A woman.
Call Bos.
Hello?
Bos, we found our assassin.
Got a picture of him?
I got a picture of her.
Sending it to you now.
Take a look.
We've got Mark and his girlfriend Dominique.
We're coming in.
Bos?
1200... isn't that her right now?
Yeah, that's her.
Get them out of here.
Get down!
Get low!
Get low!
Stay low!
Hey.
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Well, you're an Internet sensation.
"Badass catfight on beach" got 10,000 hits.
Nice.
Did you get an I.D. On our assassin before the cops took her away?
No, she didn't have much on her.
Except for this...
Uh, she tried to throw it in the sand after the fight.
What is it, a locker key?
I don't know.
Maybe mailbox?
No, it's a motorcycle key.
- You sure?
- Oh, yeah.
You know locks, I know bikes.
Well, that makes sense.
She wanted to make a quick getaway after the job.
It's probably within a few blocks.
So she could walk down the beach and look like a tourist.
Now that seems to be her M.O.
Well, let's go find her ride.
Have fun.
Security sweep came back clean.
We can head to the safe house.
Where's Dominique?
Changing.
She's pretty freaked out.
It's okay to be scared.
When I was 7, my mom died.
She was in a car with my Uncle when it was attacked.
In one moment, my father lost his wife and gained a country.
Your uncle was the King?
My father was an architect.
He loved to build things.
He ended up building a stronger country.
But it was never safe.
The day my dad decided to send me to America, he came to my room and he told me he was sending me to a place where dreams come true.
I asked him when could I come back home...
And he said, "whenever you're ready."
That must have been hard.
That whole first year of boarding school,
I called him every night.
Just the sound of my father's voice, it made everything feel like it was okay.
I can relate.
I don't know how to be a king.
You're a natural leader, Mark.
You have all the tools.
You just need to know it.
Every time you step out on that basketball court, you inspire thousands of people.
Look, coach,
I always knew that I was next in line, that I'd eventually take over for my father.
I just never thought it would be this soon.
You know, things don't always play out the way we think they will.
When I was 20,
I had a basketball scholarship to M.I.T.
I was gonna graduate and work for the NSA and change the world.
What happened?
I made some bad choices.
I'm not ready.
We never feel ready.
Sure, there's another version of your life where none of this happens, and you stay here and maybe even become an NBA star.
But sometimes life makes other plans for us.
Sometimes we need to take a step back, think about the bigger picture.
It's gonna be all right.
That's it.
Smooth getaway ride.
There's a lockbox.
Abby, grab your tools.
- Got it.
- Let's do it.
It fits.
Let me try.
Just as I thought.
Hold that.
We win.
People type their passwords more than anything else on the phone.
"O," "G," and "H" have been used way more than any other letter.
And "S" and "T" also.
Ghost.
I'm amazing at scrabble.
Okay.
The phone is registered to Hillary Kimmel.
That's a known alias in the U.S. Army.
She's a sniper.
- In the ghost program.
- Hence the password.
You said that was a known alias.
What's her real name?
Classified.
Who is this girl?
According to this, she's a ghost herself.
She died in Afghanistan five years ago.
What's a dead girl doing in Miami?
I say it's time we pull some strings.
I called an old friend of mine who just happens to be a retired general.
You have useful friends, Charlie.
Your assassin's real name is Tabitha Williams.
Hillary Kimmel was one of her many aliases.
According to army records, Tabitha died in Afghanistan, but her body was never recovered.
She must have faked her own death.
It looks like she became a private contractor using her sniper training.
Be careful, angels.
Whoever hired Tabitha has money and serious connections.
Girl certainly spread her money around.
She's got 15 different accounts linked to her various aliases.
Best way to hide it.
And look at this...
She has a series of outgoing payments all for the same amount.
Yeah, but coming from different accounts.
I thought assassins were usually in the business of incoming payments.
Where's the money going?
Looks like our killer's got a secret.
I think somebody should go and have a chat with our friend the assassin.
And I think that person should be you.
She's being kept at Metro.
No.
I'm kind of persona non grata down there.
It's Ray's case.
I don't think you're persona non grata to Ray.
Besides, the assassin had no I.D.
Chances are Ray still doesn't know who she is yet.
So whatcha got?
I've got nothing.
Her fingerprints were chemically sandpapered.
We just come up with smudges.
The FBI is showing up in a half-hour to take over.
Hmm.
What if I told you your suspect is ex-army operative with sniper training?
That she faked her death five years ago in Kabul?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
How do you get all this?
Come on, Ray.
You investigate your way, I investigate mine.
I have a proposition for you.
You give me five minutes with her alone, no surveillance, in exchange for her name.
Kate, you know I can't do that.
Okay.
Maybe Carter and the FBI will be willing to make a deal.
Carter likes to win.
It's been a while since I've seen a room like this.
You got five minutes.
That's all I need.
Tabitha?
Who are you?
Another cop?
I'm not saying a word until my lawyer gets here.
I'm not a cop.
Then what do you want?
I don't know who that is.
I'll help you.
It's your younger sister Rachel.
You've been paying her college tuition, masking the transfers as scholarships.
But we're better at finding than you are at hiding.
The cops don't have this yet, but I can share it.
You talk to me or they'll haul her in and charge her with accepting the blood money that you received for murdering people.
She doesn't know anything about that.
She doesn't know that you faked your death either, does she?
She will.
I wonder how she'll handle that.
They'll tell her all about your past.
Think about the legal fees she'll have to pay to clear her name.
You help me out, and I'll make sure the cops never find the money trail between you and Rachel.
Who paid you to kill the King and his son Mark?
Look, there's no way you're not going down, but don't take her with you.
Ray?
Wait.
Leave my sister out of this.
The payments for the Ukata job came from a company.
Mason Winkler, LLC.
That's all I know.
Mason Winkler, LLC., is based in the Bahamas.
Has no product, generates no revenue, and filed no taxes.
So it's a shell?
Whose sole purpose is to hide the identity
- of whoever's behind this.
- Does it trace back to anyone?
After doing a lot of looking... yes.
Langley Diamonds.
What's the link between diamonds and a dead monarch?
Good question.
May I have a word with you?
Sure.
I did some digging into Archer Langley.
He runs the company.
Officially, he's squeaky clean.
But unofficially?
The more I dig, the less I like him.
But unfortunately, he's good at covering up his tracks.
What about Mason Winkler, LLC.?
The connection is tenuous at best.
It's buried pretty deep.
There's no way I'm gonna get a judge to sign off on a search warrant.
Are you asking for my help?
Archer Langley is a bad guy.
And...
You need my help?
Um...
Yes.
I need you.
Okay.
We're all at the safe house.
So what do we know about Langley?
Archer inherited the Miami-based family fortune about five years ago.
He started expanding into other areas beyond diamonds, but that's still the company's bread and butter.
Diamonds are Ukata's main export.
Maybe this wasn't a homegrown political coup.
Maybe this is just good old-fashioned corporate greed.
With the King and his sole heir out of the way and a murky line of succession...
Langley could spread enough money around the country, probably get whomever he wanted into power.
Bosley, keep Mark and Dominique safe.
Angels, let's find out what the real connection is between Langley and Ukata.
Will do, Charlie.
I did a rundown of Langley's operations.
Corporate headquarters are in San Francisco, but he has a company server at his home here on Star Island.
We need to get into that house.
If we do, we can get ahold of the corporate records, see if there's anything linking the King and Langley.
There's no way security doesn't cover every inch of the grounds.
I don't know how we'll avoid it.
I say we walk in the front door.
How do we do that?
Let's go talk to the neighbors.
You guys look like you're having fun.
I'm a bit old for a babysitter, but if you guys would like to stay, my parents are out for the afternoon.
What do you say we hit the hot tub?
I don't know.
Eve, what do we say?
I-I think it depends.
Mm-hmm.
How 'bout this...
The first one of you to break a window next door gets 100 bucks.
All right.
Nice job, kid.
All yours.
Wait, um...
Could I get your digits?
Not unless you have a hot single uncle who's straight.
You gotta admire his persistence.
Why do I attract juvenile men of all ages?
Seventh Heaven Glass Repair.
Oh, lucky for you.
We just finished a job up the street.
I'll have our window techs there ASAP.
I'll stand lookout.
Okay, Bos, uh, this isn't exactly a laptop.
All right, you're looking for a U.S.B. port where I can access the computer's secure server.
Wow.
There are about 20.
Any ideas?
Start trying.
Got it.
Okay.
Wait.
Go back one.
16-bit encryption.
It's gonna take a second.
I'm in.
There are a bunch of e-mails and contracts here relating to a mine in Ukata.
This isn't about diamonds.
It's about lithium.
They must have found a vein in one of their mines.
It's the essential component of cell phone batteries.
Bos, didn't Charlie say Langley was expanding his interests?
He started several new ventures six months ago, including Langley Telecom.
Diamonds are a girl's best friend, but there is a lot of money in telecom.
Enough money to kill for.
Time to go.
Now.
Langley just got home.
Abby, disconnect the drive and get out of there.
Will do.
Eve, what are you doing?
We gotta go.
When I said "now," I really meant it.
Abbs, look at this.
Wait, isn't that...
Mark's girlfriend Dominique.
Kate?
Langley knows Dominique.
I'll call Bos.
Langley's coming through the door in five, four, three, two, one.
Working girls just get prettier and prettier.
And the clients get more and more charming.
Bos, get Mark out of there.
Dominique's working for Langley.
That's how the assassin found Mark at the beach.
Dominique tipped them off.
Mark, come on.
We gotta get out of here.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, coach.
What are you doing?
She's the leak, Mark.
She's working with Archer Langley, the man who had your father assassinated.
Why would you do that?
Sorry.
Langley promised me that you wouldn't get hurt.
He said he just wanted you to sign a few things.
And you believed him?
You don't understand.
You grew up with everything.
I'm not the prince of some country, okay?
My parents have nothing.
If it wasn't for Langley's help
I wouldn't be able to go to school.
I didn't have a choice.
Aah!
Ow!
You always have a choice.
Did you tell them my father would be at the game?
You're the reason my father was killed!
It wasn't supposed to be like that.
- I'm sorry.
- Ladies...
Yeah, the Dominique situation's under control.
The alarm was just triggered.
Someone's on the grounds.
Well, it looks like two armed men approaching from the east.
They must be pros.
They just avoided our perimeter security.
Dominique must have known they were coming before she made her move.
Bos, we'll never make it there in time.
Come on.
Move!
Get upstairs to the panic room and seal it like I showed you.
I'm not going anywhere with her.
You have to go and you gotta go now, or else they're gonna kill you both!
You know how to use this?
What are you gonna do?
Buy you as much time as I can.
Go!
Hurry up!
Go!
Don't do it.
Don't.
Why aren't you in the panic room?
Where's Mark?
- Where is he?
- He just took off.
I-I-I think he took your car.
Where's he going?
Thank you for calling OnStar.
How can I help you?
Hi, my name's John Bosley.
My car's been stolen.
Okay, Mr. Bosley.
We'll contact the police.
Thanks, Ray.
Ray talked to OnStar.
Mark's going over the bridge to Star Island.
I'm guessing Mark's going after Langley.
Turning around now.
Get down!
You killed my father.
You ruined my life.
Mark!
Don't do it, Mark.
It's not worth it.
You don't have to do this, okay?
We're here to help you.
Mark.
Mark, put the gun down.
You should listen to him, kid.
Shut up!
Listen to me, Mark.
Think about what you're doing.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
You don't have to do this, Mark.
Killing him won't do anything for you or your father.
He can't get away with murder!
- He won't.
- Of course he will.
Guys like this always get away with it.
Not when they go up against us.
Your father... he didn't go after those people that killed your mother and uncle by himself, right?
He let justice take its course.
Why'd he do that?
Because he said you can't lead with vengeance in your heart.
He was right.
This is one of those moments you need to take a step back, all right?
Look at the big picture.
Nice shot.
Look at you.
I just wanted to stop by and say thank you for everything.
I couldn't have gotten through this without you.
You're stronger than you think.
I'm ready to go home.
Your father would be very proud of you.
I just hope I can be half the king my father was.
Just focus on being the best version of yourself.
All right?
Got you a going-away present.
It's not a jump shot, either.
Something my grandmother gave me when I got my act together and moved here to Miami.
St. Christopher...
Patron Saint of long journeys, especially unexpected ones.
You're ready.
You know,
I could always use a good chief of staff.
I think Richard's got that covered.
But if you're ever in the mood for a crossover, step-back, fadeaway "J" in your face, you could always send over the royal jet.
You know you're too old for that, coach.
Thanks for everything.
You're gonna be great.
I've got Mark's escort car waiting outside.
We're heading out.
Nice work.
Thanks.
So how pissed was Carter that you solved this one before the FBI?
Not a happy camper.
Score.
And before you say it, I already know that I couldn't have done this without your help.
Mm-hmm?
So thank you.
And the invitation to that game still stands.
We play later today.
I'll think about it.
Good.
Good-bye, Ray.
He invited you again, didn't he?
You're going, aren't ya?
Oh!
Nice.
Oh!
Damn you, Goodson.
Anytime you wanna hang up that shiny federal badge and come play for the winners, you let me know.
Now didn't we have some money on that case?
It'll be mine again soon.
Keep dreaming.
Hey, Jimmy, Ty.
Hey.
Hey.
It's nice to know my welcome is still a bit worn out.
I never thought you'd come.
You're a little late to play.
Maybe next time.
So...
I was actually wondering if you wanted to go grab a postgame drink, like old times.
Uh...
I'd love to, uh, but...
I kind of have plans.
Hey, babe.
- Hey.
- Great game.
Hi, Kate.
Hey, Liz.
What are you doing here?
We, uh...
I was just closing up some stuff with the case.
♪ To be free ♪
Oh, you guys need a moment to talk?
Nope.
We're good.
So looks like you guys got plans.
I don't wanna keep you.
Yeah, come on, we'll be late.
Let's go.
Hey, you.
What happened?
Seems like my timing continues to suck.
You guys remember Liz, the detective at the consulate?
Mm-hmm.
Apparently, she and Ray do more than fight crime together.
Well, we bring an alternative to being bummed about your ex...
- Cuban sandwiches.
- Yum.
We'll trade you...
Ball for beer.
What do you say?
Deal.
- Ew.
This stupid ball.
- Come on.
Oh, my heroes.
We love you.
Ray who?
- Rex, there is someone in the house.
- And he's leaving in a body bag.
- Disturbance.
Intruder.
Okay.
I'll go downstairs, I'll take care of it.
- I think I hear an intruder.
- What do we do?
- I don't know.
- It was just a possum.
But if it were an intruder,
I'd have given him a little bit of this.
And a little bit of this.
- You're my missing piece.
- You're my missing piece.
I'm just gonne go take one last look around.
okay.
You just woke up the wrong guy.
- Honey, what's going on?
- Oh, don't be scared.
Don't be scared, honey.
There's a couple of guys out there.
- Mmm.
- I'm just gonne have to--
- Hey, virgins!
Take this party someplace else!
If I find so much as one bottle cap--
One!
It will be your asses!
- Yeah.
I hear him out there.
how are you so calm?
I can't take this anymore.
Stop toying with us, you bastard!
Finish this!
- Let's go, Rex!
Come on, Rex!
- Unstoppable.

♪ someone's got to do it ♪
Oh, my stomach.
- Oh, I wish I could take your pain.
- Oh, I wish I could give it to you.
- I called around.
Julia's sick.
Vance and Amy are sick.
It must be the stomach flu.
- You know Julie is the one who gave it to us.
- She's never been much of a hand washer.
- Yeah, it's definitely her.
My famous summer rolls.
- Nice.
- More food?
- It's a menu tasting for the wedding.
Honey, didn't you tell them the good news?
- Amy and Vance called me and asked me
To come out of retirement to plan their wedding.
- Wow.
That is almost certainly not how it went down.
- Well, so far only Amy and I have talked about it.
But Vance will be on board once we get him up to speed.
- No, no, no, no, no.
Are you out of your mind?
- I said I want elegance and class.
And Leigh is classy.
And elegant.
- Why, because she has a Marc Jacobs bag?
So do I. That doesn't make her classy.
- Oh, yes, thank you.
Please explain what "classy" means to me.
I'm just some dumb girl from Louisiana.
I want a NASCAR wedding.
A camouflage cake and a bouquet
Of illegal fireworks.
- Leigh is gonne make this wedding
All about what she wants.
And you're gonne let her.
She has, like, some weird hold on you.
She's gonne tell us to do something,
And you're gonne be all, all--
- That is a great idea, Leigh.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Table centerpieces.
I can't remember what the world was like
Before you came up with that.
- Oh, and you'll definitely want these summer rolls.
For the processional, some Debussy.
- Debussy?
I love Debussy.
- Really?
Multiple choice.
Debussy is "a," a kind of flower.
"b" a wine.
Or "c," a composer?
- I don't know, Vance.
But I love it, and I need it.
Can I get some now?
- Can I just say one
Tiny little thing about the wedding?
- Uh-oh, looks like we got a groomzilla.
- Sweetie, traditionally the wedding details
Are the woman's domain.
- Wait, though.
In Vance's defense,
I think gender roles
Have gotten kind of fuzzy.
Actually, the other night, there were
Some gang-bangers in our front yard--
- High school kids.
- And you would think that the guy
Would take care of it, but Julie did it.
That's just the way things are these days.
- Not in this house.
We had a possum in the yard last night.
Daddy stepped up.
- I was cowering in the bed.
- And I got back into that bed
And took what was mine.
- Possum must bring back some pretty painful memories.
Huh, Dave?
- Good night, Vance.
- Good night, Dave.
Sweet dreams.
He left camp early.
- I had poison sumac, from head to toe.
It's really bad.
Have you ever had poison sumac?
- No.
- Oh, are you guys talking pranks?
I'm in.
Unless I'm the one getting pranked.
Am I the one getting pranked?
- We have plenty of summer rolls left.
Eat up while they're fresh.
- Yeah.
- You're gonne love 'em.
- Mmm!
Mmm.
- Poor girl.
I guess it's a good thing I'm allergic to shrimp.
I'm gonne take care of you.
I'm gonne get you into bed.
Get you some badmagazines--
- Honey, I don't need anything.
I'm just gonne have some water and some crackers.
Just take a jog and sweat the rest of it out.
- Geez, what are you, an astronaut?
You're like gary the-- um, you're...
Uh...
Geez, how sad is that?
I can't name one astronaut.
- Seriously, honey.
I am fine.
- No, I'm not taking no for an answer.
Get your little heinie into bed.
Daddy's gonne take care of you.
- It's just a little food poisoning.
It's not the end of the world.
Come on, Julia.
Beat the poison!
- We didn't appreciate our good health when we had it.
When I feel better I'm gonne appreciate it every day.
- We're never gonne be better.
This is how we are now.
- Damn you, Leigh.
- Damn you, flu that Julia gave us.
- I finally feel good enough to drink again.
I lost nine pounds and was forgetting how to talk to girls.
- Here you go, guys.
- Thanks, sweetheart.
- Yeah, well, we have your wife
To thank for food poisoning us.
- Food poisoning?
Dude, I told you.
Lay off Leigh.
Unless you're pranking me.
Is that what this is?
Are you pranking me?
- So you were sick for two days.
Hanging around the house.
Did Amy let you take care of her?
- Oh, yeah.
I fed her soup, she let me brush her hair.
It's like I had a little dolly.
- See, Julia doesn't let me do that stuff.
She just toughs it out.
She's a regular general-- um...
Uh...
Nothing.
I can name every american idol winner.
What's happened to our generation?
- Yeah, she doesn't really lean on you much.
Does she, bro?
- No.
There used to be a few things
That she'd let me take care of.
And those are all gone now because of the stupidest
Birthday gift I ever got her.
Okay.
$79...20% would be- $15.80.
Looked it up on my iPhone.
- You can just take a left up here.
- Nope, iPhone says right.
♪ ♪
- Oh, who sings this song?
- Wait, it'll come to me.
- Oh, t-Rex.
And I just bought it.
you are so amazing.
- It's nice to feel needed every once in a while.
You know, not just as a husband, but as a person.
- Well, first off, never say that to her.
I mean, that sucked.
Second, you gotta carve out some things
That only you can provide.
Like with us.
There are things that Leigh is good at--
- Like poisoning your friends.
- Like decorating.
And there's stuff that I'm good at.
Like being tall and strong.
- Yeah, Amy lets me handle the bills,
And I let her confront people in the service industry.
- So the question is...
What is Dave good at?
- What is Dave good at?
That is a very good, very hard question.
- He's good at playing the wrong defense
Every week in fantasy football.
Maybe Julia needs help with that.
- Yeah, you were good at a lot of things in college.
Maybe she needs you to get drunk
And puke nachos on a cute girl.
- Or maybe she needs me to get new friends.
- Maybe she needs you to take things too personally
And lash out.
- Computer.
I'm good at computer stuff.
Like, when she can't connect to the internet,
I'm the one that-- I never remember what I do.
But somehow it fixes it.
- So break it.
- Break it?
- Break the computer.
- Break it.
- Break it.
- You just break it and then--
- Break it.
Break it, break it, break it!
Break it, break it, break it!
- All right, superwoman.
Let's see you get on the internet
Without your ethernet cable.
Perfect crime.
Perfect crime.
- What is he doing?
- I think he's trying to be a man?
- Oh, honey.
Just wait there.
Catch my whip!
- Yeah, I can't watch this anymore.
- Yeah.
It's kind of your fault, 'cause you've been emasculating him.
Vance tells me everything.
I do not ask, trust me.
A little quiet would be nice
Every once in a while.
- Oh, he has been so obsessed
With these gender roles
Ever since Rex and Leigh's mad men party.
- Women were treated like second-class citizens.
- I know, I know.
And it was terrible.
Now hustle your sweet caboose in the kitchen
And freshen up my martini.
She laughing?
- Nope.
- So what am I supposed to be?
Like, "oh, help me, you big, strong man."
- Oh, god.
Here comes the women's libber.
All I'm saying is throw him a bone every once in a while.
Oh, Dave?
How do I get this curly thing inside this wine bottle?
Ah, I sure wish a fire could start
In that hole somehow.
- Well, yeah, but he
Jacked up the port on the router
When he yanked the ethernet cable out.
- Nothing sexy about that, Julia.
Nothing.
- There you go, have a seat.
This is option one for what
Leigh was thinking for the groomsmen.
Seersucker is a classic outdoor look.
I'll also be changing into some
Indoor looks while you're here.
- Oh, my god, hi.
Sorry it's such a mess.
Just been down for the count with that stomach flu.
- That wasn't the stomach flu.
You food-poisoned us.
That seersucker suit is awesome.
- I did not food poison anyone.
- It's okay, it was an honest mistake.
Let's get to planning.
- Food poisoning is the second worst charge
That you can level at a wedding planner.
- Sleeping with the groom is the first.
- And if I thought for one second
That I did that to you...
I'd remove myself from consideration for this job.
- Oh, oh.
- If you're so sure these didn't make us sick,
Then let's see you eat one.
- Well, why should I?
I know they're fine.
- Then prove it.
Or step down from your post.
- Oh, god.
What are you doing?
- I'm going to eat one
Of my wife's delicious summer rolls.
- Are you sure?
That you're hungry for that right now?
- 100%.
- But I am also hungry.
For one of my delicious summer rolls.
- I can't look.
- I can't look away.
- Happy?
- Happier than you're gonne be
In approximately four to six hours.
- Ooh.
- Ugh.
- What's wrong, honey?
- Oh, this stupid computer.
- Oh, what seems to be the problem now?
- Oh, it's just not working.
And I do not know what to do.
- All right, well, let's step aside, honey.
Let me take a look-see.
Hey, maybe while I'm working you can
Grab me a cold one from the shed?
- Sure.
- Attagirl.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Dave, you have to help me, please.
- Sure thing, baby.
Just put it on the "honey-do" list.
- No, no, no, no, no.
You have to do this right now.
There's a possum, and it's dead.
And it's in our shed,
And you have to take care of it.
- Okay.
Possum, shed.
I'm pretty deep into the computer thing, so...
- Just put the cord back in that you ripped out before!
I saw the whole thing, you filmed yourself
On the web cam, dum-dum.
- What?
You--
- Please!
You have to just go take care of it!
There's so many teeth in such a tiny little dead mouth.
It was smiling at me.
Like, what is so damn funny?
- Hey, Leigh.
I've got a quick
Wedding thing to run by you,
If you're feeling up to it.
Great, I'm right outside.
So I was thinking about using this
As my "just-married" car.
Do you like it?
- Mm-hmm.
Is it from Rex's showroom?
- Yeah, he let me borrow it.
I was concerned that if you were sick,
You might ruin the posh interior.
But to quote Rex...
- I can't think of any reason
Why Leigh shouldn't ride in that car.
coming through!
- That's right.
Because I feel fine.
- Great.
Because as you said, if you food-poisoned us,
You can't be our wedding planner.
- Now let's make sure the heat works.
Boy, that feels good.
- That's nice.
come on, man.
Just man up.
It's probably not even a possum.
It's probably a squirrel, or...
Possums don't even come out--
Ugh!
Undeniably possum.
- So, Leigh, I think we should
Use this time to discuss the menu.
- Mm-hmm.
- I really like shrimp.
Big, plump, juicy-- - sounds delicious.
- This is fun.
Whee!
- Stop it!
- I will if you admit you screwed up!
- Tell me why you don't want me
To be your wedding planner first.
- 'cause a wedding has to be perfect.
It's the one chance to express the stylistic concepts
You've had about yourself your whole life.
To be the star of your own day.
- For Amy.
- Yeah.
Yeah, for Amy.
- But I could give that to her.
You know, to be the star of your own day...
The soundtrack will be critical.
And I think that she'd want you to be in charge of that.
- Yeah, okay.
She'd probably want that.
Well, what else?
- And she'd want you to feature your good side
At the altar and in pictures.
- That would mean a lot to her.
On her day.
- Yeah.
And she'd really want your best man Dave
To make a video montage of your friendship.
- Please plan our wedding.
- I'd love to.
Because I love you guys.
And I want to make this the best day of your lives.
And now for no particular reason I'm going to go inspect
The interior of that garbage can.
Okay.
- It is right that you called me.
I should be here, as I am the cause
Of your crippling possum phobia.
- Come on, can we just--
- It is the reason you left camp.
Tell the truth.
You owe it to me.
You owe it to cabin seven.
- There was no poison sumac.
- That had to feel good.
All right.
I'm gonne help you through this.
- That is not of god's hand.
Okay.
We can do this.
- Possum tailgate.
- Two hours ago you looked like you were gonne die,
And now you're drinking?
- I love you guys enough to boot and rally.
Is this possum here as the result of a classic prank?
- No.
- Oh, it should be.
We should start pranking each other.
All right, let me take a look.
- Are you gonne do it?
Are you--
- Oh, how'd it die?
'cause if this thing's got rabies
I should really have a glove on.
- I'm gonne check in with Amy.
She's an expert on all things hick.
- You're looking at an adult male.
Dead about 36 hours.
Possums, they rarely carry rabies.
So no worries there.
Yup, looks like he was looking
For shelter and he found it.
But something found him.
Something big.
And it will be back.
- I shouldn't have called.
- All right, someone get the garbage can.
- No, it'll stink like hell.
Give me that shovel.
Watch me launch this sucker
Over your house and into the woods.
- That's, like, 70 yards.
- Vance, I was all-conference lacrosse.
I think I can manage.
This really brings me back to the championship game.
- Of course this is a bigger crowd than you had for that.
- Just give me a running lane.
Unstoppable.
- Okay, that was awesome.
- Oh, honey.
You did not have to take it through the woods
So it wouldn't stink up the garbage.
- Well, that's what happened, so...
Oh, really?
Out-of-the-bedroom sex.
that is what heroes get.
- I could get used to this hero thing.
- Uh, hero calls bottom!
- oh, god!
What is that?
- It's the possum.
It's back.
- Its bottom is worse than its top.
- And the bastard's still smiling.
- Okay, what the hell is going on?
- All right.
Come here, I'm sorry.
- Ooh.
- There are two things you need to know.
I'm deathly afraid of possums.
And your brother's lacrosse skills
Are not what they once were.
- You're afraid of possums?
- Terrified.
Anything else...
Boom.
Would have taken care of it.
Snake?
No problem.
Dragon?
Slain.
Guy in thescream mask?
Captured and institutionalized.
But that is...
I, um-- oh, I'm sorry.
- Honey, don't apologize for that.
That is disgusting.
- No, but that is what I'm--
Honey, it's really important to me that you know
That I can take care of you.
- That's sweet.
But that's not you and me.
That whole, "man stuff, woman stuff."
We are way past that.
It's just "us stuff."
- Us stuff.
Hmm.
Now we sound so modern.
- We're like the couple from the future.
- All right, okay.
Be careful, be careful.
Yeah, that's him.
That's the one.
- Oh, that is so gross.
- All right, here we go.
- Okay.
- We can do it, here we go.
- Yup.
- Here we go.
- All right.
- Here we go.
- Okay, go!
- Open the bag, open the bag!
- Oh, god, it's heavy!
Whew!
Got a real good whiff.
Whoo!
We did it.
That was awesome.
- I know, look at us.
All brave.
- Whew.
- Taking care of business.
Using ladders.
Put the two of us together, we're like my dad.
- Except when we get drunk we don't stare at my breasts.
- I'm gonne talk to him about that.
- Mm-hmm.
Ah.
It's actually really nice up here.
- Oh.
The moonlight...
All secluded.
Kind of romantic.
- Possum gloves!
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh!
Possum in the mailbox.
Classic.
Honey, the guys totally pranked me!
Leigh, we got some mail.
Previously on The Real L Word...
You're so cheesy.
I asked Chanel, like, "will you be my girlfriend?
Check yes or no." Of course she checked "yes."
- I want to do this.
- I want to do it, too.
- It sounds so soon.
- It doesn't scare me.
I don't even care.
I'll wear a t-shirt, "Chanel's bitch."
Like, that's how it is.
Hey, Cori, are you ready to get your order going?
Oh, my goodness, I am so ready.
We've never even spent $2,000 on ourselves, but we spent it on sperm.
We've got batter!
I like to refer to it as "our future."
- So now we just have to wait for me to ovulate.
Can I get the nonalcoholic champagne?
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.
Being sober with everyone drinking wasn't as fun as I had remembered most of my dinner parties.
I've been doing makeup for the last 10, 11 years.
Then this last year, I lost my job, and I was, like, struggling, and then I was broke.
It's been really hard.
I can't take care of me and , on everything.
At least start looking for a second job.
Okay, I'm the one cleaning.
Francine, both of you know what I'm doing.
You're calling up some other chick, telling her that you love her, too, and that feels like shit, okay?
I really love both of them, but you can't have everything you want.
Vivian, I love you.
You don't have to say it back.
I know.
I got here, and I wanted it to be nice, and it's not nice already.
Welcome to my crib.
This is my bed, where the magic happens.
Moving to L.A., I was hoping to reconnect with Whitney, but I haven't spent any time with Whitney since I've been here.
I got fuckin' left here.
Whitney's just sort of living her life, and some of the things that she's doing might be pushing Rachel a little over the edge.
Sara, if you're gonna be sober tomorrow morning, and tell me I can't use this footage, you're fucked.
Whoo!
Whitney and I had a blow-out fight right before she goes to San Francisco, so, you know, I think it's over.
But I can't not have you in my life in some form.
I think we're mutually addicted to one another.
But on the same token,
Sara and I have real emotions for one another, and I haven't closed that door 100%.
You're tearing that pepper up like it's the best thing in the world.
It's my favorite snack.
- I want to eat a piece of it.
- Okay.
I just... 'cause you're making it look so good.
- Did you wash it?
- Mmm!
Yeah, I washed it.
I can't even believe I'm eating this.
- Why?
It's delicious.
- I don't know.
I don't think...
I haven't eaten in days, and the first thing I'm eating is a raw pepper.
Well, maybe you should eat, 'cause you're starting... you don't want to become... you have a lot of head, so you know what's gonna happen is you're gonna end up like this.
Like a lollipop?
Your body won't be able to support the massive hair-head ratio.
There's a lot of brains in this head.
- Brains?
- And these dreads.
- I don't know about that.
- What?
I thought there were.
What is that supposed to mean?
I don't know.
You have a lot of brains in that head.
Why don't you figure that out?
As soon as we get back from San Francisco,
Whitney and Sara's toxic love story began again.
Sara is definitely bringing Whitney down.
It makes me feel sad to see her going down this, like, rabbit hole.
I don't...
I don't know where she's going or... or what she's doing with herself, but Whitney can be a really awesome person, and I feel like she's not showing that, or maybe she's lost that in herself,
which is totally, awfully sad.
It's disappointing, as a friend, to see what you pick to be somebody you want to be with.
I think you deserve better.
To me, like, if you have fallen for that, then, yeah, you are not somebody...
Really, that I...
I used to look up to.
Right now maybe... maybe my decisions aren't the best, but right now
I'm trying to sort out my emotions, because that's what they are behind them.
There are emotions behind them, and sometimes, unfortunately, you can't control emotions.
I know.
We've already talked about...
So, t... no, but I'm just saying, don't fuckin' roll your eyes at me, because I'm telling you right now, like, to change the way you view someone or whatever, based on that,
I think is really shitty.
You know, it's really annoying that you get angry when I'm trying to be your friend and just tell you how I feel.
Well, because you're being condescending.
I already said I won't say anything else about it.
I'm not being condescending.
- Yeah, you are.
- No, I'm not.
You are making excuses, because you can't see...
She has, I feel like, brainwashed you, because every time anybody says anything, you have an excuse for her.
There's no excuse.
This is how she is.
And if you choose to love that, fine.
But I just want you to realize, that's how she is.
Kels... do you want to get up, or do you want to stay in bed?
It's nice outside right now.
Yeah, I'll be right back.
Okay.
Being sober feels really good, but it has been a struggle.
I am fighting to be in control of my life.
There's something that happens when you get on point and you get sober and you get focused.
The way that you look at your life changes.
I work at Marc Jacobs right now, and I'm unhappy, because I have all these things I want to do, and I'm just, like, stuck and not able to do them.
I don't think you should ever get stuck in something that you're not happy or growing in, so I'm ready to get my life on a different track than the last few years.
I've decided that I'm gonna move into an apartment by myself.
In my entire life, I've never been by myself.
I didn't have to spend nights alone or deal with myself, because for me, that's a big insecurity.
I've lost my girlfriend, and Francine doesn't want anything to do with me.
Francine and I have found some closure, and the closure is we don't get along.
And she should have told me before I moved out here that it was gonna be miserable, because she didn't.
She told me it was gonna be nice.
It's cute.
I thought things were going well, but when I think things are going well,
I don't think that means they really are going well.
I've begun to realize that I need some time alone.
- I'm hungry.
- I know.
Me too.
Hi, babe, how are you?
- Oh!
- Hey, what's up?
- How's it going?
- How are you?
Long time no see.
Hello, baby.
- Mwah.
- Hi, how are you?
My friend Sparks and her girlfriend, Anna, are in town, and they wanted to go see their other friends,
Whitney and Sara, so we all met up for dinner at a place called Street.
Oh, my God, I feel so welcome already.
I love it.
- Obviously I knew who Whitney was, because Cori and I watched the first season of The Real L Word, and I was really looking forward to meeting Whitney.
- Gnocchi?
- Yeah.
- Like...
- Oh, my God.
- Isn't that ridiculous?
- Mm-hmm.
It's like flavor bursting in my mouth.
Where'd you guys meet?
We met almost five years ago at Here.
- At Here?
- Yeah.
I know.
We met at a lesbian club called "Here."
The early 20s, I definitely partied a lot.
Now that I'm getting older and especially, you know, being with Kacy, who doesn't really like to go out... so I've definitely calmed down over the years, but I still have it in me, you know?
I like to go out and have fun and get silly and tipsy.
We, like, met eyes, and it was crazy.
It was crazy.
And then she went like this.
- Very... very un-Kacy.
- She beckoned you over.
But it worked, clearly.
And I got her number, and I was like,
"look, I got to go back to my friends, but can I have a kiss?"
- Oh, my God.
- I...
It was the most amazing kiss.
It was?
Yeah, it was... it worked well.
And, like... so, after that night, one of us took a month off to sow her wild oats.
But now, like, I'm done.
It's all done.
And so...
like, so we're actually married, like, legally married.
- You are?
- Yeah.
We've been married for two years.
- 2 1/2 years.
- Yeah.
That's amazing.
So what's the next step now?
We're on the track to make the baby.
You're gonna carry it, obviously.
- Obviously.
- Clearly.
Cori and Kacy... they're like the perfect couple, the unicorn couple.
You're like, erk! "Is that real?"
You know, like, the couple that you hear exists, but you never really see them out.
They're amazing.
You guys are cute.
- Sorry, we'll stop.
- No.
There's that "aw" factor, big-time.
And I wonder, like, what is that kind of life like, to, like, know you're with the person that you're gonna be with forever?
So what about... so how long have you guys been together?
Are you guys together?
No, actually, like, we've had a very, um...
We've had a very interesting relationship.
Like, we both have very intense feelings.
We're also both very stubborn and used to, like, you know, being in our own shit, and so, like, I think that we haven't really sorted out how to, you know,
be two fishes in the same pond, but we work on it.
Are Sara and Whitney a couple?
I don't know.
Who knows?
It's not necessarily the way Kacy and I are a couple, but, you know, as long as it works for them...
All these stairs.
When I started dating Chanel two weeks ago,
I found out we have the same birthday, so I've invited all her family and friends to a private party that I'm hosting.
- Hello?
- Hi, you guys.
Oh!
- And this is...
- I'm Saj.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Danny.
Nice to meet you, Danny.
Ryan!
Oh, hi!
- Y'all enjoying it?
- Yeah.
I'ma get, um... hold on.
Can we start with the glasses that's in there?
Huh?
I've just met Natasha, who helped me get the house for Chanel's party.
And it's perfect.
It's exactly what I wanted for her.
- I'm Saj.
- Hi, I'm Shirley.
Shirley, nice to meet you, sweetie.
Aside from this whole party planning,
I'm also meeting all of Chanel's closest friends.
I just hope they still like me at the end of the night.
I was like, "okay.
I was like, "yeah."
Well, I'm glad.
Honestly, I'm glad.
Chanel and I aren't having sex currently, but, uh, I'm planning for it, hoping for it.
The desire to have sex encourages me to do certain things.
And I just wanted her close for a second, like I needed her to myself for a while.
Oh, I love this paper.
Right intentions.
I was trying to think of, like, the perfect gift to get her, so I bought, like, a journal that, like, I promised to write in as well.
It's somewhat of a tool where I could learn to express myself to her a little better as our relationship grows.
So I decided to write my first journal entry.
"To Chanel.
I never really believed in love, but for once in my life,
I believe that there is someone that genuinely cares about me."
Just as I'm writing, I'm just realizing that these are brand-new emotions, and that's when it hit me.
Like, I'm in love with Chanel.
"I am certain that love does exist, and I want every day to feel as great as this one."
So...
I love you.
No, for real.
I don't know.
Like, after two weeks, we both dropped the "l" word...
The other "l" word.
I feel like all my bodily organs just kind of go on a break.
I just know it's good.
Oh, my God.
I have to get back to my guests.
You're about to drive me nuts right now.
Shit.
I don't want to share.
Fuck!
Thanks.
Ohh!
- A second is not gonna work.
- Shit, just a second!
A second is...
- Not gonna work.
- No, stop!
- Let's go!
- No!
Let's go, for real.
Wasn't dinner amazing?
Don't lock that.
What?
See, for me, it was like three different stages tonight of relationships.
There were, like, the married couple that, like, loves each other.
And then it's like... hope...
I mean, I would hope that they do.
Do you think we're ever gonna be normal?
I would hope so.
I mean...
Hmm.
Maybe being normal is overrated.
- Right?
- Yeah.
I mean, it would be nice to, like, give a shot at a healthy relationship with Sara, but I have trust issues with her.
Since I got back from San Francisco,
I've been hearing that she started seeing this girl Erica.
I don't know what to believe.
Hmm?
Nobody.
I wouldn't do that.
I know.
Because on one sense, it's like, yeah, sometimes we're perfect for each other.
Sometimes our chemistry is so good.
We have great energy together.
And then it's like she fucks up.
But at this point, like,
I'm willing to open myself up to this.
I walked so much today.
I walked all up and down
Hollywood, Santa Monica, Melrose.
Tired.
I have been looking for a second job, hitting the pavement, going online, filling out applications.
I was really proud of you today that you were, like, out and, like...
- Mm-hmm.
-Looking, you know?
I was not in a good place in my head.
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.
I mean, I don't really want to tell you all the time when I'm, like, down, and stuff, because you just always just ask me, "stop."
Like, I'm just supposed to snap out of it.
I don't.
It's just when you're like, "this sucks."
Like, when you're just super, like, really, really negative about it, you know,
I'm just like, you know what?
I don't... no, I don't want to hear it.
But when you're out there, like, trying, and you're looking, and you were, like, on your feet, walking around today...
I was.
I'm all looking through all my pant pockets,
- hoping there's change in there.
- Baby, that's so sad.
All I have to see is Kelsey's trying.
That's it.
When you find somebody who's genuinely, like, such a good human being and has such a good soul, you can work on that.
Trying to fix someone's soul and someone's spirit is not something I'm interested in doing.
Trying to fix somebody's, like, routine and agenda,
I can do that.
You get up tomorrow, and you go look, and if you just keep looking and looking and looking, you're gonna find one.
Yeah.
And then when you find one, I can quit.
Baby, I need you to get rich... or die trying.
Right?
Take care of me.
The party was supposed to be a night just for myself, Chanel, her family and friends.
When I said that we needed to sit down
- to plan this...
- You never said that.
You never said that, by the way.
But I had no clue Natasha's friends were gonna, like, just end up showing up... definitely not a part of the plan.
I was, um...
I was hoping to wrap it up.
Oh, you want to end it now?
Unless you... you're all right?
You want to stay?
So at that point, it was Natasha's party.
So, of course, my party's over, and I'm ready to get out of there.
Natasha, I'm about to roll out.
Do I need to do anything?
I'm good?
- Like, clean it right now?
- Yeah.
Oh, well, can you have your friends move their stuff, and then I can make it look like it was.
Or... or we could do this in the morning.
All right.
- We're gonna do it now!
- All right, no problem.
I don't have any problem with cleaning the house, but how am I supposed to clean up while she's having a party?
It's crazy.
Chanel, you know where my keys are?
They're probably in my...
Get the keys.
Let's get out of here.
I had a sense, like, something was kind of fueling with Natasha, and the night just wasn't gonna end well.
- Go ahead and...
- We're gone.
Thanks.
- I'll clean up.
- I appreciate it.
I appreciate it.
Just make sure you're not too out of it.
Get your ass out.
I've been so...
I've been so patient with you, Saj.
I've been so patient with you.
- We just met you.
- Just leave.
Just leave, just leave.
Get your shit and go right now.
I don't know who the fuck you're screaming at.
Get your shit and go right now.
- You watch yourself.
- Right now, go.
- I'm on my way.
- Go.
I said go.
I'm not even joking.
Get the fuck out.
Everything's... no, she's gonna calm down!
She's gonna calm down!
I got them.
Let's go.
I don't think it's my job to discipline anyone.
So Natasha didn't know how to act that night.
I just walk away.
- Chanel.
Chanel?
- Yeah?
I'm not coming back up these stairs.
Get in my car.
I'm about to go.
The party I threw is now over.
Anyone I invited must leave now.
I'm about to leave.
Okay, we can go, but don't come at me like that.
I'm about to... 'cause I had a little, gentle conversation... a minute ago.
It's, like, ten minutes later.
- Baby...
- It's ten minutes later.
If I rented a place and it's time to go, it's time to go.
There's no conversation.
I'm fucking losing it right now.
Just a few minutes ago, Chanel and I are telling each other we love each other, and now I'm asking you to leave the party, and you can't do it.
- Happy Birthday, Saj.
- Thank you, babe.
- Happy Birthday.
- Thank you very much.
We're gonna clean up after you.
Don't worry.
I know you are.
That's why I said, "thank you."
If there's anything else that you need, let me know.
Chanel, why aren't you walking?
Thank you, this has been a great...
Oh!
Damn!
Now she hit it...
Chanel, shut the fuck up!
I know what I'm doing!
When I first hit the car, like,
I was so ready to get out of there,
I was like, "fuck it.
It's a casualty."
But, um, I'm better than that.
Yeah, okay.
What's your first name?
I'm about to send it.
I'm sending all that to you right now.
It was such a beautiful night and, like, ended in a fuckin' mess.
- Is everything okay?
- Can we go?
Like, I'm pissed.
Look at this shit!
Drive for shit!
I just...
I was trying to get my cell.
I was trying...
Chanel, you were sitting there.
But see, you was concerned about Shirley.
Natasha, she's about to push me down the fucking stairs!
Nobody was hitting Shirley.
Shirley's man was there with her.
Shirley was "a" okay.
For me, it was a matter of trust.
I feel like she should trust that I have her best interests in mind, because I certainly trust that she has my best interests in mind, and with that, if I say, "babe, let's go," let's go.
I'm extremely upset with Chanel.
While I want to be in a relationship with you, if we have one more issue like this, we done.
We done.
There's no point.
- Cheers to your new place.
- Cheers, baby.
This looks good.
This is not reflective of my painting skills.
- Are you done?
- No, I have to...
You just have that little space right there?
That, and then I have to finish, like, the white.
I don't know, it's kind of sloppy in some areas.
It looks really good.
Oh, what have you been up to?
What's up with you and Sara?
I don't know.
I care about her, so I've gone back, and, like, we've talked about it.
Then I pulled away and shut down.
Like, and then it was, like, the final thing.
Then I was like, uhh!
So, you know, I went back, and I expressed my care for her.
Sometimes I just want to put a leash around you and be like, "bad doggy, bad!"
Whitney and Sara... they're just not right for each other.
But Whitney just has such a big heart that once she does welcome someone into her life, it's rare that she just cuts them off, even though, like Sara proved, she'll do you wrong.
I think it's just a toxic relationship.
Like, last week, she saw the girl, like, at some video shoot.
- Who is she?
- Erica.
- Is she fem or butch?
- She's butch.
She's like... well, she's like pretty butch.
Like, she's like Sara's type, you know?
She's like me or Hana or whatever, you know?
Uh-huh.
I've said to her, like, "listen,
"if you're gonna see someone else, let me know.
Like, if you're gonna hook up and do whatever, let me know."
She was telling me, like, she's gonna end it with the girl, and I'm like, "okay, well, whatever.
I mean, just let me know if you don't."
You have to take her words with a grain of salt, 'cause they're probably not true.
Yeah.
I'm in a state right now where I want to focus on what I'm doing with my career and with my life.
If I constantly just make it about the girls and the love life, I'm gonna end up with a bunch of failed relationships and no career.
I've gotten this meeting with the women at power up, which is like this lesbian film-making group.
- Claire.
- Lisa.
- Lisa, nice to meet you.
- President of film production.
Great.
But they also kind of try and encourage other lesbians who are trying to do something that creates more awareness of gay life in the media.
I'm really interested to see what they have to say about my ideas, because these girls... they know what the community is gonna support and what they're not.
And I'm hoping that in some way we can either work together, or they can...
They can help set me up with the right people to work with.
- This place is really nice.
- Thank you.
- You guys all, like, live here or just work here?
- Everybody lives here.
- Oh.
No, I'm kidding.
Uh, I'm kidding.
- Welcome to L.A.
- Thank you.
- Where'd you come from?
- New York.
Okay.
Out here, my goal was to create some kind of lesbian publication, or...
I'm planning on starting with a website that's, like, fashion, health, and, like, kind of like a...
Like, upgrade your style kind of thing.
What's your publishing background like?
Not so... not much of a publishing background.
But that's why I want to start with, uh, like, a website.
So I'm gonna kind of start there.
- I just bought a domain name...
- Oh, great.
- Yesterday.
- What is it?
- Honestly tell me what you think.
- Okay.
- Dirty boudoir.
"Dirty boudoir."
Like, that wouldn't necessarily be the name of the magazine.
- Do you have other ideas?
- I like boudoir.
I was going through, like, anything I could think.
And me and my friends were, like, just listing...
I think you should have something in the title about gay, like, even if it's, like, lavender boudoir
- or, like...
- Gay boudoir?
Uh, kind of like that.
It was so hard, 'cause it's like,
I would come up with these ideas,
- and then they'd be, like, taken.
- Right, it's just...
I mean, do you have somebody to set up the website?
Well, that's what I'm kind of struggling with at this moment.
That, and then also, my biggest thing,
I need to get writers, because I am not the best of a writer.
But I want to be able to do the interviews and kind of have somebody take what I get from the interview and write it, because that's what I want to spend my time doing is just...
'Cause every day, like, I'll just think of something new.
Then I'm like, "you know what?
How am I gonna do that or... ?"
Do you have, like, anybody that you've talked to about how to go about this?
I mean, no, not yet, not out here.
You know, people come to...
This is the tenth time I've heard this.
- What?
- Your pitch.
And I want to be the person that does it.
I think it's... you know, it's a fun idea.
The thing is, I just feel like we've seen it before, yeah.
I do think power up could be a great place for you to intern, if that's something you're interested in.
I mean, that would be amazing.
But, you know, for me, I wouldn't...
I'm not gonna do something...
Like, I'm not gonna go and be your secretary.
Yeah, great.
And it was really good to meet you.
Hi, Lou.
Vanessa, you emailed me the sketches, like, what... how many days ago?
- Saturday.
- Saturday?
Okay.
I am wanting to start a jewelry line, because I haven't been doing my makeup for a little while now, and that was always my creative outlet.
I mean, anybody who knows me knows I love jewelry.
I love accessories.
But I kind of need somebody that knows what they're doing to kind of teach me.
So, based on these, we could do... we could do the boot harness.
- We could do...
- The headpiece.
I was wearing these feathered earrings, and it kind of picked up, and a lot of people were wearing feathered earrings.
So I was thinking, "let me make 'em."
It started with that... "Let me make the feathered earrings, and I'll sell them."
Yeah, ooh.
Let's do the... the thinner piece.
- That would be good.
- That's pretty.
- Okay.
- Yeah, like that.
- Perfect.
- Yay!
- Oh, this is better.
- That's better.
- Yes.
Being a salesperson is something that I did when I was in high school, or I was in college.
But this time around, I want to do something that builds a career.
- That's really...
- That's really cute, though.
Yeah.
I really like that.
I really like it with the heel.
Okay.
Well, now we know.
All right.
- One down.
- We got one.
Can there be, like, theme days?
Like, can we have old-timey day, where for the entire day, you talk in that voice?
I know.
That's what I said.
She should do voice-over.
ello, it's the voice of reason here.
Are you listening?
I'm not sure.
I'm thankful that I spoke to Whitney.
I let it out.
I...
I didn't hold back from her.
And even though Whitney's really preoccupied right now with Sara,
I still have feelings for her, obviously.
What?
Do I look bad?
No, I just wasn't sure if I could see that camel toe situation.
There's no camel toe 'cause I don't have underwear on.
Exactly.
Like, if anything, it really clings to the...
No.
No, it doesn't.
- But it makes this feel good.
- It looks like
James and the giant peach down there.
Look at this.
What is that?
What are you trying to promote, sweetheart?
It's not a camel toe!
You guys!
I hate you so bad right now.
My B.F.F., Lauren, is coming into town, and I'm gonna go and cut her and her fiancée's hair at the Sunset Marquis.
And I just wanted Whitney to come meet my friends.
Thank you.
It's... you saved me.
No, you saved me...
- Thanks, honey.
- From a hairy mongrel.
So I'm supposed to, like... ohh.
I hope this isn't like a... a... a hug ahead of time, in case you fuck up my hair.
No, it's not.
So we're at the Sunset Marquis, and everything's going great.
- I like Whitney.
- I like Whitney, too, now.
You know, bitches come and go, but friends are for real.
I went out to smoke a cigarette, and when I came back in... there's a lot of hair going on over here.
I was, like, looking at her, like, what just happened?
- She's buzzed.
- But my best work is drunk.
- Yeah, just le...
- Holy fuck, did someone...
It's her blood.
It's okay.
- It's her blood?
- It's not my blood.
We're good.
No, I saw the blood.
Good God.
Oh, my God.
You should count them.
I know Rachel really well.
- How's it going in here?
- Good.
And I know if she's mixed things together.
- What a lame bitch.
- Si, mama.
Are you just gonna straddle... ?
When Rachel's under the influence, she does not see what she's doing.
It's almost like she has this wall up in front of her face, like, that she doesn't want to admit.
I...
I'd like to, but I'm engaged.
No, I would not leave you for an egg sandwich.
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and say, when you cut your finger open and don't acknowledge it, it's time to stop.
No, don't... yeah, Rachel...
What is that?
Don't do that.
- Oh, wow.
- Ow.
No.
Just pull yourself together.
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Get in the zone.
- Yeah, slap me.
- Control yourself.
No, harder.
Wait, one more time.
Rachel...
I know, but I'm okay.
- You make me... you always...
- I'm not... no, I...
You know what it is?
You always make me feel like...
- I don't...
- I'm a piece of shit.
- No, I don't.
- Like I'm...
No, I don't.
I do not.
Come here.
You're bad.
Just one more.
Sweet... but make it sweet.
Make it sweet?
I'm P.Ms.'ing.
Come on.
You are...
Would you just hold me like a person?
I do, but I just...
I loved you.
I would do anything for you.
You don't care.
I do!
I do.
It was funny at one point, but then I started realizing, like,
"it is officially time to go home."
There's a sweet time when you'll be like, "yeah."
I am not... but I feel like right now you're in a different...
I'm not.
I had two drinks.
Yes, I know.
You've said that befor...
Rachel...
Rachel.
I don't care what we do on the field, our technique has to be good.
I play women's professional football with the L.A. Amazons.
Hit and rip.
Hit and rip.
So I'm glad we were hitting today, because I was really frustrated over, like, the whole Chanel situation.
It's like our... our first big fight, and I'm really worried about losing her.
What, last night, why I didn't get any sleep?
Exactly.
You hit it right on the head.
Girlfriend troubles.
Well, if you... guess that makes the making up a lot better.
- It's really starting to hit me that I might be ruining a relationship before it even starts, and...
Keep going, keep going!
I just don't want it to be over.
All right.
Shit!
- Did you want to smoke a cigarette?
- Yeah.
- Whoop.
Ohh.
Guh.
So what happened?
I mean, we went to go meet with her friends so she could cut their hair, but, um, I walked back in...
I went out for a minute, and I walked back in, and it seemed like she was progressively getting more fucked up.
Uh-huh.
And... it was, like, blatantly obvious.
And, like, the girls left the room for a minute, and, like, she definitely made a move on me.
And I was like, "all right, I think you should
"definitely either do this when you're sober, or when I'm fucked up."
- She got messy?
- She got messy.
I think that it's sort of classic Rachel behavior to bottle everything up and try to self-medicate to, like, make it go away.
I think that she just is flirting with the idea of,
"okay, well, if we're just friends, then we can still kind of hook up."
Yeah.
But she doesn't really know how to get to that moment sober.
Yeah.
So I think she might honestly... hey!
I think she might honestly be...
Trying to get fucked up a little bit so that she feels like she's breaking her own ice,
- you know?
- Yeah.
I mean, maybe.
And if so, she...
Did a good job tonight.
- At the wrong time.
- Yeah.
Michu...
All the girls in my life are so crazy.
I don't know what to do, michu.
There she is.
- Homes.
- Claire.
Hey, babe.
Sorry it took me forever.
Barbara's one of my best buddies from New York.
She's one of my closest, like, gay girlfriends.
So it's just really awesome to have her come out here.
So tomorrow we'll just lay out.
Let's just chill tomorrow.
Today has been a runaround.
So I had this meeting with the girls of power up.
Basically, it's like all these women that are creative, all help each other out.
And she basically is like, "we want you to, like, intern."
But, like, I don't want to...
Not have an income, you know?
Like, that's just not how...
I roll.
You know, I kind of have to get people who want to help because they want to be a part of this.
It's like, I have to get people on board that are interesting people, that are doing interesting things, that happen to be lesbians.
And let's do it in a sick way.
And, like, that's the thing.
I feel like I want to do the photo shoot with The Real L Word girls in, like, white t-shirts, underwear, little to no makeup, in, like, bed.
I mean, I'm in a position to try.
I'd be a fool if I didn't take it.
My hope is that the other girls from The Real L Word will generate some attention for my site.
But Francine knew most of the girls on the show prior to me moving out here.
And I don't know if they're gonna want to help me in donating their time for my cause.
I would hope that they would be down with it.
And I don't see why not.
I mean, you can get them to actually...
Well, you have to, like, spend some time with them.
Yeah.
And I will.
'Cause you better make sure that this website...
I need to get on top of it, because I know I can do it, but I want to do it right.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Thanks for hangin' out, man.
Once Cori gets pregnant, she won't be able to drink or smoke, so we're having a little last-hurrah party and calling it,
"knockin' 'em back before we're knockin' her up."
- Hello!
- Hi!
- This is Adam.
- Hi, girls.
We're planning to have, like, a last "Cori's night out."
- And, uh...
- 'Cause I like to go out.
We're getting the first round.
- What do you guys want?
- Tequila business.
No... what the hell?
We got to get through the whole night.
I like to drink.
I like to party.
And... this is gonna be it for, you know, however long it takes us to conceive.
And then add on nine months to that and then add on, you know, forever after that?
You know?
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
To motherhood!
- Cheers.
- I love you.
I love you, too.
Whoo-whoo!
When Cori goes out, shots have a tendency to come in twos and threes and fours and fives.
And there's a tiny, little piece of me that's worried about whether or not she is ready for this kid.
Knockin' 'em back before we get knocked up!
Oh!
Okay.
I have these, I guess, alter egos.
Kacy has named them Cookie and Coco.
Cookie is a little cranky.
She's a bit of a diva, and she comes out when I've had a little bit too much to drink.
Lower!
Lower!
But then there's Coco.
I think we've moved to Coco.
Ooh...
Coco really loves Kacy.
So Coco's fun for Kacy, for the most part.
- Watch out!
- Hi, Coco.
Here comes Coco, just rearing' to go.
And she gets that look in her eye, that, like, eye of the tiger.
It was a little scary.
I'm not gonna lie.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
We're gonna be parents!
Okay, get it out.
I got your hair.
You're fine.
Oh, my God, that jaeger was the worst idea ever.
I didn't even get to dance!
We danced, babe.
- You bent everybody over.
- I did?
As long as I bent a few people over...
- You did.
- Bye, bitches!
I love you so much!
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
It was so weird.
We do need to talk, 'cause, um... you pissed me off the other night...
Pretty much.
I think we were both equally pissed off.
This is actually the first time
I'm seeing Chanel since the whole birthday fiasco.
It's kind of early on in the relationship that we're fighting the way that we are, so I'm pretty nervous.
But, um, I tried really hard to not let, like, isolated emotions to affect the entire relationship.
So, if I'm angry at that moment, it's just at that moment.
I had a lot of responsibility in the beginning, you know, like... to start the tension, 'cause I was being impatient.
I was ready to go.
- I was rushing you.
- Mm-hmm.
Um...
And it wasn't fair.
Like, it wasn't right.
But, um, the level we got to that night was just unhealthy.
I just feel like the pressure that we put on each other with having so much in common kind of made us have this expectation of knowing each other right away.
So the little things that I was falling short on or you were falling short on, it was irritating us more than it should have.
Like, it was just unhealthy.
And, like, for me...
I never want to see that again.
I guess that happens when you're born on the same day.
A lot of the fundamental character traits are similar.
But I'm more of a runner than Chanel is.
She's more of a fighter.
But I'm a strong believer that, like, anything great isn't gonna come easy, so it's definitely worth the work.
So what do we do?
'Cause, like, I don't want to stop...
- I don't want to stop either.
- 'Cause, like, that's easy.
I know how to do that.
I'm really good at just, like,
"fuck it.
I'll stop."
- Never think about it again.
- Right.
But I don't want to do that this time.
I think the level of trust we need to be in a healthy relationship takes longer than two weeks to grow.
It's crazy because, like, this relationship, it's uncomfortable, but comfortable at the same time.
It's uncomfortable because I know it's different than what I've ever done before.
But the comfort comes from...
Like, the whole experience being, like, rewarding.
You know?
Like, it feels damn good.
But... stop.
I can't help it.
I'm so happy.
No, I'm right there with you.
'Cause, I mean, if we're gonna have a real makeup, we need to make up the proper way.
I mean, what's the proper way to say it...
Like, "take the next step"?
I don't wanna just be like, "I'm ready to fuck."
Like... but, um...
I'm ready.
It's possible.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm just dealing with something very odd right now.
Kind of.
No.
No.
I know you're waiting for that, but, no.
It's a long story.
It's like...
- I'll tell you when I see you.
- Okay, I'll call you later.
Bye.
I don't remember kissing Whitney last night.
But we just had fun.
Like, to me, it's all about fun.
I still gave great haircuts.
And seeing Lauren and Bianca last night was awesome.
- Can I take your car?
- No.
No?
- Okay.
- Right now?
You're, like, drinking.
I had two sips.
I won't drink anymore.
I'm just saying, like, you're gonna drive... like, how are you feeling?
Because you seemed, like, a little out of it before.
I'll just wait for Alyssa and Shay to come back.
- I'm saying, like, I'm not opposed to you...
- No, it's okay.
- Taking my car sometimes.
It's just, like, I don't know.
Like, you... if you're just...
I mean, I'm not trying to offend you or do whatever.
You know?
No, okay.
It's fine.
I'm not offended.
Just take my car.
I don't want to now.
Now you're just making me pressured.
And now...
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't want to talk...
I really don't...
I can't talk about this right now.
It would be crazy if she took something this morning.
Her eyes look off.
Something's just off with her.
And I don't know what it is.
But it's like... it worries me.
Rachel.
What?
- What's happening?
- I'm peeing.
- No, but you're upset.
- No, I'm not.
Listen, I'm fine.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing!
- Can you open the door?
- No!
I'm just gonna come in.
Uh...
Last night you were fuckin'... shit canned.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Last night...
You were cutting someone's hair,
- and you cut yourself...
- Like nothing.
You were cutting...
Literally, blood was trickling down your finger into her hair.
I'm concerned about you, because if I would...
Wish I could show you what I'm seeing back, because you... your face movements.
Like, you're... the way you're speaking is concerning to me, I must say.
I'm serious, Rache.
Okay.
- So if we could...
- Okay, I get it.
I'm not on anything.
No, I didn't say "on anything," Rachel.
But I'm saying, like, "what is up?"
I'm not fucked up.
I'm not saying you're fucked...
It frustrates me to see that.
It really does.
I get pissed off, because, like, I don't want to see her...
Like, that's just a stupid mistake to make and so unnecessary.
In my opinion, Whitney can't say shit, because, uh, downfalls come in many different, um, ways, and at this point, nothing Whitney says to me...
Uh, I can take it with a grain of salt, because you're still, um, you know, fucking with someone who is a lying, uh, manipulator.
So your judgment is marred.
I'm gonna go pick Sara up from work.
Bye.
But if Sara wanted the car, it would be totally cool.
I'm picking up Sara from work, giving her a ride home.
It's so funny, our relationship, or lack of.
And by "funny," I mean not funny at all.
I'm questioning now with Sara basically...
You know, if I'm gonna get into a relationship with her,
I want to be able to trust her.
Is she someone I could see myself lasting with?
I don't know what the exact answer is, um...
Or maybe I do way down deep, and I don't want to admit it.
Sara denies seeing Erica and says she hasn't seen her in, like, forever, or she's not really interested in seeing her.
But there is Erica right there!
So what the fuck?
Wow.
Wow.
Okay.
So...
I'll tell you right now, I...
My question just got answered, 'cause I just saw Erica right down the street from Sara's salon, like, walking down that street.
What?
I'm so...
This is hilarious.
This couldn't be funnier.
I had a f... you know, the funny thing is,
I had a feeling that that was gonna happen.
And, uh... and it sure did.
Wow.
I can't even believe it.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Do you want some pizza?
- No, I just ate.
He's so funny.
We were walking right now.
He's like, "work it, bitch.
Work, work, work."
He's like, "who's more feminine?
Me.
Who's a girl?
You.
Bitch."
I'm like, "you are more feminine than me, for sure."
Thanks for coming to get me.
You're welcome.
How's it goin'?
I'm good.
Hey.
Okay, okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
How's your boo, baby?
What boo?
How's Erica?
Why do you say that?
Because I just saw her walk out...
- You did?
- Yes.
She walked out... she didn't walk out of my salon.
Where was she?
I don't know.
I didn't see her.
- What?
- I'm serious.
I just saw her right on the thing.
I swear to God, she was not...
You could have even come into my salon.
I was just hanging out with him, and, um...
You mean to tell me, out of all the places in Los Angeles, that she just so happened to be heading out the backdoor area of where you work at the exact time you're getting off of work?
She's never been to my salon.
She doesn't know where I work.
Yeah, like, it doesn't make sense to me.
- Shampoo...
- Are you still seeing her?
No, I haven't seen her.
I mean, I've talked to her.
We text and call.
I finally get it.
Sara is just lying to my face.
It's like, now you're, like, bordering into, like, insulting my intelligence.
Tell me, Sara, what are we gonna do?
Like, I think that you're doing you, so, like, I feel like I should probably...
Do the same, yeah?
I'm done.
I'm over it.
That is a wrap on Sara.
- You know...
- So let's just cut our ties.
I'm turned off at this point.
Mm, I mean, no.
That means I'm single as hell.

I mean, that's fine, Joe.
Just, you know, we're surprised, that's all.
Yeah.
Just seemed like you wanted to do that.
I know.
Well, you know, the good news is that it looks like the fantasy woman might be into you.
[ Laughing ] Oh.
You got to put that in my head?
Well, what?
You said it first.
Yeah, but I'm just bullshitting myself.
You're saying -- aw, now I'm gonna be thinking, "Hey, maybe."
I'm not gonna sleep tonight now.
I'm gonna call you at 4:00 a.m.
[ Laughing ] Oh, God.
Me and the fantasy woman.
Can you imagine that, though?
I mean, if it's -- ooh!
I got to run this off.
[ Grunts ] I'll see you at the top.
Hello?
Over here!
U realize you only get one closet, right?
Don't worry, I'm taking a couple sick days off work to purge.
Yeah, I've gone through almost one box.
Oh, boy.
What?
[ Gasps ] Give me that!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
Hey!
Oh, man!
Look at you.
Look how cute you were!
You got your whole little Duran Duran thing going there.
Look at that!
Aww, that's nice!
I was going for more of a -- I don't know -
- Belinda Carlisle.
Thank you very much.
[ Laughs ]
What can I do for you, daddy?
I noticed the inventory could use a little freshening.
You ought to have the lot guys move the new Camaros down towards the street.
Okay.
I just want to make sure you understand that now that Bruce is gone, you're gonna have to step it up.
He may have had his problems, but he took a lot off of your plate.
Daddy, I'm here morning, noon, and night.
I rarely see the kids.
Well, now, that's a shame.
But sometimes, that's -- that's the way it's got to be.
There were times back in the '70s where I slept here four nights a week.
I remember.
Okay.
[ Grunts ]
Oh, and what time do you need me here for the commercial tomorrow?
Oh.
Um...
Um...
A-actually, um 5:00.
5:00.
See you then.
Whew!
Pizza in the back, guys.
Go get it.
Just got here.
It's still hot.
It's from Mikey P's.
It's the good stuff.
Um...
Okay, guys, what?
Just because of all the management, the stuff we've been doing lately,
Dashaun and I think we should get a raise.
Oh.
I mean, you kind of made a big deal about us taking on more responsibility, which we did.
But I'm still getting paid like a cashier.
And so it's not really fair that you keep paying me the same -- us the same.
- Right?
- Yeah.
I just -- you know, guys,
I wish you would talk about this with me in my office, maybe, at the right time.
Sorry, Mr. T. It's just -- we just never see you.
Well, yeah, but like I said, that'-- that's all gonna change.
Okay.
But we're still gonna be doing a lot.
[ Sighs ] Also, I just got pizza.
Look, I'm sorry, but the truth is,
I can't be doing a raise thing right now, okay?
I just -
- I'm sorry.
So, that's it?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Carlos:
¿qué estás haciendo?
No importa.
Lo que él está hacien no es justo.
Hey, hey, hey.
Are you walking out on me?
We just want what's fair, Mr. T.
Although we could finish up and then go.
No, she's right.
Maria, what are you doing?
!
It's just not fair, Mr. T. It's not fair.
Joe:
Dashaun!
All right, man.
No worry, Mr. Joe.
I have 10 friends we call.
Okay.
You don't have to do that, Carlos.
[ Dialing ]
Oh, hey, Marcos?
Yeah, I got it.
Toilet paper and half and half.
[ Metal clanks ]
Chet:
Piece of shit!
What's going on?
The stupid pressure pump is broken again.
I keep trying to boost the regulator, but the rinse cycle is so weak because it's a piece of shit!
Okay, well, it's got to be fixed because I've Tweeted and Facebooked and we've got flyers from here to Glendale saying "Free car wash."
People are coming tomorrow morning.
Then you're gonna be hand-washing every car, because this piece of shit ain't gonna do it.
Uh, something just came up.
I'm not gonna make dinner.
Oh, shoot.
Again?
You remember both boys have school projects due tomorrow, right?
Look, it's kind of an emergency.
I got to track down this pressure pump.
And this guy, Chet, he's about to cry.
Look, forget it.
I'll tell you later.
Okay, sweetie.
When we see you later, right?
Yeah.
No, no, no, no, no mañana.
Ahora.
Estúpido.
[ Receiver slams ]
Sorry, Mr. Joe.
Yeah, it's okay, Carlos.
Don't worry.
He and me do good job.
Hey, man.
I got it.
I had to drive all the way to Torrance and wake up some dude, but, uh...
Hey, man!
Hey, I got it.
What time is it, man?
It's time to rock this thing.
And don't worry about how long it takes, 'cause you're on double time, okay?
Okay.
Hey.
You need, um...
Help?
[ Sighs ]
[ Sighs ]
Our friendly staff ensures that you'll get a great deal without all the hassle.
[ Spits ]
Because they're not making them like they used to.
You know, I got to say,
I'm kind of excited about the shoot today.
Yeah?
I mean, Owen was right.
This does not suck.
I mean, even the part with his dad is okay.
You know at I'm excited about?
I found a whole box of these in my new closet.
[ Laughs ] Wow.
You know, he's really cute, but I think I like you better.
Well, that's good.
And why are you wearing overalls?
This was my best pair of pants.
[ Laughs ]
[ Chuckles ]
Where is everybody?
The car wash has a huge line!
Everybody's supposed to be here catching fish!
Early shift was just me and Lawrence.
Did you put more people on the schedule?
[ Sighs ] Okay, okay.
Um...
Get on the phone and call everybody.
Okay.

Well, you know, I just happened to be driving by and I saw your truck here, and I realized, geez, you know?
I can't take your money.
Oh.
All right, whatever.
And I also realized
I got a good feeling about Denver tonight.
No, no.
I'm not taking bets.
I told you, that's still the deal.
Oh, come on, man, you owe me.
You know, the Cubs won the other night.
- I would've cleaned up.
- Come on, seriously.
You got to go.
Come on.
Look, I'm not taking your bet, and that's a good thing for both of us, believe me.
Aw, come on, Joe.
No, seriously.

Who do you think's gonna be the first one to flub their lines?
Not gonna be me, son.
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding?
[ Laughs ]
We're gonna start with a glamour shot of the Chevrolet emblem, light making it glow.
Then we pan to your first spokesman.
People say they don't make them like they used to.
At Thoreau Chevrolet, we agree.
The new Camaro convertible -- 312 horsepower, 29 miles per gallon.
That is definitely not making them like they used to.
And the same goes for our sales team.
Our friendly staff ensures that you'll get a great deal without all the hassle.
So, come in to Thoreau and let the best generation of car salesmen show you the next generation of cars.
Because they're not making them like they used to.
They just might be making them better.
Woman:
And cut!
[ Laughs ]
Okay?
Okay, how'd it look?
It looks great.
Freakin' cool, dude.
It's so freakin' cool.
Okay, we went a couple of seconds over, though, so let's do it again.
And, this time, just pick up the cues.
And action.
People say they don't make them like they used to.
Isn't he supposed to get out?
Cut!
Is there a problem, Terry?
Uh...
Yeah, yeah.
I think that there is.
O, can I talk to you a sec?
- Um...
- What is it?
Is it my dad?
He seems okay.
No, no, he's fine.
He's fine.
It's just, um -- it's boring.
It's boring as hell.
Is it -- is it supposed to be exciting?
It's supposed to grab you.
But it does, right?
I mean, it's -- it's so freakin' cool!
Nobody's gonna give a shit about that.
People have seen a trillion commercials.
They're not gonna be drawn in by some crane shot and a bunch of old cars.
O, I'd hate to see you spend all this money and then not end up doing any business.
- Oh, oh, okay.
- I'm sorry, I...
So...
What do we do?
Well, I-I don't know.
[ Indistinct conversations ]
Whew.
Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on, hang on.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Sit down.
You okay?
He you okay?
- Just got to catch my -- catch my --
- All right.
W-why is he doing that?
Sorry, he just -- we're thinking about making some tweaks here.
Sorry.
It -- you know those commercials for Scarpulla Chevrolet?
"Scarpulla, boyeeee"?
They're terrible, but they're seared into your brain.
Everybody remembers them.
Don't get me wrong -- this looks great.
It's just that...
This is totally forgettable.
Well, don't get me wrong, either, but you better make a decision, 'cause every minute that goes by costs you money.
[ Groans ] Yeah, yeah, we're -- just hold on, okay?
Um...
I think...
We're gonna need some help from Joe.
All right?
So you get your phone out, call him, see if he's still there, okay?
You guys have a green screen?
Man:
Quiet on the set, please!
This is Thoreau Chevrolet commercial alternate version, take 1.
Mark it!
Seriously, guys?
Go ahead.
Okay.
[ Clears throat ]
And...
Action!
At Thoreau Chevrolet, we're stuffed with deals.
Okay.
Hang on.
[ Up-tempo music plays ] That's good.
Alright.
But don't be afraid to go all out...
Cause that's what's gonna make this thing work.

Yeah, stupid is good.
[ Goofy voice ] My shadow!
That means six more weeks of savings!
[ Normal voice ] I think this is more of a beaver.
Surf's up!
Prices are down.
[French accent] Oui la la to savings.
[ Normal voice ] Our prices are going, "timbe-e-e-r!".
- So, he's Scarpulla, right?
- Yeah, yeah, he's Scarpulla.
Okay.
- That's the spot?
- Yeah, hit him again.
I've saved all I can save, and I can't save no more!

I'm okay.
We should shoot one for every holiday.

On, Silverado!
[ High voice ] Our prices are egg-cellent!
Cut it.
Sorry.
No.
Cut.
Yeah.
Okay, cut.
[ Deep voice ] I want you to buy a new Chevy.
Pick it up a little bit.
I want you to buy a new Chevy!
Goofier!
[ Beeping ] Good.
[ Normal voice ] We're clearing out the old to make room for the new.
This is a damn joke!
Uh...
Never mind.
He'll get over it.
Okay, but this is the only holiday left, right?
You get this, you'll never have to make another commercial again.
Even an old man like me knows you get the best deals at Thoreau's.
[ Laughs ]
[ Applause ]
Any more stupid shit to do?
[ Laughter ]
[ Indistinct conversations ]
Well, that was interesting.
[ Laughs ]
I hope I didn't step on your toes too much.
As long as the client is happy, I'm happy.
For a minute, I thought we were gonna go down in flames.
But, like you said, I think that we're gonna have something that is going to be seared in people brains.
[ Laughs ] I was just dancing as fast as I could there.
You have a certain knack.
[ Laughs ] Cobbling together a bunch of stupid shit.
Yeah, I agree with that.
Stupid is good.
[ Laughs ]
No, it takes a smart man to know when that's true.
Yeah.
Um, well, thanks.
But I, uh...
used to act, but you know how that is, so...
Little secret -- directing's the only thing in this business where they let us old farts stick around.
I think they think we're wise.
Anyway...
[ Bottles clink ]
Where's Owen?
I want to thank him.
[ Chuckles ]
I'm sorry, babe.
I know.
It's not right.
You have all the kids, your own work stuff going on.
Just...
[ Sighs ]
We just have to turn the corner.
I know.
It's okay.
This is what you have to do now.
This is for us, too.
It's just...
We miss you.
I miss you, too.

So come back soon, okay?

Hi, pack rat.

So, how did it go?
Was a star born?
No, I actually got replaced.
What?
Oh, God, you didn't rap, did you?
No.

- Lawrence is in it.
- Ah!
It's gonna be great.
Well, you really don't want to be the Thoreau car guy.
No.
Hey.
Hmm?

Scarpulla looks like a shyster in his commercials.
But if we bust out with a professional actor, all-American, good-looking, huh?
!
O...
O...
Come on, man.
Dude, I'm telling you.
You're the key to kicking his ass.
- All right.
- Yes!
Yes.
The new face of the company.
Look, I'm not gonna hang you out to dry.
I'm spending money I don't have on this thing.
And I don't know much about show business, but it's gonna be good...
Classy.
Okay.
Classy.
Hey, can you dance?
I'm messing with you.

What's up?
You all right?
You need an emergency bag of lucky charms?
I'm going on fumes.
No sleep again last night.
Work stuff or just peeing?
Work.
Woke up every night this week, 4:00 a.m., million thoughts runnin' through my head.
Oh, I get that shit, too.
It's like obsession wake-up call.
4:00 a.m., start thinking of stuff.
I know I ain't going back to sleep.
You know what knocks me out is mint tea.
Yeah, I'm sitting in bed wondering, "Do I even exist?"
You think I'm shutting that down with tea?
I'm just saying.
Sleep like a baby.
The only thing that's gonna make me sleep like a baby is seeing black numbers on my spreadsheet instead of red.
What, whoa, whoa, whoa, guys.
Fantasy woman.
I got to tell you, she's not that hot.
No, you're tired and stupid and still kind of fat.
Oh!
She's a good-looking woman, but, you know, you've done better.
Better than her?
Yeah, what about what's-her-face, the blind-date hygienist lady where you came in your pants?
Dori, you mean?
Yeah, that's not what happened.
I'm talking to her.
You know what?
I don't give a damn.
It's about time.
Right.
Right.
Here we go!
Hey.
Oh, hi!
- Yeah.
Hi.
- Hi.
I haven't seen you up here in a while.
Oh, yeah, I just -- you know, I've been crazy with the store and, uh, well, a lot of stuff going on.
So, uh, you know?
Joe's been playing a lot of golf.
He's trying out for the Senior Tour.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
You must be good.
I'm, uh -
- I'm okay.
I'm all right, you know?
I'm not actually trying out for the tour.
I was gonna, but I'm not now.
But, yeah, I could give you some pointers if you want to know how to hit a bad shot.
Well, thanks.
I'll think about that.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
See you later.
Okay.
Bye-by bye.
She's gonna think about that.
You know, normally, I'd say that's bullshit, but that had a not-bullshit inflection to it.
You're not trying out for the tour?
Uh, no.
No, I'm not.
Dude, that's all you been doin' for the last six month.
Well, that's all I been trying to do.
Now, look, I practiced, I got a coach, I tried.
It's just -- it ain't gonna happen.
Can't you keep on practicing?
Well, the uh, pre-qualifying's here, next week.
So...
No.
Yeah, but what about Albert?
Wasn't he supposed to caddy and all that?
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't know.
So maybe he'll see that you can't neglect shit and it magically works out.
Okay, all right.
I mean, that's fine, Joe.
Just, you know, we're surprised, that's all.
Yeah.
Just seemed like you wanted to do that.
I know.
Well, you know, the good news is that it looks like the fantasy woman might be into you.
Oh.
You got to put that in my head?
Well, what?
You said it first.
Yeah, but I'm just bullshitting myself.
You're saying -- aw, now I'm gonna be thinking, "Hey, maybe."
I'm not gonna sleep tonight now.
I'm gonna call you at 4:00 a.m.
Oh, God.
Me and the fantasy woman.
Can you imagine that, though?
I mean, if it's -- ooh!
I got to run this off.
I'll see you at the top.
Hello?
Over here!
U realize you only get one closet, right?
Don't worry, I'm taking a couple sick days off work to purge.
Yeah, I've gone through almost one box.
Oh, boy.
What?
Give me that!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
Hey!
Oh, man!
Look at you.
Look how cute you were!
You got your whole little Duran Duran thing going there.
Look at that!
Aww, that's nice!
I was going for more of a -- I don't know -
- Belinda Carlisle.
Thank you very much.
What can I do for you, daddy?
I noticed the inventory could use a little freshening.
You ought to have the lot guys move the new Camaros down towards the street.
Okay.
I just want to make sure you understand that now that Bruce is gone, you're gonna have to step it up.
He may have had his problems, but he took a lot off of your plate.
Daddy, I'm here morning, noon, and night.
I rarely see the kids.
Well, now, that's a shame.
But sometimes, that's -- that's the way it's got to be.
There were times back in the '70s where I slept here four nights a week.
I remember.
Okay.
Oh, and what time do you need me here for the commercial tomorrow?
Oh.
Um...
Um...
A-actually, um... 00.
5:00.
See you then.
Whew!
Pizza in the back, guys.
Go get it.
Just got here.
It's still hot.
It's from Mikey P's.
It's the good stuff.
Um...
Okay, guys, what?
Just because of all the management, the stuff we've been doing lately,
Dashaun and I think we should get a raise.
Oh.
I mean, you kind of made a big deal about us taking on more responsibility, which we did.
But I'm still getting paid like a cashier.
And so it's not really fair that you keep paying me the same -- us the same.
- Right?
- Yeah.
I just -- you know, guys,
I wish you would talk about this with me in my office, maybe, at the right time.
Sorry, Mr. T. It's just -- we just never see you.
Well, yeah, but like I said, that'-- that's all gonna change.
Okay.
But we're still gonna be doing a lot.
Also, I just got pizza.
Look, I'm sorry, but the truth is,
I can't be doing a raise thing right now, okay?
I just -
- I'm sorry.
So, that's it?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
¿qué estás haciendo?
No importa.
Lo que él está hacien no es justo.
Hey, hey, hey.
Are you walking out on me?
We just want what's fair, Mr. T.
Although we could finish up and then go.
No, she's right.
Maria, what are you doing?
!
It's just not fair, Mr. T. It's not fair.
Dashaun!
All right, man.
No worry, Mr. Joe.
I have 10 friends we call.
Okay.
You don't have to do that, Carlos.
Oh, hey, Marcos?
Yeah, I got it.
Toilet paper and half and half.
Piece of shit!
What's going on?
The stupid pressure pump is broken again.
I keep trying to boost the regulator, but the rinse cycle is so weak because it's a piece of shit!
Okay, well, it's got to be fixed because I've Tweeted and Facebooked and we've got flyers from here to Glendale saying "Free car wash."
People are coming tomorrow morning.
Then you're gonna be hand-washing every car, because this piece of shit ain't gonna do it.
Uh, something just came up.
I'm not gonna make dinner.
Oh, shoot.
Again?
You remember both boys have school projects due tomorrow, right?
Look, it's kind of an emergency.
I got to track down this pressure pump.
And this guy, Chet, he's about to cry.
Look, forget it.
I'll tell you later.
Okay, sweetie.
When we see you later, right?
Yeah.
No, no, no, no, no mañana.
Ahora.
Estúpido.
Sorry, Mr. Joe.
Yeah, it's okay, Carlos.
Don't worry.
He and me do good job.
Hey, man.
I got it.
I had to drive all the way to Torrance and wake up some dude, but, uh...
Hey, man!
Hey, I got it.
What time is it, man?
It's time to rock this thing.
And don't worry about how long it takes, 'cause you're on double time, okay?
Okay.
Hey.
You need, um...
Help?
Our friendly staff ensures that you'll get a great deal without all the hassle.
Because they're not making them like they used to.
You know, I got to say,
I'm kind of excited about the shoot today.
Yeah?
I mean, Owen was right.
This does not suck.
I mean, even the part with his dad is okay.
You know at I'm excited about?
I found a whole box of these in my new closet.
Wow.
You know, he's really cute, but I think I like you better.
Well, that's good.
And why are you wearing overalls?
This was my best pair of pants.
Where is everybody?
The car wash has a huge line!
Everybody's supposed to be here catching fish!
Early shift was just me and Lawrence.
Did you put more people on the schedule?
Okay, okay.
Um...
Get on the phone and call everybody.
Okay.
Whew.
Come on.
Owen Thoreau.
Hmm.
Bill, what's, uh -- I thought it was a delivery.
Well, you know, I just happened to be driving by and I saw your truck here, and I realized, geez, you know?
I can't take your money.
Oh.
All right, whatever.
And I also realized
I got a good feeling about Denver tonight.
No, no.
I'm not taking bets.
I told you, that's still the deal.
Oh, come on, man, you owe me.
You know, the Cubs won the other night.
- I would've cleaned up.
- Come on, seriously.
You got to go.
Come on.
Look, I'm not taking your bet, and that's a good thing for both of us, believe me.
Aw, come on, Joe.
No, seriously.
Listen.
Come on.
You have a problem, man.
Just go to G.A.
Man.
Joe.
Joe.
Joe.
Thanks a lot, Joe.

Not gonna be me, son.
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding?
We're gonna start with a glamour shot of the Chevrolet emblem, light making it glow.
Then we pan to your first spokesman.
People say they don't make them like they used to.
At Thoreau Chevrolet, we agree.
The new Camaro convertible -- 312 horsepower, 29 miles per gallon.
That is definitely not making them like they used to.
And the same goes for our sales team.
Our friendly staff ensures that you'll get a great deal without all the hassle.
So, come in to Thoreau and let the best generation of car salesmen show you the next generation of cars.
Because they're not making them like they used to.
They just might be making them better.
And cut!
Okay?
Okay, how'd it look?
It looks great.
Freakin' cool, dude.
It's so freakin' cool.
Okay, we went a couple of seconds over, though, so let's do it again.
And, this time, just pick up the cues.
And action.
People say they don't make them like they used to.
Isn't he supposed to get out?
Cut!
Is there a problem, Terry?
Uh...
Yeah, yeah.
I think that there is.
O, can I talk to you a sec?
- Um...
- What is it?
Is it my dad?
He seems okay.
No, no, he's fine.
He's fine.
It's just, um -- it's boring.
It's boring as hell.
Is it -- is it supposed to be exciting?
It's supposed to grab you.
But it does, right?
I mean, it's -- it's so freakin' cool!
Nobody's gonna give a shit about that.
People have seen a trillion commercials.
They're not gonna be drawn in by some crane shot and a bunch of old cars.
O, I'd hate to see you spend all this money and then not end up doing any business.
- Oh, oh, okay.
- I'm sorry, I...
So...
What do we do?
Well, I-I don't know.
Whew.
Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on, hang on.

- Just got to catch my -- catch my --
- All right.
W-why is he doing that?
Sorry, he just -- we're thinking about making some tweaks here.
Sorry.
It -- you know those commercials for Scarpulla Chevrolet?
"Scarpulla, boyeeee"?
They're terrible, but they're seared into your brain.
Everybody remembers them.
Don't get me wrong -- this looks great.
It's just that...
This is totally forgettable.
Well, don't get me wrong, either, but you better make a decision, 'cause every minute that goes by costs you money.
Yeah, yeah, we're -- just hold on, okay?
Um...
I think...
We're gonna need some help from Joe.
All right?
So you get your phone out, call him, see if he's still there, okay?
You guys have a green screen?
Quiet on the set, please!
This is Thoreau Chevrolet commercial alternate version, take 1.
Mark it!
Seriously, guys?
Go ahead.
Okay.
And...
Action!
At Thoreau Chevrolet, we're stuffed with deals.
Okay.
Hang on.
That's good.
Alright.
But don't be afraid to go all out...
Cause that's what's gonna make this thing work.
At Thoreau Chevrolet --
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
-- There is no bull!
Stupid's good, right?
Yeah, stupid is good.
My shadow!
That means six more weeks of savings!
I think this is more of a beaver.
Surf's up!
Prices are down.
Oui la la to savings.
Our prices are going, "timbe-e-e-r!".
- So, he's Scarpulla, right?
- Yeah, yeah, he's Scarpulla.
Okay.
- That's the spot?
- Yeah, hit him again.
I've saved all I can save, and I can't save no more!
I saved me a pot o' gold at Thoreau!
Leprechaun kick!
I'm okay.
We should shoot one for every holiday.
Then you'd be set for a year.

Hail to the cheap!
On, Camaro!
On, Silverado!
Our prices are egg-cellent!
Cut it.
Sorry.
No.
Cut.
Yeah.
Okay, cut.
I want you to buy a new Chevy.
Pick it up a little bit.
I want you to buy a new Chevy!
Goofier!
Good.
We're clearing out the old to make room for the new.
This is a damn joke!
Uh...
Never mind.
He'll get over it.
Okay, but this is the only holiday left, right?
You get this, you'll never have to make another commercial again.
Even an old man like me knows you get the best deals at Thoreau's.
Any more stupid shit to do?
Well, that was interesting.
I hope I didn't step on your toes too much.
As long as the client is happy, I'm happy.
For a minute, I thought we were gonna go down in flames.
But, like you said, I think that we're gonna have something that is going to be seared in people brains.
I was just dancing as fast as I could there.
You have a certain knack.
Cobbling together a bunch of stupid shit.
Yeah, I agree with that.
Stupid is good.
No, it takes a smart man to know when that's true.
Yeah.
Um, well, thanks.
But I, uh...
used to act, but you know how that is, so...
Little secret -- directing's the only thing in this business where they let us old farts stick around.
I think they think we're wise.
Anyway...
Where's Owen?
I want to thank him.
I'm sorry, babe.
I know.
It's not right.
You have all the kids, your own work stuff going on.
Just...
We just have to turn the corner.
I know.
It's okay.
This is what you have to do now.
This is for us, too.
It's just...
We miss you.
I miss you, too.
So come back soon, okay?
Hi, pack rat.
So, how did it go?
Was a star born?
No, I actually got replaced.
What?
Oh, God, you didn't rap, did you?
No.
We just -- we found a better way to do it, much simpler, much stupider.
- Lawrence is in it.
- Ah!
It's gonna be great.
Well, you really don't want to be the Thoreau car guy.
No.
Hey.
Hmm?
Look what I did today.
To remind us of when we were young and foolish.
It's hard to believe that used to be us, huh?
Thanks.
I guess.

Why would some homeless guy just come into the store and beat you up?
How should I know?
I saw the guy.
At least, I think it was the guy.
I think he came there to rob you and just didn't expect anybody to be there.
He didn't even touch the cash register.

Yeah.
I don't see any lacerations on the gums.
We'll just stick the little guy back in the socket and just splint it to the surrounding teeth.
Better get you numb.
Dori, I need you in here!
Last guy I did this for was in a car wreck.
Tooth broke right through the bottom lip.
It was just dangling there.
And then there was this woman came in.
She had her front teeth broken.
Turns out she was a professional wrestler.
Took a chair smack in the kisser.
People say that that professional wrestling is all fake.
I guess they didn't tell whoever she was wrestling.
Okay.
Bite down now for me.
Hmm.
Looks pretty good.
Okay, well, I want to see you back here again in a week, and we'll see how it's holding.
- Okay.
- Unless there's some pain or swelling.
I'll need you in 3 when you're finished in here.
Dori, wait.
Just, um...
You were right.
Joe --
You were.
About everything.
I just...
I didn't think so.
I, uh --
I thought I was a good guy.
I need you in 3.
Okay.
I got to go.
I called the store -- I told them to, you know, close up and leave everything where it is.
I figured you'd want the police to look at the damage or take photos, or somethin'.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Somebody Should get over there and do something.
Joe?
Oh, hi.
I'll wait for you downstairs.
Okay?
Look, I just want to say...
I'm sorry.
Well, no, you know,
I shouldn't have gotten all heavy on you in there.
No.
I just -
- I should have at least given you an explanation.
It's just...
When you told me about that big bet you made...
Hey...
You saw what you saw.
It was scary.
I-I was --
No.
I had to break it off, but I just want you to know that it wasn't some little thing... meeting you.
I screwed up so many things.
Well, hey, don't let bad Joe win, okay?

Previously on "The Event"...
What do you want?
Dempsey's played us both.
You need to tell him how he was behind trying to kill the President.
I was manipulated by a very powerful man.
- Who is it?
- It was...
You're gonna give me the name, or I will make sure you pay for it.
I am the Vice President, and that's the way it's going to stay.
- The boy, what's his name?
- Sean Walker.
I have a feeling that this Mr. Walker and I will cross paths again.
These people are trying to have the President killed.
Don't you want to stop them?
You can't run away, little guy.
- This is Samantha...
- Come in.
And my daughter Leila.
This is Mr. Geller.
You and Sam will be safe here.
Once we use the portal to bring our people here, then we will own it all.
Sophia, you have to stop him.
- I don't know where he is.
- I trusted you.
And once again, it was all lies.
No.
That's not what I intended.
We broke through the encryption.
She's somewhere in San Francisco.
- I want her.
- Mr. President, in the past, you've always taken the use of force off the table.
She has played me for a fool for the last time.
May God rest her soul.
Sir, it's a communication satellite.
They're sending a message home.
Oh, no.
Spikes are concentrated at the same frequencies.
What do you think?
Could be radiation from those stellar flares altair has been throwing.
At that level of intensity and regularity?
No, no.
Oh, that's not Altair talking.
Look, see, there's a pattern.
And it is aimed right at us.
This is some kind of message.
We have to call the N.S.A. right now.
This is exactly the kind of anomaly they asked us to look out for.
Slow down.
Before we start ringing alarms, let's check if it matches an elliptical orbit first.
Chances are, it's nothing.
All right, all right.
You reposition the telescopes to the frequency, and I'll punch up NOVA.
Come on.
It's a message.
I was right.
Yes, you were.
Careful.
You drop these rods, you could irradiate this entire airfield.
Thomas, it's Anthony.
He says it's urgent.
What is it?
We received a response to the message you sent home.
So what does it say?
Anthony?
It's complicated.
What does it say?
All right.
Copy all the data we need and wipe everything clean and get out of there.
The government can't know about the message.
What is it?
Something terrible has happened back home.
Season 1, Episode 14:
A Message Back
The girl in the purple sweater.
- You sure?
- Oh, yes.
She's one of the special ones.
I'll be leaving for the airport in, uh... well, pretty soon.
I'd like her in our possession by the time I get back.
Of course, Dr. Dempsey.
I'll make sure that we have some of the extract waiting for you.
Oh, good.
Yes.
It's important I stay in good health...
Now more than ever so that I can, um...
See this through.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Is that for catching butterflies?
For turtles.
They live in the pond.
I bet there are a lot of turtles in there that would like to come home with you.
- Really?
- Sure.
Everything has to leave home sometime.
Walker.
I'm not here to kill you, so don't overreact and try something stupid, because I will shoot you.
Back up.
What do you want?
I want to know who you've been working for... people behind everything.
They need to be stopped.
And you're gonna help me stop them.
You made a big mistake coming here.
How did you find me?
You were careful covering up your tracks, but your mother wasn't.
She used her old cell phone the last time she called you here.
So once I had that, tracking down where you were was easy.
Nice work.
Now put down the gun before I take it from you and make you sorry.
You're gonna help me take down the people you work for, because you might not care about the things they've done, but I do, and somebody has to stop them.
- Quit fooling yourself.
- Back up.
- You're a kid, not a man.
- Stop.
They've taken everything from me, and I'm not gonna run from them any longer.
So let's start with the names.
Who are they?
Or what, you're gonna shoot me?
I think I'll take my chances, because what you're talking about trying to do is suicide.
Well, it's not your own life you need to be worried about.
What are you talking about?
I know your mom is still taking care of your son.
And their location will go viral on the Internet unless you give me those names.
And I guarantee it'll make its way into the wrong hands.
You're lying.
The virus is controlled by a code
I enter into my phone every two hours.
So if I'm not alive to enter it...
Your family's address gets released.
So the names...
Who am I looking for?
There's only one...
James Dempsey.
He's a billionaire and one of the most powerful men in the country.
But knowing who he is isn't gonna do you any good.
Why not?
Because I already tried taking him down and couldn't.
Since then, Dempsey's vanished.
Nobody even knows where he is.
And you really tried to stop him?
How?
By using the Vice President.
He and Dempsey were in bed together on the assassination attempt of President Martinez.
Vice President Jarvis is part of the conspiracy?
Yeah.
I tried convincing him to go public.
And if he can't stand up to Dempsey, what chance do you think you have?
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
And if you care about your family, you're gonna help me.
We know the sleepers are now in possession of the uranium rods, which, if our intel is correct, puts them one step closer to accomplishing their goal... bringing more of them here.
Now, I take full responsibility for what has happened.
But make no mistake...
The consequences of that, an invasion, falls on all of us, which means, from now forward, there can be no more mistakes, from me or any of you.
The stakes are simply too high.
We must stop Thomas and Sophia before it's too late.
Now, I want an update on Sophia.
Where are we on narrowing her location in San Francisco?
We are still waiting for her phone to be activated again.
As soon as she makes or receives another call, we'll be able to pinpoint where she is.
In the meantime, we've mobilized a direct action unit, consisting of Special Ops Forces supported by every local law enforcement agency.
Local law enforcement?
No, no, no.
We've had Sophia escape from under our noses before.
I won't let that happen again.
No more mistakes...
I want the best on this.
General, who are the best men you have stationed in the vicinity?
The Marine Fourth Force Reconnaissance Company out of Alameda, sir.
Good.
Prepare to deploy them.
They should provide adequate support.
Now, you know that I cannot do that, sir.
The posse comitatus act prohibits the use of United States military forces on U.S. soil except for the case of a natural disaster, sir.
Thank you, general.
I'm well aware of federal law.
I'm also aware that when Congress passed posse comitatus nearly 130 years ago, they weren't accounting for the threat we're facing right now.
So don't question me.
Just do it.
Of course, Mr. President.
So they'll work with local law enforcement and with our Special Ops team.
Blake, could you brief your team now?
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- Mr. Vice President.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, one and all.
Please.
Thank you.
General.
- Glad you're back, sir.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It's, uh...
It's good to be back.
Thomas played me perfectly.
He knew I'd call Martinez and convince him to move the uranium.
Now he has everything he needs to power the portal.
And he's managed to completely discredit me in Martinez's eyes.
You reached out to Martinez when you didn't have to.
Maybe on some level, he knew you were telling the truth.
No, in his eyes, I'm part of the enemy.
Now there's nothing I can do to convince him otherwise.
Who has that number?
Hello?
Sophia...
I wouldn't contact you if I had a choice.
But there's something important we need to discuss.
I don't think there's anything left to talk about after what you've done.
Just hear me out, please.
You're aware of the message I sent home.
- Yes.
- Well, we got a response.
And it changes...
It changes everything.
We can't afford to be divided any longer.
Thomas, w-what are you talking about?
What was in the message?
I can't explain now.
This needs to be in person.
Do you actually think I
- I'm foolish enough to accept your offer?
Not just you...
everyone.
I'm gathering all of our people.
This is something they all need to hear.
The future of our race hangs in the balance.
- I don't believe you.
- Then your people will hear what I have to tell them without you.
- Thomas...
- I'll be sending a text with the location of the meeting soon.
I hope you're there.
Mr. President...
You asked to see me?
Close the door.
What do you think you're doing here?
Eli...
Things... things have gotten worse since I left.
Don't you think it's time we put what's happened behind us?
Yeah, see, Ray...
I may not be able to keep you from walking into this building, but I can make your life a living hell once you do.
So, no, no.
I don't want to see you.
I don't want to hear you.
I don't want to get a damn whiff of you.
You understand me?
After what happened, you don't exist.
With all due respect, Mr. President, nothing has happened...
Nothing on record, anyway.
I ran on this ticket to serve my country, to do what I think are in its best interests.
And I plan to continue to do just that.
You try and stop me, and I'll be forced to expose everything you've been so carefully trying to cover up.
What'd you expect me to do, stay home, cower under my desk until our term expires?
I don't think so.
I may have to tolerate you, Ray, but trust me, you don't want to bait me.
What do you think you're doing?
You stay the hell out of my way.
Mr. President...
I'm sorry to interrupt.
But there's news about Sophia.
- Mr. President.
- At ease.
Tell me what you have.
Sophia...
or her cell phone at least.
Uh, we were able to get a location on it because she had just received a call.
Are the Marines on their way?
Yes, sir.
They're dressing as civilian law enforcement so as not to attract any unneeded attention.
Good.
So as soon as you're sure it's her, take her alive if you can.
But if you can't...
Sir.
Do you have any idea how hard it is to gain access to the Vice President, especially now, since Dempsey's tried to kill him?
Well, we'll just have to figure out a way.
Oh, okay.
Good.
Good plan.
When you see signs for a place that might have Internet, pull over.
Until then, I want to know more about Dempsey.
How much do you know about the girls he's abducted?
Like the fact that they're not human?
Then you know about the aliens.
It's the reason why he tried assassinating Martinez in the first place.
He didn't want the President releasing them.
Dempsey tried to keep the experiments on the girls a secret.
When I found out, I knew I had to leave.
I'm surprised he could do anything to offend you.
And what's that supposed to mean?
Do I have to list the things you've done since I've met you?
Kidnapping, murdering innocent people...
You think you know me, but you don't.
Well, that's my point.
You make absolutely no sense to me.
My dad left my mom when I was a kid.
I don't even remember him.
But I remember my stepdad.
He was a real...
Bastard.
He started hitting my mom from pretty much the word "go. "
It went on like that until one day I had enough.
So when he started whaling on my mom,
I went to the drawer where I knew he kept his gun.
And I took it out...
And I shot him.
I
- I don't know what to say.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
Well, don't be, 'cause that whole sob story...
I made it up.
There's no reason I am the way I am, Walker.
I just came out this way.
Come.
I hope I'm not disturbing you again.
Depends.
Any word on Sophia?
No.
Not yet.
But, uh...
That's not why I'm here.
We haven't had much time to talk since I got back from Inostranka.
I wanted to check in, see how you're doing.
Stop beating around the bush, Blake.
You saw me confronting Ray, and you're worried that I'm...
I'm losing it.
To put it bluntly, yes.
But it's not just that.
Your decision to suspend posse comitatus...
That's not like you.
Um, that's exactly the point.
I'm not sure that I follow.
Well, Sophia and her people have been locked up at Inostranka for 66 years...
Until I tried playing the great emancipator.
Now, we all know how that worked out.
Elias, you can't blame yourself for everything that's...
It's the truth.
Let's not sugarcoat it.
Now, if I'm gonna fix the mess I've gotten us into, then I need to change... me.
Don't interrupt me again until you have something on Sophia.
Yes, Mr. President.
So what am I supposed to do when you die?
Excuse me?
Well, you're not getting out of this thing alive, which means eventually my family's information gets released.
And it's not just you that dies.
It's my mother and my son too.
I guess you better figure out a way to keep me alive, then.
I think I found something.
- What is it?
- It's an article online.
It says, uh, Jarvis is back to work at the White House today.
If you think I'm getting us into the White House, you're crazy.
No, but it also says that he's attending a party fund-raiser later tonight.
Where?
Uh, the Ambassador Hotel, downtown Washington.
Can you hack the guest list?
Oh, come on, that's got to be nothing compared to hacking the Pentagon mainframe as a sophomore in high school.
I... was a junior, but how did you know that?
You were my target once, remember?
I don't do any job without doing my research first.
Even if I add our names or our aliases for that matter, there's no way we'll ever be vetted to get in.
That's why we're gonna find people who've already been vetted for us.
Ted, what time does the fund-raiser start?
The money we paid...
I don't want to be late.
7:30.
Gonna need to get there a little early, too, to get through that security screening.
Have you seen my cuff links?
Did you check your jacket pocket?
Got them.
Did you call down for something?
No.
Hi.
I
- I think you have the wrong room.
Oh, no, no, no.
I locked myself out of my room.
I'm so sorry to bother you.
I was just wondering if...
if it's at all possible,
I could use your phone for a quick second to call down to the lobby?
Of course.
Of course.
Come on in.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Down on your knees.
Just don't hurt us.
You cooperate, and we won't have to.
- Their invitations and I.D.s?
- They're on the couch.
Here.
Remember, make sure you get a clear impression.
Any flaws, and we're not getting past security.
Status?
Here.
All right, pack it up.
Jarvis knows what I look like, so I still have to change my appearance.
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?
Wait, wait.
They're innocent.
They saw our faces.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
You're not doing this.
What do you think the message is?
I don't know.
But I think we owe it to ourselves to go to this meeting and see what Thomas has to say for himself.
I don't trust Thomas, and neither should you.
Well, listen, whether you do or not, the fact of the matter is,
Thomas is gaining more and more power.
I don't want this any more than you do, but...
What is it?
It's a text with the location of the meeting.
Where is it?
It's in Los Angeles.
I'm gonna go, okay?
You don't have to.
Leila and Samantha shouldn't be alone anyway, all right?
- Be careful.
- Of course.
Okay.
- I just got the text.
- So have many others.
Thomas has everyone worried about what the message might be.
The few I've talked to will go to the meeting.
Thomas' Agent did intercept a return message.
He murdered his partner in order to make sure it stayed a secret.
Then I have to go.
I don't have a choice.
Our people are starting to be swayed by him.
It doesn't matter what the message is.
I can't give Thomas the opportunity to solidify his power over them.
He already tried to kill you once.
He won't try that again...
Not there.
He can't risk turning too many of our people against him.
Michael, I'm not gonna force you to come with me.
But I'm going.
I have to.
Then so am I.
Good, good.
General Armbruster, you have permission to proceed.
Take her down.
Sir.
Just a moment, sir.
What is it?
Is there a problem?
We've just intercepted an SMS communication sent to Sophia.
It's part of a communication blast.
It went out to over 200 other phones.
What's it say?
It's too heavily encrypted.
There's no way to know.
Target is on the move.
She's with Michael Buchanan.
The pilot.
He must be one of them too.
What's he up to with Sophia?
We'll find out when we take him down.
Prepare to go on my command.
She's holed up all day...
Waiting for something.
She receives a text message, and then she goes.
Mr. President?
It's not just a coincidence.
She left because of it.
How many other people did you say received that text message?
Just over 200.
Let me see.
So this message...
Could be instructions or...
Or a location.
They could be meeting.
Tell your men to back off.
Mr. President, what are you doing?
Do it, now.
All teams, pull back.
Pull back immediately.
This is your chance.
You said it yourself... we can't let Sophia get away again.
And we won't.
General, follow her.
Don't let her out of your sight, not even for a second.
I don't want just Sophia.
This is our chance to get them all.
Thank you, sir.
Personal items in the tray, please.
- Stop it.
- What?
Stop looking so nervous.
We want them to think we belong here.
Thank you.
Invitations and I.D.s, please.
Personal items in the tray, please.
I'll take that.
Mrs. Fisk, right thumb on the scanner, please.
Have a great evening.
Mr. Fisk, please.
Is there a problem?
Again, Mr. Fisk.
Thank you, Mr. Fisk.
Absolutely.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
♪ ♪
There he is.
You ready?
Yeah.
You better be.
Hi.
Oh, it's good to see you.
Thank you so much for coming.
- So wonderful to see you well.
- Thank you.
Thanks again, thanks again for coming.
All the best.
Thank you.
Mr. Vice President, Ted Fisk.
This is a big honor.
Oh, Ted.
It's my honor as well.
And thank you for your support.
Oh, no... no...
no problem.
Um...
This is my wife.
Oh.
We've met.
You do anything to signal the Secret Service, and I pull the trigger.
You'll be dead before you get out a word.
You might want to smile and... and laugh like she just said something charming.
So...
So it's nice to have you here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Uh, now you're gonna tell your detail leader that you need a minute alone.
Do it.
Do it.
J.R...
I'm just going to need a moment with my friends.
- Yes, sir.
- Right this way.
After you, sir.
Apostle is headed into a secured room.
Keep your posts.
What are you doing here?
What do you want?
Ask him.
You're gonna help me take down James Dempsey.
James Dempsey...
Why are you asking me about him?
Don't... don't waste my time.
I know everything... that you helped Dempsey try to assassinate the President.
Oh, no, no, it wasn't that simple.
Okay, I don't care.
I don't care.
I just want the proof that will put him away.
The last time I came forward against Dempsey he almost killed me.
And now he's threatening my wife and children if I talk, besides which I have...
I don't have any proof, any actual proof.
It's only my word against his.
There has to be something.
There isn't.
Don't you understand?
There isn't anything you or anyone else can do!
Hey!
Keep your voice down.
Hello?
Is everything okay?
Oh, my God!
What happened?
Who did this to you?
Call 911, please.
Tell them the vice President's in danger.
You've got to know something that we can use against him.
I told you, there isn't.
Well, then at least tell us where he is.
I told you, I don't know.
And how much longer do you think it'll be before they come looking for me?
He's right.
We don't have much time.
Give me the gun.
My name is Sean Walker.
And the monster that you're protecting has hurt and killed who knows how many people.
He's framed me for murder.
Because of him, I've lost everything and everyone that I care about.
So right now I have nothing to lose.
So you're gonna give me something that will help take Dempsey down, or I will put a bullet in your head.
You understand?
Do you?
Huh?
All right.
Okay.
All right.
- What?
- He's left the country.
Uh-huh.
Go on.
He... he left for France this morning.
That's it...
France?
Somewhere in the Jura Mountains.
That's all I know.
I swear.
A call just came in.
We have a security breach.
Harden up around the V.P. now.
We've got a potential imminent threat against Apostle.
What's he doing there?
I don't know.
Please, leave me.
Mr. Vice President.
Open the door, sir.
We need to go...
Now!
He's not responding.
Stand back.
Mr. Vice President, are you all right?
Yeah, they're getting away...
that way!
Sophia arrived at Union Station 20 minutes ago.
Do we have even a guess as to where she could be headed?
No, I'm afraid not.
There's no indication she knows she's being followed.
So whatever's going on, she should lead us right to it.
Sophia is here.
She's reached her destination.
- What do we know about it?
- St. Andrew's Cathedral... it's been vacant for years.
According to the record, it was bought by a developer six months ago.
All right, I want to know who, and I want schematics on it and every other building within ten city blocks right away.
Yes, sir.
- Devon.
- Carlos.
- It's good to see you.
- You too.
It's been a long time.
Can we tell how many people are in it?
Just a few moments, Mr. President.
Splitting satellite feed to infrared.
I'm picking up about 200 heat signatures.
You were right.
They're meeting.
Move your men into position, General.
This is your new target.
Hello, Thomas.
Mother...
I'm glad you came.
You too, Michael.
I'd like to speak to you about this privately first.
No.
No more secrets.
We should get started.
Alpha team, how long before you're in position?
- Good news, Mr. President.
- What is it?
This is archival footage from a closed-circuit camera outside the church.
I don't understand.
What am I looking at?
That man there...
That's Thomas.
He's inside the church right now.
You all know my mother and I have had our differences.
Well, the reason why I brought you today is to tell you that we can't afford to be at odds with each other any longer.
The message I recently sent home has been answered.
And the response is not one that any of us will want to hear.
We've all known for some time that our planet's days were numbered.
Unfortunately, our calculations were wrong.
According to the message I received, our Sun has started going supernova.
I know this is much, much sooner than we'd anticipated.
But it is happening.
The first wave of lethal gamma rays will reach our solar system in the next two weeks.
In less than a year, our planet will be uninhabitable.
And if we don't migrate, our civilization will cease to exist.
My plan to bring thousands of our people here is now obsolete.
I have visual.
One guard at church entrance.
Roger that.
The only choice we have now is to bring everyone here...
To make this place our home.
This planet is the only chance we have of survival.
And we're gonna seize it before it's too late.
- We have a big problem.
- What is it?
Thomas, what's going on?
Where are you going?
The government's here.
Go, go, go!
Previously on The Event...
What do you want?
Dempsey's played us both.
You need to tell him how he was behind trying to kill the President.
I was manipulated by a very powerful man.
- Who is it?
- It was--
You're gonna give me the name, or I will make sure you pay for it.
I am the Vice President, and that's the way it's going to stay.
- The boy, what's his name?
- Sean Walker.
I have a feeling that this Mr. Walker and I will cross paths again.
These people are trying to have the President killed.
Don't you want to stop them?
You can't run away, little guy.
- This is Samantha...
- Come in.
And my daughter Leila.
This is Mr. Geller.
You and Sam will be safe here.
Once we use the portal to bring our people here, then we will own it all.
Sophia, you have to stop him.
- I don't know where he is.
- I trusted you.
And once again, it was all lies.
No.
That's not what I intended.
We broke through the encryption.
She's somewhere in San Francisco.
- I want her.
- Mr. President, in the past, you've always taken the use of force off the table.
She has played me for a fool for the last time.
May God rest her soul.
Sir, it's a communication satellite.
They're sending a message home.
Oh, no.
Spikes are concentrated at the same frequencies.
What do you think?
Could be radiation from those stellar flares altair has been throwing.
At that level of intensity and regularity?
No, no.
Oh, that's not Altair talking.
Look, see, there's a pattern.
And it is aimed right at us.
This is some kind of message.
We have to call the N.S.A. right now.
This is exactly the kind of anomaly they asked us to look out for.
Slow down.
Before we start ringing alarms, let's check if it matches an elliptical orbit first.
Chances are, it's nothing.
All right, all right.
You reposition the telescopes to the frequency, and I'll punch up NOVA.
Come on.
It's a message.
I was right.
Yes, you were.
Careful.
You drop these rods, you could irradiate this entire airfield.
Thomas, it's Anthony.
He says it's urgent.
What is it?
We received a response to the message you sent home.
So what does it say?
Anthony?
It's complicated.
What does it say?
All right.
Copy all the data we need and wipe everything clean and get out of there.
The government can't know about the message.
What is it?
Something terrible has happened back home.
The Event 1x14 A Message Back
-- sync, corrected by elderman --
The girl in the purple sweater.
- You sure?
- Oh, yes.
She's one of the special ones.
I'll be leaving for the airport in, uh-- well, pretty soon.
I'd like her in our possession by the time I get back.
Of course, Dr. Dempsey.
I'll make sure that we have some of the extract waiting for you.
Oh, good.
Yes.
It's important I stay in good health...
Now more than ever so that I can, um...
See this through.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Is that for catching butterflies?
For turtles.
They live in the pond.
I bet there are a lot of turtles in there that would like to come home with you.
- Really?
- Sure.
Everything has to leave home sometime.
Walker.
I'm not here to kill you, so don't overreact and try something stupid, because I will shoot you.
Back up.
What do you want?
I want to know who you've been working for-- people behind everything.
They need to be stopped.
And you're gonna help me stop them.
You made a big mistake coming here.
How did you find me?
You were careful covering up your tracks, but your mother wasn't.
She used her old cell phone the last time she called you here.
So once I had that, tracking down where you were was easy.
Nice work.
Now put down the gun before I take it from you and make you sorry.
You're gonna help me take down the people you work for, because you might not care about the things they've done, but I do, and somebody has to stop them.
- Quit fooling yourself.
- Back up.
- You're a kid, not a man.
- Stop.
They've taken everything from me, and I'm not gonna run from them any longer.
So let's start with the names.
Who are they?
Or what, you're gonna shoot me?
I think I'll take my chances, because what you're talking about trying to do is suicide.
Well, it's not your own life you need to be worried about.
What are you talking about?
I know your mom is still taking care of your son.
And their location will go viral on the Internet unless you give me those names.
And I guarantee it'll make its way into the wrong hands.
You're lying.
The virus is controlled by a code
I enter into my phone every two hours.
So if I'm not alive to enter it...
Your family's address gets released.
So the names...
Who am I looking for?
There's only one...
James Dempsey.
He's a billionaire and one of the most powerful men in the country.
But knowing who he is isn't gonna do you any good.
Why not?
Because I already tried taking him down and couldn't.
Since then, Dempsey's vanished.
Nobody even knows where he is.
And you really tried to stop him?
How?
By using the Vice President.
He and Dempsey were in bed together on the assassination attempt of President Martinez.
Vice President Jarvis is part of the conspiracy?
Yeah.
I tried convincing him to go public.
And if he can't stand up to Dempsey, what chance do you think you have?
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
And if you care about your family, you're gonna help me.
We know the sleepers are now in possession of the uranium rods, which, if our intel is correct, puts them one step closer to accomplishing their goal-- bringing more of them here.
Now, I take full responsibility for what has happened.
But make no mistake...
The consequences of that, an invasion, falls on all of us, which means, from now forward, there can be no more mistakes, from me or any of you.
The stakes are simply too high.
We must stop Thomas and Sophia before it's too late.
Now, I want an update on Sophia.
Where are we on narrowing her location in San Francisco?
We are still waiting for her phone to be activated again.
As soon as she makes or receives another call, we'll be able to pinpoint where she is.
In the meantime, we've mobilized a direct action unit, consisting of Special Ops Forces supported by every local law enforcement agency.
Local law enforcement?
No, no, no.
We've had Sophia escape from under our noses before.
I won't let that happen again.
No more mistakes-- I want the best on this.
General, who are the best men you have stationed in the vicinity?
The Marine Fourth Force Reconnaissance Company out of Alameda, sir.
Good.
Prepare to deploy them.
They should provide adequate support.
Now, you know that I cannot do that, sir.
The posse comitatus act prohibits the use of United States military forces on U.S. soil except for the case of a natural disaster, sir.
Thank you, general.
I'm well aware of federal law.
I'm also aware that when Congress passed posse comitatus nearly 130 years ago, they weren't accounting for the threat we're facing right now.
So don't question me.
Just do it.
Of course, Mr. President.
So they'll work with local law enforcement and with our Special Ops team.
Blake, could you brief your team now?
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- Mr. Vice President.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, one and all.
Please.
Thank you.
General.
- Glad you're back, sir.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It's, uh...
It's good to be back.
Thomas played me perfectly.
He knew I'd call Martinez and convince him to move the uranium.
Now he has everything he needs to power the portal.
And he's managed to completely discredit me in Martinez's eyes.
You reached out to Martinez when you didn't have to.
Maybe on some level, he knew you were telling the truth.
No, in his eyes, I'm part of the enemy.
Now there's nothing I can do to convince him otherwise.
Who has that number?
Hello?
Sophia...
I wouldn't contact you if I had a choice.
But there's something important we need to discuss.
I don't think there's anything left to talk about after what you've done.
Just hear me out, please.
You're aware of the message I sent home.
- Yes.
- Well, we got a response.
And it changes...
It changes everything.
We can't afford to be divided any longer.
Thomas, w-what are you talking about?
What was in the message?
I can't explain now.
This needs to be in person.
Do you actually think I-I'm foolish enough to accept your offer?
Not just you-- everyone.
I'm gathering all of our people.
This is something they all need to hear.
The future of our race hangs in the balance.
- I don't believe you.
- Then your people will hear what I have to tell them without you.
- Thomas--
- I'll be sending a text with the location of the meeting soon.
I hope you're there.
Mr. President...
You asked to see me?
Close the door.
What do you think you're doing here?
Eli...
Things--things have gotten worse since I left.
Don't you think it's time we put what's happened behind us?
Yeah, see, Ray...
I may not be able to keep you from walking into this building, but I can make your life a living hell once you do.
So, no, no.
I don't want to see you.
I don't want to hear you.
I don't want to get a damn whiff of you.
You understand me?
After what happened, you don't exist.
With all due respect, Mr. President, nothing has happened...
Nothing on record, anyway.
I ran on this ticket to serve my country, to do what I think are in its best interests.
And I plan to continue to do just that.
You try and stop me, and I'll be forced to expose everything you've been so carefully trying to cover up.
What'd you expect me to do, stay home, cower under my desk until our term expires?
I don't think so.
I may have to tolerate you, Ray, but trust me, you don't want to bait me.
What do you think you're doing?
You stay the hell out of my way.
Mr. President...
I'm sorry to interrupt.
But there's news about Sophia.
- Mr. President.
- At ease.
Tell me what you have.
Sophia-- or her cell phone at least.
Uh, we were able to get a location on it because she had just received a call.
Are the Marines on their way?
Yes, sir.
They're dressing as civilian law enforcement so as not to attract any unneeded attention.
Good.
So as soon as you're sure it's her, take her alive if you can.
But if you can't...
Sir.
Do you have any idea how hard it is to gain access to the Vice President, especially now, since Dempsey's tried to kill him?
Well, we'll just have to figure out a way.
Oh, okay.
Good.
Good plan.
When you see signs for a place that might have Internet, pull over.
Until then, I want to know more about Dempsey.
How much do you know about the girls he's abducted?
Like the fact that they're not human?
Then you know about the aliens.
It's the reason why he tried assassinating Martinez in the first place.
He didn't want the President releasing them.
Dempsey tried to keep the experiments on the girls a secret.
When I found out, I knew I had to leave.
I'm surprised he could do anything to offend you.
And what's that supposed to mean?
Do I have to list the things you've done since I've met you?
Kidnapping, murdering innocent people...
You think you know me, but you don't.
Well, that's my point.
You make absolutely no sense to me.
My dad left my mom when I was a kid.
I don't even remember him.
But I remember my stepdad.
He was a real...
Bastard.
He started hitting my mom from pretty much the word "go."
It went on like that until one day I had enough.
So when he started whaling on my mom,
I went to the drawer where I knew he kept his gun.
And I took it out...
And I shot him.
I-I don't know what to say.
I'm--I'm sorry.
Well, don't be, 'cause that whole sob story...
I made it up.
There's no reason I am the way I am, Walker.
I just came out this way.
Come.
I hope I'm not disturbing you again.
Depends.
Any word on Sophia?
No.
Not yet.
But, uh...
That's not why I'm here.
We haven't had much time to talk since I got back from Inostranka.
I wanted to check in, see how you're doing.
Stop beating around the bush, Blake.
You saw me confronting Ray, and you're worried that I'm...
I'm losing it.
To put it bluntly, yes.
But it's not just that.
Your decision to suspend posse comitatus...
That's not like you.
Um, that's exactly the point.
I'm not sure that I follow.
Well, Sophia and her people have been locked up at Inostranka for 66 years...
Until I tried playing the great emancipator.
Now, we all know how that worked out.
Elias, you can't blame yourself for everything that's--
It's the truth.
Let's not sugarcoat it.
Now, if I'm gonna fix the mess I've gotten us into, then I need to change-- me.
Don't interrupt me again until you have something on Sophia.
Yes, Mr. President.
So what am I supposed to do when you die?
Excuse me?
Well, you're not getting out of this thing alive, which means eventually my family's information gets released.
And it's not just you that dies.
It's my mother and my son too.
I guess you better figure out a way to keep me alive, then.
I think I found something.
- What is it?
- It's an article online.
It says, uh, Jarvis is back to work at the White House today.
If you think I'm getting us into the White House, you're crazy.
No, but it also says that he's attending a party fund-raiser later tonight.
Where?
Uh, the Ambassador Hotel, downtown Washington.
Can you hack the guest list?
Oh, come on, that's got to be nothing compared to hacking the Pentagon mainframe as a sophomore in high school.
I... was a junior, but how did you know that?
You were my target once, remember?
I don't do any job without doing my research first.
Even if I add our names or our aliases for that matter, there's no way we'll ever be vetted to get in.
That's why we're gonna find people who've already been vetted for us.
Ted, what time does the fund-raiser start?
The money we paid-- I don't want to be late.
7:30.
Gonna need to get there a little early, too, to get through that security screening.
Have you seen my cuff links?
Did you check your jacket pocket?
Got them.
Did you call down for something?
No.
Hi.
I-I think you have the wrong room.
Oh, no, no, no.
I locked myself out of my room.
I'm so sorry to bother you.
I was just wondering if-- if it's at all possible,
I could use your phone for a quick second to call down to the lobby?
Of course.
Of course.
Come on in.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Down on your knees.
Just don't hurt us.
You cooperate, and we won't have to.
- Their invitations and I.D.s?
- They're on the couch.
Here.
Remember, make sure you get a clear impression.
Any flaws, and we're not getting past security.
Status?
Here.
All right, pack it up.
Jarvis knows what I look like, so I still have to change my appearance.
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?
Wait, wait.
They're innocent.
They saw our faces.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
You're not doing this.
What do you think the message is?
I don't know.
But I think we owe it to ourselves to go to this meeting and see what Thomas has to say for himself.
I don't trust Thomas, and neither should you.
Well, listen, whether you do or not, the fact of the matter is,
Thomas is gaining more and more power.
I don't want this any more than you do, but...
What is it?
It's a text with the location of the meeting.
Where is it?
It's in Los Angeles.
I'm gonna go, okay?
You don't have to.
Leila and Samantha shouldn't be alone anyway, all right?
- Be careful.
- Of course.
Okay.
- I just got the text.
- So have many others.
Thomas has everyone worried about what the message might be.
The few I've talked to will go to the meeting.
Thomas' Agent did intercept a return message.
He murdered his partner in order to make sure it stayed a secret.
Then I have to go.
I don't have a choice.
Our people are starting to be swayed by him.
It doesn't matter what the message is.
I can't give Thomas the opportunity to solidify his power over them.
He already tried to kill you once.
He won't try that again...
Not there.
He can't risk turning too many of our people against him.
Michael, I'm not gonna force you to come with me.
But I'm going.
I have to.
Then so am I.
Good, good.
General Armbruster, you have permission to proceed.
Take her down.
Sir.
Just a moment, sir.
What is it?
Is there a problem?
We've just intercepted an SMS communication sent to Sophia.
It's part of a communication blast.
It went out to over 200 other phones.
What's it say?
It's too heavily encrypted.
There's no way to know.
Target is on the move.
She's with Michael Buchanan.
The pilot.
He must be one of them too.
What's he up to with Sophia?
We'll find out when we take him down.
Prepare to go on my command.
She's holed up all day...
Waiting for something.
She receives a text message, and then she goes.
Mr. President?
It's not just a coincidence.
She left because of it.
How many other people did you say received that text message?
Just over 200.
Let me see.
So this message...
Could be instructions or...
Or a location.
They could be meeting.
Tell your men to back off.
Mr. President, what are you doing?
Do it, now.
All teams, pull back.
Pull back immediately.
This is your chance.
You said it yourself-- we can't let Sophia get away again.
And we won't.
General, follow her.
Don't let her out of your sight, not even for a second.
I don't want just Sophia.
This is our chance to get them all.
Thank you, sir.
Personal items in the tray, please.
- Stop it.
- What?
Stop looking so nervous.
We want them to think we belong here.
Thank you.
Invitations and I.D.s, please.
Personal items in the tray, please.
I'll take that.
Mrs. Fisk, right thumb on the scanner, please.
Have a great evening.
Mr. Fisk, please.
Is there a problem?
Again, Mr. Fisk.
Thank you, Mr. Fisk.
Absolutely.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
♪ ♪
There he is.
You ready?
Yeah.
You better be.
Hi.
Oh, it's good to see you.
Thank you so much for coming.
- So wonderful to see you well.
- Thank you.
Thanks again, thanks again for coming.
All the best.
Thank you.
Mr. Vice President, Ted Fisk.
This is a big honor.
Oh, Ted.
It's my honor as well.
And thank you for your support.
Oh, no--no-- no problem.
Um...
This is my wife.
Oh.
We've met.
You do anything to signal the Secret Service, and I pull the trigger.
You'll be dead before you get out a word.
You might want to smile and--and laugh like she just said something charming.
So...
So it's nice to have you here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Uh, now you're gonna tell your detail leader that you need a minute alone.
Do it.
Do it.
J.R....
I'm just going to need a moment with my friends.
- Yes, sir.
- Right this way.
After you, sir.
Apostle is headed into a secured room.
Keep your posts.
What are you doing here?
What do you want?
Ask him.
You're gonna help me take down James Dempsey.
James Dempsey...
Why are you asking me about him?
Don't--don't waste my time.
I know everything-- that you helped Dempsey try to assassinate the President.
Oh, no, no, it wasn't that simple.
Okay, I don't care.
I don't care.
I just want the proof that will put him away.
The last time I came forward against Dempsey he almost killed me.
And now he's threatening my wife and children if I talk, besides which I have-- I don't have any proof, any actual proof.
It's only my word against his.
There has to be something.
There isn't.
Don't you understand?
There isn't anything you or anyone else can do!
Hey!
Keep your voice down.
Hello?
Is everything okay?
Oh, my God!
What happened?
Who did this to you?
Call 911, please.
Tell them the vice President's in danger.
You've got to know something that we can use against him.
I told you, there isn't.
Well, then at least tell us where he is.
I told you, I don't know.
And how much longer do you think it'll be before they come looking for me?
He's right.
We don't have much time.
Give me the gun.
My name is Sean Walker.
And the monster that you're protecting has hurt and killed who knows how many people.
He's framed me for murder.
Because of him, I've lost everything and everyone that I care about.
So right now I have nothing to lose.
So you're gonna give me something that will help take Dempsey down, or I will put a bullet in your head.
You understand?
Do you?
Huh?
All right.
Okay.
All right.
- What?
- He's left the country.
Uh-huh.
Go on.
He--he left for France this morning.
That's it--France?
Somewhere in the Jura Mountains.
That's all I know.
I swear.
A call just came in.
We have a security breach.
Harden up around the V.P. now.
We've got a potential imminent threat against Apostle.
What's he doing there?
I don't know.
Please, leave me.
Mr. Vice President.
Open the door, sir.
We need to go...
Now!
He's not responding.
Stand back.
Mr. Vice President, are you all right?
Yeah, they're getting away-- that way!
Sophia arrived at Union Station 20 minutes ago.
Do we have even a guess as to where she could be headed?
No, I'm afraid not.
There's no indication she knows she's being followed.
So whatever's going on, she should lead us right to it.
Sophia is here.
She's reached her destination.
- What do we know about it?
- St. Andrew's Cathedral-- it's been vacant for years.
According to the record, it was bought by a developer six months ago.
All right, I want to know who, and I want schematics on it and every other building within ten city blocks right away.
Yes, sir.
- Devon.
- Carlos.
- It's good to see you.
- You too.
It's been a long time.
Can we tell how many people are in it?
Just a few moments, Mr. President.
Splitting satellite feed to infrared.
I'm picking up about 200 heat signatures.
You were right.
They're meeting.
Move your men into position, General.
This is your new target.
Hello, Thomas.
Mother...
I'm glad you came.
You too, Michael.
I'd like to speak to you about this privately first.
No.
No more secrets.
We should get started.
Alpha team, how long before you're in position?
- Good news, Mr. President.
- What is it?
This is archival footage from a closed-circuit camera outside the church.
I don't understand.
What am I looking at?
That man there...
That's Thomas.
He's inside the church right now.
You all know my mother and I have had our differences.
Well, the reason why I brought you today is to tell you that we can't afford to be at odds with each other any longer.
The message I recently sent home has been answered.
And the response is not one that any of us will want to hear.
We've all known for some time that our planet's days were numbered.
Unfortunately, our calculations were wrong.
According to the message I received, our Sun has started going supernova.
I know this is much, much sooner than we'd anticipated.
But it is happening.
The first wave of lethal gamma rays will reach our solar system in the next two weeks.
In less than a year, our planet will be uninhabitable.
And if we don't migrate, our civilization will cease to exist.
My plan to bring thousands of our people here is now obsolete.
I have visual.
One guard at church entrance.
Roger that.
The only choice we have now is to bring everyone here...
To make this place our home.
This planet is the only chance we have of survival.
And we're gonna seize it before it's too late.
- We have a big problem.
- What is it?
Thomas, what's going on?
Where are you going?
The government's here.
Go, go, go!
-- sync, corrected by elderman --
Previously on The Event.
What do you want?
Dempsey played us both.
You need to tell him how he was behind trying to kill the President.
I was manipulated by a very powerful man.
Who is it?
It was...
You're going to give me the name, or I'II make sure you pay for it.
I'm the Vice President and that's the way it's going to stay.
The boy, what's his name?
Sean Walker.
I have a feeling that this Mr. Walker and I will cross paths again.
These people tried to have the President killed.
Don't you want to stop them?
You can't run away, little guy.
This is Samantha.
Come in.
My daughter Leila.
This is Mr. Geller.
MICHAEL:
You and Sam will be safe here.
Once we use the portal to bring our people here, then we will own it all.
Sophia, you have to stop him.
I don't know where he is.
I trusted you.
And once again, it was all lies.
No, it's not what I intended.
We broke through the encryption.
She's somewhere in San Francisco.
I want her.
Mr. President, in the past, you've always taken the use of force off the table.
She has played me for a fool for the Iast time.
May God rest her soul.
Sir, it's a communications satellite.
They're sending a message home.
(MIMICS EXPLOSION)
Oh, no.
(SIGNAL BUZZING)
The spikes are concentrated at the same frequencies.
What do you think?
Could be radiation from those stellar flares AItair has been throwing.
With that level of intensity and regularity?
No.
No.
That's not AItair talking.
Look.
See?
There's a pattern, and it is aimed right at us.
This is some kind of message.
We have to call the NSA right now.
This is exactly the kind of anomaly they asked us to look out for.
slow down.
Before we start ringing alarms,
let's check if it matches an elliptical orbit first.
Chances are it's nothing.
AII right, all right.
You reposition the telescopes to the frequency, and I'II punch up Nova.
Come on.
Show me!
Show me!
Show me!
It's a message.
I was right.
(GUN FIRES)
Yes, you were.
Careful!
You drop these rods, you could irradiate this entire airfield.
Thomas, it's Anthony.
He says it's urgent.
What is it?
We received a response to the message you sent home.
So what does it say?
Anthony!
It's complicated.
What does it say?
AII right.
Copy all the data we need, and wipe everything clean, and get out of there.
The government can't know about the message.
What is it?
Something terrible's happened back home.
The girl in the purple sweater.
MATRON:
You're sure?
Oh, yes.
She's one of the special ones.
I'II be leaving for the airport in...
Well, pretty soon.
I'd Iike her in our possession by the time I get back.
Of course, Dr. Dempsey.
I'II make sure that we have some of the extract waiting for you.
Oh, good, yes.
It's important I stay in good health.
Now more than ever, so that I can see this through.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Is that for catching butterflies?
For turtles.
They live in the pond.
I bet there are a Iot of turtles in there that would Iike to come home with you.
Really?
Sure.
Everything has to leave home sometime.
Walker.
I'm not here to kill you, so don't overreact and try something stupid because I will shoot you.
Back up.
What do you want?
I want to know who you've been working for, the people behind everything.
They need to be stopped, and you're gonna help me stop them.
You made a big mistake coming here.
How did you find me?
You were careful covering up your tracks, but your mother wasn't.
She used her old cell phone the Iast time she called you here, so, once I had that, tracking down where you were was easy.
Nice work.
Now put down the gun before I take it from you and make you sorry.
You're going to help me take down the people you work for, because you might not care about the things they've done, but I do.
And somebody has to stop them.
Quit fooling yourself.
Back up.
You're a kid, not a man.
Stop.
They've taken everything from me, and I'm not going to run from them any longer.
So let's start with names.
Who are they?
Or what?
You're going to shoot me?
I think I'II take my chances.
Because what you're talking about trying to do is suicide.
Well, it's not your own life you need to be worried about.
What are you talking about?
I know your mom is still taking care ofyour son.
Their location will go viral on the Internet unless you give me those names.
And I guarantee it will make its way into the wrong hands.
You're lying.
The virus is controlled by a code
I enter into my phone every two hours.
So if I'm not alive to enter it, your family's address gets released.
So the names.
Who am I looking for?
There's only one.
James Dempsey.
He's a billionaire and one of the most powerful men in the country.
But knowing who he is isn't going to do you any good.
Why not?
Because I already tried taking him down and couldn't.
Since then, Dempsey's vanished.
Nobody even knows where he is.
You really tried to stop him?
How?
By using the Vice President.
He and Dempsey were in bed together on the assassination attempt of President Martinez.
Vice President Jarvis was part of the conspiracy?
I tried convincing him to go public.
And if he can't stand up to Dempsey, what chance do you think you have?
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.
And ifyou care about your family, you're going to help me.
We know the sleepers are now in possession of the uranium rods, which, if our intel is correct, puts them one step closer to accomplishing their goal, bringing more of them here.
Now, I take full responsibility for what has happened.
But make no mistake, the consequences of that, an invasion, falls on all of us.
Which means from now forward there can be no more mistakes.
From me, or any of you.
The stakes are simply too high.
We must stop Thomas and Sophia before it's too late.
Now, I want an update on Sophia.
Where are we on narrowing her location in San Francisco?
We are still waiting for her phone to be activated again.
As soon as she makes or receives another call, we'II be able to pinpoint where she is.
In the meantime, we've mobilized a Direct Action Unit consisting of Special Ops Forces supported by every local law enforcement agency.
ELIAS:
Local law enforcement?
No, no, no.
We've had Sophia escape from under our noses before.
I won't let that happen again.
No more mistakes.
I want the best on this.
General, who are the best men you have stationed in the vicinity?
The Marine 4th Force Reconnaissance Company out of alameda, sir.
Good.
Prepare to deploy them.
They should provide adequate support.
You know that I cannot do that, sir.
The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of United States military forces on U.S. soil except for the case of a natural disaster, sir.
Thank you, General, I'm well aware of federal law.
I'm also aware that when Congress passed Posse Comitatus, nearly 130 years ago, they weren't accounting for the threat we're facing right now.
So don't question me.
Just do it.
GENERAL:
Of course, Mr. President.
ELIAS:
So they'II work with local law enforcement and with our Special Ops team.
ELIAS:
blake, could you brief the team now...
I'm sorry to interrupt.
WHITE HOUSE TECH:
Mr. Vice President.
(GROUP APPLAUDS)
WHITE HOUSE TECH:
Welcome back.
RAYMOND:
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, one and all.
RAYMOND:
please.
Thank you.
General.
glad you're back, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It's good to be back.
Thomas played me perfectly.
He knew I'd call Martinez and convince him to move the uranium.
Now he has everything he needs to power the portal, and he's managed to completely discredit me in Martinez's eyes.
You reached out to Martinez when you didn't have to.
Maybe on some level he knew you were telling the truth.
No.
In his eyes, I'm part of the enemy now.
There's nothing I can do to convince him otherwise.
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)
Who has that number?
Hello?
THOMAS:
Sophia.
I wouldn't contact you if I had a choice.
But there's something important we need to discuss.
I don't think there's anything left to talk about after what you've done.
Just hear me out.
please.
You're aware of the message I sent home?
Yes.
Well, we got a response.
And it changes...
It changes everything.
We can't afford to be divided any longer.
Thomas, what are you talking about?
What was in the message?
I can't explain now.
This needs to be in person.
Do you actually think I'm foolish enough to accept your offer?
Not just you.
Everyone.
I'm gathering all of our people.
This is something they all need to hear.
The future of our race hangs in the balance.
I don't believe you.
Then your people will hear what I have to tell them without you.
Thomas...
I'll be sending a text with the location of the meeting soon.
I hope you're there.
RAYMOND:
Mr. President.
You asked to see me?
close the door.
What do you think you're doing here?
EIi, things...
Things have gotten worse since I Ieft.
Don't you think it's time we put what's happened behind us?
Yeah.
See, Ray,
I may not be able to keep you from walking into this building, but I can make your life a living hell once you do.
So, no, no.
I don't want to see you, I don't want to hear you,
I don't want to get a damn whiff of you.
Do you understand me?
After what happened, you don't exist.
In all due respect, Mr. President, nothing has happened.
Nothing on record, anyway.
I ran on this ticket to serve my country, to do what I think are in its best interests, and I plan to continue to do just that.
You try and stop me, and I'II be forced to expose everything you've been so carefully trying to cover up.
What'd you expect me to do?
Stay home?
Cower under my desk until our term expires?
I don't think so.
I may have to tolerate you, Ray, but trust me, you don't want to bait me.
What do you think you're doing?
You stay the hell out of my way.
Mr. President,
I'm sorry to interrupt.
But there's news about Sophia.
Mr. President.
At ease.
Tell me what you have.
Sophia, or her cell phone at Ieast.
We were able to get a location on it because she just received a call.
ELIAS:
Are the Marines on their way?
Yes, sir.
They're dressing as civilian law enforcement, so as not to attract any unneeded attention.
Good.
So, as soon as you're sure it's her, take her alive if you can.
But if you can't...
Yes, sir.
Do you have any idea how hard it is to gain access to the Vice President?
Especially now, since Dempsey tried to kill him?
Well, we'II just have to figure out a way.
Oh, okay.
Good.
Good plan.
When you see signs for a place that might have Internet, pull over.
Until then, I want to know more about Dempsey.
How much do you know about the girls he's abducted?
Like the fact that they're not human?
Then you know?
About the aliens?
It's the reason why he tried assassinating Martinez in the first place.
He didn't want the President releasing them.
Dempsey tried to keep the experiments on the girls a secret.
When I found out, I knew I had to leave.
I'm surprised he could do anything to offend you.
What's that supposed to mean?
Do I have to list the things you've done since I met you?
Kidnapping, murdering innocent people.
You think you know me, but you don't.
That's my point.
You make absolutely no sense to me.
My dad left my mom when I was a kid.
I don't even remember him.
But I remember my stepdad.
He was a real bastard.
Started hitting my mom from pretty much the word go.
It went on like that, until one day, I had enough.
So when he started wailing on my mom,
I went into the drawer where I knew he kept his gun, and I took it out,
and I shot him.
I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry.
Well, don't be.
Because that whole sob story?
I made it up.
(LAUGHS)
There's no reason I am the way I am, Walker.
I just came out this way.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR) Come.
I hope I'm not disturbing you again.
Depends.
Any word on Sophia?
No.
Not yet.
But that's not why I'm here.
We haven't had much time to talk since I got back from Inostranka.
I wanted to check in to see how you're doing.
Stop beating around the bush, blake.
You saw me confronting Ray, and you're worried that I'm...
I'm losing it.
To put it bluntly, yes.
But it's not just that.
Your decision to suspend Posse Comitatus, that's not Iike you.
That's exactly the point.
I'm not sure that I follow.
Well, Sophia and her people have been locked up in Inostranka for 66 years until I tried playing the great emancipator.
And we all know how that worked out.
EIias, you can't blame yourself for everything that's happened...
It's the truth.
Let's not sugar-coat it.
Now, if I'm going to fix the mess I've gotten us into, then I need to change me.
Don't interrupt me again until you have something on Sophia.
Yes, Mr. President.
So what am I supposed to do when you die?
Excuse me?
Well, you're not getting out of this thing alive, which means, eventually, my family's information gets released.
And it's not just you that dies, it's my mother and my son, too.
I guess you better figure out a way to keep me alive, then.
I think I found something.
What is it?
It's an article online.
It says Jarvis is back to work at the White House today.
Ifyou think I'm getting us into White House, you're crazy.
No.
But it also says that he's attending a party fundraiser later tonight.
Where?
The Ambassador Hotel, downtown Washington.
Can you hack the guest list?
Come on, that's got to be nothing compared to hacking the Pentagon mainframe as a sophomore in high school.
I was a junior.
But how did you know that?
You were my target once, remember?
I don't do any job without doing my research first.
Even if I add our names or aliases, for that matter, there's no way we'II ever be vetted to get in.
That's why we're going to find people who've already been vetted for us.
Ted?
What time does the fundraiser start?
With the money we paid, I don't want to be late.
7:30.
We need to get there a Iittle early to get through that security screening.
Have you seen my cuff links?
Did you check your jacket pocket?
Got them.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Did you call down for something?
No.
Hi.
I think you have the wrong room.
Oh, no, no, no.
I locked myself out of my room.
I'm so sorry to bother you.
I was just wondering if, if it's at all possible, I could use your phone for a quick second to call down to the lobby?
Of course.
Of course.
Come on in.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Down on your knees.
Do it.
Just don't hurt us.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Just cooperate, and we won't have to.
Their invitations and IDs?
On the couch.
Here.
Remember, make sure you get a clear impression.
Any flaws and we're not getting past security.
(WHIMPERING)
Status?
Here.
AII right.
Pack it up.
Jarvis knows what I Iook like, so I still have to change my appearance.
What are you doing?
What do you think I'm doing?
Wait, wait, wait.
They're innocent.
They saw our faces.
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
You're not doing this.
(WHIMPERING)
What do you think the message is?
I don't know.
CARLOS:
But I think we owe it to ourselves to go to this meeting, and see what Thomas has to say for himself.
DIANE:
I don't trust Thomas.
And neither should you.
Well, listen, whether you do or not, fact of the matter is
Thomas is gaining more and more power.
I don't want this anymore than you do, but... (CELL PHONE BUZZING)
DIANE:
What is it?
It's a text with the location of the meeting.
Where is it?
Look, it's Los Angeles.
I'm going to go, okay?
You don't have to.
Leila and Samantha shouldn't be alone anyway, right?
Be careful.
Of course.
Okay.
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)
I just got the text.
So have many others.
Thomas has everyone worried about what the message might be.
The few I've talked to will go to the meeting.
Thomas' agent did intercept a return message.
Murdered his partner in order to make sure it stayed a secret.
Then I have to go.
I don't have a choice.
Our people are starting to be swayed by him.
It doesn't matter what the message is.
I can't give Thomas the opportunity to solidify his power over them.
He already tried to kill you once.
He won't try that again.
Not there.
He can't risk turning too many of our people against him.
Michael, I'm not going to force you to come with me.
But I'm going, I have to.
Then so am I.
Good.
Good.
General Armbruster, you have permission to proceed.
Take her down.
Sir.
BLAKE:
Just a moment, sir.
ELIAS:
What is it?
Is there a problem?
We just intercepted an SMS communication sent to Sophia.
It's part of a communication blast.
It went out to over 200 other phones.
What's it say?
It's too heavily encrypted.
There's no way to know.
Target is on the move.
She's with Michael Buchanan.
The pilot.
He must be one of them, too.
What's he up to with Sophia?
We'II find out when we take them down.
Prepare to go on my command.
She's holed up all day waiting for something.
She receives a text message and then she goes.
Mr. President?
Well, it's not just a coincidence, she left because of it.
How many other people did you say received that text message?
Just over 200.
Let me see.
So this message could be instructions
or a location.
They could be meeting.
Tell your men to back off.
Mr. President?
What are you doing?
Do it.
Now.
GENERAL:
AII teams pull back.
Pull back immediately.
This is your chance.
You said it yourself, we can't let Sophia get away again.
And we won't.
General, follow her.
Don't let her out of your sight.
Not even for a second.
I don't want just Sophia.
This is our chance to get them all.
Personal items in the tray, please.
Stop it.
What?
Stop looking so nervous.
We want them to think we belong here.
Invitations and IDs, please.
Yes.
Personal items in the tray, please.
Mrs. Fisk, right thumb on the scanner, please.
Have a great evening.
Mr. Fisk, please.
Is there a problem?
Again, Mr. Fisk.
Thank you, Mr. Fisk.
Absolutely.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
SEAN:
There he is.
You're ready?
Yeah.
You better be.
Hi.
It's good to see you.
Thank you so much for coming.
It's so wonderful to see you're well.
Thank you.
Thanks again.
Thanks again for coming.
AII the best.
Mr. Vice President?
Ted Fisk.
This is a big honor.
Ted, it's my honor as well.
And thank you for your support.
No problem.
This is my wife.
Oh, we've met.
You do anything to signal the Secret Service, and I pull the trigger.
You'II be dead before you get out a word.
You might wanna smile and laugh,
like she just said something charming.
So, it's nice to have you here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now you're going to tell your detail leader that you need a minute alone.
Do it.
J.R., I'm just gonna need a moment with my friends.
Yes, sir.
Right this way.
After you, sir.
Apostle is headed into a secured room.
Keep your posts.
(BANGING ON DOOR)
What are you doing here?
What do you want?
Ask him.
You're gonna help me take down James Dempsey.
James Dempsey?
Why are you asking me about him?
Don't waste my time.
I know everything.
That you helped Dempsey try to assassinate the President.
No, no.
It wasn't that simple...
Okay.
I don't care.
I don't care.
I just want the proof that will put him away.
The last time I came forward against Dempsey, he almost killed me.
And now he's threatening my wife and children if I talk.
Besides which, I don't have any proof, any actual proof.
It's only my word against his.
There has to be something.
There isn't.
Don't you understand?
There isn't anything you or anyone else can do.
Hey, keep your voice down.
(BANGING ON DOOR)
MAID:
Hello?
Is everything okay?
(TED GRUNTING)
Oh, my God.
What happened?
(EXCLAIMING)
Who did this to you?
Call 911.
please.
Tell them the Vice President's in danger.
You got to know something that we can use against him.
I told you, there isn't.
Then at Ieast tell us where he is.
I told you I don't know.
And how much longer do you think it will be before they come looking for me?
He's right.
We don't have much time.
Give me the gun.
My name is Sean Walker.
And the monster that you're protecting has hurt and killed who knows how many people.
He's framed me for murder.
Because of him, I've lost everything and everyone that I care about.
So right now, I have nothing to lose.
So, you're going to give me something that will help take Dempsey down, or I will put a bullet in your head, do you understand?
Do you?
Okay!
AII right.
What?
He just left the country.
Go on.
He left for France this morning.
That's it, France?
Somewhere in the Jura Mountains.
That's all I know.
I swear!
A call just came in.
We have a security breach.
Harden up around the VP now.
We've got a potential imminent threat against Apostle.
What's he doing there?
I don't know.
please, leave me.
AGENT: (KNOCKING) Mr. Vice President, open the door, sir!
VICKY:
We need to go.
Now!
He's not responding.
Stand back.
Mr. Vice President, are you all right?
They're getting away!
That way!
(AGENTS SHOUTING)
BLAKE:
Sophia arrived at Union Station 20 minutes ago.
Do we have even a guess as to where she could be headed?
No, I'm afraid not.
But there's no indication she knows she's being followed.
So whatever's going on, she should lead us right to it.
Sophia is here.
She's reached her destination.
What do we know about it?
WHITE HOUSE TECH:
St. Andrew's Cathedral.
It's been vacant for years.
According to the record, it was bought by a developer six months ago.
AII right.
I want to know who.
And I want schematics on it and every other building within 10 city blocks right away.
Yes, sir.
Devon.
Carlos.
Hey, man, it's good to see you.
You, too.
It's been a Iong time.
Can we tell how many people are in it?
Just a few moments, Mr. President.
Splitting satellite feed to infrared.
I'm picking up about 200 heat signatures.
You were right.
They're meeting.
Move your men into position, General.
This is your new target.
Hello, Thomas.
Mother.
I'm glad you came.
You, too, Michael.
I'd Iike to speak to you about this privately first.
No.
No more secrets.
We should get started.
alpha Team?
How long before you're in position?
Good news, Mr. President.
What is it?
This archival footage from a closed-circuit camera outside the church...
I don't understand.
What am I looking at?
That man, there?
That's Thomas.
He's inside the church right now.
You all know my mother and I have had our differences.
Well, the reason why I brought you today is to tell you that we can't afford to be at odds with each other any longer.
The message I recently sent home has been answered.
And the response is not one any of us will want to hear.
We've all known for some time that our planet's days were numbered.
Unfortunately, our calculations were wrong.
According to the message I received, our sun has started going supernova.
(CROWD MURMURS)
I know this is much, much sooner than we'd anticipated.
But it is happening.
The first wave of lethal gamma rays will reach our solar system in the next two weeks.
In less than a year, our planet will be uninhabitable.
And if we don't migrate, our civilization will cease to exist.
My plan to bring thousands of our people here is now obsolete.
I have visual.
One guard at church entrance.
Roger that.
The only choice we have now is to bring everyone here, to make this place our home.
This planet is the only chance we have of survival, and we're going to seize it before it's too late.
We have a big problem.
What is it?
Thomas, what's going on?
Where are you going?
The government's here.
AGENT:
Go!
Go!
Go!
Previously on The Event
What do you want?
Dempesy played us both.
You need to tell him how how he was behind trying to kill the President.
I was manipulated by a very powerful man.
- Who is it?
- It was...
You're gonna give me the name, or I will make sure you pay for it.
I am the Vice President, and that's the way it's going to stay.
- The boy, what's his name?
- Sean Walker.
I have a feeling that this Mr. Walker and I will cross paths again.
These people are trying to have the President killed.
Don't you want to stop them?
You can't run away, little guy.
- This is Samantha...
- Come in.
And my daughter Leila.
This is Mr. Geller.
You and Sam will be safe here.
Once we use the portal to bring our people here, then we will own it all.
Sophia, you have to stop him.
- I don't know where he is.
- I trusted you.
And once again, it was all lies.
No.
That's not what I intended.
We broke through the encryption.
She's somewhere in San Francisco.
- I want her.
- Mr. President, in the past, you've always taken the use of force off the table.
She has played me for a fool for the last time.
May God rest her soul.
Sir, it's a communication satellite.
They're sending a message home.
Oh, no.
Spikes are concentrated at the same frequencies.
What do you think?
Could be radiation from those stellar flares altair has been throwing.
At that level of intensity and regularity?
No, no.
Oh, that's not altair talking.
Look, see, there's a pattern.
And it is aimed right at us.
This is some kind of message.
We have to call the NSA right now.
This is exactly the kind of anomaly they asked us to look out for.
Slow down.
Before we start ringing alarms, let's check if it matches an elliptical orbit first.
- Chances are, it's nothing.
- All right, all right.
You reposition the telescopes to the frequency, and I'll punch up Nova.
Come on.
It's a message.
I was right.
Yes, you were.
Careful.
You drop these rods, you could irradiate this entire airfield.
Thomas, it's Anthony.
He says it's urgent.
What is it?
We received a response to the message you sent home.
So what does it say?
Anthony?
It's complicated.
What does it say?
All right.
Copy all the data we need and wipe everything clean and get out of there.
The government can't know about the message.
What is it?
Something terrible has happened back home.
The girl in the purple sweater.
- You sure?
- Oh, yes.
She's one of the special ones.
I'll be leaving for the airport in, uh...
Well, pretty soon.
I'd like her in our possession by the time I get back.
Of course, Dr. Dempsey.
I'll make sure that we have some of the extract waiting for you.
Oh, good.
Yes.
It's important I stay in good health...
Now more than ever so that I can, um...
See this through.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Is that for catching butterflies?
For turtles.
They live in the pond.
I bet there are a lot of turtles in there that would like to come home with you.
- Really?
- Sure.
Everything has to leave home sometime.
Walker.
I'm not here to kill you, so don't overreact and try something stupid, because I will shoot you.
Back up.
What do you want?
I want to know who you've been working for...
People behind everything.
They need to be stopped.
And you're gonna help me stop them.
You made a big mistake coming here.
How did you find me?
You were careful covering up your tracks, but your mother wasn't.
She used her old cell phone the last time she called you here.
So once I had that, tracking down where you were was easy.
Nice work.
Now put down the gun before I take it from you and make you sorry.
You're gonna help me take down the people you work for, because you might not care about the things they've done, but I do, and somebody has to stop them.
- Quit fooling yourself.
- Back up.
- You're a kid, not a man.
- Stop.
They've taken everything from me, and I'm not gonna run from them any longer.
So let's start with the names.
Who are they?
Or what, you're gonna shoot me?
I think I'll take my chances, because what you're talking about trying to do is suicide.
Well, it's not your own life you need to be worried about.
What are you talking about?
I know your mom is still taking care of your son.
And their location will go viral on the Internet unless you give me those names.
And I guarantee it'll make its way into the wrong hands.
You're lying.
The virus is controlled by a code
I enter into my phone every two hours.
So if I'm not alive to enter it...
Your family's address gets released.
So the names...
Who am I looking for?
There's only one...
James Dempsey.
He's a billionaire and one of the most powerful men in the country.
But knowing who he is isn't gonna do you any good.
Why not?
Because I already tried taking him down and couldn't.
Since then, Dempsey's vanished.
Nobody even knows where he is.
And you really tried to stop him?
How?
By using the Vice President.
He and Dempsey were in bed together on the assassination attempt of President Martinez.
Vice President Jarvis is part of the conspiracy?
Yeah.
I tried convincing him to go public.
And if he can't stand up to Dempsey, what chance do you think you have?
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
And if you care about your family, you're gonna help me.
We know the sleepers are now in possession of the uranium rods, which, if our intel is correct, puts them one step closer to accomplishing their goal...
Bringing more of them here.
Now, I take full responsibility for what has happened.
But make no mistake...
The consequences of that, an invasion, falls on all of us, which means, from now forward, there can be no more mistakes, from me or any of you.
The stakes are simply too high.
We must stop Thomas and Sophia before it's too late.
Now, I want an update on Sophia.
Where are we on narrowing her location in San Francisco?
We are still waiting for her phone to be activated again.
As soon as she makes or receives another call, we'll be able to pinpoint where she is.
In the meantime, we've mobilized a direct action unit, consisting of special ops forces supported by every local law enforcement agency.
Local law enforcement?
No, no, no.
We've had Sophia escape from under our noses before.
I won't let that happen again.
No more mistakes...
I want the best on this.
General, who are the best men you have stationed in the vicinity?
The marine fourth force reconnaissance company
- out of Alameda, sir.
- Good.
Prepare to deploy them.
They should provide adequate support.
Now, you know that I cannot do that, sir.
The posse comitatus act prohibits the use of United States military forces on U.S. soil except for the case of a natural disaster, sir.
Thank you, general.
I'm well aware of federal law.
I'm also aware that when congress passed posse comitatus nearly 130 years ago, they weren't accounting for the threat we're facing right now.
So don't question me.
Just do it.
Of course, Mr. President.
So they'll work with local law enforcement and with our special ops team.
Blake, could you brief your team now?
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- Mr. Vice President.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, one and all.
Please.
Thank you.
General.
- Glad you're back, sir.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It's, uh...
It's good to be back.
Thomas played me perfectly.
He knew I'd call Martinez and convince him to move the uranium.
Now he has everything he needs to power the portal.
And he's managed to completely discredit me in Martinez's eyes.
You reached out to Martinez when you didn't have to.
Maybe on some level, he knew you were telling the truth.
No, in his eyes, I'm part of the enemy.
Now there's nothing I can do to convince him otherwise.
Who has that number?
Hello?
Sophia...
I wouldn't contact you if I had a choice.
But there's something important we need to discuss.
I don't think there's anything left to talk about
- after what you've done.
- Just hear me out, please.
You're aware of the message I sent home.
- Yes.
- Well, we got a response.
And it changes...
It changes everything.
We can't afford to be divided any longer.
Thomas, w-what are you talking about?
What was in the message?
I can't explain now.
This needs to be in person.
Do you actually think I-I'm foolish enough to accept your offer?
Not just you...
Everyone.
I'm gathering all of our people.
This is something they all need to hear.
The future of our race hangs in the balance.
- I don't believe you.
- Then your people will hear what I have to tell them without you.
- Thomas...
- I'll be sending a text with the location of the meeting soon.
I hope you're there.
Mr. President...
- You asked to see me?
- Close the door.
What do you think you're doing here?
Eli...
Things... things have gotten worse since I left.
Don't you think it's time we put what's happened behind us?
Yeah, see, ray...
I may not be able to keep you from walking into this building, but I can make your life a living hell once you do.
So, no, no.
I don't want to see you.
I don't want to hear you.
I don't want to get a damn whiff of you.
You understand me?
After what happened, you don't exist.
With all due respect, Mr. President, nothing has happened...
Nothing on record, anyway.
I ran on this ticket to serve my country, to do what I think are in its best interests.
And I plan to continue to do just that.
You try and stop me, and I'll be forced to expose everything you've been so carefully trying to cover up.
What'd you expect me to do, stay home, cower under my desk until our term expires?
I don't think so.
I may have to tolerate you, ray, but trust me, you don't want to bait me.
What do you think you're doing?
You stay the hell out of my way.
Mr. President...
I'm sorry to interrupt.
But there's news about Sophia.
- Mr. President.
- At ease.
Tell me what you have.
Sophia...
Or her cell phone at least.
Uh, we were able to get a location on it because she had just received a call.
Are the marines on their way?
Yes, sir.
They're dressing as civilian law enforcement so as not to attract any unneeded attention.
Good.
So as soon as you're sure it's her, take her alive if you can.
But if you can't...
Sir.
Do you have any idea how hard it is to gain access to the Vice President, especially now, since Dempsey's tried to kill him?
Well, we'll just have to figure out a way.
Oh, okay.
Good.
Good plan.
When you see signs for a place that might have Internet, pull over.
Until then, I want to know more about Dempsey.
How much do you know about the girls he's abducted?
Like the fact that they're not human?
Then you know about the aliens.
It's the reason why he tried assassinating Martinez in the first place.
He didn't want the President releasing them.
Dempsey tried to keep the experiments on the girls a secret.
When I found out, I knew I had to leave.
I'm surprised he could do anything to offend you.
And what's that supposed to mean?
Do I have to list the things you've done since I've met you?
Kidnapping, murdering innocent people...
You think you know me, but you don't.
Well, that's my point.
You make absolutely no sense to me.
My dad left my mom when I was a kid.
I don't even remember him.
But I remember my stepdad.
He was a real...
Bastard.
He started hitting my mom from pretty much the word "go."
It went on like that until one day I had enough.
So when he started whaling on my mom,
I went to the drawer where I knew he kept his gun.
And I took it out...
And I shot him.
I-I don't know what to say.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
Well, don't be, 'cause that whole sob story...
I made it up.
There's no reason I am the way I am, Walker.
I just came out this way.
Come.
I hope I'm not disturbing you again.
Depends.
Any word on Sophia?
No.
Not yet.
But, uh...
That's not why I'm here.
We haven't had much time to talk since I got back from inostranka.
I wanted to check in, see how you're doing.
Stop beating around the bush, Blake.
You saw me confronting ray, and you're worried that I'm...
I'm losing it.
To put it bluntly, yes.
But it's not just that.
Your decision to suspend posse comitatus...
That's not like you.
Um, that's exactly the point.
I'm not sure that I follow.
Well, Sophia and her people have been locked up at inostranka for 66 years...
Until I tried playing the great emancipator.
Now, we all know how that worked out.
Elias, you can't blame yourself for everything that's...
It's the truth.
Let's not sugarcoat it.
Now, if I'm gonna fix the mess I've gotten us into, then I need to change...
Me.
Don't interrupt me again until you have something on Sophia.
Yes, Mr. President.
So what am I supposed to do when you die?
Excuse me?
Well, you're not getting out of this thing alive, which means eventually my family's information gets released.
And it's not just you that dies.
It's my mother and my son too.
I guess you better figure out a way to keep me alive, then.
I think I found something.
- What is it?
- It's an article online.
It says, uh, Jarvis is back to work at the white house today.
If you think I'm getting us into the white house, you're crazy.
No, but it also says that he's attending a party fund-raiser later tonight.
Where?
Uh, the ambassador hotel, downtown Washington.
Can you hack the guest list?
Oh, come on, that's got to be nothing compared to hacking the Pentagon mainframe as a sophomore in high school.
I...
Was a junior, but how did you know that?
You were my target once, remember?
I don't do any job without doing my research first.
Even if I add our names or our aliases for that matter, there's no way we'll ever be vetted to get in.
That's why we're gonna find people who've already been vetted for us.
Ted, what time does the fund-raiser start?
The money we paid...
I don't want to be late.
30.
Gonna need to get there a little early, too, to get through that security screening.
Have you seen my cuff links?
Did you check your jacket pocket?
Got them.
Did you call down for something?
No.
Hi.
I-I think you have the wrong room.
Oh, no, no, no.
I locked myself out of my room.
I'm so sorry to bother you.
I was just wondering if...
If it's at all possible,
I could use your phone for a quick second to call down to the lobby?
Of course.
Of course.
Come on in.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Down on your knees.
Just don't hurt us.
You cooperate, and we won't have to.
- Their invitations and I.D.S?
- They're on the couch.
Here.
Remember, make sure you get a clear impression.
Any flaws, and we're not getting past security.
Status?
Here.
All right, pack it up.
Jarvis knows what I look like, so I still have to change my appearance.
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?
Wait, wait.
They're innocent.
They saw our faces.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
You're not doing this.
What do you think the message is?
I don't know.
But I think we owe it to ourselves to go to this meeting and see what Thomas has to say for himself.
I don't trust Thomas, and neither should you.
Well, listen, whether you do or not, the fact of the matter is,
Thomas is gaining more and more power.
I don't want this any more than you do, but...
What is it?
It's a text with the location of the meeting.
Where is it?
It's in Los Angeles.
I'm gonna go, okay?
You don't have to.
Leila and Samantha shouldn't be alone anyway, all right?
- Be careful.
- Of course.
Okay.
- I just got the text.
- So have many others.
Thomas has everyone worried about what the message might be.
The few I've talked to will go to the meeting.
Thomas' agent did intercept a return message.
He murdered his partner in order to make sure it stayed a secret.
Then I have to go.
I don't have a choice.
Our people are starting to be swayed by him.
It doesn't matter what the message is.
I can't give Thomas the opportunity to solidify his power over them.
He already tried to kill you once.
He won't try that again...
Not there.
He can't risk turning too many of our people against him.
Michael, I'm not gonna force you to come with me.
But I'm going.
I have to.
Then so am I.
Good, good.
General Armbruster, you have permission to proceed.
Take her down.
Sir.
Just a moment, sir.
What is it?
Is there a problem?
We've just intercepted an sms communication sent to Sophia.
It's part of a communication blast.
It went out to over 200 other phones.
What's it say?
It's too heavily encrypted.
There's no way to know.
Target is on the move.
She's with Michael Buchanan.
The pilot.
He must be one of them too.
What's he up to with Sophia?
We'll find out when we take him down.
Prepare to go on my command.
She's holed up all day...
Waiting for something.
She receives a text message, and then she goes.
Mr. President?
It's not just a coincidence.
She left because of it.
How many other people did you say received that text message?
Just over 200.
Let me see.
So this message...
Could be instructions or...
Or a location.
They could be meeting.
Tell your men to back off.
Mr. President, what are you doing?
Do it, now.
All teams, pull back.
Pull back immediately.
This is your chance.
You said it yourself...
We can't let Sophia get away again.
And we won't.
General, follow her.
Don't let her out of your sight, not even for a second.
I don't want just Sophia.
This is our chance to get them all.
Thank you, sir.
Personal items in the tray, please.
- Stop it.
- What?
Stop looking so nervous.
We want them to think we belong here.
Thank you.
Invitations and I.D.S, please.
Personal items in the tray, please.
I'll take that.
Mrs. fisk, right thumb on the scanner, please.
Have a great evening.
Mr. fisk, please.
Is there a problem?
Again, Mr. fisk.
- Thank you, Mr. fisk.
- Absolutely.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
There he is.
You ready?
Yeah.
You better be.
Hi.
Oh, it's good to see you.
Thank you so much for coming.
- So wonderful to see you well.
- Thank you.
Thanks again, thanks again for coming.
All the best.
Thank you.
Mr. Vice President, Ted fisk.
- This is a big honor.
- Oh, Ted.
It's my honor as well.
And thank you for your support.
Oh, no... no...
No problem.
Um...
This is my wife.
Oh.
We've met.
You do anything to signal the secret service, and I pull the trigger.
You'll be dead before you get out a word.
You might want to smile and... and laugh like she just said something charming.
So...
So it's nice to have you here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Uh, now you're gonna tell your detail leader that you need a minute alone.
Do it.
Do it.
J.R....
I'm just going to need a moment with my friends.
- Yes, sir.
- Right this way.
After you, sir.
Apostle is headed into a secured room.
Keep your posts.
What are you doing here?
What do you want?
Ask him.
You're gonna help me take down James Dempsey.
James Dempsey...
Why are you asking me about him?
Don't... don't waste my time.
I know everything...
That you helped Dempsey try to assassinate the President.
Oh, no, no, it wasn't that simple.
Okay, I don't care.
I don't care.
I just want the proof that will put him away.
The last time I came forward against Dempsey he almost killed me.
And now he's threatening my wife and children if I talk, besides which I have...
I don't have any proof, any actual proof.
- It's only my word against his.
- There has to be something.
There isn't.
Don't you understand?
There isn't anything you or anyone else can do!
Hey!
Keep your voice down.
Hello?
Is everything okay?
Oh, my God!
What happened?
- Who did this to you?
- Call 911, please.
Tell them the Vice President's in danger.
You've got to know something that we can use against him.
I told you, there isn't.
Well, then at least tell us where he is.
I told you, I don't know.
And how much longer do you think it'll be before they come looking for me?
He's right.
We don't have much time.
Give me the gun.
My name is Sean Walker.
And the monster that you're protecting has hurt and killed who knows how many people.
He's framed me for murder.
Because of him, I've lost everything and everyone that I care about.
So right now I have nothing to lose.
So you're gonna give me something that will help take Dempsey down, or I will put a bullet in your head.
You understand?
Do you?
- Huh?
- All right.
Okay.
All right.
- What?
- He's left the country.
Uh-huh.
Go on.
He... he left for France this morning.
That's it...
France?
Somewhere in the Jura mountains.
That's all I know.
I swear.
A call just came in.
We have a security breach.
Harden up around the v.P. Now.
We've got a potential imminent threat against apostle.
What's he doing there?
I don't know.
Please, leave me.
Mr. Vice President.
Open the door, sir.
We need to go...
Now!
He's not responding.
Stand back.
Mr. Vice President, are you all right?
Yeah, they're getting away...
That way!
Sophia arrived at Union Station 20 minutes ago.
Do we have even a guess as to where she could be headed?
No, I'm afraid not.
There's no indication she knows she's being followed.
So whatever's going on, she should lead us right to it.
Sophia is here.
She's reached her destination.
- What do we know about it?
- St. Andrew's Cathedral...
It's been vacant for years.
According to the record, it was bought by a developer six months ago.
All right, I want to know who, and I want schematics on it and every other building within ten city blocks right away.
Yes, sir.
- Devon.
- Carlos.
- It's good to see you.
- You too.
It's been a long time.
Can we tell how many people are in it?
Just a few moments, Mr. President.
Splitting satellite feed to infrared.
I'm picking up about 200 heat signatures.
You were right.
They're meeting.
Move your men into position, general.
This is your new target.
Hello, Thomas.
Mother...
I'm glad you came.
You too, Michael.
I'd like to speak to you about this privately first.
No.
No more secrets.
We should get started.
Alpha team, how long before you're in position?
- Good news, Mr. President.
- What is it?
This is archival footage from a closed-circuit camera
- outside the church.
- I don't understand.
- What am I looking at?
- That man there...
That's Thomas.
He's inside the church right now.
You all know my mother and I have had our differences.
Well, the reason why I brought you today is to tell you that we can't afford to be at odds with each other any longer.
The message I recently sent home has been answered.
And the response is not one that any of us will want to hear.
We've all known for some time that our planet's days were numbered.
Unfortunately, our calculations were wrong.
According to the message I received, our sun has started going supernova.
I know this is much, much sooner than we'd anticipated.
But it is happening.
The first wave of lethal gamma rays will reach our solar system in the next two weeks.
In less than a year, our planet will be uninhabitable.
And if we don't migrate, our civilization will cease to exist.
My plan to bring thousands of our people here is now obsolete.
I have visual.
- One guard at church entrance.
- Roger that.
The only choice we have now is to bring everyone here...
To make this place our home.
This planet is the only chance we have of survival.
And we're gonna seize it before it's too late.
- We have a big problem.
- What is it?
Thomas, what's going on?
Where are you going?
The government's here.
Go, go, go!
Whoa!
Daddy, this is awesome, the way you made Fafnir...
You can tell it's him.
You can see how he didn't used to be a dragon here, and how he's turning into a dragon.
Like this part of him.
And he has a big arm just like in the story, Daddy.
And he has his... his what?
His what?
You know his helmet thing again.
What do you call his helmet thing again?
Uh, wasn't it the helmet...
Helmet of Terror or something like that?
No, the funny word.
Oh, the funny word, huh?
Pa, what was it?
A Egishjálmr.
Well there you go.
A Egishjálmr...
And this thing, what's this thing?
This thing?
Yeah.
What's this thing?
Yes.
Tell me.
You want me to tell you what this thing is?
Yes, tell him what it is.
You already forget the best part of the story?
What happened to his heart...
Oh yeah oh yeah, when he's lying on the ground like in the ditch, and then, boom!
Right through his heart!
It's his heart, okay, it's his heart.
Something like that.
Boom!
You did good with Fafnir, Daddy.
You did good.
You did good, Daddy.
Uh, why do we know so much about dragons?
But he can't do anything.
Chip.
Well, he can't.
Mr. Murrow is fat.
Really.
He's fat and he talks really slow.
What?
He needs another job.
Even Mrs. Adams would be a better P.E. teacher.
Now, Chip, come on.
What?
She said so.
Wait a minute.
Mrs. Adams said that?
Yeah.
She used to play volleyball, she said.
So she can teach us something.
She says Mr. Murrow just teaches kids to get fat and he's doing a good job.
Chip.
Mrs. Adams really said that?
Yeah.
At the store.
Yes, at the store, but Mrs. Adams said it.
Mrs. Adams really said that Mr. Murrow's teaching the kids to be fat?
No.
She used the other word.
It means fat too.
Overweight?
No.
Obese?
Yeah.
She said, "He's teaching them to be obese and he's doing a good job... at it, John." I don't know who John is, but Mrs. Adams said it.
Well, I don't want you going around repeating what Mrs. Adams didn't mean for you to hear.
Okay, okay.
Why don't you give us reports about Mr. Murrow every day?
Maybe we're forgetting some of the good things he does.
He can't do anything.
I think I remember a couple of good days in there.
Some good kickball days, tee ball days.
He can't do anything days.
Well, if he's really all that bad, we'll do something about it.
We've got connections to a very powerful member of the PTA.
You mean that guy?
That guy right there.
He doesn't look very powerful.
Oh but my hearing is powerful.
You got it, Mr. PTA?
On it.
I'm driving today!
Better check out the first grade today.
Oh.
Don't get too obese now.
Come on.
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Morning Betsy.
Good morning, Mr. Joey.
Yeah, Ed!
Yeah, I got his message, but I went ahead and told Rick to come in anyway.
Yeah.
I figure it'll give you an extra man and a little less traffic today, yeah?
So forgive me for last week?
No, today it's just the great room architecturals.
You got it.
Betsy, have you seen...
He's right behind you Miss.
Morning Marge.
Oh, Joey.
Everything okay?
I'm not so sure about these.
Okay.
Now these are the shutters.
Do you have the other page?
There we go.
Yeah, it probably makes sense to look at these two at the same time.
Okay.
Well, this morning I woke up and I was in a panic.
This looks nothing like last week.
These aren't new, are they?
No, these are from last week.
Am I crazy?
I'm not crazy.
Joey, there's something wrong.
Well, it's not a problem.
We've still got a little time before they do all the cutting.
So we'll make sure they cut you something you like, okay?
Joey.
This is Sharon.
The glazier.
Right.
Sharon, good to meet you.
Now you only got till noon today, right?
That's right.
Great.
Marge, if you don't mind, I'm gonna get Sharon...
I didn't know Ed was here.
Yeah, we're letting them play out in the sun today.
So, Marge, if you'll excuse me for about 15 minutes, I'm going to get Sharon started here and...
Oh!
But you know what?
What would be really helpful is if you could look at these, which we know you don't like.
And you've got that book.
Hold on a sec.
Sorry Sharon, I'll be right back.
I'm sorry Sharon, what is it you do?
I'm the glass cutter, ma'am.
Oh.
You cut glass.
Yes, ma'am.
So you've got this book that should be good for some ideas.
So, look through the book and write down any page numbers that look interesting.
That you like better than the drawings, then we'll take it from there.
Sound good?
Okay, but what about Sam?
Don't worry, we're not about to do anything without Sam knowing.
This is just to get us started, see if we can figure out what exactly isn't working for you.
Then we'll get Sam in here to help us along.
Alright?
Alright.
Great.
Thanks Marge.
Uh, so Sharon, let's go this way.
Now you know Bob from that Leighton House job, right?
Yeah.
That was great.
Brent, would you put up our next problem, please?
Julie, you're on deck.
Class, we see a problem like this, and our job is to...
Simplify.
Very good.
Thank you, Brent.
Julie, would you draw an arrow to where we should start to simplify.
Dennis, you're on deck.
Great.
So, it looks like Julie started inside the absolute values.
Inside the absolute values there are how many operations?
Tim?
Two operations.
Very good.
Two operations.
And Julie started with which operation?
Erin?
Multiplication.
Multiplication.
So Julie started inside the absolute values where there are two operations, and she started with the multiplication operation.
Class, do we agree?
Great.
Thank you.
Dennis, would you use Julie's work to show me how we can simplify yet again?
Cet, you're on deck.
Hey.
Aren't you forgetting something?
About today?
Blake.
Get in here.
We forgot about Jamie's...
Oh yeah, oh yeah!
Hey, Uncle Cody.
Hey, Blake.
Alright.
Go.
Pa, can we get this one?
Jamie!
Happy Birthday!
Hey there.
Double duty today, huh?
Yeah, Dave and Eileen'll be by later to pick up Blake.
Carol!
Come on in, come in.
Jamie, look who's here.
But, is Joey coming?
Yeah, he should be here in a bit.
Hold on, hold on...
Scratch that.
No, he's not going to make it.
Come on now, Joey, you are not leaving me alone with all these kids now.
Chip, where are you?
Come here.
Daddy's stuck at work again.
Stuck with the Hawk Lady.
Yeah, stuck with the Hawk Lady.
Want to go by there after this?
Yeah.
And we'll bring him some cake.
Alright, I'll let him know.
No, not about the cake.
It'll be a surprise.
Alright.
That one.
Which one?
That one?
Yeah.
Okay.
Can you read the name on it?
Paiste.
Paiste.
That's pretty good.
And that one too.
Okay that one too.
You want to print them both out or just the one?
Both.
Okay.
And can we find the stories?
No, let's do that tomorrow.
It's getting late.
Yes, it's getting late.
We've got all week to find the stories.
Yessir.
Sounds like you're getting tired.
No?
So it's not time for bed?
I believe it's time for bed.
Time for bed, Chipmunk.
No.
Don't call me that!
What, Chipmunk?
You're telling me you don't like being called Chipmunk, Chipmunk?
And Daddy keeps calling me...
That's 'cause he knows you love it.
You know, I know what else you love.
Are you trying to get away from me?
Huh?
You love when I do this.
It's time for bed, Chipmunk.
It's time for bed!
Nothing you can do about it.
I don't need two of you.
You've got two of us.
Someone help me!
No one can help you.
It's too late for you.
You're done!
You're done!
Hey.
Sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.
Long day, huh?
Looong day.
Anne's pretending to be mad at you for missing her party.
Anne.
Chip's pretending to be mad at me for acting like you.
Chip.
You remember who has training early tomorrow?
You do.
So who has to take Chip to school?
I do.
You forgot, didn't you?
I did.
Any wonder I fell for such a smooth talker?
Hello?
Hey Eileen.
You're where?
What...?
But what...?
Is he...
Eileen, is he...?
Okay, yeah, I got it.
I'll be right there.
Yeah, we'll be right there.
Hey, buddy, we got to go.
But I'm not done.
Sorry, we got to go now.
But my shoes...
I got 'em.
You can put them on in the car.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Dave, what's going on?
Is he okay?
Yeah.
They started the surgery a little while ago and they said they'd let us know if anything happens, so...
What happened, Dave?
Do you know what happened to him?
I don't know.
They talked mostly to Eileen.
She just told me the part about the surgery.
Okay.
Who did Eileen talk with?
Nurse's name was Rachel something.
I'm not sure...
Are they talking now?
But Eileen also talked to the doctor for a few minutes.
Okay, are they talking now?
They're...
No, no, doctor's in surgery now.
And Eileen actually had to go home.
Okay.
Is that the nurse you were talking to?
No.
I'm sorry.
I don't see her, Joey, I'm sorry.
No, that's fine.
I'll figure out where she is, what's going on.
Do you remember the doctor's name?
It was doctor... yeah, it was Doctor Sills.
Okay, great.
I'm just gonna go...
Chip, Daddy's going to go talk to that nurse over there, okay?
You want to come with me or stay here with Uncle Dave?
Come with you.
Alright, let's go, buddy.
Let's go.
Can I help you?
Yes.
I'm Joey Williams.
I'm waiting here with Dave, and...
I'm sorry Dave...?
Yeah, Dave Robey over there.
We're family of Cody Hines.
He, he was in a car accident.
Yesss...
And another nurse, a Rachel someone, I think, said he was in surgery.
Yes, now I have an Eileen Robey and David Robey listed as sister and brother-in-law.
Right.
Okay.
And I'm sorry, you are...?
Joey Williams.
We live together.
This is our kid Chip, Chip Hines.
Okay.
Joey's still doing okay- Cody's still doing okay, right?
Stable?
Eileen told me he was stable, but that was a little while ago.
Do you know what's happening now?
Nurse Edwards will talk to you about that.
Okay.
Okay, I haven't met her yet.
Is that Rachel Edwards?
Yes.
Okay, can you tell me where I can find her?
I'll let her know to talk to you.
Okay.
Alright, I'll be right over there with Dave.
I'll let her know.
And she knows what's going on with Cody, right?
Because I don't really know anything.
I don't know how bad it was or what they're trying to fix now, or anything.
Nurse Edwards will talk to you about all that.
Or the doctor, can I talk to him now?
Not right now.
Right.
Okay.
Thanks.
And, sorry, if you need me for anything, let me know.
Could you tell Nurse Edwards that?
That if she needs anything I'm over there.
Like if she has questions about Cody or something.
Okay.
Alright.
And she'll be back soon?
Any minute.
Okay.
You okay, buddy?
Good.
We're going to be okay.
They didn't tell you what happened?
What they're trying to do?
No, they talked to Eileen about that, I didn't get much of it.
Hey, Chip, Daddy's going to make a call, okay?
Hey Eileen, it's Joey.
It's about 9:30 now.
I'm here at the hospital with Dave.
I was hoping you knew what happened exactly.
I guess the nurse, Nurse Edwards is supposed to come talk to us, but I haven't seen her yet.
Hey, Dave, Sally knows right?
Yeah, I'm going to go pick her up at noon.
Okay.
Yeah, so call me back when you get this and I'll let you know what's going on.
Or you can let me know what's going on.
Bye.
Did you call your work?
Oh, no no.
I should.
Mr. Robey, we called this number that your wife gave us...
Hi, are you Nurse Edwards?
You are.
Great.
Is he okay?
Is he doing okay now?
Wait, are you also here for Mr. Hines?
Yes, I'm Joey Williams.
I live with him.
This is our kid Chip, Chip Hines.
Is he still in surgery?
Is he with the doctor in surgery?
No no no.
He hasn't gone into surgery yet.
Mr. Robey, your wife gave us this doctor's information, but when we contacted his office, they didn't have any records for Mr. Hines.
No, that's not his doctor.
Do you have any idea...
That hasn't been his doctor for years.
This is his doctor now.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Definitely.
Okay.
Okay, good.
Is there something else you need to know?
About his medical history?
He's allergic to penicillin and he needs... do you want to write that down?
Chip, your Dad'll be right back.
Hi...
Hey baby.
So they finished the surgery about an hour ago.
They got started really late.
I was here for hours before they started.
And it was harder than they thought.
The doctor explained a little bit more what happened.
It's awful, Eileen.
It looks like, it looks like Cody got pretty roughed up.
But they did a lot, so he's resting now.
They said that they would... they'd learn a lot from how he does tonight.
Okay?
Okay.
I'll be right back.
Okay.
Hey Joey.
Oh, Eileen.
Hey.
I brought your stuff.
Oh good.
Thanks for picking it up.
Are you sure you don't want to go home and get some rest?
No, tonight's important, they said.
So I'm gonna stick around.
Do you want Chip come home stay with us?
No, that's fine.
He, he wants to stay.
Mr. Robey, Mrs. Hines.
If you'd like, you can see Mr. Hines now.
He's not conscious, but you can sit with him for a few minutes if you like.
Yes.
I'd like that, yes.
Good.
This way, Mrs. Hines.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Williams, only family members allowed to visit at this time.
Oh.
So you mean I can't see him?
I mean, we are family, we...
I'm sorry, Mr. Williams.
No, Joey, is...
No, it's okay.
Chip, go with Grandma Sally, okay?
I don't want to go.
Chip!
Hold on a sec.
Hey Chipmunk.
Hey!
I'm sorry.
I didn't even ask.
Yeah, I didn't even ask what you wanted to do.
You don't have to go in there if you don't want to, you know that, right?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Pa got hurt, and it'll be hard to see him like that, I know.
But you know what?
If it was me back there, now I'm just trying to think like Pa now.
I think I'd really like to have my Chip with me.
Yeah?
Yeah...
That'd probably be more important than just about anything else.
And my eyes may be closed, and maybe I don't say a thing, but I would know you were there.
And I'd feel a whole lot better.
Even if I couldn't move a bit of me to show you, I would feel a whole lot better.
I would know you were there.
Everyone knows when you're in the room, Chip.
Yeah?
Now, Uncle Dave, you're never sure if he's really all there.
And I'm not sure Pa ever really liked Auntie Eileen all that much.
So you gonna go save Pa from Auntie Eileen?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Okay, I'll go.
Come on, Chip.
Come on, Chip.
Why don't you go with your Grandma?
So we'll be right back, okay?
Hey, where'd you get that?
Since I'm in my PJs, everyone thinks I'm sick.
They'll give me anything.
You want some?
I'll give you one.
They'll give me anything.
No, Chip.
Chip.
Did something happen?
No.
No change.
Mr. Williams, I wanted to give you this.
Please don't tell anyone I gave you this.
This is a Hospital Visitation Authorization.
If you fill it out, in the future you'll be able to visit him.
And he'll be able to visit you.
Just in case.
Wow.
Thank you.
Yeah, I'm kind of a moron when it comes to this stuff, so thank you.
I really appreciate it.
Hopefully, you won't need it.
Like I said, just in case.
Please don't tell anybody, I could...
Oh a song came to the valley
The valley of plenty
And you stayed
And I learned every word
And now you are leaving the valley
The valley so empty
You are crossing the river
now
This is Gloria.
We never met, but I worked with Cody.
Hey Chipmunk.
How was school?
Who are you talking to, Daddy?
Is there a chipmunk back there?
Is there a chipmunk in the car?
No, just a Chip, Daddy.
Alright.
Settle down.
I'm 6, you know.
Oh, don't I know it.
Chip.
School was looong.
Where are we going?
Back to school.
Gloria.
Hey, I'm Joey.
What do you know.
Finally get to meet face to face.
Cody said a lot of really great things about you.
Not like he needed to.
It's like our stomachs have known you for years.
Oh, uh, here you go.
Really sorry it took so long to get these back to you.
I have some lasagna.
Oh, you don't have to do that.
Gloria, I didn't come by for a refill.
Gloria, you're too much.
Really, we can't just keep taking your food.
Cody was a good one.
But he wasn't too good to eat my food, so don't you go thinking you're too good to eat my food.
You take the lasagna.
Gloria, you're too much.
And I'll take the lasagna.
Hey, have you met Chip?
Hey, Chip!
Come here!
Come say hello to Miss Gloria.
Oh hey!
Sorry about that.
Hold on, sorry.
I didn't see you there.
Joey, this is my husband, Cody.
Hey, how you doing?
Hey.
With Gus gone, Joey's going to finish the renovations.
Okay, good.
I'm just here till the end of the month.
Be nice to him.
I'm trying to convince him to stick around.
Yeah, how's she doing?
She convinced you?
Three contractors in three months, and you're the best.
Please, Joey, please stay!
This seemed like a better idea from up there.
We're not usually like this.
You're alright, yeah?
Hey, Eileen, it's Joey.
Chip Hines, please come to the upstairs.
Hi Joey.
Hey Dave.
Eileen's in the kitchen.
Okay.
Hey Eileen.
Joey.
You want a drink or something?
No, I'm okay.
Thanks.
I am just a little out of my league with all these papers.
I appreciate you letting me come over.
This was pretty much all Cody's department before.
So, I'm pretty sure everything's getting paid.
Definitely the big stuff like the mortgage.
There's some smaller bills I don't get, like this one from the bank, but I keep paying 'em.
These are all his accounts with money.
This is from the teacher's credit union.
So uh, you're not going to believe this.
I didn't find a will.
Instead, there is this... this sort of fill-in-the-blank deal.
Look at that.
He got as far as his name.
Isn't that hysterical?
I guess the mortgage must be tough with just your money coming in.
Naw, it's not so bad.
I make enough, you know.
Chip and I wouldn't even know how to live it up, so we're doing fine.
I mean, I was scared at first too, but it helped when...
Oh, okay, look at this.
So I found this budget Cody made.
It's a little old and all.
Hell, we probably talked about it at some point, but I don't remember.
I probably wasn't listening.
Well, I am listening now.
We're happy to help with Chip.
Don't let him hear that.
No, we're good, Eileen.
We're good.
And we've got some money sa-
Cody had a will.
What?
This bill from the bank is for the box where he kept his will and some other papers.
How'd you figure that out, I couldn't-
Cody told me.
Years ago.
Eileen.
Why didn't you say something?
I thought you knew.
Joey, I'm sorry, I thought you knew.
I didn't realize until you called that you didn't...
Uh Cody... he named me the executor in his will.
A friend of mine, she's been through this before, helped walk me through all the people to talk to and how to get the accounts transferred.
What?
You transferred his accounts?
I thought you knew, Joey.
I didn't say anything because I didn't want you to have to think about all this, not when you were dealing with everything else.
What does this mean?
Uh... do I need to get that mortgage check back?
Is it supposed to go somewhere else now?
Yeah, you should get that back.
I'll take care of the mortgage now.
Really, Eileen, I can afford it.
Well Joey, the, the house is in my name now.
So that means that there's a mortgage in my name now too.
Cody left all his assets in my name, so that he could see that Chip was taken care of... by me.
But I'm telling you, I can take care of Chip.
There's no problem.
You don't think I can take care of Chip?
Joey, no.
It's just, it's what Cody wanted.
Oh and you can't be telling me Cody thought I couldn't take care of Chip.
Eileen, this is from 2002.
Chip was just a baby.
It's his will, Joey.
I'm sorry, he never changed it.
You can't think that he...
He had 6 years to change it, and he didn't.
It says "Last Will And Testament." It's, it's not fill-in-the-blank.
He knew what he wanted.
So you don't need to worry about the mortgage.
You can stay as long as you need.
And... you don't have to worry about Chip.
Of course I need to worry about Chip, I'm his father.
Joey, Chip is our responsibility now.
Our legal responsibility.
Cody named us as...
Stop pointing to 2002!
It's what my brother wanted, Joey.
Could you have a little respect for that?
Just a little respect?
What is going on here, Eileen?
I don't get what's going on here.
Cody wanted to make sure...
What is changing here?
What is going on?
We are his family and-
I am Chip's dad!
Since when did that need explaining?
Chip!
Joey, please...
Chip, come on, we're going!
Joey!
So...
So, this is a really lovely moresque.
You see how it has elements like the wood detailing in the library.
It's like a leaf.
You see that?
Except that it's a soft medium, it's a fabric.
So it will converse well with its neighbor.
You know, you won't feel like you're jumping around room to room, but it will still allow this room to have its own identity.
You don't think it's too dark?
It looks like Paul's room.
Well, the ivories in the pattern keep it lighter, but you're right, it's not colorful.
But also remember that we're talking about fixed background elements.
And you may not want a lot of color in your fixed background elements.
You can use color on the chairs, or in pillows, something like that.
Something... like this azul.
This burgundy fleur pattern.
Oh my!
And this is period?
Well, it's not contemporary with when the house was built, but it's old.
So, so it would have, it would have been available then.
That's the nice thing.
Old things keep popping up overtime.
I mean the moresques were really popular in Europe around the 16th century.
But you saw them in places, like Venice, earlier by the 15th century.
And of course Muslim artists used them far before that.
Oh my.
Oh, let me help you with those.
Oh Paul!
That's Joey.
And this is...
I'm sorry dear, what's your name?
Helen.
Helen is here.
That was my husband Paul.
Sorry.
Now this is a library.
Are you responsible for this?
No way.
Your house, everything's so particular, there's an expert for just about everything.
No, I just make sure they get here on time and have what they need.
That's no small feat.
Pleasure to meet you, I'm Paul.
Joey.
Hope you don't have too many more of these.
We built you a little room to grow, but we went off the collection the movers had.
Damn movers packed everything.
These are new.
Well, new acquisitions.
Grandpa was kind of rough with them.
Yeah?
Pages are strong though.
1799?
Sure.
Ha.
You should get these rebound, you know?
Kind of sad to see them like this.
A couple can probably just be restored.
You sound like someone who knows what he's talking about.
Just something I picked up at one point, from someone who really knew what they were doing.
That someone looking for work?
Not right now.
But, I learned enough I can handle these.
Really?
Sure.
Does this mean you go on the payroll with the other experts?
Naw, don't worry.
I've got so much down time these days, it'll help me earn my keep.
Helen's pretty much in charge now, and she knows what she's doing.
No this will be good, you know.
Give me something to do between this and that.
That'll be great, Joey
We should probably go over which ones you want done.
I noticed a couple over here that could use some work.
Hey Chipmunk.
Hey Daddy.
Hey Blake.
Dave.
So, how was the big game there?
We won!
You won?
It was 18 to 0.
What?
Nooo...
Nooo...
I don't believe you.
Come on. 18 to 0?
Hey Sally, it's Joey.
Good, good.
So I wanted to check and see what we can bring for Thanksgiving.
Yeah, for Thanksgiving.
I mean when we come for Thanksgiving, you want us to bring anything?
Sally, is every-
Yeah, yeah... we kind of did.
I-
Sally, she-
Yeah I know, but-
Sally, when did I become the bad guy all of a sudden?
No I get it, but-
Sure, I'm not asking you-
Sure.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, keep the peace, Sally, keep the peace.
You're at least going to let Chip come, right?
Alright.
Yeah.
Okay, I'll drop him off then.
Hey, Chipmunk.
Come here a sec.
So, uh... here's an idea.
How would you like to have two Thanksgivings this year?
You know, one day can be Thanksgiving.
Next day can be Thanksgiving too.
Did you make this up?
I kind of did.
Can we have two Christmases too?
Okay, let's not get-
Okay.
You said okay.
Alright, Mr. Smarty pants, we-
Alright!
You said alright!
What?
I'm afraid to say anything now.
Fine.
Don't be afraid.
Say your things.
So uh,
I thought Wednesday you and me, you know, we could have our Thanksgiving.
And then Thursday you can go to Grandma's, have Thanksgiving there too.
Is this because you and Auntie Eileen are fighting?
Yeah.
Auntie Eileen's not too happy with me right now.
And to tell you the truth, I'm not so happy with her.
So it's probably better we a little time to cool off.
It'd probably be weird to be in a room with us when we're both unhappy like that, yeah?
It's just weird being in a room with you, Daddy.
You don't say.
Weird, weird, weird.
I'm not weird, Chipmunk.
And you call everyone Chipmunk.
Only those who deserve it, Chipmunk.
Okay, okay!
We can have our weird Thanksgiving.
Thank you, Chipmunk.
Do we have to have turkey though?
Are you kidding?
It is our Thanksgiving, we can have whatever we want.
Rice krispie treats?
Okay, rice krispie treats.
But uh, we should probably have something else too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Chili mac.
Hey, that we can do.
What is that?
Rice krispie treats.
And chili mac.
Chili mac...
And we should probably have some veggies too, no?
Nah.
No?
Some greens, yeah?
Green jello.
I don't think that's a vegetable.
Green MMs.
Nope.
I don't think that's a vegetable either.
Green cake.
You're not very good at this, are you?
Nope.
Nope.
Not a veggie guy.
No, I'm not.
You ready?
Yeah?
Alright, go on.
I'll pick you up tomorrow afternoon.
You got it.
Can I just say I'm sorry right now?
Get it over with.
It's okay.
Cody!
Hey Dave, how you doing?
Good to see you.
This is Joey.
Joey, Dave.
Dave, Joey.
You don't have to worry about Dave so much, he's okay.
Hey Eileen, how you doing?
Hey Joey, I want you to meet my sister Eileen.
Eileen, this is Joey.
Joey, Eileen.
Hey Eileen.
Is that them?
That's us.
Is that Cody?
That's me.
This is Joey.
Joey!
Oh, you must be Joey.
Welcome.
Welcome to, welcome to Thanksgiving.
Yeah Mama, Mama he knows what Thanksgiving is.
Welcome to our Thanksgiving.
Yes, let's all thank Joey for coming down from outer space for Thanksgiving.
It's okay.
Thanks for having me ma'am.
Mr. Hines?
It's good to meet you.
It's really good to see you.
Oh what a polite young man.
I didn't know they made them like that in outer space.
Do you, do you, would you like a drink?
You know, a wine cooler?
What?
I don't know what he drinks.
It's okay.
No, of course you don't.
It's okay.
How am I supposed to know what he drinks?
Joey, could you come in here?
There's this uh, shelf in the pantry that I would...
Mama!
You're not going to put him to work now.
Well, you said he was good at that.
Well Mama, if it's a shelf, Dave can take care of it!
Dave, take care of it.
Well Dave is too tall.
Mama!
I'm sorry, I'll be right back.
You're too tall.
What?
What did I do?
It's a low shelf, so...
Ah, it happens.
Surprise!
Happy Thanksgiving, Joey!
Hey!
Yeah, surprise.
You didn't think we'd let you spend Thanksgiving alone now, did you?
Sometimes alone ain't so bad.
Well, come in, come in.
Hell, I may start a sneaking out Thanksgiving tradition.
Oh no.
Joey, no.
We are here for, what do they call that?
An intervention.
That's right, an intervention.
We are here to save you from your own cooking.
Hey... now that was made with love.
Okay, it was made with Chip, but...
Aaah.
We may be too late.
Hello, you've reached the Hines' home.
Hello?
Oh, hello Sally?
Oh.
Yes.
Sally, it's Joey.
Yes.
Joey.
Turkey must have really knocked you out, I've been out here ringing your bell.
Yes, I know.
Sally, what's going on?
Why didn't you come to the door?
Sally, is something wrong?
Are you okay?
Sally, are you there?
Sally do-
Chip isn't here, Joey.
What do you mean he isn't here?
I told you I was coming by to pick him up.
Sally, where is he?
I'm sorry, Joey, I'm sorry.
But, it's okay.
Chip is with his family.
Sally, what's going on?
Eileen.
You see, Eileen is the legal guardian.
She said the judge said so.
And she and Dave, they'll take really good care of Chip.
Sally!
You've looked after him really well, Joey.
We all know that.
And we hope...
Sally, I am Chip's dad!
Joey, you were so good for Cody.
Cody after Rebecca.
And Joey, it was so nice... my Cody and Rebecca, the two of them.
And Chip looks just like Rebecca...
Sally!
Why are you doing this?
Where are they?
Where did they take Chip?
Sally, where did they take Chip?
No, Joey.
It'll just make it harder.
It'll just make it harder.
Thank you.
Come on, Eileen, I know you're in there.
Open up!
Chip!
Hey, Chipmunk, can you hear me?
It's going to be okay.
We're going to go home soon.
Eileen!
Eileen!
You can bring them back now.
Hey, you okay?
Whoa!
Careful, I don't think you want to be swimming around in this mess.
This is Rebecca's...
It's okay, alright?
She loved...
I...
Sit back.
It's okay, Cody.
Sit back.
Okay?
Sit back.
You know, this is nothing.
Yeah, we'll put this back together again.
I didn't mean to.
We'll put it back together again, no problem.
Yeah, just sit back.
Here we go, here we go.
Okay.
Good, um...
Can't put her back together again.
Cody, I...
She's gone.
Yeah.
I know.
She's gone...
She was something else, wasn't she?
Wasn't she?
Yeah.
Hold on.
What is it?
You need something?
Sorry about that.
Yeah, that was a good one.
I didn't mean to.
Well, let me...
No, no, no.
It's okay.
Just leave it.
It's okay.
I'll be right back.
Okay?
Sorry about the mess.
Hey, it's Tennessee.
It happens.
Hey.
Cody, where's Chip?
Oh.
Chip's...
Chip's at his grandparents now.
That's where he is...
at his grandparents... not here...
Okay.
Okay good.
Good good good.
Then we only got one baby to take care of.
Let's uh, let's get you cleaned up, you've got some stuff...
No, you don't have to do that.
Yeah, yeah, you just sit back and shut up.
What'd you say?
Shut up.
Is that how you talk to a baby?
Yeah, come on, you need some rest.
This you don't need.
Rest you need.
Come on.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
Sure you don't.
I mean, that's natural.
What am I supposed to do?
Cody, you'll figure it out.
Don't you tell me to figure it out!
Hey!
I just need to know what to do.
I'm so
- I'm sorry, I just...
No, it's okay, I'm...
You're terrible at this.
Yeah, yeah I kind of am.
Yeah nothing makes sense.
Yeah uh...
I've been there.
No.
You don't know what it's like now.
Yup, shut up, I have.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah, who died?
Uh, sister.
Mother... father...
Foster father... foster mother.
Seriously?
Yup.
All those people?
Yup.
See what we got here.
I think maybe I'd be a good contractor.
I think I'd be a good... carpenter.
Think maybe I ought to try it.
Okay!
I think you need to sleep on it.
Yeah.
Yeah, come on.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Here we go.
Up.
Yeah I'll do it...
These are kind of tough.
Good?
Uh... don't you want to brush your teeth or something?
Man, you're going to regret that, um...
Here.
Come on, you'll feel a little less nasty in the morning.
Oh Betsy, have you seen...
They're in the hallway, Miss.
So when I went to go look for him at Eileen's...
Good morning.
Sorry, I, I didn't mean to interrupt.
No problem.
Did you need me or Helen?
Helen.
Joey, I'll come find you after we're done.
Yeah, okay.
What the hell.
Joey, I'm so sorry...
Oh, this is wrong!
Helen, this is wrong!
Yeah, you don't have to convince me.
Joey, what kind of beer you got?
Never mind.
I can get it.
You sit down, Joey.
You just... sit down.
Gloria, hey.
Chicken pot pie.
You're an angel, Gloria.
Just thoughtful beyond belief.
Thank you.
Got it.
And do you have...
Yeah, I have his number here.
Well, I'll let you get back to your guests.
Gloria, there's just a couple of us.
Can you come in for a bit?
More company tonight would be nice.
Yeah?
Wonderful
Hey everyone, this is Gloria.
She teaches at Cody's school.
Gloria this is Helen and Anne.
And sorry, it's been a while since we've had company.
Can I get you something to drink, Gloria?
Do you have tea?
Sure, sure.
Joey, how many women you got feeding you?
Can you believe what Eileen did?
Seriously, the police?
As if Joey would hurt anyone.
Who's Eileen?
Joey, you got to let your people know what's going on.
We're good for more than just cooking.
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry, Gloria.
Who's Eileen?
Cody's sister.
She took Chip away.
Wouldn't let Joey see him, not a word of discussion.
Joey goes to pick him up one day...
And sorry.
No.
You know what?
He's our kid now.
We don't need you.
Can you believe that?
And stay away.
Then this happened today.
A restraining order.
Okay, I have known Eileen for a while.
And you know our kids have grown up together.
But she should have gotten the restraining order on me, because I am going to kill her!
Do it.
I mean what is she thinking?
I mean seriously!
Trying to keep Joey away from Chip?
I mean, why do you want to spend your time on that?
Why?
Why that?
We've been coming up with a list of names, people who have gone through some sort of child custody case or...
Charles, it's Gloria.
Yeah.
Be in your office tomorrow at four, I'm sending a friend over.
Treat him right.
Yeah, his name is Joey Hines.
It's Williams.
Williams.
Sorry.
Joey Williams.
Yeah.
Charles did my divorces and my custody case.
Talk to him tomorrow.
How come I haven't met Gloria before?
Here you go, Gloria.
Ah!
She gets things done.
We like Gloria.
Thanks.
Yeah, it'll be good to talk to your friend.
I've talked to some lawyers over the phone, and uh... they pretty much can't get off the phone fast enough.
Well you got Charles tomorrow.
And all these people, Joey.
And these are friends, not just some stranger on the phone.
They're going to help you figure something out.
Trying to keep Chip away from his dad, I swear...
Eileen...
Get you another, Joey?
Uh, yeah.
Helen?
Please.
What's a Paiste?
What's a who?
Paiste.
Irish dragon.
She's a teacher.
They know things.
Chip, he's kind of going through a dragon phase right now.
We used to look up a dragon a week.
You know, look up all the stories about him.
Well that was Cody and Chip's job, to do all this research.
They'd give me these pictures and I'd make Chip a little block with the dragon on it.
He calls them blocks.
They're art.
Have you seen these things?
Well he can definitely spell some really strange words now.
You know, since Chip started school, he wasn't so thrilled about Mondays.
So, Monday morning he'd get a new block, you know, give him something to look forward to.
I guess I just kinda forgot since Cody...
I mean look at this.
Oh yeah, that's Fafnir.
Aaah...
Norse.
Helmet and heart.
I went through a dragon phase myself.
Oh Gloria, you are full of surprises.
This was Chip's thing.
Man, of all the things to forget.
So make it.
Make him his P-, Pie-, Paste, Pasta...
Paiste.
I'll give it to him.
No, I can't ask you to-
You're not.
I'm telling you, do it.
I'm telling you, she should have gotten one for me.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay, good.
Would you mind also uh...
Yeah.
Hey.
Chip's not feeling so well today.
Let's let him rest a little, okay?
Okay.
Come on, Blake.
Hey Chipmunk.
So...
I know it's been a while, but guess what?
Daddy's got another dragon story for you.
Yeah?
This is a story about a dragon named Paiste.
And the dragon was old, really old.
You know, they say Paiste was left over from the beginning of time.
And the beginning of time must have been a pretty scary place if everyone looked like him.
Yeah?
He had these horns shooting out from his head, and each year they got stronger and sharper.
His body was long and huge.
His scales were like an armor he never took off.
He always lived with all his horrible parts.
And he was the original fire-breathing dragon.
In a single afternoon your whole village could disappear.
Yeah, just gone to ashes.
Well, there was this one village, a village with a funny name Daddy can't pronounce, so... we're just going to call it the East Village.
And the people of the East Village, they saw how every year the fires were getting closer and closer, and so they thought,
Man, we better do something about this dragon, or the East Village is going to be burned to ashes.
Now, there happened to live up in the mountains near the East Village... an old Saint.
The people thought,
Well, if anyone will know what to do, it'll be this guy.
So they went up the mountain and they begged the Saint and said,
Please help us, or the East Village is going to be burned to ashes.
And the Saint, well he said,
Sure.
Why not?
So, you know, the Saint goes to see Paiste.
And, the dragon sees him coming, and he thought,
Great, the food's coming to me now.
This is the life.
The dragon says to the Saint,
Are you a sacrifice?
May I eat you now?
Dragons can be polite when they're pleased, you know.
And the Saint lied and said, 'Yes."
Well the dragon opened its mouth to eat the Saint and the Saint shouted,
Wait!
Your sacrifice needs to be properly prepared.
And the Saint started to do a dance.
Oh it wasn't a very good dance, but the dragon waited, patiently.
The Saint then started shaking some sticks in the air, and the dragon waited, you know, patiently.
The Saint then, he dropped the sticks along the dragon's back.
And the dragon waited patiently.
The Saint then started to sing and finally the dragon said,
Are you done yet?
And the Saint cried, 'Yes!" you know.
He clapped his hands, and those sticks he dropped along the dragon's back, they turned into huge ropes that twisted around the dragon and trapped him.
Oh Paiste struggled, but he couldn't break free.
The Saint then yelled, "To the sea!"
And the ropes carried the dragon to the bottom of the sea.
And there he is, even today.
Yeah, still alive at the bottom of the sea.
They say he's going to live there until Judgement Day, when they decide whether he was really evil or just a misunderstood dragon.
And uh, even though he's really old, and even though the ropes are really tight,
Paiste will still try to break free sometimes.
Oh yeah, he struggles and struggles and splashes around at the bottom of the sea.
That's why sometimes, when you go to the beach, after a lot of little waves, you'll get that one really big one.
Hey that's Paiste, trying to break free.
Hey Chipmunk.
Hey Chipmunk.
Mr. Williams?
Yes, I'm Joey Williams.
It's good to meet you.
Okay.
Come in.
Yeah, Gloria had a lot of good things to say about you.
Well, they don't make 'em like Gloria anymore.
We've been through some times.
You from around here, Joey?
Yeah, I grew up here in Martin.
Huh.
You don't say.
So, I'm sorry about the formality, we get so many folks in here, it just helps to keep things straight.
Sure, sure.
So it says here this is a child custody case?
Well you want to tell me a little about what's going on, Joey?
Yeah, sure um... so my kid Chip, he's six now.
His mom died when he was born, and Cody and I raised him together all this time.
And we did-
I'm sorry, who's Cody?
Cody is Chip's dad.
I thought you were Chip's dad.
Yeah, what is it they say, Chip has two daddies.
So when Cody died, um, things were fine for a while.
I mean, they weren't fine, but there weren't any problems with Chip.
You know, we kept on the way we'd been doing.
And then, Eileen, now that's Cody's sister, tells me weeks later that Cody's will made her Chip's guardian.
They took him away, you know didn't let me see him.
A couple of days later I get this restraining order that tells me-
Now let me stop you there, Mr. Williams.
Now, Mr. Williams, you wrote on this sheet that this is a child custody case.
But I will tell you frankly, you do not have a child custody case.
Let me guess, I'm not the first lawyer you've talked to.
No, sir.
And my guess is they pretty much all stop you at this point and with good reason.
Mr. Williams, you do not have a child custody case.
Now, you may be able to dig and find some crackpot who will throw around some hallelujah phrases like psychological parent or "presumed parent" or shit like that.
And he'll feed you these words while happily cashing your checks.
But uh, I'm a moral man, Mr. Williams.
I cannot take your money to say to the world that you are really this kid's father.
Now, because you're Gloria's friend, let me give you this advice.
Even if you find your lawyer, you will never find a judge around here who will legitimize that kind of stuff.
Alright?
It's the truth.
I'm sorry you had to come all the way down here to hear it.
You uh, you give my best to Gloria now.
Joey?
Are you still here?
Yeah, uh, wanted to finish up a couple little things.
Is Ed still here?
No, he went home for the day.
Just you?
Yeah.
Did you need something?
No.
No.
Good night, Joey.
Good night, Marge.
Yeah, no I understand.
I appreciate you taking the time.
Yeah, uh, I definitely will.
Hey Joey?
Yeah Ed.
Ready for you.
Alright.
I'm sorry.
Hello?
Gloria, hey, this is Anne!
Hey Anne, it's Joey.
I think you dialed the wrong number or something.
I know, Gloria, I know.
Anne, is everything okay?
Oh yeah, absolutely.
Look, Gloria, please don't say anything.
I feel bad enough already.
I know, I owe you.
Just please, not another word about this.
You understand?
Not really.
Not another word, okay?
Okay.
Great.
I owe you big time Gloria.
Sorry about that Eileen.
Some people, there's an expiration date on forgiveness you know, so I had to call when I remembered.
No Blake, it's just this time.
Jamie's gonna be first mate just this time.
How come you're always the captain?
Do you want to be captain?
Yeah!
Okay, then what's this part of the ship?
What do you mean?
I mean what do you call this part of the ship?
I don't know.
How can you be captain if you don't know?
I don't know.
A captain has to know, Blake.
But don't feel bad, okay?
I'll teach you, and then you'll know next time.
This is the bow.
Okay bow.
The back is the stern.
This side is port.
And this side is starboard, got it?
Okay.
Can I try now?
Okay, go.
Bow.
And what's the back again?
Stern, Blake.
Chip just told you!
Port.
And starboard.
Okay, I'm captain now!
This about your kid?
Marge told me.
You going to be okay?
Found a lawyer yet?
No.
Can I see your list?
Marge said you had a list of folks.
Doesn't this just read like the Book of Revelation?
Alright Joey, you got yourself a lawyer.
You?
Me.
I thought you were retired.
Hell, you're only retired till you're not.
You want a lawyer or not?
Yeah.
Alright, you got one.
I don't know Paul, there's a lot of smart people on that list...
Oh, I wouldn't go that far.
Well, uh, there's a lot of people on that list, and they seem to be telling the same story.
I don't know much about law, but when I try to read up on stuff, it also sounds like the same story.
Seems like I can make a big huff and cause some trouble, but uh, none of it leads to Chip coming home.
Joey Williams, can I say something?
Let me just say how glad I am that I've taken you on as a client.
You are, in fact, my favorite kind of client.
I have a feeling you'll actually listen to me.
You are the kind of client who will actually listen to what I'm about to tell you and take it to heart.
You ready for this?
Yeah, you got my attention.
Joey, I am old, and I have spent most of my life doing the same damn thing,
which is too bad for me, but it's good for you.
Because I've learned a little something about legal affairs that you should know.
Alright?
First, just because the law has limits, it does not mean that it is our job to push up against and test those limits.
Those limits can be distracting.
So don't head straight for them.
Keep an open mind about where you're going to put your energy, okay?
Okay.
And number two, just because the law has limits, does not mean our lives have those same limits.
Lawyers live in courtrooms, you don't have to.
The limits of the law apply in court.
But when you're out of court, when the person across the table is no longer an adversary,
a lot more is possible.
That's uh... that's a different way of thinking about all this.
I just...
I can't see how me and the family get to talking again after all this.
Well... there may be a way for the law to help you get to that point when the person across the table is no longer an adversary.
That I haven't heard before.
Maybe I should put this down.
I'll write it down for you.
And I'll write down your homework.
So here's what you need, Joey.
You are not going to read case history.
You've got to figure out what's important here, regardless of the law.
Forget the law.
What's really important to change in your life,
what don't you want to disturb,
and what you're ready to give up.
And once you've got that sorted out, really think about who or what is in your way.
Live with these questions a while.
They sound easy, but they'll stir up a big mess.
And you'll just have to go over them again and again until you've mastered the mess.
Then we talk, okay?
Okay.
And then
I get to figure out how the law fits into all these things you've figured out.
Okay.
So, no answers today.
Yeah.
And it may take a while, just us figuring it all out, before we file a single piece of paper.
Yeah.
You're alright with that?
Yeah.
Alright.
Hey!
So I guess this is it, huh?
We better have a beer or something to celebrate, yeah?
Yeah?
Who would have thought George the mailman would be the one to miss me?
That man sure knows how to say goodbye, over and over again.
Oh thanks.
And uh, here you go.
Sorry, I'm probably breaking all kinds of laws, but here you go.
Oh.
Thanks.
Well, place looks great.
I can hardly get over it.
Yeah.
Turned out pretty nice.
Oh and Chip loves his crib by the way.
Yeah?
Oh yeah.
Good.
Yeah, I can go a little stir crazy... when everyone else around me is doing something, and I'm not.
You know, the crib was all left over pieces from Casey's project too.
Oh no kidding?
Yeah.
He would have thrown away a crib and not even known.
So, is Chip uh...
No, he's not here now.
He's with my folks, which helps, you know, having a day off now and then.
He's a good kid.
Yeah.
He's got lots of personality for a little thing, don't he?
Oh yeah.
Well...
I wanna thank you, Joey.
I really do.
For the crib, of course, and...
Well, but for more than that, for... for helping hold it all together here.
'Cause uh... you know, Chip and I...
It's just that your being here it's, it's been uh...
I don't know what the hell I'm trying to say.
I guess I'm trying to say thank you.
You've done a good job.
Well you're welcome.
Yeah?
Alright George, what'd you bring me?
No thank you.
I know what this is.
Yeah?
What is it?
You ever hear of Chip Taylor?
Sounds kind of familiar.
He's the guy that wrote...
Oh, the guy who wrote "Wild Thing."
You know Chip Taylor?
Just that one song.
Oh well, this man has written so much stuff, so much great stuff.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
He did this album, right, with like this girl on the cover holding a fiddle.
Carrie Rodriguez.
Yeah, I think that's it.
Oh that's definitely it.
Absolutely.
So, uh, during the time they'd been making all those albums, he and Carrie, they were duet albums.
And this is his first solo record after that.
And because he'd written so many songs during the time that they were a duo that really didn't make sense for them as duets, they had to make this into a double CD.
And it's just brilliant, man, just so much great stuff, like he'll...
Wait.
You know the songs already?
Oh yeah.
On the CD you just got in the mail?
Well I needed a new copy.
I gave the other one to my mom.
What's so funny about that?
No.
I...
Okay then, you're gonna have to listen to this.
C'mon.
You're gonna want one for yourself.
And since you laughed at me, I ain't gonna special order it for you.
No one laughs at Chip Taylor in my house.
I don't care how much of the house you built.
Oh God.
I hate this stuff.
Uh...
No, I got it, I got it.
Alright...
So many great songs on this.
That's not one of'em.
Hold on.
There you go.
You just throw little darts
They keep on hurting me
All that pain and still it's free
What a lucky guy
You just say little things
Mixed with lies of wanderings
I know they're just little things
But they hurt me big time
And then I watch you walk
And I like the way you walk
And I want something
I want it all the time
I'm sorry about that.
I didn't mean to.
I didn't know...
Wasn't expecting that.
Yeah, I don't quite know what happened there.
This Chip Taylor really gets a hold of you, huh?
I guess so.
Yeah.
We actually named Chip after him.
I mean, my Chip's named after this one
Yup.
I remember Rebecca didn't even put up a fight about it.
She knew better.
I'm sorry about that, I didn't...
Hey...
I'm not complaining.
No complaints here, Cody.
Hold on a second, Cody.
Yeah?
Just what kind of cheap date you take me for?
Yeah don't think this is gonna be another one of your... your one beer, two track romances.
C'mon.
You gottta take me out on the town, spin me around a little.
Yeah, you might want a...
Smart ass.
Okay, let's go.
I just don't know what I'm getting myself into here.
Morning, Joey.
Morning.
You ready for this?
Yeah.
Now remember, they'll say whatever.
Awful things.
But none of that matters.
What matters is at the end of it all, you get your turn to talk.
And they'll be there?
They'll be there.
Uh, Paul Hawks for Lee Simons at Myers.
He know you're coming?
He knows.
Lee Simons.
People here to see you.
Alright.
Sign in.
Sixth floor.
Morning Cheryl.
Paul!
Where have you been hiding yourself?
.
Oh, ya'll be in Conference Room B today.
Thank you.
Jack doing well?
Much better.
Thanks.
Tell him I say hello.
I will.
He'll be happy to hear it.
Jefferson.
Paul.
Mr. Williams, Jefferson Robinson.
Joey, good to meet you.
Paul Hawks.
Mr. Williams, why don't you take a seat right up here?
Here you go.
Paul Hawks.
Pleasure.
You alright, Mr. Williams?
If you'd like something to drink, there's water and soda over there.
Uh no, I'm okay.
Thanks.
Sure?
Alright.
Any time you need a minute, you want to take a break, just let me know.
Okay.
Thanks.
Now I'm just going to wait until I get the okay from our court reporter over there.
I'm ready.
Alright, do you want to go ahead and swear him in?
Mr. Williams, could you please raise your right hand?
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Yes, I do.
Great, let's go on record.
Mr. Williams, my name is Jefferson Robinson, and I am attorney for Mrs. Eileen Robey, and I'm going to be asking you a couple questions today.
Alright?
Okay.
Now the first one is going to be really easy.
Could you state your full name for the record please?
Joey Williams.
Alright, Mr. Williams, now uh, have you ever been deposed before?
Is this your first time?
Yes, this is my first time.
Alright, let me start off then by explaining a couple of things that'll make today go a little smoother.
This is for the record, which means our court reporter will be making a transcript of what we say here today.
To make sure we try and keep, um, misunderstandings to a minimum, please speak clearly so that the court reporter can hear you.
Also, please let me finish my question before you speak.
The reporter has a hard time dealing with two voices at once.
And the reporter cannot record gestures, so please make sure you speak all your answers.
That all make sense?
Yes, sir.
And anytime you need to confer with your lawyer, you just let us know, and we'll go off the record.
Alright?
Okay.
Now, Mr. Williams, this may be your first deposition, but...
I have to admit to you that this is also my first deposition of this sort.
It's a unique set of circumstances that's led us to this point.
I'm going to place before you a document that was signed by you as well as my client.
Do you recognize that document, Mr. Williams?
You can take as long as you need to look it over.
Yes, I recognize it.
Good.
Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to take just a little time to review what's been stipulated.
And I mean I know the document has been executed, but just to be clear about it all since we're all here.
That alright, Mr. Williams?
Sure.
Paul?
Go ahead.
Alright, so as part of this stipulation, Mr. Williams, you've requested this on the record deposition to be attended by David and Eileen Robey who are both in the room now, is that correct?
Yes, that's right.
So, the agreed format for today is that I'll ask some questions, and I really don't have that many, and then Mr. Hawks will ask some questions.
And then there'll be some cross if there are any more questions.
Is that your understanding?
Yes, it is.
So, the requests are a little unusual, but my client has agreed to it.
For your part, Mr. Williams, you've agreed to release any claims you may have, underscore may have, uh, on the home at... 161 Woodland Street, the address at which you now reside.
Yes.
In addition, you release an potential claims on bank accounts or other assets that were held by Mr. Cody Hines or jointly by yourself and Mr. Cody Hines, is that correct?
Yes.
Now, Mr. Williams, you understand that the releases you provide in this stipulation go beyond this case before us
Yes.
Ah.
Sorry, just a little more to the question.
No matter what happens in this custody case, no matter the outcome, you are releasing those claims.
Now this means you cannot claim those assets in a separate lawsuit.
You understand and agree with that?
Oh yes.
Sorry, I didn't know if you were finished.
No problem, and I appreciate you going through those preliminaries with me.
Now, um, you answered that... sorry, could the reporter read back the statement of full name please?
Joey Williams.
No middle name, Mr. Williams?
No, sir.
And you're not a Joseph?
No, just Joey.
Hm.
That's a little unusual, isn't it?
How'd that happen?
My foster Mom and Dad called me Joey.
Their last name was Williams.
When they passed, I had my name changed.
Oh, so uh Joey Williams is not your real name.
It is my real name.
Oh, sorry, it is your current legal name.
What was your name before?
Chin Mae Lang.
Sorry, could you spell that for me?
Sure.
C-H-I-N.
Then M-A-E.
Then I-A-N-G.
Now um,
I have records of a Chin Mae Lang in the Martin foster care system.
Is that you?
I doubt there was another.
I never met another.
Now, are you sure?
Because from what I can see, this Chin Mae Lang seems to have a violent record.
Not sure what you mean by a violent record-
These records seem to show you got into a lot of fights in foster care.
Mr. Williams, do you mind taking a look at this, if it's okay with your counsel?
Take a look.
If you can understand what he's talking about, you can respond.
Mr. Williams, do you understand the fights I referred to previously?
Yes, sir.
Great, so I'll ask you again.
Did you have a violent record while you were in the foster care system?
No, sir.
I'm sorry Mr. Williams, that file refers to you, yes?
Yes.
And it describes fights, yes?
Yes.
Could the court reporter please read back the original question?
So, I'll ask you again, did you have a violent record while you were in the foster care system.
Mr. Williams, is your answer still no?
It's still no.
Okay, maybe I'm not being clear.
I-
This is about fights I had when I was 12 and 13, in the orphan home.
You know, after that they moved me into foster care.
I didn't have any fights when I was in foster care, or living with the Williams, or after.
But you did change your name?
Yes.
To separate yourself from this history of violence.
Mr. Robinson, I was 16.
I don't remember all that much from then, but
I'm pretty sure I wasn't spending a whole lot of time regretting punches I threw when I was 12, or thinking about the future, you know.
I'm pretty sure changing my name had something to do with my mom and dad just dying.
Your foster mother and father.
My foster mother and father.
A lot of people seem to die around you, don't they Mr. Williams?
And a lot of people seem to puke around you, don't they Jefferson?
Can we move on?
I'm just trying to understand some history.
Alright.
Let's keep it to that.
Mr. Williams, you entered the orphan home when your biological family, your father, mother and sister died.
Is that correct?
Yes.
And then your foster mother and foster father died too.
Yes?
Yes.
And did you know Rebecca Hines?
Yes.
So Rebecca and Cody Hines too have died since you've known them.
Yes.
That's a lot of people to die in someone's life.
Yes.
And you think Chip would be safe with you?
Yes.
Mr. Williams, how long were you at the Williams' home?
Uh... two and a half years.
That's it?
Yes.
Seems like they made quite an impression in two and a half years.
Yes, they did.
And how old were you when your biological family died?
Three.
So, other than about 5 years of your life, you've not had a father and a mother.
That's right.
And you in fact did not have any family outside those 5 years.
Well that's not right.
No?
There's Cody and Chip.
Okay.
And Dave and Eileen and Blake...
Ah, sure.
Sally and Darryl.
Let's talk for a minute about Cody Hines.
How exactly did you seduce him?
Excuse me?
How did you seduce Cody Hines?
I did not seduce Cody Hines.
Cody Hines did not engage in any deviant sexual behavior before he met you, did he?
I object.
On behalf of the civilized world.
Can we keep away from conjecture and compound questions?
Mr. Williams, as far as you knew, did Cody Hines sleep with men before he met you?
As far as I know, no.
But he slept with you?
Yes.
And this started when Rebecca was pregnant with Chip?
No.
Oh this happened after Chip was born?
Yes.
After Rebecca died?
Yes.
Right after?
No.
How long after?
Uh... about seven months.
Mr. Williams, is it possible to get over the death of a loved one in seven months?
I guess.
Have you gotten over the death of Cody?
No.
Been about seven months, right?
Yes.
And you, you're not over him yet?
No.
You don't have another boyfriend?
Nope.
Mr. Williams,
Cody Hines had never been with a man before you.
Why did he choose you?
I don't know.
How did you seduce him?
I didn't.
You didn't take advantage of his, his confusion of his mourning his recently deceased bride.
No.
I listened to him was all, when he needed it.
I talked to him.
And I didn't ask him for anything.
Oh, except a paycheck.
No.
No?
You were working for him, right?
Yes, but I didn't get a paycheck.
You know, when Rebecca died, I just felt awful for Cody.
And I really liked Rebecca too, you know.
And
I had these other jobs at the time that were paying me fine, so I, I just billed through other folks' costs on Cody's project.
I didn't take any money from him during that time.
And did he know this?
I don't know.
I can't speak for him.
And you don't seem to be able to speak of him either.
You didn't say anything at Cody Hines' service did you, Mr. Williams?
No, I-
Now Mr. Williams, you...
you're not a pedophile, are you?
No.
If I were to look through your criminal history, I wouldn't find any charges?
Under your name or any other name you've assumed?
No.
Well thank you, Mr. Williams.
That's all the questions I have.
Joey, you may only have had a mother and father for a couple of years, but it looks like they at least taught you some manners in that time.
Yes, they did.
Now Joey, I'm going to back us up a little bit to where Mr...
Robinson started the deposition.
Do you remember him talking about a document you signed and about you giving up the house?
Yes, I do.
And it seems like you gave up your claims to the house and to your accounts with Cody in exchange for a deposition.
Now,
I love a good deposition as much as the next lawyer, but this is a surprising trade.
And it sounds like
Mr. Robinson was surprised too.
Could you tell us why you decided to do this?
Okay.
It's a big question.
Yeah.
But
I think it'll help Jefferson and Eileen and Dave understand why they're here.
Okay.
Yeah, okay.
So uh...
I've been thinking.
You know, being on my own now.
With the house so quiet.
With, with all this time.
I've been thinking, how'd we ever get here.
You know, how'd things ever get to the point they did.
And how'd they happen so fast, you know.
It seems like one day I was Chip's dad, Blake's Uncle Joey.
Then all of a sudden I'm Mr. Joey Williams on a police form.
I've been trying to think what exactly happened.
Sorry, it'll probably take me a while to get at your question.
That's fine, Joey.
That's fine, you take all the time you need.
Well at the beginning, all I wanted was to get Chip back.
And I was angry, so I wasn't one to think straight.
Now I look back, and all the times I tried to get through to Dave, Eileen or Sally...
I was pretty much screaming my head off.
Even that first night Eileen told me about Cody's will, I got a little hotheaded.
And that night I took Chip away.
Right or wrong, it didn't help things.
It didn't exactly make me someone they wanted to come up and talk to.
So I guess the first thing I wanted to do is tell Dave and tell Eileen I know I had my part in the way things went bad so fast.
I'm not just mad at you, I know I had my part.
Okay, I think they heard you, Joey.
Okay, now about why I traded all the stuff for a deposition.
Good.
You're right, it's not for love of the thing.
I get that feeling.
Am I doing that bad?
You're doing just fine, Joey.
You're doing just fine.
Okay, well uh... when you first said you'd be my lawyer, you asked me a question.
You asked me what was really important and what would I give up to get there.
And you figured it out.
Yeah, I figured it.
It took me a while, but I figured it out.
Cody kind of helped me figure it out.
Thinking about me and Cody.
You know, we had a good life.
A really good life.
He knew it, I knew it, but... but I guess the thing we didn't do was talk about the big stuff.
Each day kind of crept up on us and we never said big stuff.
Like I don't think I ever told him how happy I was.
It'd be nice if I did.
It'd be nice if we talked about big things like a life together and like wills, so bad on us, you know.
We didn't talk about it, so the other guy didn't know.
So I decided I am not going to make the same mistake twice.
I am going to talk about the big stuff in front of Dave and in front of Eileen.
I'm not going to assume they know what Chip means to me.
What Cody means to me.
So I want to tell them.
And this is important enough, you'll give up all that other stuff.
Oh, yeah.
I've uh...
I've started from zero a couple times in my life.
Giving up these things, I'm hardly at zero.
But Chip is family.
Dave and Eileen are family.
I think it's more important they get me than some judge gets me.
I don't know if it's going to happen, but I want to give them a chance to get me.
So, why don't I ask a couple questions about some of the stuff Jefferson mentioned?
Good.
You're going to help me out with questions.
I'm going to help you out with questions, Joey.
Now,
Jefferson mentioned you didn't speak at Cody's memorial service?
Is that right?
No.
I mean yes, that's right, I didn't speak.
Is there a reason why?
I had no idea what to say.
But I knew I should at least try and say something, right?
I planned on talking.
I sort of helped Chip up to the podium, and he went first.
I kind of stood with him while he talked about his pa.
And Chip, he was just up there telling everyone this story and that about his pa.
Had everyone cracking up and bawling all at once.
And you know, it was the first time all day it felt like Cody was close by.
When everyone else talked, it was like he was slipping away, but Chip brought him back.
And I just thought it was the right way to end things, you know.
Let his kid have the last word.
Yeah, Chip did us all a big favor that day and I wasn't about to undo it.
Joey, do you think you can share with us a few words about Cody now?
Maybe some of the things you were thinking about saying that day.
Okay.
Uh...
I don't really remember what I was going to say that day...
Why don't you just tell us a little bit about you and Cody.
Okay.
Well uh... me and Cody was pretty much a surprise to both of us.
It wasn't just you guys, we were surprised too.
I mean, I never expected we'd get together.
He was just this nice guy I sort of knew, you know.
We got along and all.
And uh...
I guess he had the idea first and one night he... out of the blue, sort of kissed me.
And uh... it just set something off.
You know?
Suddenly everything was really fun.
And I just wanted him in every minute of my life.
The more I got to know him, the more I couldn't believe I never saw all the good stuff before, you know?
Like um,
I have these musician friends, but I learned more about music just watching Cody listen to some Chip Taylor song.
Man, he loved his Chip Taylor.
Yeah, he loved his Chip Taylor, you make sure you get that in there.
He'll want that written down.
Oh Cody loved a lot of stuff.
It was kind of contagious, you know.
He saw good things in people.
Sometimes I don't know where he was looking, but he convinced us it was there.
I think it's a little harder for us to see some of the good stuff now.
Without him, I mean.
Yeah Cody was the guy I wanted to grow old with.
But uh... he's also the kind of guy you have in your life a little while, and you know you're a lucky bastard.
Now Joey, you talked a little bit about your foster parents earlier.
Can you tell me more about them?
Sure.
Um... my mom, her name was Irene Williams.
My dad was Joseph Williams.
And that's where the Joey came from?
Yeah.
What did they do?
My dad, when he was younger, he used to build boats.
He's originally from Louisiana.
As he got older, the things he built kind of got smaller.
In the end he was mostly building guitars.
Also had a shop where he bound books.
Really good with the leather bound.
And he taught you how to do some of that stuff?
.
Yeah.
We were kind of dangerous together.
You had a man who could teach you how to make anything in the world and a kid who just couldn't get enough.
It was just too cool.
Did you ever build a boat with your dad?
Yeah.
Not many people can say that.
I tell you it doesn't even begin to describe the guy.
He told me to call him Dad from day one, and he lived up to it.
You know, growing up without a family, you kind of get used to this look from grown-ups.
Yeah.
They kind of look at you like, what-am-I-gonna-do-with-you.
Dad never had that look.
He knew what he was gonna do.
He was going to be my dad, that was that.
And it was the most natural thing in the world to him.
And what did your mom do?
Oh... she was full-time crazy.
But just about the most beautiful kind of crazy you can imagine.
Yeah?
Dad made the guitars, and Mom had the friends to play them.
She loved like mountain music and dancing.
And with Mom, every week it was something new.
Yeah, you didn't know if it was going to be Mom the writer, or Mom the archeologist, or...
I swear, there were a couple of months there where all she did was make personalized urns.
Seriously, she did all this research into people's lives after they died to make the perfect urn to fit their personality.
Just out of her gourd.
It's uh, it's funny, her life was all noise and adventure and stuff, but um... when it was just the two of us, it was usually just quiet.
You know I, I guess everyone has to come down a little at some point.
But uh, us around the house, not really doing anything.
I don't know why, but that's what I think about a lot.
People like the crazy stories, but uh, that nothing around the house stuff, um, that's what I miss about Mom.
It sounds like they set a pretty good example for you as parents.
They did.
Now.
Can you tell me, Joey, why you think you'll be a good father to Chip?
Well, uh...
I guess I never really had to think about that question before.
Sure, I thought about how to be a good dad, but I didn't spend a whole lot of time trying to convince people I was up for it.
You know, I just did it.
And tried to do it better.
Now it's like I'm interviewing for the same job I had for the last six years.
But I've tried to think about the question.
You know, take myself out of it, and think about it seriously.
And I'm not about to say I'm the world's best dad.
But this is what I got.
I got a Mom and Dad who taught me how to love like a reflex.
Yeah?
If you do it all the time, it gets easy.
It gets into every little thing you do, and your kid's going to have the important stuff.
Cody, he taught me a lot.
Cody was really smart.
People sometimes forgot that about him 'cause he had all this other stuff going for him, but he was crazy smart.
Chip's the same way.
Yeah?
They are both way out of my league there, but
I saw how Cody taught Chip.
How he taught him to be creative, find out more about stuff he liked.
Yeah, you live with a real teacher like Cody and um, you learn how to help people get better.
Much better than you.
So, I know Chip will grow up to be smarter than me, and he'll go on to do important things.
But I can help him get there.
I know that's my job.
And uh, Chip is such a good kid, there's gonna be all sorts of people lining up to help him in his life.
But I'm gonna be at the front of that line.
All the time.
I know Dave and Eileen are in that line too.
They're like me, I think.
They really miss Cody, and they want to make sure Chip gets the best.
Mr. Robinson, you're right.
I've lost a lot of people in my life.
But I won't lose someone I love if I don't have to.
Yeah, I won't let Chip think I stopped loving him before I'm cold in the ground.
My life is all about that kid.
Every thing I think, he comes into the picture.
I've got his college fund going.
And I am going to teach him to throw that perfect spiral.
He is really into dragons right now.
I've got the next five lined up.
Or whatever he's into, I'll line it up.
And I'll make sure he gets every Chip Taylor album, just like his pa wanted.
He'll do his homework, eat vegetables, all of that.
Hell, we might even build a boat together.
But it won't be so he can build boats all his life.
Yeah, he's going to learn to captain the boat and all.
I swear to you, I'll give Chip everything.
I will be a good dad to him.
I know how, and I will do it.
I raised my hand today and swore to you I wasn't going to lie.
I will swear to be a good dad to him.
As many times as you need me to swear it.
Thank you, Joey.
No more questions.
Alright.
Why don't we take a quick break and we'll come back and see if we can wrap this up before long?
Alright, going off the record.
Want some coffee?
There's a kitchen around the corner.
Yeah, that'd be great.
Mind if I follow you?
Sure.
Heard about, something about coffee.
Um.
We don't have anything else Paul, so we're done for the day.
Mr. Williams.
Joey.
Hey, Dave.
You guys left in a hurry today.
Oh yeah.
Sorry Joey.
Eileen she...
You know,
I've been sorry about this since the start, I...
It was good to hear you talk.
We did hear you.
It's nice to be, to be talking again.
Yeah, we're just talking up a storm here, aren't we Dave?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I didn't know the lawyer was going to say those things.
They, they were awful.
Eileen and me both, we couldn't believe what he said.
Eileen okay?
Um, not really, no.
You all could have just talked to me before talking to the police, Dave.
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know.
I know.
And I, I think Eileen knows that too.
You were right, what you said, we have all been... we've been confused since Cody.
But she's, she's really been working hard to figure this out.
She's trying real hard.
Now I don't know if you believe it, but she is.
I believe you, Dave.
She, she's just trying to figure it out.
She know you're here?
Yeah, she's in the car.
She's not going to come out and talk to me?
I don't know.
She don't know.
But she, she wanted to let you know, uh, this is from her now, you don't have to move.
I know we signed whatever, but this is your place.
She's got that much figured out.
Still don't know what to do about uh... about everything else, but uh,
you'll give her some time, yeah?
She's not like she was where she's saying,
This is how it is.
She, uh, she really doesn't know.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Dave, you can tell her, tell her I-
Oh hell, this is ridiculous.
Eileen!
Eileen, get out here and talk to Joey!
Daddy!
Surprise!
Chip!
Hope you don't mind a guest tonight.
You are mine, Father !
Yes.
Very good, Jubei.
Yet you reveal your feelings.
In battle, you must suppress them.
You show much improvement.
Enough to begin the training with the kunai ?
You are far too young.
But I want to be like you.
And one day become general of the Shirai Ryu.
As your father, my wish is that you have the life you desire.
Yet
This is what I want Father.
Then I will train you.
Prove your dedication.
And should your heart long for this life in the future,
I will try my best to ensure you gain entrance into the clan.
Have preparations for the Shogun's arrival been completed ?
Nearly.
Kumamoto castle is very busy, being prepared with food and flowers.
And you, Jubei.
Are you prepared to offer a song in honor of his arrival ?
Mother...
I do not have time for songs anymore.
Samurai do not sing.
Is that so ?
Jubei...
It is a great privilege for our province to host the Shogun.
Yes.
Now... honor your mother and me with the same gift.
As you will soon learn, ... practices bears nothing but fruit.
Yes, Father.
Teru-teru-teru-bozu, teru bozu,
Do make tomorrow a sunny day,
One day Jubei... will learn his life... cannot include the Shirai Ryu.
One day.
And on that day, he will also learn... how much his father loves him.
General Hasashi.
We come on behalf on Lord Ryuk.
He has arrived early and requires your immediate presence at Kumamoto castle.
One moment.
The Shogun has arrived earlier than expected.
I have been summoned to the castle.
I should be back by morning.
Bi Han ?
Hanzo.
You dare kill the Shogun !
A necessary step.
My village...
Is without means to defend itself.
And your inferior Shirai Ryu will finally meet its end.
Previously on "army wives"...
We both want to have another child.
Preaching to the choir, woman.
Finn's dad is your contractor, he's living in your parking lot,
And trevor's cool with this?
We got a standing order to deport.
(claudia joy) elena, your green card is a forgery.
No, no, that's impossible.
My mother, she paid for it in el salvador.
Whoever your mother paid was a crook.
We may need to pull some strings with the army.
Okay, I'll try.
I've been having this pain on my right side.
What's wrong?
...And I went to my doctor.
She found a mass.
Thank you.
What, um,
What--what exactly did the doctor say?
Um... (sniffles)
She did an ultrasound and found a mass.
And so I need a, um, c.T. Scan tomorrow.
To confirm the diagnosis?
Mm-hmm.
I have an appointment, uh, with a specialist off post.
Hartnett memorial hospital.
H-have you talked to your husband?
No.
I-I don't want to worry michael with this.
It could be a-- it could be a false alarm.
Well, how about your daughter?
I don't really want anyone to know right now.
I'm fine, grant.
I am.
You just--you caught me at a bad time.
That's all.
Okay.
(whispers indistinctly)
¶
(horn honks)
(machinery whirring, indistinct conversations)
Hey, bubba!
Hey, whit.
All right, finn, now you're the sandwich man.
You gotta make sure everyone gets one, okay?
Yes, ma'am.
Okay.
Lunch!
No school?
Half day.
Teacher meeting.
So he's working for me this afternoon.
It seems like we're all working for you, miss roxy.
(chuckles) hey!
Easy on the help.
I need that arm.
Saved you one, whit.
Tuna and swiss--your favorite.
Hey, thanks, bubba.
I appreciate that.
Mom, can I go see the backhoe?
No.
The construction site is not a playground.
Your mama's right.
Playing's not allowed.
But working'--that's a whole nother matter.
What do you say, rox?
Think I can draft this able-bodied man
For a little job?
Please, mom?
Okay, for one minute.
Yes!
Yes!
(chuckles) hold on, bubba.
Safety first.
There you go.
Come on.
Okay, be careful.
Whit, I mean it.
Yes, ma'am.
(engine starts) all right, man.
First, left hand here.
This is so cool.
All right, let's go this way.
(sizzles)
(groans)
(sniffles and sighs)
(sighs)
Oh, that smells good.
(sniffles)
D.?
Hey.
(chuckles) it's silly.
Um, I just spilled water.
(sniffles)
Well, at least it wasn't milk.
You know, crying over spilled milk?
Right.
Hey.
Hey.
What's going on, honey?
(inhales deeply)
Lately, I just find myself crying for no reason.
There's a reason, honey.
No, I mean, um,
It happens at the oddest times, and I can't control it.
(sighs)
I assumed it would go away, but so far...
Have you tried talking to chaplain maris?
Yeah, he suggested his grief support group.
I know it's not exactly your cup of tea, but...
No, let's go.
Really?
You'd come?
If it'll help, of course.
Thank you.
(sizzling)
Is that my lunch that's burning?
Oh. (sniffles)
(pan rattles) (groans)
(woman) joan, what's going on?
Roland and I have decided to have a second child.
Really?
That is wonderful.
Well, thank you.
We're both excited.
So what changed?
'cause last time we talked, you weren't so sure.
I know.
Uh...
Well, it may sound obvious, but, uh, we want sara elizabeth
To have a little brother or sister...
(chuckles)
And the clock is ticking, so...
So let's get this exam started.
(pamela) hey.
(indistinct conversations)
What's this for?
Oh, I don't know.
Saving my wedding, talking me off the ledge,
Taking the kids so chase and I could do
An overnight in savannah-- take your pick.
Aw.
Hi, mrs.
Moran.
What can I get you?
Half day at fordham.
(laughs) uh, well, then I'll have a diet orange.
One diet orange.
Coming right up.
(laughs)
Oh.
So how's it feel being a waiter?
I like working at the truck stop better.
The truck stop?
Whit let me drive the backhoe.
Really?
Whit's a nice guy, huh?
Uh-huh.
And look what we found.
It's a fossil shark's tooth.
Miocene epoch, I think.
We read about it in class.
Wow.
That's pretty cool.
Whit said we can go back
On the weekend and dig for more stuff.
One diet orange.
Can I get you anything else, ma'am?
I'm good.
Thanks. (chuckles)
¶
Pretty cute, huh?
Yeah.
Can I open that now?
Oh.
¶
(chuckles)
I love it.
Good.
(jet engine roaring)
Make sure you run a bore brush through that saw.
Roger, sergeant.
Hey, don't listen to that e-5, riggs.
We got a new e-6 coming in to run things.
What?
What, is that a joke?
Promotion list just came down.
Your name was on it.
Believe that?
Staff sergeant leblanc.
What's this army coming to?
(giron) congratulations, sergeant.
Yeah.
About time they paid you for what you doing anyway.
Roger that.
Yeah, I bet roxy's gonna like that jump in pay.
I can supervise if you wanna hit the phone tent
And give her a call.
(helicopter blades whirring)
She's probably working.
I'll call her later.
Thanks.
Whatever you say, staff sergeant.
Good-bye.
(whistles and imitates explosion)
You don't look well.
Are you eating?
Elena?
I'm not a criminal.
I know that.
And we are doing everything we can to get you out of here.
But you have to eat.
You have to think about your baby.
(crying) they're going to send me back to el salvador.
Elena, did you hear me?
You have to hold on.
You can't lose hope.
Okay?
She's in bad shape, grant.
Tell her we're doing everything we can.
I did.
Good.
Are we?
Yes.
I've filed the appeal,
But it's unlikely to be heard before her deadline is up.
So where are we with specialist cabrera?
I still haven't heard back from michael yet.
Well, assuming we do get ahold of him in afghanistan,
He's still gonna have to go through all that red tape.
You sound pessimistic.
No, I'm just realistic.
Grant, we promised elena.
I know what we promised, claudia joy,
But immigration law makes the tax code look easy.
So barring an act of congress,
I-I don't know what else we can do right now.
Wait.
Are you serious about an act of congress?
A state senator or a congressman
Could introduce a private bill
Requesting a stay on elena's behalf,
But I mean, unless you know someone-- I do.
I do.
Jean calhoun.
You mean senator calhoun's widow?
Mm-hmm.
She's a friend and she still has friends on the hill.
Well, now it's worth a shot.
Okay.
I'm on it.
Oh, claudia joy.
Do you have someone helping you through...
I'm fine, grant.
No, but what about your friend, you know, uh...
Denise?
No, no, no.
I would not drop this on her,
Not after what she's been through.
I appreciate your concern, truly.
But for now, I can...
I can handle this myself.
Thanks.
Okay.
(roland) what exactly did dr.
Lang say?
Well, the complications from my first delivery
Left scars on my uterine wall.
Coupled with my age,
It would make this a high-risk pregnancy.
High risk?
Did she advise you not to get pregnant?
Well, she said ultimately, the choice was mine.
Ours.
But her recommendation was not to go forward.
Look, roland, I know this would be physically demanding,
But I'm up for it.
I'm fit.
I'm strong.
I battled through my t.B.I., didn't I?
Joan, pregnancy isn't supposed to be a battle.
Tell that to a woman in her third trimester.
No, uh,
I'm serious, joan.
So am I.
(sighs) you've already made up your mind.
I have.
Do I at least get a vote?
Of course.
But you know how I feel.
(door opens)
(door closes)
(bell tolls)
(indistinct conversations)
(carrie) denise?
Carrie.
Hi.
Nice to see you.
Oh, you, too.
Um, this is my husband frank.
Frank, this is carrie myers.
Her husband was major steve myers.
I knew him well.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
Thank you.
I was so sorry to hear about your son.
Is this your first time?
I've missed the last couple of sessions.
Yeah, it is.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, why don't we get started?
It's very informal.
You don't have to talk if you don't want to.
I see some new faces.
Welcome.
Now this is a safe environment.
Hmm?
We're not a therapy group.
We're a support group.
Uh, we encourage you to be honest,
To listen, and share.
Who'd like to begin?
(t.J.) it's not fair.
Finn's little, and he got to drive the backhoe.
I'm not little.
(sighs) t.J., the light.
Why the fuss?
I thought you didn't even like whit.
Well, that's before I knew him.
I mean, whit's really cool,
And I want to go to the job site.
Please, mom.
Okay, okay.
Can you please just focus?
I can't do this in the dark.
I'm not little.
(chaplain maris) I think it's normal,
What you're experiencing, denise.
Anybody?
Laura.
(sniffles) I was on a walk yesterday
And passed a freshly cut lawn.
You know that smell?
(chuckles)
All of a sudden, I-I had an image
Of darren pushing a lawn mower.
He--he did that for extra money in high school.
And I started crying, just like now.
He's been gone for two years.
But I don't--I don't fight it anymore, denise.
I-I just accept it.
That's all.
I think what laura is talking about
Is the distinction between grief and sadness.
For most of us, grief fades over time,
But sadness...
I don't know if that ever goes away or should.
Thank you.
Carrie, you've been quiet tonight.
Not much to say.
You want to share what you told me earlier?
Um, uh, this is my last session.
I'm moving off post this week.
Why?
It's time.
It's been almost a year since steve...
I'm--I'm taking the kids to live near my folks in illinois.
We'll miss you.
I'll miss you, too.
(crying) I wish I felt that his sacrifice was worth it...
But after all the time we've spent here together,
I don't.
I still don't know
Why steve had to die in a meaningless war.
Excuse me?
Frank.
No.
No, I want you to explain yourself.
My husband died in a country that doesn't want us,
For a country that doesn't care.
He died for nothing.
And we're supposed to just listen to this?
Frank, there's no judgment--
You're just gonna let her go on like that?
I'm encouraging her to go on like that.
It's how she feels.
I won't be a part of this.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
(chaplain maris) it's all right.
(people speak indistinctly)
Frank.
Frank, you have to apologize.
What?
You have to go back in there and apologize to those people,
Especially carrie.
I will do no such thing.
Frank.
She's stepping on the flag, d.
She doesn't see it that way.
She said that jeremy died for nothing.
She did not say that.
She sure as hell did.
Now you can go back in there
If you want to-- no, you need to go back in there.
She lost a husband, just like we lost a son,
And if we want to be a part of that group-- I will not be in the same room with that woman.
(knocks on door)
Well, I take it congress isn't going into emergency session
To help us.
Mnh-mnh.
Jean calhoun thinks it's outrageous
That the wife of a deployed serviceman
Is facing deportation.
But?
(sighs) a lot of her friends lost in the last election
And the rest aren't willing to stick their necks out.
Well, you sound surprised.
Disappointed.
Well, immigration is a hot-button issue.
Grant, we're running out of time here.
There has to be something else we can do.
Well, what if there isn't?
I don't know, but I'm not willing to sit there
And let elena be sent away.
Maybe you're ready to quit on her.
I'm not.
I'm sorry.
Look, claudia joy,
Go home, get some rest.
You got a big day tomorrow.
I care about her, too, claudia joy.
(inhales and exhales deeply)
Out like a light.
I'm thinking some mint chocolate chip.
How about you?
I don't like it.
What?
You love mint chocolate chip.
You know what I mean.
I talked to dr.
Seaver over at mercer.
He's an expert on these things.
And he told you about the chances
Of miscarriage and uterine rupture.
Yes, he did.
A uterine rupture could be fatal, joan,
To you and the baby.
And with the amount of scarring you have,
He says your odds go way up.
I'm aware of that.
It's not worth it, joan.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
I'm not gonna put your life on the line.
Now you said I had a vote.
That's my vote.
No.
So that's it?
No.
There's adoption.
Roland, we're not adopting.
Why not?
Look, we...
We both want a second child.
We've got the means to provide--
No, we are not doing that.
Joan, adoption is--
Adoption is for people who can't have kids on their own.
That is not us.
It's not me, anyway.
You gonna talk to me?
D.?
You heard chaplain maris.
That group is supposed to be a safe place.
They...
Those people helped me.
They reached out to me, frank, and you insulted them.
I did not.
Yes, you did.
Well, that woman was--
Th-that woman's name is carrie.
She has three children and no husband,
And she was the first one to welcome us tonight.
Well, she shouldn't have said what she said.
Why not?
She lost her husband.
She can say whatever she wants.
Not to me, she can't.
Well, to me, then.
D.
You know, sometimes I don't understand you, frank.
You think you can tell the whole world how to feel?
You think carrie myers is the only army wife
To question the cause?
Well, let me tell you something.
Every mother who loses a child wants to know what it was for
And if it was worth it-- every one.
Hey, joan.
Roland, we don't have time to get into this right now.
I can't be late.
Will you just tell me why you came down so hard last night?
Will you hold on for one second, please?
Look, I get your disappointment about pregnancy.
You know, maybe it was insensitive of me
To bring up adoption so soon.
It was.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
But, sweetheart, there are all sorts of reasons to adopt.
It's not just about an inability to conceive.
Can I go now?
No.
Look, I just want to know what's bothering you.
Nothing is bothering me.
I just don't think adoption is the right road for us.
That's all.
Look, it's not a failure if we decide to go a different route.
That's not it.
So what is it?
Me.
For some women, being a mom comes naturally.
Not for me.
You know that.
It was a role I had to learn.
But you did.
You learned.
Hey, joan, you're a fantastic mother.
I don't think I can...
I'm not sure I could love someone else's child
The way I love my own.
Okay?
I gotta go.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Okay.
The c.T. Scan
Confirms that you have a tumor on your right ovary.
It's about 6 centimeters in diameter.
Okay.
So now what?
Well, we need to go in and remove it.
The ovary as well, I'm afraid.
It's a laparoscopic procedure.
It's minimally invasive.
Nevertheless, I'll want you to stay overnight for observation.
When?
As soon as we can get you ready.
There's no sense in delaying.
If it is cancer, we want to get it now.
I booked an o.R. For 6:00 this evening.
Please don't eat or drink anything between now and then
So your stomach is empty before the anesthesia, okay?
Mrs. Holden, depending on what we find,
We may need to remove more than just the ovary.
Now we're talking anything
From a partial to a radical hysterectomy.
I need you to be prepared for that possibility.
The pathology report should take 12 to 24 hours
After the procedure.
Any questions?
(woman speaking indistinctly over p.A.)
Oh.
I-I didn't think you should be alone for this.
Uh, hope you don't mind.
No.
So what'd they say?
(sighs)
(people speaking indistinctly)
(vehicle approaches)
(horn honks)
(indistinct conversations continue)
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I was just driving around post because I can,
With my new I.D. Card.
(gasps) wow!
Good picture.
Right?
The new and improved army wife.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're all set, rox.
Hiya, pamela.
Oh, thank you.
You're a lifesaver.
Hey, whit.
Wanna play?
(children speaking indistinctly)
(laughs) all right.
Only for a minute, though.
Your mom's got me on a tight schedule.
(laughs)
What do y'all want to do, two-on-one?
I thought he was never coming on post.
Oh, washing machine emergency.
Roxy.
I tried to fix it myself.
Look, I don't remember you having such a problem with whit
When he saved your wedding with his generator.
That was different.
Oh, really?
How?
This was a onetime emergency, just like that was.
I'm just a little worried about you.
That's all.
I'm not sure you're thinking clearly.
Pamela, I'm fine.
There is nothing to worry about, believe me.
Okay.
You wanna stay for some tea?
Uh, no.
I gotta pick up the kids.
Maybe tomorrow?
Sure.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
(whit laughs)
(laughs) fumble.
Great tackle, guys.
I'm so glad you could drop by.
Well, I'm glad you called.
(sighs) the house is a mess,
And the packers just left for the day.
Oh, I can imagine.
Mm.
How are the kids handling it, the move and everything?
It's tough.
The army's all they've ever known.
But we have each other,
And we'll get through it as a family.
I hope you like oatmeal raisin.
(chuckles) my favorite.
I don't know how you find the time to make 'em.
I should've come by sooner, denise.
You and claudia joy were so kind to me when steve was killed.
I'm sorry.
Please.
I should be the one apologizing,
After last night.
No, it's okay.
No, it's not.
Your husband's a soldier.
Honestly...
He reminds me of steve--
Army all the way.
Yeah, that's frank.
In a way, I envy them.
To them, the world is black and white,
Right and wrong.
The good guys and the bad guys.
It's not that way, though, is it?
No.
It's not.
(indistinct conversations)
(engines whirring)
Hey, pamela.
Hey.
I was just driving by, and I thought maybe we could,
Uh, talk for a minute.
Yeah, sure.
What's up?
I know who you are, whit.
I mean, being finn's dad.
Roxy told me the first time you were here.
Yeah, I'm just here to do a job.
That's all.
Really?
Dancing with roxy at my wedding,
Digging for fossils with finn,
Playing football with the boys...
Okay, I-I know how that might look, but I mean,
I think roxy can take care of herself, don't you?
No, I don't.
She's not thinking clearly right now.
Trevor's been gone a long time, and she's struggling.
I just want to help.
Yeah, but you're not the man of the house, whit.
Trevor is.
I know.
So whether you mean to or not,
Your being here confuses things for roxy...
And for the boys.
You really wanna help?
Yeah.
Go home.
(indistinct conversations continue)
(car engine starts)
(car pulls away)

(intercom beeps)
(telephone beeps) yeah?
(woman) general holden's on line one.
Uh, put him through.
(beep)
Hello, general.
I was looking for my wife.
Her cell went right to voice mail,
And nobody's picking up at home.
Yeah, well, we're working late tonight,
And, um, I don't know exactly where she is.
You want me to take a message?
I've got some news about specialist cabrera.
Oh.
Uh, go ahead.
I can take that.
His unit's coming back to camp eagle today.
Well, that's great.
Uh, listen, um,
You wouldn't happen to have a, like a video hookup
We could talk to him on?
We have a facility here, yeah.
Uh, here's the problem.
I don't think we can get the bureaucracy
To work fast enough unless we get a little help.
So if specialist cabrera could talk to a reporter,
Then the resulting press-- absolutely not.
The army will not participate in one of your publicity gimmicks.
Now--now wait just a minute, general.
I know how you operate, chandler, and I don't like it.
With due respect, general, the wife of one of your soldiers
Is gonna be deported unless we can shake things up here.
Now I know it may be personally distasteful,
But sometimes publicity is the only card left to play.
So we can sit here butting heads over it,
Or we can try to help an innocent woman.
Your call.
(mouth full) that was a terrific dinner, honey.
Thanks.
And these cookies are fantastic.
What is that, a new recipe or something?
They're not mine.
Carrie myers brought 'em over.
I invited her.
May I ask why?
So I could apologize for you.
You shouldn't have done that.
Well, I disagree.
You misjudged her.
No, I heard what she said.
No, you heard the words.
You didn't hear what she was saying.
She's in pain, frank.
She's raising three children by herself,
And she has to move out of the state,
And she misses her husband every minute of every day.
Don't you get that?
Of course I do.
That's still no reason for her--
To what?
To blame the army?
Well, who else is she gonna blame?
It's--it's not about that anyway.
It's not about what you think, the mission,
The noble sacrifice.
It's about living with a hole in your life
For the rest of your life.
(molly crying)
I'd think about that before I pass judgment
On another grieving widow.
(molly continues crying)
Hey.
Hey.
(inhales and exhales deeply)
You're wrong, you know.
(chuckles)
About what this time?
Your capacity as a mother.
How about the way you cared for molly the other night?
You seemed pretty loving then.
Yeah, well, that's different.
Molly's a dream, and she's frank and denise's daughter.
Well, every child is somebody's son or daughter.
Yeah.
Yeah, I suppose.
Hey, look, joan,
Adoption isn't exactly what I had in mind either.
But if we're serious about wanting a larger family,
I think it's something that we should at least consider.
It took courage to admit what you told me,
To share your fears.
To be honest, I've had a few myself.
I'm just talking about taking the first step here,
You know?
It's the first baby step.
Hey, look, sweetheart,
There might be legitimate reasons not to adopt,
But I know you, so let's be clear--
The size of your heart isn't one of 'em.
Thank you.
How you feeling?
Tired.
Um, saw it at the gift shop.
It wraps around the bed.
Mm.
See?
(chuckles)
It's cute.
Thanks.
So how'd it go?
They got the tumor.
They didn't have to take anything else.
Good.
I get the lab results tomorrow,
Find out if it's cancer, you know.
Right.
Um, your husband called the office looking for you.
I...
I told him you were tied up with work.
Thanks.
He had information about specialist cabrera.
Uh...
Well, I'll--I'll let you get your rest.
Uh, I'll see you tomorrow.
Wait.
Wait.
Um,
What about--what about specialist cabrera?
Don't you worry about that now.
Okay?
Just...
Wait.
Wait.
Grant.
I might have some news in the morning.
Get some rest.
Good night.
Good night.
Hey.
Hey, rox.
Brought you a little somethin' somethin'.
All right.
Thanks.
Hey, guys, doughnuts.
How's it goin'?
Good.
(machinery whirring)
Listen, I hate to do this to you, but, uh,
I got a call from a buddy of mine back home last night.
He's building a new subdivision,
And he wants me to oversee the whole thing.
New subdivision?
Yeah, houses.
I know what a subdivision is.
I just didn't know anybody was building them these days.
They are.
I won't leave you high and dry, though, rox.
I, uh, met a guy down at the lumberyard.
He checks out.
He's gonna finish the job for you, same money.
You always were a really bad liar, whit.
I ain't lying'.
Look, I shouldn't have come here.
What are you talking about?
Ugh.
I just--you.
You're not thinking clearly these days, rox.
Says who?
Says me.
I should go home.
You do, and I'll sue you for breach of contract.
Rox.
I mean it, whit.
We signed a contract.
You do not move an inch until you are done with this job.
Where are you going?
(engine turns over)
Hey, pamela.
Hey.
Please tell me you did not talk to whit.
Roxy, I-I--
I can't believe you did that.
Well, listen.
I just want--
No, you listen.
You stay away from him.
I need whit to help me build that truck stop.
I just thought that before--
That what?
That--that you'd mess with my project?
I mean, you do understand
That this is my money we're talking about here, right?
Okay, now hold on.
You aren't seriously telling me
That whit is the only contractor that can do that job.
On time and on budget, yes.
Oh, come on.
Come on what?
Roxy, you asked whit here because you wanted him around.
You are so out of bounds.
Roxy, he's practically walked into your-- how many times do I have to tell you that we are only friends?
If it's all so innocent, how come you haven't told trevor?
I told you, I've tried.
How hard is it to send an e-mail,
Even if you're scared to tell him on the phone?
Ugh.
That's it.
Roxy, you already broke your rule about him coming on post.
What is next?
He is just a friend.
Why can't you just leave it alone?
Because he was just a friend
The last time you slept with him, that's why.
Shut up, pamela.
Just shut up.
Roxy, since jeremy died, you've been acting like
Trevor's gone, too, and he's not.
He's alive and he's still your husband,
And sooner or later, he's coming home.
All I'm trying to say-- I can't believe you just said that.
Roxy.
No, you know what?
Stay away from me, okay?
Stay away from me.
Almost ready.
No rush, counselor.
Okay.
Oh.
Can't forget this.
(chuckles)
It's sweet.
(woman) ...
News desk for the latest developments.
(man) as reported earlier, elena cabrera,
Pregnant wife of army specialist antonio cabrera,
A decorated soldier currently serving in afghanistan,
Faces deportation to el salvador later this week.
(man) I was born in el salvador,
And I'm a citizen of the United States...
Grant, how did you make this-- shh.
Your husband arranged it.
My wife didn't know her green card was fake.
She's--she's been working and paying taxes
In the United States for six years.
She's--she's applying for citizenship.
She's always done the right thing.
We both have.
That's why I'm fighting here.
We love the United States.
How can they deport her for that?
(man) wsvd news asked that very question
Of a leading washington immigration official,
Who had no explanation.
That's fantastic.
Let's just hope it works, huh?
(chuckles)
Oh, here, ma'am.
Let me help you with that.
Oh, no.
I've got it.
That's okay.
Ma'am, come on.
Please.
Thank you.
You got that?
Yeah, I've got it.
Thank you.
(frank exhales)
Look, uh, I wanted to apologize for the other night.
Thanks, but I don't need it.
I understand how you feel.
Fair enough.
But maybe I didn't understand how you feel.
Maybe I do a little better now.
(door opens)
It's all right, sweetheart.
He's a friend.
That's my oldest.
Very protective of her mother.
Well, denise, uh,
Well, let's just say she broadened my perspective.
(chuckles) is that code for "gave you a talking to"?
Look, ma'am... (sighs)
Perhaps you do understand me,
But what I wanted to say is that
The army is more than just symbols to me.
It is flesh and blood.
It is the soldier on your left, the soldier on your right.
That's who you fight for.
That's who you die for.
Now I was supposed to have been
On that chopper your husband was piloting.
I got pulled the last minute.
So maybe that's why I feel his sacrifice so strongly.
He was a fine soldier, ma'am.
And I wanted you to know that.
Thank you.
I wish you well.
(crying)
(roland) we've gone over
The state's requirements for adoption,
And we are confident that we can provide
A stable, loving home.
It's been our dream to have a second child.
I appreciate that, colonel burton,
But I have to tell you that state adoption
Would be a difficult process in your case.
Difficult?
Difficult how?
Military families-- they often struggle to meet
State regulations regarding residency and home ownership.
Colonel burton could be reassigned on a moment's notice.
Isn't that true?
Yes.
Uh, technically.
Even the possibility of deployment
Can create an unstable environment for a child.
So you're saying we can't adopt?
I'm saying...
It would be a difficult process.
Huh.
I'm gonna file a complaint.
Roland.
It's discriminatory, joan.
Bias against all military families.
How is that not wrong?
Well, think how it looks from where she's sitting.
No.
I don't want to.
We're good parents, joan.
Yes, we are.
And if we can't use the state, we'll find a private agency.
Really?
That's expensive.
So?
We'll sell the yacht.
Huh.
Right.
(indistinct conversations)
After I became aware of the extenuating circumstances,
Naturally, uh, I couldn't allow
Such a miscarriage of justice to take place.
(grant) naturally.
(chuckles) that's why I have granted mrs.
Cabrera
Humanitarian parole,
Allowing her to remain in this country
While she continues her application for citizenship.
You gotta love hypocrites like that.
When they make the right decisions, yes.
Thank you.
Thank you both so much, so much.
Of course.
If it's a boy, we're calling him grant.
Ah.
And if it's a girl, claudia.
Oh.
Si.
Si.
Sweet.
Hey, more champagne.
Oh, thank you.
(cell phone rings)
Oh.
Excuse me.
(rings and beeps)
(indistinct conversations)
Si. (speaks spanish)
Yes, okay.
Okay, thank you.
Uh, you, too.
Good-bye.
(beep)
It's not cancer.
(exhales) (sighs)
(chuckles)
Oh, claudia joy...
I should go.
No.
Wait.
Uh... (groans)
(cell phone rings)
(ring)
(beeps)
Michael.
Oh, honey, I-I'm so sorry I couldn't pick up
The other night when you called.
Well, that's okay.
I know you had a lot on your plate.
Mm.
Thank you for that video hookup.
It worked.
Elena cabrera is not being deported. (chuckles)
Well, that's great,
But I can do you one better.
We're coming home.
Really?
Next week.
Everything got moved up.
We just received redeployment orders, the whole division.
You're coming home?
I'm coming home.
Michael, that is the best news I've heard all day.
Captioned by closed captioning services, inc.
Subs straight from CC
Previously on Army Wives...
We both want to have another child.
...Preaching to the choir, woman.
...Finn's dad is your contractor, he's living in your parking lot, and Trevor's cool with this?
We've got a standing order to deport.
Elena, your green card is a forgery.
No, no.
That's impossible.
My mother, she paid for it in El Salvador.
Whoever your mother paid was a crook.
...We may need to pull some strings with the Army.
Okay.
I'll try.
I've been having this pain on my right side.
- What's wrong?
- And I went to my doctor.
She found a mass.
Thank you.
What...
What exactly did the doctor say?
Um...
She did an ultrasound and found a mass.
And so I need a CT scan tomorrow.
To confirm the diagnosis?
Mmm-hmm.
I have an appointment with a specialist off post.
Hartnett Memorial Hospital.
Have you talked to your husband?
No, I don't want to worry Michael with this.
It could be a false alarm.
Well, how about your daughter?
I don't really want anyone to know right now.
I'm fine, Grant.
I am.
You just caught me at a bad time, that's all.
Okay.
- Hey, bubba!
- Hey, Whit!
All right, Finn, now you're the sandwich man.
You got to make sure everyone gets one, okay?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.
Lunch!
No school?
Half day.
Teacher meetings.
So he's working for me this afternoon.
Yeah, it seems like we're all working for you, Miss Roxy.
Hey, easy on the help.
I need that arm.
I saved you one, Whit.
Tuna and Swiss, your favorite.
Hey, thanks, bubba.
I appreciate that.
Mom, can I go see the backhoe?
No.
The construction site is not a playground.
Your mom is right.
Playing's not allowed.
But working?
That's a whole other matter.
What do you say, Rox?
Think I could draft this able-bodied man for a little job?
Please, Mom?
Okay, for one minute.
Yes!
Hold on, bubba.
Safety first.
There you go.
Come on.
Okay, be careful.
Whit!
I mean it.
Yes, ma'am.
All right, man.
First, your left hand here.
- So cool.
- All right.
Let's go this way.
Ah!
That smells good.
D?
Hey.
It's silly.
I just spilled water.
Well, at least it wasn't milk.
You know, crying over spilt milk?
Right.
Hey.
Hey.
What's going on, honey?
Lately, I just find myself crying for no reason.
There's a reason, honey.
No, I mean, it happens at the oddest times and I can't control it.
I assumed it would go away, but so far...
You try talking to Chaplain Maris?
Yeah, he suggested his grief support group.
I know it's not exactly your cup of tea, but...
No, let's go.
Really?
You'd come?
If it'll help, of course.
Thank you.
Is that my lunch that's burning?
Joan.
What's going on?
Roland and I have decided to have a second child.
Really?
That is wonderful.
Well, thank you.
We're both excited.
So what changed?
Because last time we talked, you weren't so sure.
I know.
Well, it may sound obvious, but we want Sara Elizabeth to have a little brother or sister.
And the clock is ticking, so...
So, let's get this exam started.
Hey.
What's this for?
Oh, I don't know.
Saving my wedding, talking me off a ledge, taking the kids so Chase and I could do an overnight in Savannah.
- Take your pick.
- Aw!
Hi, Mrs. Moran.
What can I get you?
Half day at Fordham.
Well then, I'll have a diet orange.
One diet orange.
Coming right up.
So, how's it feel being a waiter?
I like working at the truck stop better.
The truck stop?
Whit let me drive the backhoe.
Really?
- Whit's a nice guy, huh?
- Uh-huh.
And look what we found.
It's a fossil shark's tooth.
Miocene epoch, I think.
We've read about it in class.
Wow, that's pretty cool.
Whit said we can go back on the weekend and dig for more stuff.
One diet orange.
Can I get you anything else, ma'am?
I'm good.
Thanks.
- Pretty cute, huh?
- Yeah.
- Can I open that now?
- Oh!
I love it.
Good.
Make sure you run a bore brush through that SAW.
Roger, Sergeant.
Hey, don't listen to that E-Five, Riggs.
We got a new E-Six coming in to run things.
- What?
- Was that a joke?
Promotion list just came down.
Your name was on it.
Believe that?
Staff Sergeant LeBlanc.
What's this Army coming to?
Congratulations, Sergeant.
Yeah, about time they paid you for what you're doing, anyway.
- Roger that.
- Yeah, I bet Roxy's going to like that jump in pay.
I can supervise if you want to hit the phone tent, give her a call.
She's probably working.
I'll call her later, thanks.
Whatever you say, Staff Sergeant.
You don't look well.
Are you eating?
Elena?
I'm not a criminal.
I know that.
And we are doing everything we can to get you out of here.
But you have to eat.
You have to think about your baby.
They're going to send me back to El Salvador.
Elena, did you hear me?
You have to hold on.
You can't lose hope.
Okay?
She's in bad shape, Grant.
Tell her we're doing everything we can.
- I did.
- Good.
Are we?
Yes.
I've filed the appeal, but it's unlikely to be heard before her deadline is up.
So where are we with Specialist Cabrera?
I still haven't heard back from Michael yet.
Well, assuming we do get a hold of him in Afghanistan, he's still going to have to go through all that red tape.
You sound pessimistic.
No, I'm just realistic.
Grant, we promised Elena.
Well, I know what we promised, Claudia Joy, but immigration law makes the tax code look easy.
So barring an act of Congress,
I don't know what else we can do right now.
Wait, are you serious about an act of Congress?
A state senator or congressman could introduce a private bill requesting a stay on Elena's behalf.
But unless you know someone...
I do.
I do.
Jean Calhoun.
You mean, Senator Calhoun's widow?
She's a friend.
And she still has friends on the Hill.
Well, that's worth a shot.
Okay.
I'm on it.
Claudia Joy.
Do you have someone helping you through...
I'm fine, Grant.
Yeah, but what about your friend?
Denise?
No, no, no.
I would not drop this on her.
Not after what she's been through.
I appreciate your concern, truly, but for now I can handle this myself.
Thanks.
Okay.
What exactly did Dr. Lang say?
Well, the complications from my first delivery left scars on my uterine wall.
Coupled with my age would make this a high-risk pregnancy.
High risk.
Did she advise you not to get pregnant?
Well, she said ultimately, the choice was mine.
Ours.
But her recommendation was not to go forward.
Look, Roland, I know this would be physically demanding, but I'm up for it.
I'm fit, I'm strong.
I battled through my TBI, didn't I?
Joan, pregnancy isn't supposed to be a battle.
Tell that to a woman in her third trimester.
No.
I'm serious, Joan.
So am I.
You've already made up your mind.
I have.
Do I at least get a vote?
Of course.
But you know how I feel.
Denise?
Carrie, hi.
Nice to see you.
This is my husband, Frank.
Frank, this is Carrie Myers.
Her husband was Major Steve Myers.
I knew him well.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
Thank you.
I was so sorry to hear about your son.
Is this your first time?
I've missed the last couple of sessions.
Yeah, it is.
Okay, why don't we get started?
It's very informal.
You don't have to talk if you don't want to.
I see some new faces.
Welcome.
Now this is a safe environment.
We're not a therapy group, we're a support group.
We encourage you to be honest, to listen and share.
Who'd like to begin?
It's not fair.
Finn's little and he got to drive the backhoe.
I'm not little.
T.J., the light.
Why the fuss?
I thought you didn't even like Whit.
Well, that was before I knew him.
Whit's really cool and I want to go to the job site.
Please, Mom?
Okay, okay.
Can you please just focus?
I can't do this in the dark.
I'm not little.
I think it's normal, what you're experiencing, Denise.
Anybody?
Laura.
I was on a walk yesterday and passed a freshly cut lawn.
You know that smell?
All of a sudden I had an image of Darren pushing a lawn mower.
He did that for extra money in high school.
And I started crying.
Just like now.
He's been gone for two years.
But I don't fight it anymore, Denise.
I just accept it.
That's all.
I think what Laura is talking about is the distinction between grief and sadness.
For most of us, grief fades over time.
But sadness?
I don't know if that ever goes away.
Or should.
Thank you.
Carrie.
You've been quiet tonight.
Not much to say.
You want to share what you told me earlier?
This is my last session.
I'm moving off post this week.
Why?
It's time.
It's been almost a year since Steve...
I'm taking the kids to live near my folks in Illinois.
We'll miss you.
I'll miss you, too.
I wish I felt that his sacrifice was worth it, but after all the time we've spent here together, I don't.
I still don't know why Steve had to die in a meaningless war.
- Excuse me?
- Frank.
No, no.
I want you to explain yourself.
My husband died in a country that doesn't want us.
For a country that doesn't care.
He died for nothing.
And we're supposed to just listen to this?
Frank, there's no judgment...
You're just going to let her go on like that?
I'm encouraging her to go on like that.
It's how she feels.
I won't be a part of this.
I'm so sorry.
It's all right.
Frank.
Frank, you have to apologize.
- What?
- You have to go back in there and apologize to those people, especially Carrie.
I will do no such thing.
Frank.
She's stepping on the flag, D.
She doesn't see it that way.
She said that Jeremy died for nothing.
- She did not say that.
- She sure as hell did.
- Now you can go back in there...
- No, you need to go back in there.
She lost a husband, just like we lost a son, and if we want to be a part of that group...
I will not be in the same room with that woman.
Well, I take it Congress isn't going into emergency session to help us.
Mmm-mmm.
Jean Calhoun thinks it's outrageous that the wife of a deployed serviceman is facing deportation.
But?
A lot of her friends lost in the last election.
And the rest aren't willing to stick their necks out.
Well, you sound surprised.
Disappointed.
Well, immigration is a hot button issue.
Grant, we're running out of time here.
There has to be something else we can do.
Well, what if there isn't?
I don't know, but I'm not willing to sit there and let Elena be sent away.
Maybe you're ready to quit on her, I'm not.
I'm sorry.
Look, Claudia Joy, go home.
Get some rest.
You've got a big day tomorrow.
I care about her, too, Claudia Joy.
Out like a light.
I'm thinking some mint chocolate chip.
How about you?
I don't like it.
What?
You love mint chocolate chip.
You know what I mean.
I talked to Dr. Seaver over at Mercer.
He's an expert on these things.
And he told you about the chances of miscarriage and uterine rupture.
Yes, he did.
A uterine rupture could be fatal, Joan.
To you and the baby.
And with the amount of scarring you have, he says your odds go way up.
- I'm aware of that.
- It's not worth it, Joan.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
I'm not going to put your life on the line.
Now you said I had a vote.
That's my vote.
No.
So that's it?
No.
There's adoption.
Roland, we're not adopting.
Why not?
Look, we both want a second child, we've got the means to provide...
No.
We are not doing that.
Joan, adoption is...
Adoption is for people who can't have kids on their own.
That is not us.
It's not me, anyway.
You going to talk to me?
D?
You heard Chaplain Maris.
That group is supposed to be a safe place.
Those people helped me, they reached out to me, Frank, and you insulted them.
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.
- Well, that woman was...
- That woman's name is Carrie.
She has three children and no husband and she was the first one to welcome us tonight.
Well, she shouldn't have said what she said.
Why not?
She lost her husband.
She can say whatever she wants.
- Not to me, she can't.
- Well, to me then.
- D.
- Sometimes,
I don't understand you, Frank.
You think you can tell the world how to feel?
You think Carrie Myers is the only Army wife to question the cause?
Let me tell you something.
Every mother who loses a child wants to know what it was for and if it was worth it.
Every one.
Hey, Joan.
Roland, we don't have time to get into this right now.
I can't be late.
Will you just tell me why you came down so hard last night?
Will you hold on for one second, please?
Look, I get your disappointment about pregnancy.
Maybe it was insensitive of me to bring up adoption so soon.
- It was.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
But, sweetheart, there are all sorts of reasons to adopt.
It's not just about an inability to conceive.
- Can I go now?
- No.
Look, I just want to know what's bothering you.
Nothing is bothering me.
I just don't think adoption is the right road for us, that's all.
Look, it's not a failure if we decide to go a different route.
That's not it.
So what is it?
Me.
For some women, being a mom comes naturally.
Not for me.
You know that.
It was a role I had to learn.
But you did.
You learned.
Hey, Joan, you're a fantastic mother.
I don't think I can...
I'm not sure I could love someone else's child the way I love my own.
Okay?
I've got to go.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Okay.
The CT scan confirms that you have a tumor on your right ovary.
It's about six centimeters in diameter.
Okay.
So now what?
Well, we need to go in and remove it.
The ovary as well, I'm afraid.
It's a laparoscopic procedure, it's minimally invasive.
Nevertheless, I'll want you to stay overnight for observation.
- When?
- As soon as we can get you ready.
There's no sense in delaying.
If it is cancer, we want to get it now.
I booked an OR for 6:00 this evening.
Please don't eat or drink anything between now and then so your stomach is empty before the anesthesia, okay?
Mrs. Holden, depending on what we find, we may need to remove more than just the ovary.
We're talking anything from a partial to a radical hysterectomy.
I need you to be prepared for that possibility.
The pathology report should take 12 to 24 hours after the procedure.
Any questions?
I didn't think you should be alone for this.
I hope you don't mind.
No.
So what did they say?
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Hey.
Oh, I was just driving around post because I can.
With my new ID card.
Wow.
Good picture.
Right?
The new and improved Army wife.
Yeah.
You're all set, Rox.
Hey, Pamela.
Thank you.
You're a lifesaver.
Hey, Whit!
Want to play?
All right.
Only for a minute though.
Your mom's got me on a tight schedule.
I thought he was never coming on post.
Washing machine emergency.
- Roxy.
- I tried to fix it myself.
Look, I don't remember you having such a problem with Whit when he saved your wedding with his generator.
That was different.
Oh really?
How?
This was a one-time emergency, just like that was.
I'm just a little worried about you, that's all.
I'm not sure you're thinking clearly.
Pamela, I'm fine.
There's nothing to worry about, believe me.
Okay.
You want to stay for some tea?
No.
I got to pick up the kids.
Maybe tomorrow?
- Sure.
- Okay.
Bye bye.
I'm so glad you could drop by.
I'm glad you called.
The house is a mess and the packers just left for the day.
I can imagine.
How are the kids handling it?
The move and everything?
It's tough.
The Army's all they've ever known.
But we have each other and we'll get through it as a family.
I hope you like oatmeal raisin.
They're my favorite.
I don't know how you find the time to make them.
I should have come by sooner, Denise.
You and Claudia Joy were so kind to me when Steve was killed.
I'm sorry.
Please.
I should be the one apologizing.
- After last night.
- No.
It's okay.
No, it's not.
Your husband's a soldier.
Honestly, he reminds me of Steve.
Army all the way.
Yeah, that's Frank.
In a way, I envy them.
To them, the world is black and white.
Right and wrong.
The good guys and the bad guys.
It's not that way though, is it?
No, it's not.
Hey, Pamela.
Hey.
I was just driving by and I thought maybe we could talk for a minute.
Yeah, sure.
What's up?
I know who you are, Whit.
I mean, being Finn's dad.
Roxy told me the first time you were here.
I'm just here to do a job, that's all.
Really?
Dancing with Roxy at my wedding, digging for fossils with Finn, playing football with the boys.
Okay, I know how that might look, but I think Roxy can take care of herself, don't you?
No, I don't.
She's not thinking clearly right now.
Trevor's been gone a long time and she's struggling.
I just want to help.
Yeah, but you're not the man of the house, Whit.
- Trevor is.
- I know.
So whether you mean to or not, your being here confuses things for Roxy.
And for the boys.
You really want to help?
Yeah.
Go home.
Mrs. Holden?
Hmm.
Yes.
We're ready.
Yeah?
General Holden's on line one.
Um...
Put him through.
Hello, General.
I was looking for my wife.
Her cell went right to voicemail and nobody's picking up at home.
Yeah, well, we're working late tonight and I don't know exactly where she is.
You want me to take a message?
I've got some news about Specialist Cabrera.
Go ahead, I can take that.
His unit's coming back to Camp Eagle today.
That's great.
Listen, you wouldn't happen to have a video hook-up we could talk to him on?
We have a facility here, yeah.
Here's the problem.
I don't think we can get the bureaucracy to work fast enough unless we get a little help.
So if Specialist Cabrera could talk to a reporter, then the resulting press...
Absolutely not.
The Army will not participate in one of your publicity gimmicks.
Now, wait just a minute, General.
I know how you operate, Chandler, and I don't like it.
With due respect, General, the wife of one of your soldiers is going to be deported unless we can shake things up here.
Now I know it may be personally distasteful, but sometimes publicity is the only card left to play.
So we can sit here butting heads over it, or we can try to help an innocent woman.
Your call.
- That was a terrific dinner, honey.
- Thanks.
And these cookies are fantastic.
Is that a new recipe or something?
They're not mine.
Carrie Myers brought them over.
I invited her.
May I ask why?
So I could apologize.
For you.
You shouldn't have done that.
I disagree.
You misjudged her.
- No, I heard what she said.
- No.
You heard the words.
You didn't hear what she was saying.
She's in pain, Frank.
She's raising three children by herself and she has to move out of the state and she misses her husband every minute of every day.
- Don't you get that?
- Of course I do.
- It's still no reason for her to...
- To what?
To blame the Army?
Who else is she going to blame?
It's not about that, anyway.
It's not about what you think, the mission, the noble sacrifice.
It's about living with a hole in your life for the rest of your life.
I'd think about that before I pass judgment on another grieving widow.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You're wrong, you know.
About what this time?
Your capacity as a mother.
How about the way you cared for Molly the other night?
You seemed pretty loving then.
Yeah, well, that's different.
Molly's a dream.
And she's Frank and Denise's daughter.
Well, every child is somebody's son or daughter.
Yeah.
I suppose.
Hey, look, Joan, adoption isn't exactly what I had in mind, either.
But if we're serious about wanting a larger family,
I think it's something that we should at least consider.
It took courage to admit what you told me, to share your fears.
To be honest, I've had a few myself.
I'm just talking about taking the first step here.
You know?
Just the first baby step.
Hey, look, sweetheart.
There might be legitimate reasons not to adopt, but I know you, so let's be clear.
The size of your heart isn't one of them.
Thank you.
How you feeling?
Tired.
Saw it at the gift shop.
It wraps around the bed.
See?
It's cute.
Thanks.
So how'd it go?
They got the tumor.
They didn't have to take anything else.
Good.
I'll get the lab results tomorrow.
- Find out if it's cancer.
- Right.
Your husband called the office looking for you and I told him you were tied up with work.
Thanks.
He had information about Specialist Cabrera.
Well, I'll let you get your rest.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Wait, wait.
What about Specialist Cabrera?
Don't you worry about that now.
Okay?
Wait, wait.
Grant?
I might have some news in the morning.
Get some rest.
- Good night.
- Night.
Hey.
Hey, Rox.
Brought you a little something-something.
All right, thanks.
Hey, guys, donuts!
- How's it going?
- Good.
Listen, I hate to do this to you, but I got a call from a buddy of mine back home last night.
He's building a new subdivision and wants me to oversee the whole thing.
A new subdivision.
Yeah.
Houses and...
I know what a subdivision is.
I just didn't know anybody was building them these days.
They are.
I wouldn't leave you high and dry, though, Rox.
I met a guy down at the lumber yard.
He checks out.
He's going to finish the job for you, same money.
You always were a really bad liar, Whit.
Well, I ain't lying.
Look, I shouldn't have come here.
What are you talking about?
I just...
You.
You're not thinking clearly these days, Rox.
- Says who?
- Says me.
I should go home.
You do and I'll sue you for breach of contract.
- Rox.
- I mean it, Whit.
We signed a contract.
You do not move an inch until you are done with this job.
Where are you going?
Hey, Pamela.
- Hey.
- Please tell me you did not talk to Whit.
- Roxy, I...
- I can't believe you did that.
- Well, listen, I just...
- No, you listen.
You stay away from him.
I need Whit to help me build that truck stop.
I just thought that before...
That what?
That you'd mess with my project?
You do understand that this is my money we're talking about here, right?
Okay, now hold on.
You aren't seriously telling me that
Whit is the only contractor that can do that job?
On time and on budget?
Yes!
- Come on.
- Come on, what?
Roxy, you asked Whit here because you wanted him around.
You are so out-of-bounds.
- Roxy, he's practically walked into...
...we're only friends!
If it's all so innocent, how come you haven't told Trevor?
I told you, I've tried.
How hard is it to send an e-mail even if you're scared to tell him on the phone?
That's it.
God.
Roxy, you already broke your rule about him coming on post.
What is next?
He is just a friend.
Why can't you just leave it alone?
Because he was just a friend the last time you slept with him, that's why.
Shut up, Pamela!
Just shut up!
Roxy, since Jeremy died, you've been acting like Trevor's gone, too, and he's not.
He's alive and he's still your husband.
And sooner or later, he's coming home.
- All I'm trying to say...
- I can't believe you just said that.
- Roxy.
- No.
You know what?
Stay away from me, okay?
Stay away from me.
Almost ready.
No rush, Counselor.
Okay.
Can't forget this.
It's sweet.
As reported earlier, Elena Cabrera, pregnant wife of Army Specialist Antonio Cabrera, a decorated soldier currently serving in Afghanistan, faces deportation to El Salvador later this week.
I was born in El Salvador and I'm a citizen of the United States.
- Grant, how did you make this...
- Your husband arranged it.
My wife didn't know her green card was fake.
She's been working and paying taxes in the United States for six years.
She's applying for citizenship.
She's always done the right thing.
We both have.
That's why I'm fighting here.
We love the United States.
How can they deport her for that?
WSVD News asked that very question of a leading Washington immigration official, who had no explanation.
That's fantastic.
Let's just hope it works, huh?
Here, ma'am.
Let me help you with that.
- I've got it.
That's okay.
I...
- Ma'am, come on, please.
Thank you.
- You got that?
- Yeah, I got it.
Thanks.
Look, I wanted to apologize for the other night.
Thanks, but I don't need it.
I understand how you feel.
Fair enough.
But maybe I didn't understand how you feel.
Maybe I do a little better now.
It's all right, sweetheart.
He's a friend.
It's my oldest.
Very protective of her mother.
Well, Denise...
Well, let's just say she broadened my perspective.
Is that code for gave you a talking to?
Look, ma'am.
Perhaps you do understand me.
But what I wanted to say is that the Army is more than just symbols to me.
It is flesh and blood.
It is the soldier on your left, the soldier on your right.
That's who you fight for.
That's who you die for.
Now I was supposed to have been on that chopper your husband was piloting.
I got pulled the last minute.
So maybe that's why I feel his sacrifice so strongly.
He was a fine soldier, ma'am.
And I wanted you to know that.
Thank you.
I wish you well.
We've gone over the state's requirements for adoption.
And we are confident that we can provide a stable, loving home.
It's been our dream to have a second child.
I appreciate that, Colonel Burton, but I have to tell you that state adoption would be a difficult process in your case.
Difficult?
Difficult how?
Military families, they often struggle to meet state regulations regarding residency and home ownership.
Colonel Burton could be reassigned on a moment's notice, isn't that true?
Yes.
Technically.
Even the possibility of deployment can create an unstable environment for a child.
So you're saying we can't adopt?
I'm saying it would be a difficult process.
I'm going to file a complaint.
- Roland.
- It's discriminatory, Joan.
Bias against all military families.
How's that not wrong?
Well, think how it looks from where she's sitting.
I don't want to.
We're good parents, Joan.
Yes, we are.
And if we can't use the state, we'll find a private agency.
Really?
That's expensive.
So we'll sell the yacht.
Right.
After I became aware of the extenuating circumstances, naturally, I couldn't allow such a miscarriage of justice to take place.
Naturally.
That's why I have granted Mrs. Cabrera humanitarian parole, allowing her to remain in this country while she continues her application for citizenship.
You got to love hypocrites like that.
When they make the right decisions, yes.
Thank you.
Thank you both so much.
So much.
Of course.
If it's a boy, we're calling him Grant.
And if it's a girl, Claudia.
Oh!
- Hey, more champagne!
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay, thank you.
Yeah, you, too.
Goodbye.
It's not cancer.
Claudia Joy.
- I should go.
- Wait.
Michael.
Honey, I'm so sorry I couldn't pick up the other night when you called.
Well, that's okay, I know you had a lot on your plate.
Thank you for that video hook-up.
It worked.
Elena Cabrera is not being deported.
Well, that's great, but I can do you one better.
We're coming home.
- Really?
- Next week.
Everything got moved up.
We just received redeployment orders, the whole division.
You're coming home?
I'm coming home.
Michael, that is the best news I've heard all day.
When the people of the world have a common monetary language, completely freed from every government, it will so facilitate and stabilize exchange that peace and prosperity will ensue even without world government.
A union of peoples, rather than a union of political governments, is what this world needs.

Money as Debt III
Evolution Beyond Money
The Challenge
Life has always been a challenge.
When one has a problem and wishes to solve it, first one must determine what is the root cause of the problem.
Simple problems have simple solutions, complex problems are, well...
more complex.
An obvious problem with our current financial system is that it rewards greed and corruption.
Greed and corruption seem to be everywhere.
But are greed and corruption the root causes of the problem or are they the result of the way the system is built?
Logically, one should first ask are there built-in reasons why the system works the way it does, and if there are, can they be built out?
Interest Stock Flow
Some say the basic reason the system is unstable, and leads inevitably to corruption, is the charging of interest.
As explained earlier in this series, in our current bank credit as money system, the principal amount of a bank loan is simply created from the borrower's promise to pay back the principal plus interest in money.
But the money to pay the interest is not created.
The obvious, but untrue conclusion, is that it would therefore be mathematically impossible to pay off all debts.
Many who call for money reform call for the abolition of interest as the solution to the problem.
But is interest really the problem?
Yes, there would be a serious mathematical shortage if all loans where concurrent and had to be paid back in one lump sum.
That problem might apply to gangland loans and sometimes to farm loans but that's not how the banking system works in general.
Bank loans usually get paid back in a series of payments over a period of time, and for good reason.
Money is both a stock, the amount in existence at any one time, and a flow, the transactions over time that the money is used for.
Flow works like this:
if I, the rich guy, lend you a dollar and that was the only dollar in existence, the stock, could you pay me back 100 dollars?
Well, if it had to be paid in one lump sum, no.
That other 99 dollars, the interest on the loan, would be impossible to pay.
It would be impossible to pay even in 2 dollar payments because there's only 1 dollar in existence.
But if I let you pay me the 100 dollars in 1 dollar payments, magic happens.
In fact, in 1 dollar payments you could pay me back any amount of interest, if you lived long enough.
The only condition required to make full payment of a 100 dollar debt with only 1 dollar in existence is that I give you the opportunity to earn, or otherwise get that dollar back, each time you pay it to me.
This is the flow.
And by means of the flow, the same dollar can be paid any number of times and becomes effectively many dollars, all legitimately representing the work done to earn them.
It is always the work, the real value, that pays the debt and gives the dollar its value, not the dollar itself.
The relationship in our example is dreadfully unequal because the man with the money has enslaved the man without it, just like the real-world, some would say.
But a simple loan at interest need not produce a shortage of money or cause unpayable debt if flow is 100 percent, as in our example.
Flow is the real measure of economic activity.
It's much more significant than the stock in the money system because it multiplies the effect of money in circulation.
Given that today we use an exclusively debt money system, what is flowing in all these transactions is credit or promises to pay money.
This credit is ultimately nothing more than promises of borrowers to pay this credit back, usually according to a time schedule, and usually with interest added.
To pay this credit back, most of us will have to work and earn it by being productive.
So, therefore the real value of the money that flows in our economy today is created by our promises of future productive work.
We take a loan in order to have something now rather than later.
We agree to pay interest on into the future, thus reducing our future spending power, often by more than the amount of the original loan.
However, with an understanding of flow, we see that there is no intractable arithmetic problem with the charging of interest.
The problem is a social and systemic one.
Lenders have neither obligation nor incentive to spend all their interest income so that the borrowers can earn it again and again.
In fact, money lent once into existence is lent as existing money a second and third time in expectation of more gain.
The problem is basically one of incomplete recycling, where money needs to be spent, earned and used to extinguish the debt that created it, it is instead lent or invested for gain.
In other words, money that must be extinguished is instead expected to grow forever.
Money Lent Twice
Here's another simple example of a basic mechanism inherent to all lending.
Let's say I lend you 100 dollars and you spend it into circulation.
It eventually ends up in the possession of someone who doesn't need to spend it and decides to lend it instead.
Now, once again, let's say this is the only 100 dollars in existence.
So you have to borrow it from the secondary lender in order to pay off your debt to me.
But now you have to borrow it from me to pay the secondary lender.
This twice lent money has become a perpetually unpayable debt.
This debt can never be extinguished, nor even reduced without a default.
Notice that interest doesn't even enter into this equation.
The problem of perpetual debt remains, interest or no.
And even if the money itself is of intrinsic value, like gold or silver, or if it is issued by governments as cash, twice lent money creates perpetual debt exactly the same way.
When the same money is lent at interest, several times simultaneously, not only is the debt perpetual, society as a whole is paying moneylenders multiples of the interest-rate for the use of the same money.
There's an expectations that existing money should increase indefinitely by being lent at interest.
But thisr equires us to mentally divorce the money from the debt from which it came.
However, the reality is, every dollar created today has a scheduled appointment to be extinguished as a principal payment on the loan that created it.
And that's why debt money can't be separated from the debt that created it.
It's like a yo-yo spun out into circulation in the economy for a while and then pulled back in at the appointed time.
In order for the yo-yo to be free to return, all of the debt money needed to extinguish the debt has to be available to be earned.
The flow must be complete.
Can't we just pay off these debts with other money?
But what would other money be?
Today, the amount of physical cash and coin in circulation is very small.
Almost all money is bank credit, debt money.
So if almost all money comes into existence the same way, then its a valid to picture each debt money dollar as having its own cycle, from creation to destruction.
So, the question, can we pay off debts with other money?
No, there is no other money!
Because all of it is similarly committed to debt in one form or another.
Therefore, the only way to insure current payments can be made is to constantly increase the total amount of money in the system.
But more money in a debt money system means more debt, so the debt hole in reality just deepens.
Since debt is money in this system it creates the fantasy of wealth... for a while.
But fantasies must come to an end.
The day of reckoning can be pushed back but only by passing the debt onto generations yet unborn, which is precisely what we're doing now.
Government debt piles up endlessly.
Corporate debt piles up, consumer debt too.
As long as total debt keeps increasing, the system can stay ahead of the debt monster.
But all of this debt is an absurd fantasy that our descendants will surely never repay.
Nor would they be advised to as repayment of debt would eliminate the money stock and plunge the world into a depression.
Once real growth levels off due to the inherent limits of human productivity, or the limited resources of a finite planet, this growth dependent money system can only resolve its impossible arithmetic in the destruction of value.
This can either happened through a deflationary spiral of credit defaults, falling prices or by the devaluation of the money unit.
Taken to extremes, either course of events will destroy an economy and even a civilization.
The only other choice is debt forgiveness.
In the ancient world, a regular debt jubilee, a society wide forgiveness of debts, was a common practice to deal with these unavoidable problems with lending.
It was considered normal, even by the rich and powerful, that the general good of society took precedence over the rights of those rich enough to be lending money for profit.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be.
~William Shakespeare, Hamlet
Hard Money
Some say that the money systems problems would be solved if we returned to using gold for money, or silver, or some other limited or hard commodity like oil or energy in general.
They argue that this prevents money from being created in excess and backs it with real value.
However, it also makes those who actually possess the selected physical substance, the only ones with real money.
Everyone else would only have a claim on real money.
For instance, gold.
How would we ever transition back to a honest gold economy with a natural distribution of gold among the population?
That's long gone.
And why would we want to do that?
The gold based money system is our past, it's how we got to where we are today.
Gold is inconvenient, even more so was a barrel of oil.
Therefore, whether gold, oil or kumquats, trade will be carried out in promises.
The real question is if we are going to trade using promises of delivering something of real value, why gold?
In fact, why any single commodity?
At this time in our evolution, doesn't this very old idea of money merit serious re-examination?
Debts Promises
It can be argued, that our current elastic debt money is backed by real value, every bit as meaningfully as gold.
That's because money, most of which is created as mortgages, represents the value of the assets pledged as collateral.
So is bank credit money actually a claim on the real-estate pledged to create it?
Not directly.
Bank credit money can be a claim on anything.
Now, anything includes the real-estate pledged as collateral, so it can be a claim on the real-estate that was pledged to create it.
So how is a promise of real-estate any less valid than a promise of gold?
Both gold and real-estate can change value relative to other commodities.
Neither is a permanent standard.
In fact, there can never be a permanent standard of value because value is always subjective and variable.
So it would seem that the crucial difference between a claim on gold and bank credit is that bank credit is not a claim on any specific real thing, while the promise of gold is.
The promise of gold has to be a promise of a specific amount of a specific real thing from a specific promiser.
Isn't that the essential reason why many people would consider a promise of gold the better promise?
But that is only true if the promise is reliable and what is delivered is really gold.
With the discovery that some of the gold bullion sitting in central banks is actually relatively worthless tungsten plated in gold, the whole argument that gold is the most solid reliable money is shown to be neither solid, nor reliable.
Precious metal is susceptible to counterfeiting, it's heavy and it's vulnerable to theft.
So to return to commerce via the physical exchange of precious metal coins would mean civilization had reverted to a pre-electronic level of technology.
In the absence of such a collapse, the economy would still windup running on promises, just as it does now.
So once again, money would only be as good as the promises made and there would be no need of actual precious metal coins if all transactions were carried out with promises.
The VALUE of the coin is the MEASURING UNIT
Money is the Measure by which Goods are Valued, the Value by which goods are Exchanged, and in which Contracts are made payable.
Every thing receives a Value from its use, and the Value is raised, according to its Quality, Quantity and Demand.
Money is not the Value for which Goods are exchanged, but the Value by which they are Exchanged.
~John Law, political economist, 1705
The Fundamental Questions
The fundamental question is:
What does the need for money, to enable trade, have to do with the amount of some shiny metal there is?
Or the amount of any single natural resource or commodity, or real-estate, for that matter?
Where is there any meaningful relationship between the functional need for money and any of these things?
To answer that question, let's go back in time and find out when money started and why it became what it is today.
We know that Stone age people had money.
In the Stone age, before writing was invented, money had to be a portable object of value, because that was the only technology available.
That's why rare shells and stones, from which jewellery could be made, were ideal as money.
A rough standard of value for these money objects developed over large areas, enabling extensive networks of indirect trading.
This way people could obtain specialty items not available in their own environment and looked good doing it.
The popular concept of jewellery as a store of value has continued to this day.
In later agricultural civilizations, cattle were often the standard value objects for large transactions and salt for small ones.
Salt was rare in those days and valuable.
Roman soldiers were paid in salt, thus the term "salary", meaning payment for services.
With the invention of writing, trade and other commodities could be carried out using promises of cattle and salt.
The cattle and salt weren't necessarily what was finally delivered.
They were just commonly understood units of value in which the real trade goods could be conveniently priced.
Written credits were expressed in these two common units, although they represented a variety of real goods and services.
This form of money was ideal for local economies, where traders were known to each other and pledges could be collected upon.
This voucher redeemable for pottery tile - potter
This voucher redeemable for boats sails - boat builder
Agricultural surpluses allowed some people to leave the farming to others and specialize in particular crafts.
This resulted in improved skills and better tools and that led to further gains in productivity.
This specialization of labour required increased trade, as more people opted to produce a single item of enhanced value.
They would then need to trade their specialty for the broad spectrum of necessities that past generations had produced for themselves.
But direct barter was inefficient.
So more trade lead to a greater need for money.
Over many centuries, various forms of money where tried.
Eventually, gold and silver coins proved to be the most useful money objects because they were conveniently portable, and similarly valued across large areas of the civilized world.
They where also easily standardized for weight and purity, and did not require enforcement of value by some authority, nor redemption in goods from someone far away.
Thus, for very good reasons, gold and silver became the universally successful international currencies, accepted as final payment of debt almost everywhere.
Money as a Single Uniform Commodity
The problem with a system in which money is a standard commodity is that it is most efficient when only one standard commodity is used, but if you do that, it makes the value of money exclusively dependent on the quantity of that one commodity
in relation to all other commodities.
For example, the Spanish thought they would be fabulously wealthy with all the gold they stole from the Aztecs and the Incas and then turned into money back home.
But when the gold got back to Europe, sure, the amount of gold increased, but it didn't increase real productivity and proportion.
Fertilizer would have been more useful for that.
So, because there was no big increase in real stuff to buy with it, the value of gold decreased, and the Spaniards discovered that gold had no absolute money value in itself as many people had imagined it would.
Its value was determined by its abundance relative to the value of real goods and services to be bought.
Yet many continue to argue that the value of gold, a luxury item of no practical use to most people, should be the measure of value for all the real goods and services essential to our lives.
While some campaign for a return to gold, others mistakenly believe that today's money still does represent gold held in a vault somewhere.
That hasn't been true for decades.
In our current money system, we use national fiat currencies and bank promises to pay in national currencies as the standard commodity instead of gold.
National currencies used to be promises to pay in gold or silver.
But way more promises were made than could be honoured... so that system fell apart.
Today, national currency is just legally enforced money, what they call "Fiat Money".
That is, it's money you have to accept because the government says so.
To many, this government fiat money is just worthless paper.
But is it really?
We can pay our taxes with it, and governments, especially local ones, provide essential services paid for with those taxes, like roads, schools, hospitals, libraries, police and military.
So government fiat money isn't worthless at all.
Now it is true that consumers of government services have no individual free market choice as to what their tax money is spent on and what services they receive.
In fact, many taxpayers may not want those services.
So, therefore, this money can rightly be accused of being monopolistic, coercive and socialist.
But government is coercive, monopolistic and socialist by nature, isn't it?
What else should it be?
Government in a democracy or a republic is ideally a single authority, empowered by society to enforce laws agreed upon by society for its own collective benefit.
In a free market economy, government must provide the level playing field of law within which the free market can function.
And it also has to provide the referees to enforce the rules of the game.
Those who are nostalgic for the freedom of the frontier, should recall that the first thing early settlers usually did was elect a sheriff, and build a jail and collect taxes to pay for both...
for good reason.
So government fiat money isn't inherently worthless by nature.
Governments at all levels offer vital services in exchange for it.
It only becomes worthless when government creates too much of it.
Which it often does and for the worst reasons.
While many reformers are fixated on the differences between gold and fiat currency, what's more important is the essential similarity.
Being single uniform commodities, gold, silver, national currencies and bank credit, all share the characteristic common to moneis for millennia past:
the more money there is relative to the real things available to buy, the less the money unit is worth.
Thus the total quantity of money in circulation is extremely important to maintaining the general price levels.
And today, this quantity is largely determined by the demand for new money to purchase real estate and speculative equities.
This makes the supply of money for general trade particularly vulnerable to real estate and stock market bubbles.
fantasy wealth real wealth destruction
OH NO, IT HAPPENED AGAIN!
The Concentration of Wealth
Perhaps the most significant problem with money as a single commodity is its tendency to concentrate wealth.
Those who have no money must get it from those who have it to lend.
Anyone with extra money can lend it at interest and if, rather than spending all of the interest, they add any of it to their lending capital, they will accumulate even more money to lend.
One reputable study counted all the ways we pay interest, directly on our own debt, and indirectly in prices and taxes for corporate and government debt.
This was compared to the interest we earn from all sources.
This study found that only the richest ten percent come out ahead.
The next ten percent do little better than break even and the remaining 80% pay more than they receive, the poorest losing out the most.
Payment in Money
Now, in our current bank credit system, money is created as debt to banks.
This debt is required to be repaid to the banks in money, either fiat cash or bank credit.
Therefore, the ability of all borrowers to repay depends on the availability of fiat cash or bank credit.
The supply fiat cash is controlled by the nation's central bank.
But flat cash makes up only a very small proportion of money.
Usually about 95% of all money is bank credit.
And who controls the availability of bank credit?
The banks?
!
Well, on the one hand, what the banks can do is constrict the supply of credit anytime they want to, with high interest rates or by just not granting loans.
On the other hand, the banks could lower interest rates and encourage borrowing, but, they can't expand the money supply, unless borrowers are willing to borrow.
If cautious and reliable borrowers are in short supply, banks must take bigger risks as interest must be paid to depositors and banks cost money to run.
The bank credit money supply is, as they say, "highly elastic".
And, because its based on the willingness of borrowers to borrow and the reliability of borrowers' credit, it is vulnerable to both rapid expansion and drastic shrinkage.
Also, everyone is legally obliged to pay in money.
Now money, in reality, is just an accounting of debt.
And accounting follows strict rules.
So the whole situation is governed by inflexible numbers.
That's why a sudden shrinkage in the money supply caused by some defaults has the inevitable follow-up effect of causing more and more defaults and even more shrinkage of the money supply.
This self reinforcing downwards suction leads us into economic collapse and the economic and social absurdity of unemployed, dispossessed people camping outside their empty, vandalized homes.
And what does the government do about it?
It loads bankrupt taxpayers with astronomical fantasy debt that will never even be reduced, never mind paid off.
A TRILLION used to be a big number
Not anymore!
The BANK ASSETS lost were PROMISES to pay legal tender the banks NEVER HAD
All this is done to fill up the negative balance sheets of the banks with money the banks never had in the first place.
Now you, the taxpayer, will pay interest on those "losses" FOREVER!
And then they use it to pay themselves obscene bonuses!
Life is GOOD...
Life is good for those who know how to play the system.
when the PROFITS are YOURS... the losses are forced onto the taxpayers
The bailout scam was the biggest daylight robbery in the history of the world...
so far!
and the government puts YOU in charge of making sure it "never happens again"!
It's the System!
All of these tendencies of the money as commodity system are features of the system itself.
The greed and corruption comes in as those who understand the system profitably surf the inevitable waves of boom and bust.
Those who understand the system know what's coming, and even precipitate it when the time is ripe for them to take advantage of disastrous mass events for their personal and political gain.
But it's the structure of the system itself which gives them the opportunity.
Without the wave, there would be no surfing!
And they've taken this opportunity over and over again since ancient times.
People complain of the injustice...
blame each other, blame the Left or the Right or whoever the scapegoat of choice is.
But they never really catch on to the reasons this keeps happening.
That's because most of us shy away from trying to understand the true nature of money and of freedom.
The basis of freedom is essentially the freedom to exchange... goods, services, ideas.
If you create something in proven demand, you and only you, should have the right and the freedom to create and spend the credit money needed by someone to buy it.
Money as a portable uniform commodity was invented a very long time ago.
Pretty stone...
maybe good for trade
It was the only choice using the technological means available at that time.
But times have changed.
So why is this outmoded technology still the prevailing concept we have for money?
Could we go beyond money as we've known it?
Could there be a new basis, a fresh concept, a design that could more effectively address the real purpose of money in the 21st century?
"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them. " ~Albert Einstein
"I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination.
Imagination is more important than knowledge.
Knowledge is limited.
Imagination encircles the world.
~Albert Einstein
Only a revolution in the mind of the individual is needed to accomplish the greatest stroke for freedom of all time.
It is a remarkable fact that no constitution of any state, nor any declaration of human rights, has ever proclaimed the right of freedom of money issue.
Yet this right is inseparable from the right of bargain or exchange, which is the very foundation of liberty.
Man's ignorance of the laws of money has blinded him to the very touchstone of freedom.
You are indeed sovereign, if you but realize that your money power is your sovereign power.
You need no political laws to liberate your power for prosperity and peace;
you are the master of your fate by natural law, if you but discover that law.
As you scan the world scene with all its miseries, its drab outlook, the discouraging prospect of a solution for humanity's problems by political means, and the remoteness from you of the capitols through which promised salvation is desperately hoped for, you are saddened be a sense of frustration.
But if you realized that the citadel of power is your own home and that yours is the majesty and sovereignty, sadness will be dispelled by gladness.
To bring this transformation you must comprehend the power of money and that you are the money power.
~E.C. Riegel, monetary theorist The New Approach to Freedom 1949
Monetary Reform Movements
Gold
Awareness of the need for real change in the money system is growing.
But what direction to take, what exactly is the problem and how can it be solved?
The safest and only real choice, many people argue, is to return to gold or a gold standard because this worked for millennia in the past.
But gold itself is impractical for transactions in the modern world.
It was impractical centuries ago, which is why the promise to pay gold system developed.
And so it is certain that, in practice, transactions would be conducted in promises to pay gold, not gold itself.
Thus, the promises to pay gold money will only be as reliable as the promises.
So, in reality, it isn't the gold that makes the system work, it's the reliability of promises.
Would they be reliable promises?
Maybe.
But what we would be using as money would be like the old goldsmiths promises, made in the knowledge that only rarely does anyone ever ask for real gold.
This was the problem with the goldsmiths situation.
The real gold was seldom claimed, allowing fraudulent promises of gold to be made and used as money.
Why would history not repeat itself if all the same elements remained in place?
Another thing.
What most people say they like about the gold system is that the promise of gold money is a promise of a specific amount of real value.
Now this is an odd idea, given that the vast majority of us have no use for gold.
So how much real value can it have for us?
Wouldn't a promise redeemable in food, clothing or shelter be much more real?
People also like the idea that gold is just gold, it doesn't need a government to create it.
However, it does need miners.
In a gold money system, mining discoveries, jewellery making, industrial use, hoarding and counterfeit bars of gold-plated tungsten, would all influence the money stock.
What on earth does any of that have to do with the need for money for trade?
Lastly, gold as money is a single uniform commodity manifesting all the inherent mathematical defects of lending, demonstrated in part one of this movie.
Being a coin with intrinsic value doesn't make any difference.
A lot of gold and silvers appeal comes from a belief in an oversimplified version of history.
People assume that coins were invented to standardize the inherent value of the metal they contain.
This is true, but right from the beginning, some of the earliest coins were created based on a diametrically opposed idea.
This was done because the rulers at that time foresaw the inevitable negative consequences of using limited supplies of precious metals as money.
Therefore, they chose to avoid that route.
Instead of precious metals, these rulers struck coins of iron or copper and defined their value by decree.
What's more, these coins by decree were heated and dipped in vinegar, so the metal they contained would have no intrinsic value.
These coins were in fact the original and true fiat money.
They were merely tokens of value, money created by law and enforced by the ruler's authority.
And I can force my subjects to accept it
Fiat Monopoly
Pure flat money is the other main idea favoured by money reformers.
They would restore flat money to its true status as a national government monopoly on money creation.
This current of money reform, in stark contrast to the the gold advocates, insists that true money is fiat money by authority of the State.
This money is to be simply spent into existence as a promise by the State to accept the same money back in payment of taxes.
The taxes are compulsory and the State also promises to enforce the acceptance of this money in court.
These are very reliable promises and can result in very reliable money, if not abused.
The problem these flat money reformers have with the current system is that government has given away this power to private bankers and is now borrowing at interest money it could create itself with a few keystrokes, just like the banks do.
This results in a massive unplayable national debt on which interest will forever be paid.
This ever growing national debt expands the money supply when new money is created by the Central Bank to buy more government debt.
And the interest burden passed on through taxes adds to the cost of almost everything we buy one way or another.
In contrast to money being created as national debt, fiat money simply spent into existence would save the taxpayers immense sums of interest.
It would free future generations from impossible debt and it would forestall the tendency to inflation because the money supply would not grow forever with the national debt, as there would be no national debt.
In the fiat money system, taking flat money out of circulation by means of taxes preserves or restores the value of the remaining money in circulation.
Not taxing it back sufficiently would devalue it.
Understanding the proper use of government fiat money is a revelation.
If you can charge prices or taxes for something in the future, you can issue that much new money now because it is your valuable services to others and the reliability of your promises that create the real value of any money.
The government can honour its promises to accept its money back in taxes and it will make your debtors pay you in government fiat money if you take them to court.
These are good reasons why government issued money works now and why it would work if governments just self issue this credit, instead of borrowing it from banks.
But in this pure fiat money system, the money supply must still be determined by a central authority.
Therefore, the money supply is still limited, monopolistic and managed from above.
They have the power to create money and you have to get the money for them.
They also have the power to create way too much money and spend it on wars and other unproductive activities without the approval of those whose productivity gives that money its value.
In the current system, these inflationary debts are now beyond absurd, threatening to crash the entire system and drag the whole world into chaos.
To save themselves, governments are now laying impossible claims upon the productivity of generations yet unborn, a truly hopeless cause given the overall world situation.
Witnessing government performance to date, many people believe that returning the full power to create money to corrupt, incompetent politicians, would not only fail to solve our problems, it would be the height of insanity.
It would really all depend on the quality of the people in government.
Fiat money reformers believe there would have to be a substantial revolution in government to rest this power back from the banks.
Therefore, they believe it would be reasonable to expect that honest and competent people with a sincere concern for the public good would be in charge.
But, good guys or bad, we would still be dependent on some distant someone else to maintain the value of our money.
And they would have a thousand pressures and temptations to enrich themselves by not doing so.
And like gold is money, government fiat money is a single uniform commodity manifesting all the inherent mathematical defects of lending at interest and twice lent money.
Once the government creates the fiat money and it goes into the banking system to be lent at interest, the problems created in the current system will continue as before.
So, this pure fiat money idea might be very useful in rescuing governments from their own hopeless financial positions, and it is a limited example of the self-issued credit principle being advocated here.
But pure fiat money would not address the root problems inherent in the math of lending unless the principal were expanded beyond government.
Advocates of pure fiat money like to claim it is money created by law, as if it were independent of economics.
But if new fiat money were just spent into existence, year after year, without being removed from circulation as taxes, it would become worthless.
What these flat reformers tend to ignore when quoting history is that, in ancient money created-by-law systems, the prices of critical commodities were also dictated by law.
In fact, the value of money was defined by the ruler as so much of a certain commodity.
Charge more or less for the designated commodities and it could be off with your head!
Today, price controls like this, could only be achieved in a self isolated and totally bureaucratically controlled economy, like Soviet communism.
In a free market global economy, money created by law is bound by the same laws of supply and demand as any other single uniform commodity money.
In other words, pure fiat money in a free market is an illusion.
There is no such thing.
Self-Issued Credit
In the third stream of money reform are the various types of so-called "alternative" currencies, all of them based on some concept of money being created as self-issued credit.
Many examples of such systems exist today all over the world.
Some are very successful business to business barter networks, in which businesses create product credit money to use among themselves independent of banks and government and usually interest-free.
Such systems are tolerated, and in Switzerland, the existence of the WIR system is generally credited with stabilizing the banking system by expanding when the conventional system contracts and vice versa.
But in the past, when they became too successful, alternative currencies were usually suppressed by the banking system or even outlawed by government.
So, "act of suppression", is the most significant external problem.
The most common inherent problems with these systems are their limited scope and acceptance, their operating costs and the unreliability of member credit.
What the conventional banking system provides, worldwide reach, affordability, credit checks and debt enforcement, are the necessary services that are usually inadequate or prohibitively expensive in the alternative systems.
Once the small group of idealistic and honest originators are joined by members exhibiting the full range of human behaviour, alternative systems discover they must deal with cheaters.
Some are deliberately cheaters, others just not to conscientious about their debts.
And at the opposite end of the spectrum are the hyper conscientious people who wont issue credit because they are afraid they wont be able to fulfil it.
The self-issued credit system cannot work if the members are afraid of issuing credit.
And that is why it makes far more sense that government and essential industries like farming, forestry, mining, manufacturing and construction should be the main and widely accepted sources of self-issued credit, not vulnerable individuals trading haircuts for pottery.
However, we are talking about creating a truly liberated system of exchange.
Therefore, in this proposed new system, anyone would have the freedom to issue credit, because only voluntary acceptance would determine the circulation of it.
The cost of accounting in self-issued credit systems could be overcome entirely by emerging technologies allowing the creation of a digital coin.
Digital coins could be passed from one owner to another, peer-to-peer, so that no bookkeeping and no third party involvement, like banks and pay-pal, is required.
This leaves only the problem of achieving global spread.
Thanks to technology again, this could now be achieved at little cost and at the same rate and with the same ease that the existing social networks, like facebook and twitter, have spread.
So there is a positive answer to all the questions we have posed in this movie.
And there is a solution that has the potential to unite the three seemingly conflicting schools of money reform into one cohesive movement for fundamental monetary change.
Because, when examined closely, be it gold, tax receipts or someone's goods and services, all three schools of money reform are really calling for the same thing:
money that is redeemable for something specific from someone specific.
Once one comes to that realization, it becomes obvious that self issued credit, for the full range of goods and services in demand, would necessarily include gold, silver and government tax receipts, as these are also things in demand.
We just need to look beyond obsolete beliefs to see the heart of the situation.
The all-inclusive self-issued credit system, the basis for almost all so-called "alternative" currencies, could contain within it both the precious metal and the payable-for-tax models of money without any contradiction.
Self-Issued Credit Taxes PAID
Conclusion
Money has both religious and social histories that are fascinating and go well beyond just the need for trade.
But for our practical purposes in this presentation, money is the invention that overcame the limitations of direct barter.
Money is, therefore, a technology, a way to solve a problem.
Most of us would agree that we have a problem with our money system.
This is no surprise once we realize the current system was designed by bankers in their own interest and governments wanting to pump out artificial money to wage war and pay for it with a hidden form of taxation called inflation.
It was not a well-thought-out project of mathematicians and engineers seeking to create a money system for the general benefit of humankind.
There are now many people, including mathematicians, engineers, and even cartoonists, trying to rethink money, as the need to do so becomes obvious.
In this presentation, we've proposed that we return as close to direct barter as we can, because doing so would anchor the money system directly to the real world things we want to exchange.
The destructive flights of fantasy money, that have brought the current system to its breaking point, would not be possible.
Self-issued credit is not a new idea.
It is, in fact, an idea as old as numbers and written record keeping, that is very old.
However, only with our new technologies can it finally achieve its full potential as an international medium of exchange.
And this transformation is already underway.
Extensive electronic barter networks, some with their own currencies, exist among businesses right now.
These could grow into a new global money system.
In Canada, Canadian Tire money has been a self-issued credit for goods currency for decades.
This money is redeemable for merchandise at Canadian Tire stores only.
But is widely exchanged as payment by third parties, because almost everyone eventually buys something at Canadian Tire.
Like air miles and other bonus-point systems, it is only a Customer Reward Program at present, but anything that can serve the purpose of money can be money.
Private enterprise self-issued credit money already exists in several forms all over the world and more private enterprises are going in this direction.
Money becomes money by acceptance.
So, one could say, the path to freedom lies before us if we can only accept new and broader ideas of what money is.
Looked at logically, why wouldn't a legally binding contract for delivery of specific goods and services from a specific supplier be much more acceptable as a medium of trade than the much abused government bank Monopoly money we are using now?
And does it not seem natural and logical that the source of money should be the same as the source of real wealth, the productive members of society?
And does it not seem natural and logical that the value of anyone's credit should be determined solely by their own proven success at living within their means, no one else's?
And does it not seem natural and logical that the value of what we have earned with our work and productivity should not be susceptible to being destroyed or stolen by the gambling of some very greedy people?
We hope that watching the Money as Debt series has given you insights into why our money system functions the way it does.
We also hope that we've demonstrated how a return to gold or a switch to any single uniform commodity as money does not solve the fundamental problems with money.
Manipulation of single commodity money has milked productive people of their life energies and prosperity for millennia.
That this predatory wealth extraction system could soon take the form of a single global bank emerging as an unaccountable big brother world dictatorship, should concern everyone.
We hope you're encouraged to do your own thinking about money, a subject that has been ignored and misunderstood by the public for much too long to our great disadvantage.
And, not to criticize without offering an alternative, we have, in this final movie of the series, offered a comprehensive and detailed picture of how a radically new economic system might work, if interest-bearing product vouchers where the medium of exchange,
thus eliminating money as a commodity in itself.
Instead, money would be a global measurement unit like minutes, meters and tons.
The existing physical situation on this planet is not sustainable and the number one technical obstacle to doing anything serious about it is the current growth addicted money system, which is itself unsustainable.
The crisis is upon us.
If you'd rather think about solutions than despair about the problems, think about taking back our money power with self-issued credit.
Join with others who realize the need for radical change and spread this knowledge and understanding as fast and as far as you can.
The masses of people must take upon themselves the responsibility to wake up, realize our power and create something better.
The WORLD belongs to us ALL
To trade goods and services is a natural right of all people.
To issue the money necessary to make these exchanges is also the natural right of all people who are intelligent enough to do so.
We need not beg for money.
We do not need to be money slaves:
we can be money masters.

I'm afraid if I start writing that down, it'll turn into a suicide note.
I'm assuming this table's gonna have a lot more of those requests.
Yes, I could tell by the hats.

H-a-n.
No trap in my name.
I'm thinking we should take the first step in our new cupcake business by writing "Max's Homemade Cupcakes"
up on the specials board.
No, I can't have my name up there.
Everyone I owe money to thinks I live in Seattle.
Oh, we used to own Seattle.
Max, we've got to get the name out there.
Create a buzz.
Ooh, good idea!
Let's create a buzz.
Exactly, in order to launch--
I'm mocking you.
When in doubt, I'm always mocking you.
Seriously, Max.
This new cupcake business is our lifeline.
A way out for both of us.
And I wanna thank you again for letting me move in.
If there's anything I can do to help you--
You mean besides starting to wait on tables?
I meant, anything I can do to help you through your breakup with Robbie.
Oh.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
And we're working.
Well, one of us is.
Are you sure you're fine?
'Cause I heard you crying last night.
I don't cry.
I sold my tear ducts to an organ bank for cash two years ago.
I was on the couch.
And I heard you crying alone in your bedroom.
Really?
What did the crying sound like?
Like...
[Moaning]
I wasn't crying.
Well, then what were you d--
Oh!
So none of my business.
That's right.
And remember that.
Got it.
In fact, let's just say that anything having to do with my bedroom, my tables, or my life-- you should stay away from.
Boundaries.
Got it.
And please don't tell anyone at work
I let you move into my apartment.
That is one boundary we both don't want crossed.
Why?
Hey, roomies.
That's why.
Hope those sheets are okay.
Oh, don't worry about it.
I know they're the best you could afford.
Not really.
The good ones are on my bed.
Max, that oven is so hot.
Could you do me a favor and open the back door?
We've known each other two days and you're already asking for back door?
Dear God!
I forgot you're Equestrian Barbie.
You came with a horse.
No.
Out, horse, bad!
Bad horse.
Chestnut.
[Snaps]
No need to yell, he's a champion.
Champion stink bomb.
It's smelling pretty ripe out in that yard.
That's not Chestnut, that's Brooklyn.
Okay, well, I'm watching "The Champion"
drop some steaming hot "Brooklyn" right now.
Max, I've been thinking about how you completely overreacted to your name up on the specials board.
Do you think it's a fear of success?
I am too poor to have a fear of success.
At Wharton Business School, we learned that every new venture can bring up a certain amount of fear.
Is there any way to do a yelp review of Wharton Business School?
Maybe you're having a hard time imagining this cupcake business could ever even happen because nobody ever believed in you or your dreams.
I'm guessing.
I can make this happen, Max.
For me, for you, for us.
Just keep making those amazing cupcakes.
And I'll do the rest till you believe.
I believe everything you just said and that children are the future.
Max, it's me!
I know it's you.
You sleep with a knife under your pillow?
It's the only home security system I can afford.
And I'm a cutter.
I can't sleep on that couch.
I think Ikea might be the Scandinavian word for sciatica.
And there's weird sounds in the street.
And I don't have my white noise machine.
Well, that's Puerto Rican noise.
You'll get used to it.
Can I just lay down here and get a little sleep?
I don't even let the men I sleep with sleep with me.
I can't get into your issues right now.
I just need to sleep!
Fine, get in then.
What is that?
Potato chips.
I sleep-eat.
Cool ranch and bacon?
Dude, they're delicious.
Because of your breakup with Robbie?
Just get in.
I have to be in the city to babysit in five hours.
Oh, great, you're like a nightlight.
You're so blonde.
Thank you.
[Door creaks]
Max, someone's in the living room.
Max, someone's in the bedroom!
Robbie!
What's up, babe?
Robbie, what are you doing here?
We broke up.
Still?
Yes, still.
You hit on me.
And then she caught you with someone else in these very sheets.
Which I'm hoping she washed.
Oh, I get it.
You blew me off 'cause you like the ladies.
Which is cool.
I like the ladies, too.
And right now, it's the two ladies I like.
Robbie, if I were gonna go lesbian, she would be the last "les" I'd "bian."
Listen, babe--
You really hurt her.
Stop.
She sleep-eats trans fats thanks to you.
Here, stuff all of these in your mouth.
Got it, your thing.
I'll be quiet.
Robbie, this isn't cool at all.
Mm-mm.
Showing up here after what you did?
You go, girl.
I have something to say to you and you had better listen.
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.
What are you, the relationship ghost?
Robbie, just go!
I can't say what I need to in front of the relationship ghost.
I'll call you to come get your stuff and we can talk then.
Leave the key.
Straight up, Max, you're breaking my heart.
You're the only woman that I feel this way about.
Here.
Ladies, I don't know what's going on here, but it would've been a lot sexier if I was in it.
Are you okay?
If you wanna talk, I'm here.
Can I get a hit off that?
You think these are good?
God, we're poor.
Morning!
It's a beautiful day.
These shades belong down.
From now on, think of me as a vampire without all the annoying marketing.
Bad news.
A pipe broke in the street so the water's off.
Good news, when I went out to get us two coffees,
I spoke to Juan and Javier, two city workers.
And they assured me the water'll be on no later than 3:00.
I also stopped at the health food store and got us a fresh-squeezed juice to split.
It's ginger-apple-strawberry.
That was the name of the hooker who had this apartment before me.
What is this?
From me.
It says "Thanks for letting me sleep in your bed last night."
I prefer my usual cash on the bedside table.
When I went to the cute coffee place,
I spoke to the counter girl, Nabulangi--
If someone named Nabulangi is making an appearance in the first sentence, I have to sit down.
And she said her manager'll be in at 11:00.
So I thought I'd chanel it up, walk on over there, introduce myself and your fabulous cupcakes.
That's exactly what I was gonna do.
I'm just gonna go say good-bye to Chestnut and get going.
You know, having only one cute outfit takes hours off getting dressed.
Oh.
That is a lot of fresh Brooklyn.
Morning, Chestnut.
It's a beautiful--
No.
Way.
[Whimpering]
Look, Chanel Number Two.
Tell me it's mud.
T-tell me it's mud.
It's mud?
What is that?
A carrot?
There's carrots in the mud?
There's no water.
Oh, get it off me, please.
Please do something.
Just get it off me, get it off me.
Stop!
This is dry-clean only.
Max, please, please take me somewhere they have a hot shower, I beg of you.
Calm down, it's just mud.
Max, please-- [screams] Don't touch me!
Thank you so much for taking me to shower at your babysitting job.
Well, I didn't have much of a choice.
You pulled the pillow knife on me.
I'll just introduce myself to your boss and tell her what happened.
Look, I don't want Peach to know you were here.
This is a job.
Not a meet-and-greet.
Got it.
You get in there, you take a five-minute shower, clean it up and go.
Fine, I'll hide in the hallway till she's gone.
No need, just follow me in.
She never really looks at me.
Morning!
Hi, Max.
Go!
Hey, Peach.
Uh, hair and makeup.
What's the big occasion?
Pilates.
Max, good news.
They found a way to make diamonds more sparkly?
I got Brad and Angelina a playdate with another set of twins in the building.
It starts in five minutes.
Cool, what are their names?
6B.
Bye-bye, Brangelina.
Mommy loves you.
Guys?
Before you leave, stop at this one.
Angelina could use a little help.
Contour that neck, she's a fatty.
Peach, come on, that's baby fat.
Still, kids can be cruel.
Don't you listen to your mommy, Angelina.
She never eats.
Oh, no, she doesn't.
Here it is.
Caroline with an "E."
I have your new and correct nametag.
Oh, thank you, Han.
Oh.
I've seen something I should not have.
I will just put correct nametag here on counter.
So sorry, but many thank yous.
What are you doing?
I know you said you don't want it up there.
But now that you see it...
How does it feel?
It feels like you're not listening to me at this job or at my other job.
I said a five-minute shower and get out.
Did you take a nap at Peach's?
The thread count was calling to me.
Peach found blonde hairs in her bed and thought her husband was cheating on her.
Which he is, but that's not the point.
You almost ruined a perfectly happy fake marriage, and there are innocent children involved.
Well, I have some good news.
Look, it's Nabulangi.
I invited her in to taste your amazing cupcakes.
And when she loves them, we'll have an in at her bakery.
Come over and say hello.
No, I can't now.
I wanna call Robbie before we get too busy.
Tell him when to come over and get his stuff.
Max, wait.
No, don't distract me.
I wanna sound cool and hot and all like,
"You can't have me anymore, sucka."
Max--
Robbie, it's me.
Classy burp on your outgoing message.
Max, I--
No.
I need you to come get your stuff tomorrow.
I don't know how you've been surviving without your chin-up bar and Axe body spray.
Max, hang up.
I already called him.
You called Robbie?
You've done so much for me.
I wanted to do something for you, too.
So I called Robbie and I had him come over, and I gave him his stuff.
Now you won't have to go through with all that mess.
And I think you'd be pleased, I really let him have it.
What is with you and boundaries?
You're in my bed, you're in my boss' bed, and now you go and call Robbie?
You're like-- you're like your big-ass horse.
Charging in everywhere you don't belong.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
In spite of what you say about the sounds I heard coming from your bedroom the other night,
I know you're upset.
I was masturbating.
I love my job.
I need to see you outside.
Now.
Don't get involved with her.
She takes money from the homeless.
Not true, Bob's an investor.
Be right back.
Good cupcake, right?
Max, I don't know how smart that was, blowing by our only potential business contact.
You stole my breakup scene.
The only remotely good thing about breaking up with a guy is telling him how much better you are than him when you give him back his stuff.
I don't know if you noticed, but my entertainment budget is pretty low and I was really looking forward to that.
And then you went and stole it.
But I guess you couldn't help it, 'cause that's what you channings do, you steal things.
Huh.
Interesting.
Okay, you wanted a breakup scene?
You're in one.
I'm breaking up with you.
Oh, okay.
The cupcake business is over, the dream is dead.
Oh, I'm sure Nabulangi will be devastated.
I don't need you or your cupcakes to survive.
I'll figure something else out.
Because, aside from your constant Wharton putdowns,
I'm a business genius and I will always land on my feet.
Oh, really?
'Cause today you kind of landed on your front.
We're done.
After work tonight, I'll get my things and be gone.
Ooh, you gonna load up your dream-filled wheelie bag and ride away on sir muds-a-lot?
Go ahead.
Be as negative as you want.
'Cause you're in charge of your own future again.
Oh, joke's on you.
I don't have a future.
Max...
Are you up?
No.
Max, are you mad?
Yes.
Are you up and mad?
No and yes.
Oh, your bed's so soft.
That's my boob.
I know I moved out, but I came back.
I took the rest of our dead dream money and bought some cocktails for myself and some people.
And myself.
Did you bring me back any of those?
'Cause I can't listen to this sober.
Max...
I have nothing.
I really need the cupcake business.
I can be different.
No, you can't.
No, I can't.
But I can be better.
Please?
Please, let's do this.
I know you have a fear of success.
You do, because no one ever believed in your dreams.
But I believe in your dreams.
We have a dream.
God, you are so drunk.
So you probably won't even remember this.
I'm sorry I said that stuff about your father.
Did you hear me?
Max, are you up?
Hey, do you have any more of those poor people chips?
What's up, hangover three?
Why are these up?
I thought we were vampires.
Here, I took the rest of last night's cupcake money, and brought you a coffee and a fresh juice.
Which means that, after two days in business, we are $23 down from where we were.
So we're still building our cupcake business?
Sure.
All we need is how much?
$250,000.
Which is awesome.
Max, I'm sorry I crossed all those boundaries.
It's cool.
Me and drunk Caroline worked it all out.
In fact...
She signed this paper.
"I, drunk Caroline, am a..."
What's that word?
Punk ass ho.
Thanks.
"I, drunk Caroline, am a punk ass ho.
"I promise to keep my big mouth shut,
"and replace all of Max's poor people chips.
I will no longer meddle in her relation-chips."
You laughed about that until you threw up.
Oh, and if you're wondering, no, the puke stains will not void this contract.
God!
I forgot again that we have a horse.
Max, get him out of here.
He doesn't know I'm a waitress.
Chestnut.
He is a champion.
He learned that a lot faster than you did.
Hi, ready to order?
Do you have anything that's really special?
Not according to my high school guidance counselor.
I'll have the veggie plate.
But instead of beets, I want kale.
And instead of broccoli, more kale.
I want the veggies steamed.
And instead of dressing, I want lemons.
Don't you need to write this down?
I'm afraid if I start writing that down, it'll turn into a suicide note.
I'm assuming this table's gonna have a lot more of those requests.
Yes, I could tell by the hats.
Earl, I have something new I want you to try.
That's the exact same sentence that got me hooked on cocaine in the '80s.
It's my new cupcake flavor.
Delicious dark chocolate the ladies can't help but love.
I'm calling it "The Earl."
I know you got that right.
Hi, I'm here.
I was running late so I decided to hail a cab.
And then I remembered I didn't have any money on me.
And then I remembered I didn't have any money at all.
So I walked the whole way here.
The apartment's three blocks away.
Yes, I know.
Three blocks and 15 "Hola chicas" away.
Well, you can't be late again.
I'm already worried about me being late... every month.
On my way here, a homeless man asked me for money.
And I told him that I usually always give, but that my father was indicted in a Ponzi scandal and I've lost my family fortune and my Manhattan townhouse, so I've been sleeping on a couch in Brooklyn,
but, in spite of it all, I'm still optimistic that you and I will achieve success in our exciting new cupcake business venture.
And look what he gave me!
You took money from a homeless man?
I prefer to think of Bob near the bridge as our first investor.
Pickup!
Special sandwich.
I can think of even more special sandwich.
You, me and the hot blonde giraffe.
Well, she recently lost her dignity, so you might have a shot.
Hello today!
I have nametag for you.
Only your second day and look, nametag already.
As new owner, I am killing it.
Thank you.
Oh, it says "Carolin."
It's Caroline.
With an "E."
I'm Caroline.
As new owner, I am sucking it.
Just put it on.
You can't tell an Asian he made a mistake.
He'll go in the back and throw himself on a sword.
Thank you, Mr. Lee.
You may call me Han.
H-a-n.
No trap in my name.
I'm thinking we should take the first step in our new cupcake business by writing "Max's Homemade Cupcakes"
up on the specials board.
No, I can't have my name up there.
Everyone I owe money to thinks I live in Seattle.
Oh, we used to own Seattle.
Max, we've got to get the name out there.
Create a buzz.
Ooh, good idea!
Let's create a buzz.
Exactly, in order to launch--
I'm mocking you.
When in doubt, I'm always mocking you.
Seriously, Max.
This new cupcake business is our lifeline.
A way out for both of us.
And I wanna thank you again for letting me move in.
If there's anything I can do to help you--
You mean besides starting to wait on tables?
I meant, anything I can do to help you through your breakup with Robbie.
Oh.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
And we're working.
Well, one of us is.
Are you sure you're fine?
'Cause I heard you crying last night.
I don't cry.
I sold my tear ducts to an organ bank for cash two years ago.
I was on the couch.
And I heard you crying alone in your bedroom.
Really?
What did the crying sound like?
Like...
I wasn't crying.
Well, then what were you d--
Oh!
So none of my business.
That's right.
And remember that.
Got it.
In fact, let's just say that anything having to do with my bedroom, my tables, or my life-- you should stay away from.
Boundaries.
Got it.
And please don't tell anyone at work
I let you move into my apartment.
That is one boundary we both don't want crossed.
Why?
Hey, roomies.
That's why.
Hope those sheets are okay.
Oh, don't worry about it.
I know they're the best you could afford.
Not really.
The good ones are on my bed.
Max, that oven is so hot.
Could you do me a favor and open the back door?
We've known each other two days and you're already asking for back door?
Dear God!
I forgot you're Equestrian Barbie.
You came with a horse.
No.
Out, horse, bad!
Bad horse.
Chestnut.
No need to yell, he's a champion.
Champion stink bomb.
It's smelling pretty ripe out in that yard.
That's not Chestnut, that's Brooklyn.
Okay, well, I'm watching "The Champion"
drop some steaming hot "Brooklyn" right now.
Max, I've been thinking about how you completely overreacted to your name up on the specials board.
Do you think it's a fear of success?
I am too poor to have a fear of success.

I think Ikea might be the Scandinavian word for sciatica.

You'll get used to it.
Can I just lay down here and get a little sleep?
I don't even let the men I sleep with sleep with me.
I can't get into your issues right now.
I just need to sleep!
Fine, get in then.
What is that?
Potato chips.
I sleep-eat.
Cool ranch and bacon?
Dude, they're delicious.
Because of your breakup with Robbie?
Just get in.
I have to be in the city to babysit in five hours.
Oh, great, you're like a nightlight.
You're so blonde.
Thank you.
Max, someone's in the living room.
Max, someone's in the bedroom!
Robbie!
What's up, babe?
Robbie, what are you doing here?
We broke up.
Still?
Yes, still.
You hit on me.
And then she caught you with someone else in these very sheets.
Which I'm hoping she washed.
Oh, I get it.
You blew me off 'cause you like the ladies.
Which is cool.
I like the ladies, too.
And right now, it's the two ladies I like.
Robbie, if I were gonna go lesbian, she would be the last "les" I'd "bian."
Listen, babe--
You really hurt her.
Stop.
She sleep-eats trans fats thanks to you.
Here, stuff all of these in your mouth.
Got it, your thing.
I'll be quiet.
Robbie, this isn't cool at all.
Mm-mm.
Showing up here after what you did?
You go, girl.
I have something to say to you and you had better listen.
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.
What are you, the relationship ghost?
Robbie, just go!
I can't say what I need to in front of the relationship ghost.
I'll call you to come get your stuff and we can talk then.
Leave the key.
Straight up, Max, you're breaking my heart.
You're the only woman that I feel this way about.
Here.
Ladies, I don't know what's going on here, but it would've been a lot sexier if I was in it.
Are you okay?
If you wanna talk, I'm here.
Can I get a hit off that?
You think these are good?
God, we're poor.
Morning!
It's a beautiful day.
These shades belong down.
From now on, think of me as a vampire without all the annoying marketing.
Bad news.
A pipe broke in the street so the water's off.
Good news, when I went out to get us two coffees,

When I went to the cute coffee place,
I spoke to the counter girl, Nabulangi--

So I thought I'd chanel it up, walk on over there, introduce myself and your fabulous cupcakes.
That's exactly what I was gonna do.
I'm just gonna go say good-bye to Chestnut and get going.
You know, having only one cute outfit takes hours off getting dressed.
Oh.
That is a lot of fresh Brooklyn.
Morning, Chestnut.
It's a beautiful--
No.
Way.
Look, Chanel Number Two.
Tell me it's mud.
T-tell me it's mud.
It's mud?
What is that?
A carrot?
There's carrots in the mud?
There's no water.
Oh, get it off me, please.
Please do something.
Just get it off me, get it off me.
Stop!
This is dry-clean only.
Max, please, please take me somewhere they have a hot shower, I beg of you.
Calm down, it's just mud.
Max, please--
Don't touch me!
Thank you so much for taking me to shower at your babysitting job.
Well, I didn't have much of a choice.
You pulled the pillow knife on me.
I'll just introduce myself to your boss and tell her what happened.
Look, I don't want Peach to know you were here.
This is a job.
Not a meet-and-greet.
Got it.
You get in there, you take a five-minute shower, clean it up and go.

But I guess you couldn't help it, 'cause that's what you channings do, you steal things.
Huh.
Interesting.
Okay, you wanted a breakup scene?
You're in one.
I'm breaking up with you.
Oh, okay.
The cupcake business is over, the dream is dead.
Oh, I'm sure Nabulangi will be devastated.
I don't need you or your cupcakes to survive.
I'll figure something else out.
Because, aside from your constant Wharton putdowns,
I'm a business genius and I will always land on my feet.
Oh, really?
'Cause today you kind of landed on your front.
We're done.
After work tonight, I'll get my things and be gone.
Ooh, you gonna load up your dream-filled wheelie bag and ride away on sir muds-a-lot?
Go ahead.
Be as negative as you want.
'Cause you're in charge of your own future again.
Oh, joke's on you.
I don't have a future.
Max...
Are you up?
No.
Max, are you mad?
Yes.
Are you up and mad?
No and yes.
Oh, your bed's so soft.
That's my boob.
I know I moved out, but I came back.
I took the rest of our dead dream money and bought some cocktails for myself and some people.
And myself.
Did you bring me back any of those?
'Cause I can't listen to this sober.
Max...
I have nothing.
I really need the cupcake business.
I can be different.
No, you can't.
No, I can't.
But I can be better.
Please?
Please, let's do this.
I know you have a fear of success.
You do, because no one ever believed in your dreams.
But I believe in your dreams.
We have a dream.
God, you are so drunk.
So you probably won't even remember this.
I'm sorry I said that stuff about your father.
Did you hear me?
Max, are you up?
Hey, do you have any more of those poor people chips?
What's up, hangover three?
Why are these up?
I thought we were vampires.
Here, I took the rest of last night's cupcake money, and brought you a coffee and a fresh juice.
Which means that, after two days in business, we are $23 down from where we were.
So we're still building our cupcake business?
Sure.
All we need is how much?
$250,000.
Which is awesome.
Max, I'm sorry I crossed all those boundaries.
It's cool.
Me and drunk Caroline worked it all out.
In fact...
She signed this paper.
"I, drunk Caroline, am a..."
What's that word?
Punk ass ho.
Thanks.
"I, drunk Caroline, am a punk ass ho.
"I promise to keep my big mouth shut,
"and replace all of Max's poor people chips.
I will no longer meddle in her relation-chips."
You laughed about that until you threw up.
Oh, and if you're wondering, no, the puke stains will not void this contract.
God!
I forgot again that we have a horse.
Max, get him out of here.
He doesn't know I'm a waitress.
Chestnut.
He is a champion.
He learned that a lot faster than you did.
Hi.
Ready to order?
Do you have anything really special?
Not according to my high school guidance counselor.
I'll have the veggie plate, but instead of beets I want kale, and instead of broccoli, more kale.
I want the veggies steamed, and instead of dressing, I want lemons.
Don't you need to write this down?
I'm afraid if I start writing that down, it'll turn into a suicide note.
I'm assuming this table's gonna have a lot more of those requests?
Mm-hm.
- Yes.
I could tell by the hats.
Earl, I have something new I want you to try.
That's the exact same sentence that got me hooked on cocaine in the '80s.
It's my new cupcake flavor.
Delicious dark chocolate the ladies can't help but love.
I'm calling it The Earl.
I know you got that right.
I'm here.
I was running late, so I decided to hail a cab and then I remembered I didn't have any money on me.
Then I remembered I didn't have any money at all.
So I walked the whole way here.
The apartment is three blocks away.
Yes, I know.
Three blocks and 15 "hola, chicas" away.
Well, you can't be late again.
I'm already worried about me being late.
Every month.
On my way here, a homeless man asked me for money and I told him I usually always give but my father was indicted in a Ponzi scandal and I've lost my family fortune, my Manhattan townhouse so I've been sleeping on a couch in Brooklyn but, in spite of it all, I'm optimistic that you and I will achieve success in our exciting new cupcake business venture.
And look what he gave me.
You took money from a homeless man?
I prefer to think of Bob near the bridge as our first investor.
Pick up.
Special sandwich.
I can think of even more special sandwich.
You, me and a hot blond giraffe.
Well, she recently lost her dignity, so you might have a shot.
Hello, today.
I have name tag for you.
Only your second day and look, name tag already.
As new owner, I am killing it.
Thank you.
Oh, it says Carolin.
It's Caroline with an E.
- I'm Caroline.
- As new owner, I am sucking it.
Just put it on.
You can't tell an Asian he made a mistake.
He'll go in the back and throw himself on a sword.
Thank you, Mr. Lee.
You may call me Han.
H-A-N.
No trap in my name.
We should take the first step in our new cupcake business by writing Max's Homemade Cupcakes up on the specials board.
I can't have my name up there.
Everyone I owe money to thinks I live in Seattle.
Oh, we used to own Seattle.
Max, we've gotta get the name out there.
- Create a buzz.
- Oh, good idea.
- Let's create a buzz.
- To launch our new--
I'm mocking you.
When in doubt, I'm always mocking you.
Seriously, Max, this new cupcake business is our lifeline.
A way out for both of us.
And I wanna thank you again for letting me move in.
If there's anything I can do to help you--
You mean besides starting to wait on tables?
I meant anything I can do to help you through your breakup with Robbie.
Oh.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
And we're working.
Well, one of us is.
Are you sure you're fine?
- Because I heard you crying last night.
- I don't cry.
I sold my tear ducts to an organ bank for cash two years ago.
I was on the couch and I heard you crying alone in your bedroom.
Really?
What did the crying sound like?
Like:
- I wasn't crying.
- Well, then, what were you do--?
Oh.
So none of my business.
That's right.
And remember that.
- Got it.
- In fact, let's say anything having to do with my bedroom, my tables or my life...
-...you stay away from.
- Boundaries, got it.
And please, don't tell anyone at work I let you move into my apartment.
That is one boundary we both don't want crossed.
Why?
Hey, roomies
That's why.
- Hope those sheets are okay.
- Don't worry.
I know they're the best you could afford.
Not really.
The good ones are on my bed.
Max, that oven is so hot.
Could you do me a favor and open the back door?
We've known each other two days and you're already asking for back door?
Oh, God.
I forgot you're Equestrian Barbie.
You came with a horse.
No.
- Out, horse.
Bad.
Bad horse.
- Chestnut:
No need to yell.
He's a champion.
Champion stink bomb.
It's smelling pretty ripe out in that yard.
That's not Chestnut.
That's Brooklyn.
Okay, well, I'm watching the champion drop some steaming-hot Brooklyn right now.
Max, I've been thinking about how you completely overreacted to your name up on the specials board.
Do you think it's a fear of success?
I am too poor to have a fear of success.
At business school, we learned every new venture can bring up fear.
Is there any way I can do a Yelp review of Wharton Business School?
You're having a hard time imagining this business could ever even happen because nobody ever believed in you or your dreams.
I'm guessing.
I can make this happen, Max.
For me, for you.
For us.
Just keep making those amazing cupcakes and I'll do the rest till you believe.
I believe everything you just said and that children are the future.
Max, it's me.
I know it's you.
You sleep with a knife under your pillow?
It's the only home security system I could afford.
And I'm a cutter.
I can't sleep on that couch.
I think IKEA might be the Scandinavian word for sciatica.
And there's weird sounds in the street.
I don't have my white-noise machine.
Well, that's Puerto Rican noise.
You'll get used to it.
Can't I just lay down here and get a little sleep?
I don't even let the men I sleep with sleep with me.
I can't get into your issues right now.
I just need to sleep.
Fine, get in, then.
What is that?
Potato chips.
I sleep-eat.
Cool ranch and bacon?
Dude, they're delicious.
- Because of your breakup with Robbie?
- Just get in.
I have to be in the city to babysit in five hours.
Oh.
Great.
You're like a night-light.
You're so blond.
Thank you.
Max, someone's in the living room.
Max, someone's in the bedroom.
- Robbie?
- What's up, babe?
Robbie, what are you doing here?
We broke up.
Still?
Yes, still.
You hit on me, then she caught you with someone else, in these very sheets which I'm hoping she washed?
Oh, I get it.
You blew me off because you like the ladies.
Which is cool.
I like the ladies too.
And right now, I see two ladies I like.
Robbie, if I were gonna go lesbian, she would be the last lez I'd be in.
Listen, babe--
- You've really hurt her.
- Stop.
She sleep-eats trans fats, thanks to you.
Here.
Stuff all of these in your mouth.
Got it, your thing.
I'll be quiet.
- Robbie.
- Yeah?
- This isn't cool at all.
- Mm-mm.
- Showing up here after what you did.
- You go, girl.
I have something to say to you, and you had better listen.
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.
What are you, the relationship ghost?
Just go.
I can't say what I need to in front of the relationship ghost.
I'll call you to come get your stuff and We can talk then.
Leave the key.
Straight up, Max.
You're breaking my heart.
You're the only woman that I feel this way about.
Uh, here.
Ladies, I don't know what's going on here but it would've been a lot sexier if I was in it.
Are you okay?
If you wanna talk, I'm here.
Can I get a hit off that?
You think these are good?
God, we're poor.
Morning.
It's a beautiful day.
These shades belong down.
From now on, think of me as a vampire without all the annoying marketing.
Bad news.
A pipe broke in the street, so the water's off.
Good news.
When I went out to get us coffees I spoke to Juan and Javier, two city workers and they assured me the water will be on no later than 3.
I stopped at the health food store, got a fresh juice to split.
It's ginger apple strawberry.
That was the name of the hooker who had this apartment before me.
- What is this?
- From me.
Says thanks for letting me sleep in your bed last night.
I prefer my usual cash on the bedside table.
When I went to the cute coffee place, I spoke to the counter girl, Nabulangi--
Whoa.
If someone named Nabulangi is making an appearance in the first sentence, I have to sit.
And she said her manager will be in at 11.
So I thought I'd Chanel it up, walk on over there introduce myself and your fabulous cupcakes.
That's exactly what I was gonna do.
I'm gonna go say goodbye to Chestnut and get going.
You know, having only one cute outfit takes hours off getting dressed.
Oh.
That is a lot of fresh Brooklyn.
Morning, Chestnut.
It's a beautiful--
No way.
Look, Chanel number two.
Tell me it's mud.
Tell me it's mud.
It's mud?
What is that?
A carrot?
There's carrots in the mud?
There's no water!
Get it off me, please.
Please, do something.
Get it off me.
Get it off me.
Stop, this is dry-clean only.
Max, please.
Take me somewhere they have a hot shower.
I beg of you.
Calm down, it's just mud.
- Max, please.
- Aah!
God!
Thank you so much for taking me to shower at your babysitting job.
Well, I didn't have much of a choice.
You pulled the pillow knife on me.
I'll introduce myself to your boss and tell her what happened.
I don't want Peach to know you were here.
This is a job, not a meet and greet.
- Got it.
- Get in there, take a five-minute shower...
-...clean it up, and go.
- Fine.
I'll hide in the hallway till she's gone.
No need.
Just follow me in.
She never really looks at me.
- Morning.
- Hi, Max.
Go, go, go.
Down the hall.
Hey, Peach.
Uh, hair and makeup.
What's the big occasion?
Pilates.
Max, good news.
They found a way to make diamonds more sparkly?
I got Brad and Angelina a playdate with another set of twins in the building.
Starts in five minutes.
- Cool, what are their names?
- Six B.
Bye-bye, Brangelina.
Mommy loves you.
Guys, before you leave, stop at this one.
Angelina could use a little help.
Contour that neck.
She's a fatty.
Peach, come on, that's baby fat.
Still, kids can be cruel.
Don't you listen to your mommy, Angelina.
She never eats.
Oh, no, she doesn't.
Here it is.
Caroline with an E.
I have your new and correct name tag.
- Oh, thank you, Han.
- Oh.
I see something I should not have.
I will just put correct name tag here on counter.
So sorry but many thank-yous.
What are you doing?
I know you said you don't want it up there, but now that you see it how does it feel?
Like you're not listening to me at this job or at my other job.
I said five-minute shower and get out.
Did you take a nap at Peach's?
The thread count was calling to me.
Peach found blond hairs in her bed and thought her husband was cheating.
Which he is, but that's not the point.
You almost ruined a perfectly happy fake marriage.
- There are innocent children involved.
- Well, I have some good news.
Look.
It's Nabulangi.
I invited her to taste your amazing cupcakes.
When she loves them, we'll have an in at her bakery.
Come say hello.
I can't now.
I wanna call Robbie before we get too busy.
Tell him to come get his stuff.
- Max, wait.
- No.
Don't distract me.
I wanna sound cool and hot and all like, "You can't have me anymore, sucker."
- Max.
- Robbie, it's me.
Classy burp on your outgoing message.
- Max, I--
- Don't.
Get your stuff tomorrow.
I don't know how you've been surviving without your chin-up bar and Axe body spray.
Max, hang up.
I already called him.
You called Robbie?
You've done so much for me, I wanted to do something for you.
I called Robbie, had him come over, and gave him his stuff.
You won't have to go through with that mess.
And I think you'd be pleased, I really let him have it.
What is with you and boundaries?
You're in my bed, in my boss's bed, now you go and call Robbie?
You're like your big-ass horse, charging in everywhere you don't belong.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
In spite of what you say about the sounds from your bedroom the other night I know you're upset.
I was masturbating.
I love my job.
I need to see you outside.
Now.
Don't get involved with her.
She takes money from the homeless.
Not true.
Bob's an investor.
Be right back.
Good cupcake, right?
Max, I don't know how smart that was blowing by our only potential business contact.
You stole my breakup scene.
The only good thing about breaking up with a guy is telling him how much better you are than him when you give back his stuff.
I don't know if you noticed, but my entertainment budget is low.
I was really looking forward to that.
And then you went and stole it.
I guess you couldn't help it.
That's what you Channings do.
You steal things.
Huh.
Interesting.
Okay.
You wanted a breakup scene?
You're in one.
I'm breaking up with you.
- Oh, okay.
- The cupcake business is over.
The dream is dead.
Oh, I'm sure Nambulandi will be devastated.
I don't need you or your cupcakes to survive.
I'll figure something else out.
Aside from your constant putdowns I'm a business genius, and I will always land on my feet.
Oh, really?
Because today, you kind of landed on your front.
We're done.
After work tonight, I'll get my things and be gone.
Ooh, you gonna load up your dream-filled wheelie bag and ride away on Sir Muds-a-lot?
Go ahead, be as negative as you want.
You're in charge of your own future again.
Oh, joke's on you.
I don't have a future.
Max, are you up?
No.
Max, are you mad?
- Yes.
- Are you up and mad?
No and yes.
Oh.
Your bed's so soft.
That's my boob.
I know I moved out, but I came back.
I took the rest of our dead dream money and bought some cocktails for myself and some people and myself.
Did you bring me back any of those?
Because I can't listen to this sober.
Max I have nothing.
I really need the cupcake business.
I can be different.
No, you can't.
No, I can't.
But I can be better.
Please.
Please, let's do this.
I know you have a fear of success.
You do.
Because no one ever believed in your dreams.
I believe in your dreams.
We have a dream.
God, you are so drunk.
So you probably won't even remember this.
I'm sorry I said that stuff about your father.
Did you hear me?
Max, are you up?
Hey, do we have any more of those poor-people chips?
What's up, Hangover 3?
Why are these up?
I thought we were vampires.
Here.
I took the rest of last night's cupcake money and brought you a coffee and a fresh juice.
Which means that after two days in business we are $23 down from where we were.
So we're still building our cupcake business?
Sure.
All we need is how much?
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Which is awesome.
Max, I'm sorry I crossed all those boundaries.
It's cool.
Me and Drunk Caroline worked it all out.
In fact she signed this paper.
"I, Drunk Caroline, am a..."
What's that word?
Punk-ass ho.
Thanks.
"I, Drunk Caroline, am a punk-ass ho.
I promise to keep my big mouth shut and replace all of Max's poor-people chips.
I will no longer meddle in her relation-chips."
You laughed about that until you threw up.
Oh, and if you're wondering, no the puke stains will not void this contract.

Pickup!
Special sandwich.
I can think of even more special sandwich.
You, me and the hot blonde giraffe.
Well, she recently lost her dignity, so you might have a shot.
Hello today!
I have nametag for you.
Only your second day and look, nametag already.
As new owner, I am killing it.
Thank you.
Oh, it says "Carolin."
It's Caroline.
With an "E."
I'm Caroline.
As new owner, I am sucking it.

Like...
I wasn't crying.
Well, then what were you d--
Oh!
So none of my business.
That's right.
And remember that.
Got it.
In fact, let's just say that anything having to do with my bedroom, my tables, or my life-- you should stay away from.
Boundaries.
Got it.
And please don't tell anyone at work
I let you move into my apartment.
That is one boundary we both don't want crossed.
Why?
Hey, roomies.
That's why.
Hope those sheets are okay.
Oh, don't worry about it.
I know they're the best you could afford.
Not really.
The good ones are on my bed.
Max, that oven is so hot.
Could you do me a favor and open the back door?
We've known each other two days and you're already asking for back door?
Dear God!
I forgot you're Equestrian Barbie.
You came with a horse.
No.
Out, horse, bad!
Bad horse.
Chestnut.
No need to yell, he's a champion.
Champion stink bomb.
It's smelling pretty ripe out in that yard.
That's not Chestnut, that's Brooklyn.
Okay, well, I'm watching "The Champion"
drop some steaming hot "Brooklyn" right now.
Max, I've been thinking about how you completely overreacted to your name up on the specials board.
Do you think it's a fear of success?
I am too poor to have a fear of success.
At Wharton Business School, we learned that every new venture can bring up a certain amount of fear.
Is there any way to do a yelp review of Wharton Business School?
Maybe you're having a hard time imagining this cupcake business could ever even happen because nobody ever believed in you or your dreams.

I think Ikea might be the Scandinavian word for sciatica.

Can I just lay down here and get a little sleep?
I don't even let the men I sleep with sleep with me.
I can't get into your issues right now.
I just need to sleep!
Fine, get in then.
What is that?
Potato chips.
I sleep-eat.
Cool ranch and bacon?
Dude, they're delicious.
Because of your breakup with Robbie?
Just get in.
I have to be in the city to babysit in five hours.
Oh, great, you're like a nightlight.
You're so blonde.
Thank you.
Max, someone's in the living room.
Max, someone's in the bedroom!
Robbie!
What's up, babe?
Robbie, what are you doing here?
We broke up.
Still?
Yes, still.
You hit on me.
And then she caught you with someone else in these very sheets.
Which I'm hoping she washed.
Oh, I get it.
You blew me off 'cause you like the ladies.
Which is cool.
I like the ladies, too.
And right now, it's the two ladies I like.
Robbie, if I were gonna go lesbian, she would be the last "les" I'd "bian."
Listen, babe--
You really hurt her.
Stop.
She sleep-eats trans fats thanks to you.
Here, stuff all of these in your mouth.
Got it, your thing.
I'll be quiet.
Robbie, this isn't cool at all.
Mm-mm.
Showing up here after what you did?
You go, girl.
I have something to say to you and you had better listen.
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.
What are you, the relationship ghost?
Robbie, just go!
I can't say what I need to in front of the relationship ghost.
I'll call you to come get your stuff and we can talk then.
Leave the key.
Straight up, Max, you're breaking my heart.
You're the only woman that I feel this way about.
Here.
Ladies, I don't know what's going on here, but it would've been a lot sexier if I was in it.
Are you okay?
If you wanna talk, I'm here.
Can I get a hit off that?
You think these are good?
God, we're poor.
Morning!
It's a beautiful day.
These shades belong down.
From now on, think of me as a vampire without all the annoying marketing.
Bad news.
A pipe broke in the street so the water's off.
Good news, when I went out to get us two coffees,
I spoke to Juan and Javier, two city workers.
And they assured me the water'll be on no later than 3:00.
I also stopped at the health food store and got us a fresh-squeezed juice to split.
It's ginger-apple-strawberry.
That was the name of the hooker who had this apartment before me.
What is this?
From me.
It says "Thanks for letting me sleep in your bed last night."
I prefer my usual cash on the bedside table.
When I went to the cute coffee place,
I spoke to the counter girl, Nabulangi--
If someone named Nabulangi is making an appearance in the first sentence, I have to sit down.
And she said her manager'll be in at 11:00.
So I thought I'd chanel it up, walk on over there, introduce myself and your fabulous cupcakes.
That's exactly what I was gonna do.
I'm just gonna go say good-bye to Chestnut and get going.
You know, having only one cute outfit takes hours off getting dressed.
Oh.
That is a lot of fresh Brooklyn.
Morning, Chestnut.
It's a beautiful--
No.
Way.
Look, Chanel Number Two.
Tell me it's mud.
T-tell me it's mud.
It's mud?
What is that?
A carrot?
There's carrots in the mud?
There's no water.
Oh, get it off me, please.
Please do something.
Just get it off me, get it off me.
Stop!
This is dry-clean only.
Max, please, please take me somewhere they have a hot shower, I beg of you.
Calm down, it's just mud.
Max, please--
Don't touch me!
Thank you so much for taking me to shower at your babysitting job.
Well, I didn't have much of a choice.
You pulled the pillow knife on me.
I'll just introduce myself to your boss and tell her what happened.
Look, I don't want Peach to know you were here.
This is a job.
Not a meet-and-greet.
Got it.
You get in there, you take a five-minute shower, clean it up and go.
Fine, I'll hide in the hallway till she's gone.
No need, just follow me in.
She never really looks at me.
Morning!
Hi, Max.
Go!
Hey, Peach.
Uh, hair and makeup.
What's the big occasion?
Pilates.
Max, good news.
They found a way to make diamonds more sparkly?
I got Brad and Angelina a playdate with another set of twins in the building.
It starts in five minutes.
Cool, what are their names?
6B.
Bye-bye, Brangelina.
Mommy loves you.
Guys?
Before you leave, stop at this one.
Angelina could use a little help.
Contour that neck, she's a fatty.
Peach, come on, that's baby fat.
Still, kids can be cruel.
Don't you listen to your mommy, Angelina.
She never eats.
Oh, no, she doesn't.
Here it is.
Caroline with an "E."
I have your new and correct nametag.
Oh, thank you, Han.
Oh.
I've seen something I should not have.
I will just put correct nametag here on counter.
So sorry, but many thank yous.
What are you doing?
I know you said you don't want it up there.
But now that you see it...
How does it feel?
It feels like you're not listening to me at this job or at my other job.
I said a five-minute shower and get out.
Did you take a nap at Peach's?
The thread count was calling to me.
Peach found blonde hairs in her bed and thought her husband was cheating on her.
Which he is, but that's not the point.
You almost ruined a perfectly happy fake marriage, and there are innocent children involved.
Well, I have some good news.
Look, it's Nabulangi.
I invited her in to taste your amazing cupcakes.
And when she loves them, we'll have an in at her bakery.
Come over and say hello.
No, I can't now.
I wanna call Robbie before we get too busy.
Tell him when to come over and get his stuff.
Max, wait.
No, don't distract me.
I wanna sound cool and hot and all like,
"You can't have me anymore, sucka."
Max--
Robbie, it's me.
Classy burp on your outgoing message.
Max, I--
No.
I need you to come get your stuff tomorrow.
I don't know how you've been surviving without your chin-up bar and Axe body spray.
Max, hang up.
I already called him.
You called Robbie?
You've done so much for me.
I wanted to do something for you, too.
So I called Robbie and I had him come over, and I gave him his stuff.
Now you won't have to go through with all that mess.
And I think you'd be pleased, I really let him have it.
What is with you and boundaries?
You're in my bed, you're in my boss' bed, and now you go and call Robbie?
You're like-- you're like your big-ass horse.
Charging in everywhere you don't belong.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
In spite of what you say about the sounds I heard coming from your bedroom the other night,
I know you're upset.
I was masturbating.
I love my job.
I need to see you outside.
Now.
Don't get involved with her.
She takes money from the homeless.
Not true, Bob's an investor.
Be right back.
Good cupcake, right?
Max, I don't know how smart that was, blowing by our only potential business contact.
You stole my breakup scene.
The only remotely good thing about breaking up with a guy is telling him how much better you are than him when you give him back his stuff.
I don't know if you noticed, but my entertainment budget is pretty low and I was really looking forward to that.
And then you went and stole it.
But I guess you couldn't help it, 'cause that's what you channings do, you steal things.
Huh.
Interesting.
Okay, you wanted a breakup scene?
You're in one.
I'm breaking up with you.
Oh, okay.
The cupcake business is over, the dream is dead.
Oh, I'm sure Nabulangi will be devastated.
I don't need you or your cupcakes to survive.
I'll figure something else out.
Because, aside from your constant Wharton putdowns,
I'm a business genius and I will always land on my feet.
Oh, really?
'Cause today you kind of landed on your front.
We're done.
After work tonight, I'll get my things and be gone.
Ooh, you gonna load up your dream-filled wheelie bag and ride away on sir muds-a-lot?
Go ahead.
Be as negative as you want.
'Cause you're in charge of your own future again.
Oh, joke's on you.
I don't have a future.
Max...
Are you up?
No.
Max, are you mad?
Yes.
Are you up and mad?
No and yes.
Oh, your bed's so soft.
That's my boob.
I know I moved out, but I came back.
I took the rest of our dead dream money and bought some cocktails for myself and some people.
And myself.
Did you bring me back any of those?
'Cause I can't listen to this sober.
Max...
I have nothing.
I really need the cupcake business.
I can be different.
No, you can't.
No, I can't.
But I can be better.
Please?
Please, let's do this.
I know you have a fear of success.
You do, because no one ever believed in your dreams.
But I believe in your dreams.
We have a dream.
God, you are so drunk.
So you probably won't even remember this.
I'm sorry I said that stuff about your father.
Did you hear me?
Max, are you up?
Hey, do you have any more of those poor people chips?
What's up, hangover three?
Why are these up?
I thought we were vampires.
Here, I took the rest of last night's cupcake money, and brought you a coffee and a fresh juice.
Which means that, after two days in business, we are $23 down from where we were.
So we're still building our cupcake business?
Sure.
All we need is how much?
$250,000.
Which is awesome.
Max, I'm sorry I crossed all those boundaries.
It's cool.
Me and drunk Caroline worked it all out.
In fact...
She signed this paper.
"I, drunk Caroline, am a..."
What's that word?
Punk ass ho.
Thanks.
"I, drunk Caroline, am a punk ass ho.
"I promise to keep my big mouth shut,
"and replace all of Max's poor people chips.
I will no longer meddle in her relation-chips."
You laughed about that until you threw up.
Oh, and if you're wondering, no, the puke stains will not void this contract.
God!
I forgot again that we have a horse.
Max, get him out of here.
He doesn't know I'm a waitress.
Chestnut.
He is a champion.
He learned that a lot faster than you did.
Hi, ready to order?
Do you have anything that's really special?
Not according to my high school guidance counselor.
I'll have the veggie plate.
But instead of beets, I want kale.
And instead of broccoli, more kale.
I want the veggies steamed.
And instead of dressing, I want lemons.
Don't you need to write this down?
I'm afraid if I start writing that down, it'll turn into a suicide note.
I'm assuming this table's gonna have a lot more of those requests.
Yes, I could tell by the hats.
Earl, I have something new I want you to try.
That's the exact same sentence that got me hooked on cocaine in the '80s.
It's my new cupcake flavor.
Delicious dark chocolate the ladies can't help but love.
I'm calling it "The Earl."
I know you got that right.
Hi, I'm here.
I was running late so I decided to hail a cab.
And then I remembered I didn't have any money on me.
And then I remembered I didn't have any money at all.
So I walked the whole way here.
The apartment's three blocks away.
Yes, I know.
Three blocks and 15 "Hola chicas" away.
Well, you can't be late again.
I'm already worried about me being late... every month.
On my way here, a homeless man asked me for money.
And I told him that I usually always give, but that my father was indicted in a Ponzi scandal and I've lost my family fortune and my Manhattan townhouse, so I've been sleeping on a couch in Brooklyn,
but, in spite of it all, I'm still optimistic that you and I will achieve success in our exciting new cupcake business venture.
And look what he gave me!
You took money from a homeless man?
I prefer to think of Bob near the bridge as our first investor.
Pickup!
Special sandwich.
I can think of even more special sandwich.
You, me and the hot blonde giraffe.
Well, she recently lost her dignity, so you might have a shot.
Hello today!
I have nametag for you.
Only your second day and look, nametag already.
As new owner, I am killing it.
Thank you.
Oh, it says "Carolin."
It's Caroline.
With an "E."
I'm Caroline.
As new owner, I am sucking it.
Just put it on.
You can't tell an Asian he made a mistake.
He'll go in the back and throw himself on a sword.
Thank you, Mr. Lee.
You may call me Han.
H-a-n.
No trap in my name.
I'm thinking we should take the first step in our new cupcake business by writing "Max's Homemade Cupcakes"
up on the specials board.
No, I can't have my name up there.
Everyone I owe money to thinks I live in Seattle.
Oh, we used to own Seattle.
Max, we've got to get the name out there.
Create a buzz.
Ooh, good idea!
Let's create a buzz.
Exactly, in order to launch--
I'm mocking you.
When in doubt, I'm always mocking you.
Seriously, Max.
This new cupcake business is our lifeline.
A way out for both of us.
And I wanna thank you again for letting me move in.
If there's anything I can do to help you--
You mean besides starting to wait on tables?
I meant, anything I can do to help you through your breakup with Robbie.
Oh.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
And we're working.
Well, one of us is.
Are you sure you're fine?
'Cause I heard you crying last night.
I don't cry.
I sold my tear ducts to an organ bank for cash two years ago.
I was on the couch.
And I heard you crying alone in your bedroom.
Really?
What did the crying sound like?
Like...
I wasn't crying.
Well, then what were you d--
Oh!
So none of my business.
That's right.
And remember that.
Got it.
In fact, let's just say that anything having to do with my bedroom, my tables, or my life-- you should stay away from.
Boundaries.
Got it.
And please don't tell anyone at work
I let you move into my apartment.
That is one boundary we both don't want crossed.
Why?
Hey, roomies.
That's why.
Hope those sheets are okay.
Oh, don't worry about it.
I know they're the best you could afford.
Not really.
The good ones are on my bed.
Max, that oven is so hot.
Could you do me a favor and open the back door?
We've known each other two days and you're already asking for back door?
Dear God!
I forgot you're Equestrian Barbie.
You came with a horse.
No.
Out, horse, bad!
Bad horse.
Chestnut.
No need to yell, he's a champion.
Champion stink bomb.
It's smelling pretty ripe out in that yard.
That's not Chestnut, that's Brooklyn.
Okay, well, I'm watching "The Champion"
drop some steaming hot "Brooklyn" right now.
Max, I've been thinking about how you completely overreacted to your name up on the specials board.
Do you think it's a fear of success?
I am too poor to have a fear of success.
At Wharton Business School, we learned that every new venture can bring up a certain amount of fear.
Is there any way to do a yelp review of Wharton Business School?
Maybe you're having a hard time imagining this cupcake business could ever even happen because nobody ever believed in you or your dreams.
I'm guessing.
I can make this happen, Max.
For me, for you, for us.
Just keep making those amazing cupcakes.
And I'll do the rest till you believe.
I believe everything you just said and that children are the future.
Max, it's me!
I know it's you.
You sleep with a knife under your pillow?
It's the only home security system I can afford.
And I'm a cutter.
I can't sleep on that couch.
I think Ikea might be the Scandinavian word for sciatica.
And there's weird sounds in the street.
And I don't have my white noise machine.
Well, that's Puerto Rican noise.
You'll get used to it.
Can I just lay down here and get a little sleep?
I don't even let the men I sleep with sleep with me.
I can't get into your issues right now.
I just need to sleep!
Fine, get in then.
What is that?
Potato chips.
I sleep-eat.
Cool ranch and bacon?
Dude, they're delicious.
Because of your breakup with Robbie?
Just get in.
I have to be in the city to babysit in five hours.
Oh, great, you're like a nightlight.
You're so blonde.
Thank you.
Max, someone's in the living room.
Max, someone's in the bedroom!
Robbie!
What's up, babe?
Robbie, what are you doing here?
We broke up.
Still?
Yes, still.
You hit on me.
And then she caught you with someone else in these very sheets.
Which I'm hoping she washed.
Oh, I get it.
You blew me off 'cause you like the ladies.
Which is cool.
I like the ladies, too.
And right now, it's the two ladies I like.
Robbie, if I were gonna go lesbian, she would be the last "les" I'd "bian."
Listen, babe--
You really hurt her.
Stop.
She sleep-eats trans fats thanks to you.
Here, stuff all of these in your mouth.
Got it, your thing.
I'll be quiet.
Robbie, this isn't cool at all.
Mm-mm.
Showing up here after what you did?
You go, girl.
I have something to say to you and you had better listen.
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.
What are you, the relationship ghost?
Robbie, just go!
I can't say what I need to in front of the relationship ghost.
I'll call you to come get your stuff and we can talk then.
Leave the key.
Straight up, Max, you're breaking my heart.
You're the only woman that I feel this way about.
Here.
Ladies, I don't know what's going on here, but it would've been a lot sexier if I was in it.
Are you okay?
If you wanna talk, I'm here.
Can I get a hit off that?
You think these are good?
God, we're poor.
Morning!
It's a beautiful day.
These shades belong down.
From now on, think of me as a vampire without all the annoying marketing.
Bad news.
A pipe broke in the street so the water's off.
Good news, when I went out to get us two coffees,
I spoke to Juan and Javier, two city workers.
And they assured me the water'll be on no later than 3:00.
I also stopped at the health food store and got us a fresh-squeezed juice to split.
It's ginger-apple-strawberry.
That was the name of the hooker who had this apartment before me.
What is this?
From me.
It says "Thanks for letting me sleep in your bed last night."
I prefer my usual cash on the bedside table.
When I went to the cute coffee place,
I spoke to the counter girl, Nabulangi--
If someone named Nabulangi is making an appearance in the first sentence, I have to sit down.
And she said her manager'll be in at 11:00.
So I thought I'd chanel it up, walk on over there, introduce myself and your fabulous cupcakes.
That's exactly what I was gonna do.
I'm just gonna go say good-bye to Chestnut and get going.
You know, having only one cute outfit takes hours off getting dressed.
Oh.
That is a lot of fresh Brooklyn.
Morning, Chestnut.
It's a beautiful--
No.
Way.
Look, Chanel Number Two.
Tell me it's mud.
T-tell me it's mud.
It's mud?
What is that?
A carrot?
There's carrots in the mud?
There's no water.
Oh, get it off me, please.
Please do something.
Just get it off me, get it off me.
Stop!
This is dry-clean only.
Max, please, please take me somewhere they have a hot shower, I beg of you.
Calm down, it's just mud.
Max, please--
Don't touch me!
Thank you so much for taking me to shower at your babysitting job.
Well, I didn't have much of a choice.
You pulled the pillow knife on me.
I'll just introduce myself to your boss and tell her what happened.
Look, I don't want Peach to know you were here.
This is a job.
Not a meet-and-greet.
Got it.
You get in there, you take a five-minute shower, clean it up and go.
Fine, I'll hide in the hallway till she's gone.

Oh, joke's on you.
I don't have a future.

"Kate, because you are a connoisseur,

Nobody.
Good morning, Lauren.

Well, you've been stalling me with this music-publishing mediation, Kate.
I have not been stalling you.
Perhaps I just overstated a touch when, uh, I said that I was rounding third base.
How much did you overstate?
The "rounding third base" part.
It's more of like a, mm, first base kind of situation.

No lights equals no office.

- or I'm gonna have to step in.
- I'll take care of it.
God, how am I gonna take care of it?
Those band members...
they won't even talk to me.
Maybe they can only communicate through the power of song.
♪ oh, yeah yeah ♪
♪ oh, yeah yeah ♪
♪ oh, yeah yeah ♪ please stop doing that.
Go to the conference room.
So if they won't talk to us, what do we do?
Paul, there's not much that we can do.
I mean, we've been pressing their lawyer, and he has said repeatedly that Mac and Sherry are not interested in a licensing agreement, period.
I guess that'll probably be a no on the reunion tour too.
Yeah, what's their deal anyway?
Are they allergic to money?
Well, maybe they just don't like me.
Really?
You seem like a decent enough kind of guy.
Well, they remember the rock star prick I used to be.
Let's just say a few, uh, TVs lost their lives in a flight off hotel balconies.
Mm.
Well, look, no one is the same person that they were 15 years ago, but TV-catapulting aside,
I mean, I just don't understand why they won't engage in an arm's-length business deal with you.
Well...
Paul...
Come on.
This is confidential.
And I can't help you if you don't lay your cards out on the table.
I'm dying.
Blood cancer...
I've got three months to live.
Chased all the wrong things in my life, Kate, but I did have one hit song.
Hey...
I'm not worried about dying.
I'm worried about dying with regret.
I want to get the song out there again.
B.M.E.'s only giving us 48 hours to get this resolved.
If you can just try one more time.
Okay, um...
I'll go around their lawyer.
I will talk to Mac and Sherry in person.
- Mm-hmm.
- And, uh...
Once I tell them that you're sick, I mean...
- No...
No.
- But they'll understand.
No, I don't want them to know.
You're gonna tell them anyway, right?
No.
No, I can't.
I-I mean, unless they agree to participate in the mediation process, or you allow me to tell them.
Uh-huh.
I don't want them to think that I'm using my illness to force them into something, you know?
Okay, then that's that.
But I am gonna see them.
Well, that's great.
Thank you.
I'll be back by 4:00.
Um, the gamers' mediation's at 3:00.
That's what I said... 3:00.
Uh, Kate, this could be a tricky one.
Online role-playing games are a multibillion-dollar industry.
Have you read the emails that I sent?
All 800 of them?
Nope.
Don't underestimate the complexity of the online-gaming world.
Oh, Leo, I read the file.
- Read or skimmed?
- Um, somewhere in between.
Okay, let's review.
The two pasty-faced people coming to our boardroom this afternoon lead the armies of 10,000 gamers that pay $20 a month to our client to fight virtual battles on virtual battlefields.
Which is 200 grand a month, not including the cost of original software.
Are you really quizzing me?
I just want to make sure you're taking this seriously.
Yes, I will mediate their dispute,
"The Battle of Xerxerus", two "x"s... will go on as planned, and our client will not lose 200 grand a month.
So you're saying you read the file.
I told you, I "skread" it.
Mm, "skimmed" plus "read"... cute.
I'm not gonna embarrass you in front of the geek squad.
♪ promise ♪
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm Kate Reed.
I'm the mediator from your publishing firm, B.M.E.
I'm sorry.
We've been very clear.
We want nothing to do with the song licensing.
Okay, um, you have been clear, super clear.
Now let me be super clear.
Hi.
I'm Kate Reed, and all I want is five minutes of your time, but if you'd rather not talk to me,
I'm sure that Paul Shelton will be more than happy to come down and talk to you himself.
- Okay, come on in.
- Thank you.
You sign your name.
The advertising agency hands you a large check.
Maybe it's, like, one of those comically large ones that you get when you win the lottery.
Money's not everything.
No, but this is a lot of money.
Well, whatever it is, it's not enough for us to want to deal with Paul Shelton.
What did this guy do to you?
Just tell me, and I promise you, if I can't convince you that whatever it is doesn't matter anymore,
I'm gonna walk out that door.
It's hard to explain how addictive it is to be in a rock band, even at the level that we were at... just the one hit song.
Mac and I, we handled it badly.
Paul handled it worse.
It came to a head in '96 at the Vogue Theater.
Yeah yeah had reached number nine on the Billboard charts.
Paul was out of control...
Get off the phone, man!
Come on!
Trashing hotel rooms, tearing apart dressing rooms.
Hey.
When he attacked that roadie during sound check, that was the last straw.
Paul!
Who knows why he went after the guy, but by the time I got to him and pulled him off, he started swinging at me.
He left the theater, missed that night's show.
We never saw him again.
And you two were able to just walk away?
We're public-school teachers now.
That life is far, far in the past.
Hey, Brandon, can you turn it down a little?
Wow.
Sounds like a chip off the old block.
He's a lot better than I ever was.
When I found out I was pregnant,
Mac and I knew life on the road wasn't for us.
And no one's asking you to go back on the road, Sherry.
No, but if the song gets some exposure, people will pay attention again.
Somebody will do a "where are they now" piece on the band, and Paul will feed off of that stuff.
But our son deserves the nice, quiet life we've carved out for him.
Yes, and that's something that you can control.
If you want to be brutally honest, we just don't want Paul back in our lives.
Okay, I understand why you wouldn't want that Paul back in your lives, but I'm telling you, the guy that I met, he's not that guy.
Now, are you really willing to walk away from a big payday just because of some bad memories?
Excuse me.
Hey, uh, I'm Mac and Sherry's son, Brandon.
- Right, the guitar.
- Yeah.
Oh, I'm Kate.
You sounded really good.
Thanks.
Was there something that you wanted to tell me?
Just tell Paul Shelton to stay away from me and my parents.
- You heard us talking?
- Yeah.
That guy's a major prick.
Yeah, and then some.
He told me everything.
- He needs to stay away.
- Yeah, I got that.
He ruined their lives, okay?
And he's gonna do it again.
Brandon, what's going on?
Are you afraid that Paul's trying to get the band together?
Because your dad has... just keep him away from us, okay?
Today's feeling like a ham and swiss day, Benny.
Oh, sorry.
I'm out of ham and swiss.
Oh.
- Hey, Kim.
- Hey.
You're not Benny.
Where's Benny?
Did the jets have something to do with it?
Uh, Benny's on vacation, so I'm...
I'm picking up his shifts.
I'll be here every day this week.
Oh, my God.
That's so rough on me.
Did you want some turkey and cheddar?
I could never do that to ham and swiss.
- They'd hate me forever.
- I'll bring one tomorrow.
Uh, tomorrow's my peanut butter day.
So it's like I make it at home.
I'm home alone, which I usually am, so don't worry about tomorrow.
Right.
Okay.
I got to go.
Um, I'll walk with you.
Ah!
You know, because, uh, uh, cramps are an occupational hazard.
So you can be honest.
I mean, uh...
Uh, coming for more shifts, is it really an excuse to...
I needed to make some extra money.
That is what I mean...
money.
Money's a very good thing to have, if you're not a hermit.
Seeing you is a bonus.
Sorry.
I got a leg cramp right there.
I had to, uh, speed-walk it out.
Right.
Well, I should probably...
Move those sandwiches...
yes, yes.
Don't let me, uh, keep you from that.
Sorry I didn't have what you wanted.
Don't apologize to me.
Apologize to, uh, ham and swiss.
Oh, so sensitive.
You'd think they'd be neutral, because of the whole swiss thing, but, no.
Okay.
Ah, Leonardo.
Yeah, that was about as smooth as an alligator's butt.
Nothing's changed.
Looks exactly the same.
Should I try my key?
You still have your key?
Yeah.
You still have yours?
Well, I forgot to throw it out.
You think they changed the locks?
I don't know.
Oh, my God.
What did they do to our condo?
It's not our condo anymore.
I'm gonna check the pipes.
What were they going for here, like, brothel chic?
Yep!
Galvanized steel.
- What a jerk!
- What, me jerk?
No... plumber jerk.
No, really, Justin...
You can take on a drug cartel but then a guy in a tool belt...
he can get the best of you?
- Are you kidding me?
- Why is it suddenly my responsibility to do an extensive background check on a plumber?
- He said he was gonna put in...
- Hello!
- Hello.
- Hi.
- You must be Justin Patrick
- Kate Reid...
I kept my name.
- Oh, good for you.
- Yes.
Uh, and you are?
Margo Reston.
I represent the sellers.
Should we, uh, have a look at the pipes?
We already did.
It's steel.
Our plumber screwed us.
Look, we closed escrow, like, a year ago.
How come it took them so long to call us?
They just noticed.
You know, the neighborhood's had a big uptick, so they decided to take their profits and move to the Peninsula.
So, uh, they make a profit, and then they sue us for the pipes... excellent.
You know, I told you we shouldn't have sold to lawyers.
Oh, my God.
Enough with the lawyer digs.
New copper pipes are $2,000.
Someone is going to need to write a check.
You can mail it to me.
- She seemed like...
- Don't.
There's nothing to be nervous about.
Just show them that you're a new man.
Hey, Mac.
Long time.
Mac, thank you for coming.
Is Sherry joining us?
Uh, Brandon had a soccer game.
Oh.
All right, well, why don't you just have a seat and...
Oh, I'm good standing.
Great.
I'm...
I'm good, good to stand.
Paul, uh, why don't you start?
I really appreciate that you came, Mac.
I, uh...
I know there's been a lot of rough water between us and, uh, maybe we could just, you know, leave it behind us, move forward.
That's him as a changed man?
- What do you want me to say?
- How about "I'm sorry"?
Of course I'm sorry.
There you go, an apology...
that's a good first step.
I screwed up.
I drove you and...
and Sherry and Brandon,
I drove you all from my life.
I knew it.
That's what this is about.
What do you mean?
Tell her.
Yeah, tell me.
It's about, uh...
It's about the fans.
It's about us.
It's about everything.
You haven't got the guts to admit you made a huge mistake.
You want him back in your life.
Well, you know what?
It's too late.
Okay, somebody please tell me what's going on here.
Stay the hell away from us.
What is he talking about?
Brandon...
He's my son.
He's right, isn't he?
This isn't about the song.
You're just trying to get the money to get close to Brandon.
I'm using the only leverage I have.
Paul, B.M.E. retained this Firm to mediate a half-million-dollar case involving three songwriters and whether or not they use your song, that's just completely irrelevant to you.
All I have is Mac and Sherry and Brandon.
You should have told me the truth, Paul.
I told you I was a prick.
Okay, just hold on a second.
How did we get here?
Well, we'd been a band since we were 16.
Mac and Sherry were together right from the start.
And then in, uh, '96, they broke up.
Now, I'd always had a thing for Sherry.
She was the most amazing woman I'd ever met.
So I just went for it.
And for a few weeks, it was beautiful.
But when I saw them that day, kissing at the vogue, I knew it was over.
She picked him.
I had to lash out at somebody.
I was probably high.
I don't really remember.
Mac pulled me off, told me to get lost.
And Brandon?
I found out later that Sherry was pregnant and that the baby was mine.
But by that time, I was long gone.
Excuse me.
Kate, I need just a minute.
- I'm almost done here.
- Yeah.
Paul, I'm sorry that you're sick, but I can't work with clients who don't tell me the truth.
I understand.
I do.
From now on, we're gonna play by my rules, and that means that we tell everybody the truth.
So we're gonna tell Mac and Sherry that you're dying and that you want to see your son.
Okay.
What?
I'm rounding second.
Last week you were rounding third.
Do you know how baseball works?
You didn't call me in here to correct my metaphors.
B.M.E. Says the ad agency is sensing an impasse.
This may be over by the end of the day.
But you gave me 48 hours.
Apparently, they weren't mine to give.
The gamers are here.
Coming.
Hey, did you know that in the 1870s,
David Smith's bar was a surveyor's weigh station?
What?
Prospectors would bring their findings, get them weighed, and then get paid.
How is this helpful to my mediation?
It's not.
I just thought it was cool.
You're a very special man, Leonardo.
Where are the gamers?
May I introduce phoenixxx16.
I am the greatest warrior of them all.
Kneel before me.
And in this corner...
Darkenova45.
I will eviscerate all who walk in my path.
Good luck with that.
Ah, who's this?
This is you.
Hi, I'm Kate.
Hi, I'm Kate.
- I'm an elf?
- Actually, you're a druid.
A druid's sort of a half-elf.
And they're very powerful...
large spell books.
Leonardo, I work with real people.
I don't mediate cartoons.
Avatars.
Get me live human...
Leonardo, I work with real people.
I don't mediate cartoons.
Are you finished?
Get me live human beings in this conference room.
You're just mad because I made you a druid, okay?
The boils are a sign of beauty.
People...
I work with people.
You can't even command a druid.
Me?
The druid scoffed at you.
- Uh...
- the only scoffing was at your idiocy.
- Hey!
- Pig!
- Moron!
- Guys?
Mac, what are you doing here?
I took a walk to blow off some steam.
Come into my office, will you, please?
We've decided to give Paul the rights to the song, free and clear.
That's not what he wants.
Isn't that the case you were hired for?
Does Brandon know that Paul's his father?
Of course.
After Brandon was born, we tried to bring Paul into his life, but he was too busy... always on the road.
We raised our son.
We just want to be left alone to finish our job as parents.
Paul can have the song.
What's the catch?
He signs over all parental rights and a legal guarantee that he never tries to contact Brandon again.
Mac, people make mistakes.
That doesn't mean that they should have to live with them forever.
Ms. Reed, I've known Paul a long time.
All he's ever wanted is to be famous.
He'll take this deal, and it won't take him too long to figure it out.
♪ it's your hometown ♪
♪ it's your hometown ♪
♪ it's your hometown ♪
♪ your hometown ♪
♪ ooh whoa whoa ♪
- Thank you.
- Whoo, whoo, whoo!
I'm gonna take a short break.
Oh.
You still got it.
Well, playing for 12 people isn't like playing for 20,000, but, uh, there aren't a lot of jobs where people applaud when you're finished.
Was that an Ultravinyl song?
No, I don't play those, uh, anymore.
Doesn't seem right.
Mm.
Well, I like your new sound.
Thanks.
Been writing again.
I hadn't written a song in ten years.
Now I got them pouring out of me.
Hey, Paul...
Uh-oh.
I talked to Mac and Sherry.
They've agreed to give you the copyright to yeah yeah, but in exchange, they want you to sign a legal statement saying that you are never going to contact them or try to see Brandon ever again.
It's not your fault.
Um, you did the best you could, considering I lied to you about... about what I really wanted.
So that's it?
You've been absent from Brandon's life for 15 years, and now you're gonna just roll over?
Paul, I mean, how are we gonna show them that you've changed, that you still care?
Um...
Well, then I reject their offer.
Good.
I want to give my rights to the song to Brandon.
- Okay.
- Uh...
Mac and Sherry can use the money for... for his college tuition.
That's great.
And then what about seeing Brandon?
He's got good parents.
They're doing what they think is best for him.
Draw up the contract, so I can do what's best for him too.
Sure.
Brandon?
Hi.
My parents told me he was playing here.
Yeah.
Are you gonna go inside?
I was thinking about it.
Okay.
Yeah, you know, uh, your dad told me about Paul and who he is to you, Brandon... what kind of person forgets his own son, forgets he even exists?
- I don't know.
- Yeah.
Me neither.
But maybe you should go inside and ask.
What's he gonna say?
"Sorry I missed the first 16 years of your life"?
Brandon, it took him a long time to realize what's important.
But I think he knows it now.
Why now?
Oh, just let your parents fill in the blanks.
Yeah, that's what Paul is to me... a blank.
Maybe it's better that way.
No, nothing's better that way.
Brandon.
- I've got the short-form agreement for the Ultravinyl mediation.
Um, okay, great.
So then I'll just call you after my meeting.
What meeting?
There's nothing on your calendar.
Sometimes there are things that you just you don't know about, Leo.
Uh, no, there's not, ever.
If it's in your calendar, I put it there.
Well, you forgot about this one.
Well, I'm...
I'm sorry.
I, uh...
Don't worry about it.
People make mistakes.
Dave, tell him the one about the lawnmower.
What, and ruin his image of me as a man who's good with his hands?
Hey, David.
Hi, Kate.
Can I talk to you?
Well, I'm a little busy right now.
It'll only take a second.
Kate, I've got a bar full of customers.
Maybe some other time, okay?
If you don't come in and get that ointment...
That herpes will never clear up.
Have a good day.
Gentlemen.
I don't have it.
Ham and swiss.
Hey, you're back.
I didn't want ham and swiss to get the wrong impression of me.
It's a little late for lunch.
Midnight snack?
It's on me.
Thanks.
Yeah, I'll...
I'll probably be here late, because I'm about to rip into an epic game of, uh, World of Warcraft.
I just had a marathon session last night.
Really?
I took down a 50th-level warlock.
- You know, I-I'm actually working on a big online-gaming mediation right now...
I mean, uh, Kate and I are.
Right.
So I should probably get going.
See you tomorrow.
I'm happy Benny's on vacation.
Me too.
I wish Benny could be on vacation forever.
That wouldn't be a vacation...
- Technically.
- That's true.
And I would have to leave, since it's his business.
Another detail that I overlooked.
So...
Good-bye, Leonardo.
Bye, Kim.
Don't get lonely in the elevator.
I won't.
Can you hold that, please?
If she goes to the lobby, meets someone and falls in love instantly, flies to Las Vegas and gets married,
I gonna be so upset.
It's happened to me before.
I brought you a veggie patty with an extra side of veggie.
Thanks.
Look, Kate, about the plumber...
Oh, yes, you know what?
I brought my checkbook.
No, no, no, no, I'm gonna pay for this.
I'm not mad at you anymore.
Mad?
Why would you be mad?
You're the one who hired the plumber... what, without references?
Is that what you were gonna say?
No, no.
It doesn't matter.
Okay, if you recall, during that remodel,
I was in court with the tax evasion case.
Yes, and I was away on the Sumter case.
It was always something, wasn't it?
Always?
Let's just stick to the pipes, okay?
Yep.
That's a great idea.
It's the only way she'll meet with you.
She wants to meet in person.
- No way.
- That's crazy.
I know, I know, I know.
But trust me, she's the best there is.
If anyone can get this feud resolved, it's her.
I spent 18 hours designing this avatar... the armor, the weaponry.
- How will I defend myself?
- Against what?
It's not like the real Darkenova is gonna be riding up in here on a metal horse with a javelin.
I could bring a real javelin.
- No, you can't.
- Crossbow?
- No.
- Catapult?
You have those things in real life?
I'm bringing my scimitar.
No.
No.
No weapons, just yourselves.
And wear some decent clothes.
Bathrobes do not count...
common mistake among gamers.
There's been a slight change of plans.
Didn't I say something like this would happen?
We gave him the rights to the song.
Yes, and instead of you giving Paul your share of the rights, he would like to give Brandon his share.
- W-what's in it for Paul?
Well, he wanted to reconnect with you, but you've said that that's not possible, and he wants Brandon to have money for college or whatever else you think is best.
And I have the contract right here.
Don't sign it.
There are other things going on.
Meaning Brandon.
No.
Then what?
I can't tell you.
Paul's my client, and, unfortunately, I can't talk about it.
Just give me the contract so I can sign something and get him out of our lives.
Mediations are confidential.
Did you know that?
But because you refused to enter into mediation with Paul, you are outside of that circle of confidentiality.
So how about you come inside the circle just for a little bit?
So enter a mediation to end a mediation?
Exactly, yes.
And I have the engagement letter for the mediation right here.
Please sign it.
Okay.
He's dying.
What?
He has less than three months to live.
You said the artist agreements were signed.
All signed...
- So I called B.M.E.
- Oh, awesome.
So what...
what is the problem?
There's a paternity issue embedded in Paul's side of the deal that I would like to extricate.
- No.
- Oh, come on, Lauren.
Momentum's on my side right now.
I just really want to make everybody happy.
It's irrelevant to our transaction.
Paul's dying.
He's never spent any time with his son.
It's relevant to him.
Well, t-that's tragic.
The only reason he got this ball rolling to begin with was to fix all this before he dies.
So, technically, if he did not want to see his son, there would be no fee from the successfully mediated licensing deal... big fee, big big.
Just stall B.M.E. Just for a little while.
- How long?
- The rest of the day?
That's not gonna happen.
Give me an hour.
Ah.
And just what exactly do I tell the men from B.M.E.?
I believe in the force of your charming personality.
An hour.
Hi.
They're here.
Hey, Sher.
Hey, Paul.
Why don't we all have a seat, make ourselves comfortable?
Okay, it's now or never.
There's one huge advantage to having three months to live.
It gives you instant clarity.
I screwed up my life.
I don't want to screw up the next three months.
The three of us...
we really had something.
And I'm not talking about the music.
I'm talking about us.
You two were the only people who really knew me and cared about me.
And when I broke up the band,
I had...
I had no idea of the damage it would cause.
I was already leaving for my own sake, for the sake of our son.
I'm really, really sorry about you getting sick.
We don't always get an encore.
You know, Paul, for a few years, because of you, we had a lot of fun.
- It was a blast, wasn't it?
- Yeah.
That's true.
Oh, excuse me.
Done.
Or, uh, undone, I guess.
So we're good.
Yeah.
The revised contracts are on the table, and they're ready to go.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
You too.
You're not gonna hug me, are you?
- Never even dawned on me.
- Okay, good.
Yeah.
This is something I thought I'd never see.
I told you he's changed.
You just had to see it to believe it.
You know, his sound has changed too... he's amazing.
He's playing later at Buzz Coffee, and you should check it out.
You never give up, do you?
I wish I knew how.
Brandon!
Is he in there?
Brandon, why don't you just go in and meet him?
No.
Then go in and punch him.
No.
- Kick him.
- No.
- Scream at him!
Do something!
- No!
No!
Come on, punch me!
Do something!
Do something!
No!
Do something.
You keep showing up, but you're not doing anything, Brandon.
You're... you're... you're angry.
You're sad.
You're both.
You need to express these feelings.
He's dying.
I can't make you go in there.
I just...
I can't.
Okay, um, remember the coffee shop where you came to visit?
This is his last performance.
Why don't you just come through the back...
And just watch?
Okay?
They're here.
For real this time.
You're nervous.
Just a little bit.
They're just people.
They command large armies.
Virtual armies.
Paying real money.
Point taken.
Thank you both for stepping out from behind your avatars.
In a mediation, it's, uh... it's very important for both sides to not only be physically present, uh...
Nobody likes to be called that.
Okay, so then let's start.
Billy, why don't you go first?
Oh, it's okay.
You don't need to...
- What?
- Go right ahead.
You buy weapons from other people who have earned them.
That's not fair.
That's it?
Okay.
B-be seated.
Donna?
You don't...
you don't need to... it's not fair at you organize outlawed individuals into groups.
Excuse me.
Leonardo?
- It's going great.
- Really?
Yeah, you're really getting through to them.
But that doesn't mean anything if they're not communicating.
They're comfortable in an environment where you wouldn't be... a place where millions of people use a de facto form of communication that crosses borders and transcends cultural differences.
I-I-I'm serious.
- It's a multibillion-dollar...
- yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it.
Let me try again.
Phoenixxx16, Darkenova45, please rise.
I'm disappointed in you two.
You should be leading thousands of your minions to victory, but instead, you're both sitting here like lily-livered miscreants.
Where's your dignity, Phoenixxx16?
I have dignity.
I have volumes of dignity.
Then show some.
Fight.
And you, Darkenova45, have some pride.
I am proud.
Okay, then it's decided.
Let's hear a call to arms.
Tonight, we will dine together in hell.
Tell your legions that the Battle of Xerxerus will begin at 20:10 sharp!
Into the fire!
Into the fire!
Sometimes you scare me.
No.
No, no.
This is a nice surprise.
I never got to hear the rest of the song.
How did you get her to show up?
I gave her a flyer.
Mac's parking the car.
I'm so glad you came.
Good evening, everyone.
It's a big night for me.
And, um, I'm gonna play a...
I'm gonna play a song that...
That I haven't played in a long time.

- Hi.
- Hi.
I sent the money to the real-estate agent, and I ripped up your check.
I never should have hired that crackpot plumber in the first place.
I should've taken responsibility for stuff around the condo.
Yeah...
Maybe.
I didn't...
Always choose work over home.
Well, sometimes it felt like it.
You know, sometimes when we fight, it turns me on.
Always?
Yeah, always.
Now's not a good time.
Oh, why not?
I'm getting ready for the lunch crowd.
If you don't talk to me, I'm gonna come in here every day and say embarrassing things in front of your friends.
Um, Tequila?
Nope, not again.
How about a scotch?
Yeah.
One scotch.
- How do you take it?
- Neat.
Atta girl.
18-year-old Macallan.
She knows her scotch.
Nice.
My dad taught me about scotch.
I'll tell you a secret.
I taught your dad about scotch.
I don't really like secrets.
They always seem to hurt the person that they're trying to protect.
You don't think there are some things that people just shouldn't know?
No.
No.
It's like magic, and I hate magic.
I mean, why would I want to be tricked into believing something that isn't true?
I hate magic too.
So, um...
You taught my dad about scotch.
What else did you teach him?
How to lose the evidence?
Before I give you this,
I want you to know Teddy was a good man.
Are you saying he didn't lose the evidence?
Your father had to have a good reason for what he did.
But I can't ask him about that, can I?
Maybe that's the way he wanted it.
The Teddy I knew back in the day, the scrappy guy that would do what it took to get out of the neighborhood, what does it matter who that guy was?
It matters to me.
If I don know who my dad is, then how the hell do I know who I am, David?
There are some things about people's pasts that aren't worth knowing.
I'm kind of the opposite.
I like to know everything.
I got to start prepping for lunch.
Thank you for the drink.

Ah, doesn't ring a bell.
Well, they broke up about, uh, 15 years ago, and I'm mediating... or I'm trying to mediate an agreement to license the song for a car commercial, but two of the band members...
they won't sign off on a deal.
Listen, Kate, I said a lot of things the other night.
- We both said a lot of things.
- I know.
I just don't know how we're gonna move on from here good on you for washing her down.
Too many sand crabs have boats, but aren't willing to put in the time.

Turns out, he didn't put in copper plumbing.
Okay, well, why don't we call him and have him pay for this?
Oh, I tried.
His phone is disconnected.
I went down to see him at his store, it's a yogurt shop now.

- Good morning, Leo.

Ohh!
Yes, nothing says Monday like a fresh bottle of Tequila.
Leo...
You are gonna make a very popular boss.
Wasn't me, actually.
"Kate, because you are a connoisseur,
"David Smith."
I shared my knowledge.
I thought you went to talk to him about whether your father lost evidence in his trial.
I did, and we had some drinks to break the ice.
- How'd it go?
- We broke it heavily.
- And he told me nothing.
- Mm.
I've got to go to that bar.
He's hiding something.
I just need to figure out what it is.
Who?
Nobody.
Good morning, Lauren.
What can I do for you?
Well, you've been stalling me with this music-publishing mediation, Kate.
I have not been stalling you.
Perhaps I just overstated a touch when, uh, I said that I was rounding third base.
How much did you overstate?
The "rounding third base" part.
It's more of like a, mm, first base kind of situation.
Clients like B.M.E. keep the lights on.
No lights equals no office.
No office equals no job.
Does that cold tone of voice of yours... does that come naturally, or is that something that you practice?
I practice, every time I talk to you.
[Chuckles]
You've got 48 hours to get this done,
- or I'm gonna have to step in.
- I'll take care of it.
God, how am I gonna take care of it?
Those band members...
they won't even talk to me.
Maybe they can only communicate through the power of song.

Go to the conference room.
So if they won't talk to us, what do we do?
Paul, there's not much that we can do.
I mean, we've been pressing their lawyer, and he has said repeatedly that Mac and Sherry are not interested in a licensing agreement, period.
I guess that'll probably be a no on the reunion tour too.
Yeah, what's their deal anyway?
Are they allergic to money?
[Chuckles] Well, maybe they just don't like me.
Really?
You seem like a decent enough kind of guy.
[Chuckles]
Well, they remember the rock star prick I used to be.
Let's just say a few, uh, TVs lost their lives in a flight off hotel balconies.
Mm.
Well, look, no one is the same person that they were 15 years ago, but TV-catapulting aside,
I mean, I just don't understand why they won't engage in an arm's-length business deal with you.
Well...
Paul...
Come on.
This is confidential.
And I can't help you if you don't lay your cards out on the table.
I'm dying.
Blood cancer...
I've got three months to live.
Chased all the wrong things in my life, Kate, but I did have one hit song.
Hey...
I'm not worried about dying.
I'm worried about dying with regret.
I want to get the song out there again.
B.M.E.'s only giving us 48 hours to get this resolved.
If you can just try one more time.
Okay, um...
I'll go around their lawyer.
I will talk to Mac and Sherry in person.
- Mm-hmm.
- And, uh...
Once I tell them that you're sick, I mean...
- No...
No.
- But they'll understand.
No, I don't want them to know.
You're gonna tell them anyway, right?
No.
No, I can't.
I-I mean, unless they agree to participate in the mediation process, or you allow me to tell them.
Uh-huh.
I don't want them to think that I'm using my illness to force them into something, you know?
Okay, then that's that.
But I am gonna see them.
Well, that's great.
Thank you.
I'll be back by 4:00.
Um, the gamers' mediation's at 3:00.
That's what I said... 3:00.
Uh, Kate, this could be a tricky one.
Online role-playing games are a multibillion-dollar industry.
Have you read the emails that I sent?
All 800 of them?
Nope.
Don't underestimate the complexity of the online-gaming world.
Oh, Leo, I read the file.
- Read or skimmed?
- Um, somewhere in between.
Okay, let's review.
The two pasty-faced people coming to our boardroom this afternoon lead the armies of 10,000 gamers that pay $20 a month to our client to fight virtual battles on virtual battlefields.
Which is 200 grand a month, not including the cost of original software.
Are you really quizzing me?
I just want to make sure you're taking this seriously.
Yes, I will mediate their dispute,
"The Battle of Xerxerus", two "x"s... will go on as planned, and our client will not lose 200 grand a month.
So you're saying you read the file.
I told you, I "skread" it.
Mm, "skimmed" plus "read"... cute.
I'm not gonna embarrass you in front of the geek squad.

[humming yeah yeah]
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm Kate Reed.
I'm the mediator from your publishing firm, B.M.E.
I'm sorry.
We've been very clear.
We want nothing to do with the song licensing.
Okay, um, you have been clear, super clear.
Now let me be super clear.
Hi.
I'm Kate Reed, and all I want is five minutes of your time, but if you'd rather not talk to me,
I'm sure that Paul Shelton will be more than happy to come down and talk to you himself.
- Okay, come on in.
- Thank you.
You sign your name.
The advertising agency hands you a large check.
Maybe it's, like, one of those comically large ones that you get when you win the lottery.
Money's not everything.
No, but this is a lot of money.
Well, whatever it is, it's not enough for us to want to deal with Paul Shelton.
What did this guy do to you?
Just tell me, and I promise you, if I can't convince you that whatever it is doesn't matter anymore,
I'm gonna walk out that door.
It's hard to explain how addictive it is to be in a rock band, even at the level that we were at... just the one hit song.
Mac and I, we handled it badly.
Paul handled it worse.
It came to a head in '96 at the Vogue Theater.
Yeah yeah had reached number nine on the Billboard charts.
Paul was out of control...
Get off the phone, man!
Come on!
Trashing hotel rooms, tearing apart dressing rooms.
Hey.
[Slurring words]
When he attacked that roadie during sound check, that was the last straw.
- [Shouting]
- Paul!
Who knows why he went after the guy, but by the time I got to him and pulled him off, he started swinging at me.
He left the theater, missed that night's show.
We never saw him again.
And you two were able to just walk away?
We're public-school teachers now.
That life is far, far in the past.
[Electric guitar playing]
Hey, Brandon, can you turn it down a little?
Wow.
Sounds like a chip off the old block.
He's a lot better than I ever was.
When I found out I was pregnant,
Mac and I knew life on the road wasn't for us.
And no one's asking you to go back on the road, Sherry.
No, but if the song gets some exposure, people will pay attention again.
Somebody will do a "where are they now" piece on the band, and Paul will feed off of that stuff.
But our son deserves the nice, quiet life we've carved out for him.
Yes, and that's something that you can control.
If you want to be brutally honest, we just don't want Paul back in our lives.
Okay, I understand why you wouldn't want that Paul back in your lives, but I'm telling you, the guy that I met, he's not that guy.
Now, are you really willing to walk away from a big payday just because of some bad memories?
Excuse me.
Hey, uh, I'm Mac and Sherry's son, Brandon.
- Right, the guitar.
- Yeah.
Oh, I'm Kate.
You sounded really good.
Thanks.
Was there something that you wanted to tell me?
Just tell Paul Shelton to stay away from me and my parents.
- You heard us talking?
- Yeah.
That guy's a major prick.
[Laughs] Yeah, and then some.
He told me everything.
- He needs to stay away.
- Yeah, I got that.
He ruined their lives, okay?
And he's gonna do it again.
Brandon, what's going on?
Are you afraid that Paul's trying to get the band together?
Because your dad has... just keep him away from us, okay?
Today's feeling like a ham and swiss day, Benny.
Oh, sorry.
I'm out of ham and swiss.
Oh.
- Hey, Kim.
- Hey.
You're not Benny.
Where's Benny?
Did the jets have something to do with it?
[Laughs] Uh, Benny's on vacation, so I'm...
I'm picking up his shifts.
I'll be here every day this week.
Oh, my God.
That's so rough on me.
Did you want some turkey and cheddar?
I could never do that to ham and swiss.
- They'd hate me forever.
- I'll bring one tomorrow.
Uh, tomorrow's my peanut butter day.
So it's like I make it at home.
I'm home alone, which I usually am, so don't worry about tomorrow.
Right.
Okay.
I got to go.
Um, I'll walk with you.
Ah!
You know, because, uh, uh, cramps are an occupational hazard.
So you can be honest.
I mean, uh...
Uh, coming for more shifts, is it really an excuse to...
I needed to make some extra money.
That is what I mean...
money.
Money's a very good thing to have, if you're not a hermit.
Seeing you is a bonus.
Sorry.
I got a leg cramp right there.
I had to, uh, speed-walk it out.
Right.
Well, I should probably...
Move those sandwiches...
yes, yes.
Don't let me, uh, keep you from that.
Sorry I didn't have what you wanted.
Don't apologize to me.
Apologize to, uh, ham and swiss.
Oh, so sensitive.
You'd think they'd be neutral, because of the whole swiss thing, but, no.
Okay.
Ah, Leonardo.
Yeah, that was about as smooth as an alligator's butt.
Nothing's changed.
Looks exactly the same.
Should I try my key?
You still have your key?
Yeah.
You still have yours?
Well, I forgot to throw it out.
You think they changed the locks?
I don't know.
Oh, my God.
What did they do to our condo?
It's not our condo anymore.
I'm gonna check the pipes.
What were they going for here, like, brothel chic?
Yep!
Galvanized steel.
- What a jerk!
- What, me jerk?
No... plumber jerk.
No, really, Justin...
You can take on a drug cartel but then a guy in a tool belt...
he can get the best of you?
- Are you kidding me?
- Why is it suddenly my responsibility to do an extensive background check on a plumber?
- He said he was gonna put in...
- Hello!
- Hello.
- Hi.
- You must be Justin Patrick
- Kate Reid...
I kept my name.
- Oh, good for you.
- Yes.
Uh, and you are?
Margo Reston.
I represent the sellers.
Should we, uh, have a look at the pipes?
We already did.
It's steel.
Our plumber screwed us.
Look, we closed escrow, like, a year ago.
How come it took them so long to call us?
They just noticed.
You know, the neighborhood's had a big uptick, so they decided to take their profits and move to the Peninsula.
So, uh, they make a profit, and then they sue us for the pipes... excellent.
You know, I told you we shouldn't have sold to lawyers.
Oh, my God.
Enough with the lawyer digs.
New copper pipes are $2,000.
Someone is going to need to write a check.
You can mail it to me.
- She seemed like...
- Don't.
There's nothing to be nervous about.
Just show them that you're a new man.
Hey, Mac.
Long time.
Mac, thank you for coming.
Is Sherry joining us?
Uh, Brandon had a soccer game.
Oh.
All right, well, why don't you just have a seat and...
Oh, I'm good standing.
Great.
I'm...
I'm good, good to stand.
Paul, uh, why don't you start?
I really appreciate that you came, Mac.
I, uh...
I know there's been a lot of rough water between us and, uh, maybe we could just, you know, leave it behind us, move forward.
That's him as a changed man?
- What do you want me to say?
- How about "I'm sorry"?
Of course I'm sorry.
There you go, an apology...
that's a good first step.
I screwed up.
I drove you and...
and Sherry and Brandon,
I drove you all from my life.
I knew it.
That's what this is about.
What do you mean?
Tell her.
Yeah, tell me.
It's about, uh...
It's about the fans.
It's about us.
It's about everything.
You haven't got the guts to admit you made a huge mistake.
You want him back in your life.
Well, you know what?
It's too late.
Okay, somebody please tell me what's going on here.
Stay the hell away from us.
What is he talking about?
Brandon...
He's my son.
He's right, isn't he?
This isn't about the song.
You're just trying to get the money to get close to Brandon.
I'm using the only leverage I have.
Paul, B.M.E. retained this Firm to mediate a half-million-dollar case involving three songwriters and whether or not they use your song, that's just completely irrelevant to you.
All I have is Mac and Sherry and Brandon.
You should have told me the truth, Paul.
I told you I was a prick.
Okay, just hold on a second.
How did we get here?
Well, we'd been a band since we were 16.
Mac and Sherry were together right from the start.
And then in, uh, '96, they broke up.
Now, I'd always had a thing for Sherry.
She was the most amazing woman I'd ever met.
So I just went for it.
And for a few weeks, it was beautiful.
But when I saw them that day, kissing at the vogue, I knew it was over.
She picked him.
I had to lash out at somebody.
I was probably high.
I don't really remember.
Mac pulled me off, told me to get lost.
And Brandon?
I found out later that Sherry was pregnant and that the baby was mine.
But by that time, I was long gone.
Excuse me.
Kate, I need just a minute.
- I'm almost done here.
- Yeah.
Paul, I'm sorry that you're sick, but I can't work with clients who don't tell me the truth.
I understand.
I do.
From now on, we're gonna play by my rules, and that means that we tell everybody the truth.
So we're gonna tell Mac and Sherry that you're dying and that you want to see your son.
Okay.
What?
I'm rounding second.
Last week you were rounding third.
Do you know how baseball works?
You didn't call me in here to correct my metaphors.
B.M.E. Says the ad agency is sensing an impasse.
This may be over by the end of the day.
But you gave me 48 hours.
Apparently, they weren't mine to give.
The gamers are here.
Coming.
Hey, did you know that in the 1870s,
David Smith's bar was a surveyor's weigh station?
What?
Prospectors would bring their findings, get them weighed, and then get paid.
How is this helpful to my mediation?
It's not.
I just thought it was cool.
You're a very special man, Leonardo.
Where are the gamers?
May I introduce phoenixxx16.
I am the greatest warrior of them all.
Kneel before me.
And in this corner...
Darkenova45.
I will eviscerate all who walk in my path.
Good luck with that.
Ah, who's this?
This is you.
Hi, I'm Kate.
Hi, I'm Kate.
- I'm an elf?
- Actually, you're a druid.
A druid's sort of a half-elf.
And they're very powerful...
large spell books.
Leonardo, I work with real people.
I don't mediate cartoons.
Avatars.
Get me live human...
Leonardo, I work with real people.
I don't mediate cartoons.
Are you finished?
Get me live human beings in this conference room.
You're just mad because I made you a druid, okay?
The boils are a sign of beauty.
People...
I work with people.
You can't even command a druid.
Me?
The druid scoffed at you.
- Uh...
- the only scoffing was at your idiocy.
- Hey!
- Pig!
- Moron!
- Guys?
Mac, what are you doing here?
I took a walk to blow off some steam.
Come into my office, will you, please?
We've decided to give Paul the rights to the song, free and clear.
That's not what he wants.
Isn't that the case you were hired for?
Does Brandon know that Paul's his father?
Of course.
After Brandon was born, we tried to bring Paul into his life, but he was too busy... always on the road.
We raised our son.
We just want to be left alone to finish our job as parents.
Paul can have the song.
What's the catch?
He signs over all parental rights and a legal guarantee that he never tries to contact Brandon again.
Mac, people make mistakes.
That doesn't mean that they should have to live with them forever.
Ms. Reed, I've known Paul a long time.
All he's ever wanted is to be famous.
He'll take this deal, and it won't take him too long to figure it out.

No, I don't play those, uh, anymore.

Been writing again.
I hadn't written a song in ten years.
Now I got them pouring out of me.
Hey, Paul...
Uh-oh.
I talked to Mac and Sherry.
They've agreed to give you the copyright to yeah yeah, but in exchange, they want you to sign a legal statement saying that you are never going to contact them or try to see Brandon ever again.
It's not your fault.
Um, you did the best you could, considering I lied to you about... about what I really wanted.
So that's it?
You've been absent from Brandon's life for 15 years, and now you're gonna just roll over?
Paul, I mean, how are we gonna show them that you've changed, that you still care?
Um...
Well, then I reject their offer.
Good.
I want to give my rights to the song to Brandon.
- Okay.
- Uh...
Mac and Sherry can use the money for... for his college tuition.
That's great.
And then what about seeing Brandon?
He's got good parents.
They're doing what they think is best for him.
Draw up the contract, so I can do what's best for him too.
Sure.
Brandon?
Hi.
My parents told me he was playing here.
Yeah.
Are you gonna go inside?
I was thinking about it.
Okay.
Yeah, you know, uh, your dad told me about Paul and who he is to you, Brandon... what kind of person forgets his own son, forgets he even exists?
- I don't know.
- Yeah.
Me neither.
But maybe you should go inside and ask.
What's he gonna say?
"Sorry I missed the first 16 years of your life"?
Brandon, it took him a long time to realize what's important.
But I think he knows it now.
Why now?
Oh, just let your parents fill in the blanks.
Yeah, that's what Paul is to me... a blank.
Maybe it's better that way.
No, nothing's better that way.
Brandon.
- I've got the short-form agreement for the Ultravinyl mediation.
Um, okay, great.
So then I'll just call you after my meeting.
What meeting?
There's nothing on your calendar.
Sometimes there are things that you just you don't know about, Leo.
Uh, no, there's not, ever.
If it's in your calendar, I put it there.
Well, you forgot about this one.
Well, I'm...
I'm sorry.
I, uh...
Don't worry about it.

I didn't want ham and swiss to get the wrong impression of me.
It's a little late for lunch.
Midnight snack?
It's on me.
Thanks.
Yeah, I'll...
I'll probably be here late, because I'm about to rip into an epic game of, uh, World of Warcraft.
I just had a marathon session last night.
Really?
I took down a 50th-level warlock.
- You know, I-I'm actually working on a big online-gaming mediation right now...
I mean, uh, Kate and I are.
Right.
So I should probably get going.
See you tomorrow.
I'm happy Benny's on vacation.
Me too.
I wish Benny could be on vacation forever.
That wouldn't be a vacation...
- Technically.
- That's true.
And I would have to leave, since it's his business.
Another detail that I overlooked.
So...
Good-bye, Leonardo.
Bye, Kim.
Don't get lonely in the elevator.
I won't.
Can you hold that, please?
If she goes to the lobby, meets someone and falls in love instantly, flies to Las Vegas and gets married,
I gonna be so upset.
It's happened to me before.
I brought you a veggie patty with an extra side of veggie.
Thanks.
Look, Kate, about the plumber...
Oh, yes, you know what?
I brought my checkbook.
No, no, no, no, I'm gonna pay for this.
I'm not mad at you anymore.
Mad?
Why would you be mad?
You're the one who hired the plumber... what, without references?
Is that what you were gonna say?
No, no.
It doesn't matter.
Okay, if you recall, during that remodel,
I was in court with the tax evasion case.
Yes, and I was away on the Sumter case.
It was always something, wasn't it?
Always?
Let's just stick to the pipes, okay?
Yep.
That's a great idea.
It's the only way she'll meet with you.
She wants to meet in person.
- No way.
- That's crazy.
I know, I know, I know.
But trust me, she's the best there is.
If anyone can get this feud resolved, it's her.
I spent 18 hours designing this avatar... the armor, the weaponry.
- How will I defend myself?
- Against what?
It's not like the real Darkenova is gonna be riding up in here on a metal horse with a javelin.
I could bring a real javelin.
- No, you can't.
- Crossbow?
- No.
- Catapult?
You have those things in real life?
I'm bringing my scimitar.
No.
No.
No weapons, just yourselves.
And wear some decent clothes.
Bathrobes do not count...
common mistake among gamers.
[Computer beeps]
There's been a slight change of plans.
Didn't I say something like this would happen?
We gave him the rights to the song.
Yes, and instead of you giving Paul your share of the rights, he would like to give Brandon his share.
- W-what's in it for Paul?
Well, he wanted to reconnect with you, but you've said that that's not possible, and he wants Brandon to have money for college or whatever else you think is best.
And I have the contract right here.
Don't sign it.
There are other things going on.
Meaning Brandon.
No.
Then what?
I can't tell you.
Paul's my client, and, unfortunately, I can't talk about it.
Just give me the contract so I can sign something and get him out of our lives.
Mediations are confidential.
Did you know that?
But because you refused to enter into mediation with Paul, you are outside of that circle of confidentiality.
So how about you come inside the circle just for a little bit?
So enter a mediation to end a mediation?
Exactly, yes.
And I have the engagement letter for the mediation right here.
Please sign it.
Okay.
He's dying.
What?
He has less than three months to live.
You said the artist agreements were signed.
All signed...
- So I called B.M.E.
- Oh, awesome.
So what...
what is the problem?
There's a paternity issue embedded in Paul's side of the deal that I would like to extricate.
- No.
- Oh, come on, Lauren.
Momentum's on my side right now.
I just really want to make everybody happy.
It's irrelevant to our transaction.
Paul's dying.
He's never spent any time with his son.
It's relevant to him.
Well, t-that's tragic.
The only reason he got this ball rolling to begin with was to fix all this before he dies.
So, technically, if he did not want to see his son, there would be no fee from the successfully mediated licensing deal... big fee, big big.
Just stall B.M.E. Just for a little while.
- How long?
- The rest of the day?
[Elevator bell dings] That's not gonna happen.
Give me an hour.
Ah.
And just what exactly do I tell the men from B.M.E.?
I believe in the force of your charming personality.
An hour.
Hi.
They're here.
Hey, Sher.
Hey, Paul.
Why don't we all have a seat, make ourselves comfortable?
Okay, it's now or never.
There's one huge advantage to having three months to live.
It gives you instant clarity.
I screwed up my life.
I don't want to screw up the next three months.
The three of us...
we really had something.
And I'm not talking about the music.
I'm talking about us.
You two were the only people who really knew me and cared about me.
And when I broke up the band,
I had...
I had no idea of the damage it would cause.
I was already leaving for my own sake, for the sake of our son.
I'm really, really sorry about you getting sick.
We don't always get an encore.
You know, Paul, for a few years, because of you, we had a lot of fun.
- It was a blast, wasn't it?
- Yeah.
[Laughs] That's true.
[Knock at door]
Oh, excuse me.
Done.
Or, uh, undone, I guess.
So we're good.
Yeah.
The revised contracts are on the table, and they're ready to go.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
You too.
You're not gonna hug me, are you?
- Never even dawned on me.
- Okay, good.
Yeah.
[Indistinct chatter, Kate laughs]
This is something I thought I'd never see.
I told you he's changed.
You just had to see it to believe it.
You know, his sound has changed too... he's amazing.
He's playing later at Buzz Coffee, and you should check it out.
You never give up, do you?
I wish I knew how.
[Chuckles]
Brandon!
Is he in there?
Brandon, why don't you just go in and meet him?
No.
Then go in and punch him.
No.
- Kick him.
- No.
- Scream at him!
Do something!
- No!
No!
Come on, punch me!
Do something!
Do something!
No!
Do something.
You keep showing up, but you're not doing anything, Brandon.
You're... you're... you're angry.
You're sad.
You're both.
You need to express these feelings.
He's dying.
I can't make you go in there.
I just...
I can't.
Okay, um, remember the coffee shop where you came to visit?
This is his last performance.
[Sniffles]
Why don't you just come through the back...
And just watch?
Okay?
They're here.
For real this time.
You're nervous.
Just a little bit.
They're just people.
They command large armies.
Virtual armies.
Paying real money.
Point taken.
Thank you both for stepping out from behind your avatars.
In a mediation, it's, uh... it's very important for both sides to not only be physically present, uh...
Nobody likes to be called that.
Okay, so then let's start.
Billy, why don't you go first?
Oh, it's okay.
You don't need to...
- What?
- Go right ahead.
You buy weapons from other people who have earned them.
That's not fair.
That's it?
Okay.
B-be seated.
Donna?
You don't...
you don't need to... it's not fair at you organize outlawed individuals into groups.
Excuse me.
Leonardo?
- It's going great.
- Really?
Yeah, you're really getting through to them.
But that doesn't mean anything if they're not communicating.
They're comfortable in an environment where you wouldn't be... a place where millions of people use a de facto form of communication that crosses borders and transcends cultural differences.
I-I-I'm serious.
- It's a multibillion-dollar...
- yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it.
Let me try again.
Phoenixxx16, Darkenova45, please rise.
I'm disappointed in you two.
You should be leading thousands of your minions to victory, but instead, you're both sitting here like lily-livered miscreants.
Where's your dignity, Phoenixxx16?
I have dignity.
I have volumes of dignity.
Then show some.
Fight.
And you, Darkenova45, have some pride.
I am proud.
Okay, then it's decided.
Let's hear a call to arms.
Tonight, we will dine together in hell.
Tell your legions that the Battle of Xerxerus will begin at 20:10 sharp!
Into the fire!
Into the fire!
Sometimes you scare me.
No.
No, no.
This is a nice surprise.
I never got to hear the rest of the song.
How did you get her to show up?
I gave her a flyer.
Mac's parking the car.
I'm so glad you came.
Good evening, everyone.
It's a big night for me.
And, um, I'm gonna play a...
I'm gonna play a song that...
That I haven't played in a long time.

Wow.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I sent the money to the real-estate agent, and I ripped up your check.
I never should have hired that crackpot plumber in the first place.
I should've taken responsibility for stuff around the condo.
Yeah...
Maybe.
I didn't...
Always choose work over home.
Well, sometimes it felt like it.
You know, sometimes when we fight, it turns me on.
Always?
Yeah, always.
Now's not a good time.
Oh, why not?
I'm getting ready for the lunch crowd.
If you don't talk to me, I'm gonna come in here every day and say embarrassing things in front of your friends.
Um, Tequila?
Nope, not again.
How about a scotch?
Yeah.
One scotch.
- How do you take it?
- Neat.
Atta girl.
18-year-old Macallan.
She knows her scotch.
Nice.
My dad taught me about scotch.
I'll tell you a secret.
I taught your dad about scotch.
I don't really like secrets.
They always seem to hurt the person that they're trying to protect.
You don't think there are some things that people just shouldn't know?
No.
[Laughs]
No.
It's like magic, and I hate magic.
I mean, why would I want to be tricked into believing something that isn't true?
I hate magic too.
So, um...
You taught my dad about scotch.
What else did you teach him?
How to lose the evidence?
Before I give you this,
I want you to know Teddy was a good man.
Are you saying he didn't lose the evidence?
Your father had to have a good reason for what he did.
But I can't ask him about that, can I?
Maybe that's the way he wanted it.
The Teddy I knew back in the day, the scrappy guy that would do what it took to get out of the neighborhood, what does it matter who that guy was?
It matters to me.
If I don know who my dad is, then how the hell do I know who I am, David?
There are some things about people's pasts that aren't worth knowing.
I'm kind of the opposite.
I like to know everything.
I got to start prepping for lunch.
Thank you for the drink.
I'm calling across Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Whoa!
Jeez!
Don't sneak up on people.
Oh, please.
Don't let me interrupt, uh, whatever it is you're doing.
Well, if you don't clean a boat regularly, then salt water just rots it.
That's a vaguely familiar song, yet, still unappealing.
It's Yeah Yeah by Ultravinyl.
Yeah, it doesn't ring a bell.
Well, they broke up...
... about, uh, 15 years ago and I'm mediating, or I'm trying to mediate, an agreement to license the song for a car commercial.
But two of the band members, they won't sign off on a deal.
Listen, Kate.
I said a lot of things the other night.
We both said a lot of things.
I know.
I just don't know how we're going to move on from...
Good on you for washing her down.
Too many sand crabs have boats but aren't willing to put in the time.
Good to see you.
Hey.
You two know each other?
We've met.
We've met.
Kate Reed, you've been served.
We're being sued by the people who bought our condo.
What for?
Remember that guy we hired to put copper plumbing in our bathrooms?
Turns out he didn't put in copper plumbing.
Okay.
Well, why don't we call him and have him pay for this?
Oh, I tried.
His phone is disconnected.
I went down to see him at his store.
It's a yogurt shop now.
So, we're on the hook.
$2,000.
Yeah.
You want to stay and help clean?
Not today.
All right, well, ifyou change your mind,
I'll be here next week.
Same time, same place.
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Good morning, Leo.
Morning to you, Kate.
Oh!
Yes.
Nothing says Monday like a fresh bottle of tequila.
Leo!
You are going to make a very popular boss.
It wasn't me, actually.
"Kate, because you are a connoisseur.
"David Smith. "
I shared my knowledge.
I thought you went to talk to him about whether your father lost evidence in his trial.
I did.
We had some drinks to break the ice.
How did it go?
We broke it.
Heavily.
And he told me nothing.
Mmm.
I've got to go to that bar.
He's hiding something.
I just need to figure out what it is.
Who?
Nobody.
Good morning, Lauren.
What can I do for you?
Well, you've been stalling me with this music publishing mediation, Kate.
I have not been stalling you.
And perhaps I just overstated a touch when, uh, I said that I was rounding third base.
How much did you overstate?
The rounding third base part.
It's more of, like a, hmm, first base kind of situation.
Clients like B.M.E. keep the lights on.
No lights equals no office.
No office equals no job.
Does that cold tone of voice of yours, does that come naturally, or is that something that you practice?
I practice.
Every time I talk to you.
You've got 48 hours to get this done, or I'm going to have to step in.
I'll take care of it.
God, how am I going to take care of it?
Those band members, they won't even talk to me.
Maybe they can only communicate through the power of song.
Oh, yeah, yeah Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Please stop doing that.
Go to the conference room.
So, if they won't talk to us, what do we do?
Paul, there's not much that we can do.
I mean, we've been pressing their lawyer and he has said repeatedly that Mac and Sherry are not interested in a licensing agreement.
Period.
I guess that would probably be a "no" on the reunion tour, too.
Yeah, what's their deal, anyway?
Are they allergic to money?
Or maybe they just don't like me.
Really?
You seem like a decent enough kind of guy.
Yeah, well.
They remember the rock star prick I used to be.
Let's just say a few TVs lost their lives in the flight off hotel balconies.
Mmm.
Well, look.
No one is the same person that they were 15 years ago.
But, TV catapulting aside,
I mean, I just don't understand why they won't engage in an arm's length business deal with you.
Well...
Paul.
Come on.
This is confidential.
And I can't help you ifyou don't lay your cards out on the table.
I'm dying.
Blood cancer.
I've got three months to live.
I chased all the wrong things in my life, Kate.
But I did have one hit song.
Hey.
I'm not worried about dying.
I'm worried about dying with regret.
I want to get the song out there again.
B.M.E. is only giving us 48 hours to get this resolved.
If you can just try one more time.
Okay.
Um...
I'll go around their lawyer.
I will talk to Mac and Sherry in person.
Mmm-hmm.
And, uh, once I tell them that you're sick, I mean...
No.
No.
No?
But they'll understand.
No, I don't want them to know.
You're going to tell them anyway, right?
No.
No, I can't.
I...
I mean, unless they agree to participate in the mediation process or you allow me to tell them.
I don't want them to think that I'm using my illness to force them into something, you know?
Okay.
Then, that's that.
But I am going to see them.
Well, that's great.
Thank you.
I'll be back by 4:00.
Um, the gamers mediation is at 3:00.
That's what I said, 3:00.
Uh, Kate?
This could be a tricky one.
Online role-playing games are a multi-billion dollar industry.
Have you read the emails that I sent?
All 800 of them?
Nope.
Don't underestimate the complexity of the online gaming world.
Oh, Leo, I read the file.
Read or skimmed?
Um.
Somewhere in between.
Okay, let's review.
The two pasty-faced people coming to our boardroom this afternoon lead the armies of 10,000 gamers that pay $20 a month to our client to fight virtual battles on virtual battlefields.
Which is 200 grand a month, not including the cost of original software.
Are you really quizzing me?
I just want to make sure you're taking this seriously.
Yes.
I will mediate their dispute.
The Battle ofXerxerus, two X's, will go on as planned.
And our client will not lose 200 grand a month.
So, you're saying you've read the file.
I told you.
I skread it.
Mmm, skimmed plus read.
Cute.
I'm not going to embarrass you in front of the geek squad.
Promise.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Kate Reed.
I'm the mediator from your publishing firm, B.M.E.
I'm sorry, we've been very clear.
We want nothing to do with the song licensing, okay?
Okay, um, you have been clear.
Super clear.
Now, let me be super clear.
Hi.
I'm Kate Reed.
And all I want is five minutes of your time.
But, if you'd rather not talk to me,
I'm sure that Paul Shelton will be more than happy to come down and talk to you himself.
Okay.
Come on in.
Thank you.
You sign your name, the advertising agency hands you a large check.
Maybe it's, like, one of those comically large ones that you get when you win the lottery.
Money is not everything.
No, but this is a lot of money.
Well, whatever it is, it's not enough for us to want to deal with Paul Shelton.
What did this guy do to you?
Just tell me.
And I promise you, if I can't convince you that whatever it is doesn't matter anymore,
I'm going to walk out that door.
It's hard to explain how addictive it is to be in a rock band.
Even at the level that we were at, just the one hit song.
Mac and I, we handled it badly.
Paul handled it worse.
It came to a head in '96 at the Vogue Theater.
Yeah Yeah had reached number nine on the Billboard charts.
Paul was out of control.
Get off the phone, man.
Come on.
Trashing hotel rooms, tearing apart dressing rooms...
Hey.
I don't want to see his face.
When he attacked that roadie during sound check, that was the last straw.
Yeah.
Get up!
Come on!
Paul!
Who knows why he went after the guy, but by the time I got to him and pulled him off, he started swinging at me.
He left the theater, missed that night's show.
We never saw him again.
And you two were able to just walk away?
We're public school teachers now.
That life is far, far in the past.
Hey, Brandon?
Can you turn it down a little?
Wow!
Sounds like a chip off the old block.
He's a lot better than I ever was.
When I found out I was pregnant,
Mac and I knew life on the road wasn't for us.
And no one's asking you to go back on the road, Sherry.
No, but if the song gets some exposure, people will pay attention again.
And somebody will do a "Where are they now?" piece on the band.
And Paul will feed off of that stuff.
But our son deserves the nice, quiet life we've carved out for him.
Yes, and that's something that you can control.
If you want to be brutally honest, we just don't want Paul back in our lives.
Okay.
I understand why you wouldn't want that Paul back in your lives, but I'm telling you, the guy that I met, he's not that guy.
Now, are you really willing to walk away from a big payday just because of some bad memories?
Excuse me?
Hey.
Uh, I'm Mac and Sherry's son, Brandon.
Right, the guitar!
Yeah.
Oh, I'm Kate.
You sounded really good.
Thanks.
Was there something that you wanted to tell me?
You should tell Paul Shelton to stay away from me and my parents.
You heard us talking?
Yeah.
That guy is a major prick.
Yeah, and then some.
He told me everything.
He needs to stay away.
Yeah, I got that.
He ruined their lives, okay?
And he's going to do it again.
Brandon, what's going on?
Are you afraid that Paul is trying to get the band together?
Because your dad has no...
Just keep him away from us, okay?
Today's feeling like a ham and Swiss day, Benny.
Oh, sorry.
I'm out of ham and Swiss.
Oh.
Hey, Kim.
Hey.
You're not Benny.
Where's Benny?
Did the Jets have something to do with it?
Uh, Benny's on vacation.
So, I'm picking up his shifts.
I'll be here every day this week.
Oh, my God.
That's so rough on me.
Did you want some turkey and cheddar?
I could never do that to ham and Swiss.
They'd hate me forever.
I'll bring one tomorrow.
Uh, tomorrow's my peanut butter day.
So, it's, like, I make it at home.
I'm home alone, which I usually am.
So, don't worry about tomorrow.
Right.
Okay.
I've got to go.
Um.
Hey, I'll walk with you.
Ow!
You know, because...
Uh, cramps.
They're an occupational hazard.
So, you can be honest.
I mean, uh...
Coming for more shifts is really an excuse to, uh...
I needed to make some extra money.
That is what I mean.
Money.
Money is a very good thing to have if you're not a hermit.
I'm not a hermit.
Seeing you is a bonus.
Sorry, I got a leg cramp right there.
I had to, uh, speed walk it out.
Right.
Well, I should probably...
Move those sandwiches.
Yes.
Yes.
Don't let me, uh, keep you from that.
Sorry I didn't have what you wanted.
Oh, don't apologize to me.
Apologize to, uh, ham and Swiss.
Oh!
So sensitive.
You'd think they'd be neutral because of the whole Swiss thing.
But, no.
Okay.
Oh, Leonardo.
Yeah, that was about as smooth as an alligator's butt.
Nothing's changed.
Looks exactly the same.
Should I try my key?
You still have your key?
Yeah.
Do you still have yours?
Well, I forgot to throw it out.
You think they changed the locks?
I don't know.
Oh, my God.
What did they do to our condo?
It's not our condo anymore.
I'm going to check the pipes.
What were they going for here, like, brothel chic?
Yep.
Galvanized steel.
Jerk.
What, me jerk?
No.
Plumber jerk.
But really, Justin.
You can take down a drug cartel, but then a guy in a tool belt, he can get the best ofyou?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Why is it suddenly Are you kidding me?
my responsibility to do Hello?
an extensive background check on a plumber?
He said he was going to put in...
Hello?
You hired him.
Hello.
Hi.
You must be Kate and Justin Patrick.
Kate Reed.
I kept my name.
Oh.
Good for you.
Yes.
And you are?
Margo Reston.
I represent the sellers.
Should we, uh, have a look at the pipes?
We already did.
It's steel.
Our plumber screwed us.
We closed escrow, like, a year ago.
How come it took them so long to call us?
They just noticed.
Hmm.
You know, the neighborhood's had a big up-tick.
So, they decided to take their profits and move to the peninsula.
Mmm.
So, uh, they make a profit and then they sue us for the pipes.
Excellent.
You know, I told you we shouldn't have sold to lawyers.
Oh, my God.
Enough with the lawyer digs.
Didn't I tell you?
New copper pipes are $2,000.
Someone is going to need to write a check.
You can mail it to me.
She seemed like...
Don't.
There's nothing to be nervous about.
Just show them that you're a new man.
Hey, Mac.
Long time.
Mac, thank you for coming.
Is Sherry joining us?
Uh, Brandon had a soccer game.
Oh.
All right, well, why don't you just have a seat...
Oh, I'm good standing.
Great.
I'm good, good to stand.
Paul, uh, why don't you start?
I really appreciate that you came, Mac.
I, uh, I know there's been a lot of rough water between us, and uh...
Maybe we could just, you know, leave it behind us.
Move forward.
That's him as a changed man?
What do you want me to say?
How about, "I'm sorry"?
Of course, I'm sorry.
There you go.
An apology.
That's a good first step.
I screwed up.
I drove you and Sherry and Brandon, I...
I drove you all from my life.
I knew it.
That's what this is about.
What do you mean?
Tell her.
Yeah, tell me.
It's about, uh, it's about the fans.
It's about us.
It's about everything.
You haven't got the guts to admit you made a huge mistake.
You want him back in your life.
Well, you know what?
It's too late.
Okay.
Somebody please tell me what's going on here.
Just stay the hell away from us.
What is he talking about?
Brandon.
He's my son.
He's right, isn't he?
This isn't about the song.
You're just trying to get the money to get close to Brandon.
I'm using the only leverage I have.
Paul, B.M.E. retained this firm to mediate a half million dollar case involving three songwriters, and whether or not they used your song, that's just completely irrelevant to you.
All I have is Mac and Sherry and Brandon.
You should have told me the truth, Paul.
I told you I was a prick.
Okay.
Just...
Hold on a second.
How did we get here?
Well, we'd been a band since we were 16.
Mac and Sherry were together, right from the start.
And then, in, uh, '96, they broke up.
Now, I'd always had a thing for Sherry.
She was the most amazing woman I'd ever met.
So, I just went for it.
And for a few weeks, it was beautiful.
But when I saw them that day, kissing at the Vogue,
I knew it was over.
She'd picked him.
I had to lash out at somebody.
I was probably high.
I don't really remember.
Mac pulled me off, told me to get lost.
And Brandon?
I found out later that Sherry was pregnant.
And that the baby was mine.
But, by that time, I was long gone.
Hi.
Excuse me.
Kate, I need just a minute.
I'm almost done here.
Yeah.
Paul.
I'm sorry that you're sick.
But I can't work with clients who don't tell me the truth.
I understand.
I do.
From now on, we're going to play by my rules.
And that means that we tell everybody the truth.
So, we're going to tell Mac and Sherry that you're dying and that you want to see your son.
Okay.
What?
I'm rounding second.
And last week you were rounding third.
Do you know how baseball works?
You didn't call me in here to correct my metaphors.
B.M.E. says the ad agency is sensing an impasse.
This may be over by the end of the day.
But you gave me 48 hours.
Apparently, they weren't mine to give.
The gamers are here.
I'm coming.
Did you know that in the 1870s,
David Smith's bar was a surveyor's weigh station?
What?
Prospectors would bring their findings, get them weighed and then get paid.
How is this helpful to my mediation?
It's not.
I just thought it was cool.
You're a very special man, Leonardo.
Where are the gamers?
May I introduce,
Phoenixxx16.
I am the greatest warrior of them all.
Kneel before me.
And in this corner, Darkenova45.
I will eviscerate all who walk in my path.
Good luck with that.
Oh.
Who's this?
This is you.
Hi, I'm Kate.
Hi, I'm Kate.
I'm an elf?
Actually, you're a druid.
A druid is sort of half-elf.
And they're very powerful, large spell books.
Leonardo, I work with real people.
I don't mediate cartoons.
Avatars.
Get me live human...
I work with real people.
I don't mediate cartoons.
Are you finished?
Get me live human beings in this conference room.
You're just mad because I made you a druid.
Okay?
The boils are a sign of beauty.
People.
I work with people.
You can't even command a druid.
Me?
The druid scoffed at you.
Uh...
The only scoffing was at your idiocy, hack.
Hey.
Guys...
Mac.
What are you doing here?
I took a walk to blow off some steam.
Come into my office.
Will you, please?
We've decided to give Paul the rights to the song.
Free and clear.
That's not what he wants.
Isn't that the case you were hired for?
Does Brandon know that Paul is his father?
Well, of course.
After Brandon was born, we tried to bring Paul into his life but he was too busy.
Always on the road.
We raised our son.
We just want to be left alone to finish our job as parents.
Paul can have the song.
What's the catch?
He signs over all parental rights.
And a legal guarantee that he never tries to contact Brandon again.
Mac, people make mistakes.
That doesn't mean that they should have to live with them forever.
Ms. Reed, I've known Paul a long time.
All he's ever wanted is to be famous.
He'll take this deal.
And it won't take him too long to figure it out.
It's your hometown
It's your hometown
It's your hometown
Your hometown
Ooh, oh...
Thank you.
I'm going to take a short break.
Wow!
You've still got it.
Well, playing for 12 people isn't like playing for 20,000.
But, uh, there aren't a lot ofjobs where people applaud when you're finished.
Was that an Ultravinyl song?
No.
I don't play those, uh, anymore.
Doesn't seem right.
Mmm.
Well, I like your new sound.
Thanks.
I've been writing again.
Hadn't written a song in 10 years.
Now, I've got them pouring out of me.
Hey, Paul...
Uh-oh!
I talked to Mac and Sherry.
They've agreed to give you the copyright to Yeah Yeah.
But, in exchange, they want you to sign a legal statement saying that you are never going to contact them or try to see Brandon ever again.
It's not your fault.
Um, you did the best you could.
Considering I lied to you about what I really wanted.
So, that's it.
You've been absent from Brandon's life for 15 years and now, you're going to just roll over?
Paul!
I mean, how are we going to show them that you've changed?
That you still care?
Um...
Well, then, I reject their offer.
Good.
I want to give my rights to the song to Brandon.
Okay.
Uh...
Mac and Sherry can use the money for his college tuition.
That's great.
And then, what about seeing Brandon?
He's got good parents.
They're doing what they think is best for him.
Draw up the contract.
So I can do what's best for him, too.
Sure.
Brandon?
Hi.
My parents told me he was playing here.
Yeah.
Are you going to go inside?
I was thinking about it.
Okay.
Yeah.
You know, uh, your dad told me about Paul and who he is to you, Brandon...
What kind of person forgets his own son?
Forgets he even exists!
I don't know.
Yeah.
Me neither!
Then, maybe you should go inside and ask.
What's he going to say?
"Sorry I missed the first 16 years ofyour life?"
Brandon, it took him a long time to realize what's important.
But I think he knows it now.
Why now?
Oh, just let your parents fill in the blanks.
Yeah.
That's what Paul is to me.
A blank.
Maybe it's better that way.
No, nothing's better that way.
Brandon!
I've got the short-form agreement for the Ultravinyl mediation.
Um.
Okay, great.
So, then,
I'll just call you after my meeting.
What meeting?
There's nothing on your calendar.
Sometimes there are things that you just don't know about, Leo.
Uh, no, there's not.
Ever.
If it's in your calendar, I put it there.
Well, you forgot about this one.
Well, I'm sorry.
I, uh...
Don't worry about it.
People make mistakes.
David, tell him the one about the lawnmower.
What, and ruin his image of me as a man who's good with his hands?
I don't think so.
Hey, David.
Hi, Kate.
Can I talk to you?
Well, I'm a little busy right now.
It'll only take a second.
Kate, I've got a bar full of customers.
Maybe some other time, okay?
If you don't come in and get that ointment, that herpes will never clear up.
Have a good day.
Gentlemen.
I don't have...
Ham and Swiss.
Hey!
You're back.
I didn't want ham and Swiss to get the wrong impression of me.
It's a little late for lunch.
Midnight snack?
It's on me.
Thanks.
Yeah, I'll probably be here late because I'm about to rip into an epic game of, uh, World of Warcraft.
I just had a marathon session last night.
Really?
I took down a 50th level warlock.
You know, I'm actually working on a big online gaming mediation right now.
I mean, uh, Kate and I are.
Right.
So, I should probably get going.
See you tomorrow.
I'm happy Benny's on vacation.
Me, too.
I wish Benny could be on vacation forever.
That wouldn't be a vacation, technically.
That's true.
And I would have to leave since it's his business.
Another detail that I overlooked.
So...
Goodbye, Leonardo.
Bye, Kim.
Don't get lonely in the elevator.
I won't.
Can you hold that, please?
If she goes to the lobby and meets someone and falls in love instantly, flies to Las Vegas and gets married,
I'm going to be so upset.
It's happened to me before.
I brought you a veggie patty with an extra side of veggie.
Thanks.
Look, Kate, about the plumber...
Oh, yes.
You know what?
I brought my checkbook.
No, no, no, no.
I'm going to pay for this.
I'm not mad at you anymore.
Mad?
Why would you be mad?
You're the one who hired the plumber.
What, without references?
Is that what you were going to say?
No.
No.
It doesn't matter...
Okay.
If you recall, during that remodel,
I was in court with the tax evasion case.
Yes.
And I was away on the Sumter case.
It was always something, wasn't it?
Always?
Let's just stick to the pipes.
Okay?
Yep.
That's a great idea.
It's the only way she'll meet with you.
She wants to meet in person.
No way.
That's crazy.
I know.
I know.
I know.
But trust me, she's the best there is.
If anyone can get this feud resolved, it's her.
I spent 18 hours designing this avatar.
The armor, the weaponry.
How will I defend myself?
Against what?
It's not like the real Darkenova is going to be riding up in here on a metal horse with a javelin!
I could bring a real javelin.
No, you can't.
Crossbow?
No.
Catapult?
You have those things in real life?
I'm bringing my scimitar.
No.
No.
No weapons.
Just yourselves.
And wear some decent clothes.
Bathrobes do not count.
Common mistake among gamers.
There's been a slight change of plans.
Didn't I say something like this would happen?
We gave him the rights to the song.
Yes.
And instead ofyou giving Paul your share ofthe rights, he would like to give Brandon his share.
What's in it for Paul?
Well, he wanted to reconnect with you, but you've said that that's not possible.
And he wants Brandon to have money for college.
Or whatever else you think is best.
And I have the contract right here.
Don't sign it.
There are other things going on.
Meaning Brandon.
Uh, no.
Then, what?
I can't tell you.
Paul's my client.
And unfortunately, I can't talk about it.
Just give me the contract so I can sign something and get him out of our lives.
Mediations are confidential.
Did you know that?
But, because you refused to enter into mediation with Paul, you are outside of that circle of confidentiality.
So, how about you come inside the circle just for a little bit?
So, enter a mediation to end the mediation?
Exactly.
Yes.
And I have the engagement letter for the mediation, right here.
Please sign it.
Okay.
He's dying.
What?
He has less than three months to live.
You said the artist agreements were signed.
All signed.
So, I called B.M.E.
Oh.
Awesome.
So, what is the problem?
There's a paternity issue embedded in Paul's side of the deal that I would like to extricate.
Yeah.
No.
Oh, come on, Lauren.
Momentum's on my side right now.
I just really want to make everybody happy.
It's irrelevant to our transaction.
Paul's dying.
He's never spent any time with his son.
It's relevant to him.
Well, that's tragic, but...
The only reason he got this ball rolling to begin with was to fix all this before he dies.
So, technically, if he did not want to see his son, there would be no fee from the successfully mediated licensing deal.
Big fee.
Big, big.
Just stall B.M.E., just for a little while.
How long?
The rest ofthe day?
That's not going to happen.
Give me an hour.
Ah!
And just what exactly do I tell the men from B.M.E.?
I believe in the force ofyour charming personality.
An hour.
Hi.
They're here.
Hey, Sher.
Hey, Paul.
Why don't we all have a seat?
Make ourselves comfortable.
Okay.
It's now or never.
There's one huge advantage to having three months to live.
It gives you instant clarity.
I screwed up my life.
I don't want to screw up the next three months.
The three of us...
We really had something.
And I'm not talking about the music.
I'm talking about us.
You two were the only people who really knew me, who cared about me.
And when I broke up the band,
I had no idea of the damage it would cause.
I was already leaving.
For my own sake.
For the sake of our son.
I'm really, really sorry about you getting sick.
We don't always get an encore.
You know, Paul, for a few years, because of you, we had a lot of fun.
It was a blast, wasn't it?
Yeah.
That's true.
Oh, excuse me.
Certainly.
Done.
Or, uh, undone, I guess.
So, we're good.
Yeah.
The revised contracts are on the table and they're ready to go.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
You, too.
You're not going to hug me, are you?
Never even dawned on me.
Okay, good.
Yeah.
I heard you had another gig?
Oh, I did.
You know, small.
This is something I thought I'd never see.
I told you he's changed.
You just had to see it to believe it.
You know, his sound has changed, too.
He's amazing.
He's playing later at Buzz Coffee and you should check it out.
You never give up, do you?
I wish I knew how.
Brandon.
Is he in there?
Brandon, why don't you just go in and meet him?
No.
Then go in and punch him.
No.
Kick him.
No.
Scream at him.
No!
Do something.
Come on.
No.
No.
No!
Hit me.
Come on.
Punch me.
Do something.
Do something.
No!
You keep showing up, but you're not doing anything, Brandon.
You're angry.
You're sad.
You're both.
You need to express these feelings.
He's dying.
I can't make you go in there.
I just...
I can't.
Okay.
Um...
Remember the coffee shop that you came to visit?
This is his last performance.
Why don't you just come through the back and just watch?
Okay?
They're here.
For real this time.
You're nervous.
Just a little bit.
They're just people.
They command large armies.
Virtual armies.
Paying real money.
Point taken.
Thank you both for stepping out from behind your avatars.
In a mediation, it's very important for both sides to not only be physically present, uh...
Nobody likes to be called that.
Okay.
So, then, let's start.
Billy, why don't you go first?
Oh.
It's okay.
You don't need...
What?
Go right ahead.
You buy weapons from other people who have earned them.
That's not fair.
That's it?
Okay.
Be seated.
Donna?
You don't need to...
It's not fair that you organize outlawed individuals into groups.
Excuse me.
Leonardo.
It's going great.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
You're really getting through to them.
But that doesn't mean anything if they're not communicating.
They're comfortable in an environment where you wouldn't be.
A place where millions of people use a de facto form of communication that crosses borders and transcends cultural differences.
I'm serious.
It's a multi-million dollar...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it.
I'm gonna try again.
Phoenixxx16, Darkenova45.
Please rise.
I'm disappointed in you two.
You should be leading thousands of your minions to victory.
But instead, you're both sitting here like lily-livered miscreants.
Where's your dignity, Phoenixxx16?
I have dignity.
I have volumes of dignity.
Then show some!
Fight.
And you, Darkenova45.
Have some pride.
I am proud.
Okay, then.
It's decided.
Let's hear a call to arms.
Tonight, we will dine together in Hell.
Tell your legions that the Battle ofXerxerus will begin at 2010, sharp.
Into the fire!
Sometimes, you scare me.
No.
No.
No.
Well, this is a nice surprise.
I never got to hear the rest of the song.
How did you get her to show up?
I gave her a flyer.
Mac's parking the car.
I'm so glad you came.
Good evening, everyone.
It's a big night for me.
And, uh, I'm going to play...
I'm going to play a song that I haven't played in a long time.
Well, I'm calling across
Can you hear me?
Yeah, I'm calling across
Can you hear me?
Whoa, yeah, yeah Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah Oh, I
Oh, yeah Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah Oh, I
If you want me
Just come and get me
Don't be shy
And some I pleasure Some I treasure
Because I'm calling across
Can you hear me?
Yeah, I'm calling across
Can you hear me?
Wow.
Hi.
Hi.
I sent the money to the real estate agent.
And I ripped up your check.
I never should have hired that crackpot plumber in the first place.
I should have taken responsibility for stuff around the condo.
Yeah.
Maybe.
I didn't always choose work over home.
Well, sometimes, it felt like it.
Sometimes, when we fight it turns me on a little bit.
Always?
Yeah.
Always.
Now is not a good time.
Oh, why not?
I'm getting ready for the lunch crowd.
If you don't talk to me, I'm gonna come in here every day and say embarrassing things in front of your friends.
Uh, tequila?
Nope.
Not again.
How about scotch?
Yeah.
One scotch.
How do you take it?
Neat.
Good girl.
Eighteen-year-old Macallan.
She knows her scotch.
Nice.
My dad taught me about scotch.
I'll tell you a secret.
I taught your dad about scotch.
I don't really like secrets.
They always seem to hurt the person that they're trying to protect.
You don't think there are some things that people just shouldn't know?
No.
No.
It's like magic, and I hate magic.
I mean, why would I want to be tricked into believing something that isn't true?
I hate magic, too.
So, um...
You taught my dad about scotch.
What else did you teach him?
How to lose the evidence?
Before I give you this,
I want you to know Teddy was a good man.
Are you saying he didn't lose the evidence?
Your father had to have a good reason for what he did.
But I can't ask him about that, can I?
Then, maybe, that's the way he wanted it.
The Teddy I knew, back in the day, the scrappy guy that would do what it took to get out of the neighborhood.
What does it matter who that guy was?
It matters to me.
If I don't know who my dad is, then how the hell do I know who I am, David?
There are some things about people's pasts that aren't worth knowing.
I'm kind of the opposite.
I like to know everything.
I've got to start prepping for lunch.
Thank you for the drink.

Ah, doesn't ring a bell.
Well, they broke up about, uh, 15 years ago, and I'm mediating... or I'm trying to mediate an agreement to license the song for a car commercial, but two of the band members...
they won't sign off on a deal.
Listen, Kate, I said a lot of things the other night.
- We both said a lot of things.

Okay, well, why don't we call him and have him pay for this?
Oh, I tried.
His phone is disconnected.
I went down to see him at his store, it's a yogurt shop now.

Ohh!
Yes, nothing says Monday like a fresh bottle of Tequila.
Leo...
You are gonna make a very popular boss.
Wasn't me, actually.
"Kate, because you are a connoisseur,
"David Smith."
I shared my knowledge.
I thought you went to talk to him about whether your father lost evidence in his trial.
I did, and we had some drinks to break the ice.
- How'd it go?
- We broke it heavily.
- And he told me nothing.
- Mm.
I've got to go to that bar.
He's hiding something.
I just need to figure out what it is.
Who?
Nobody.
Good morning, Lauren.
What can I do for you?
Well, you've been stalling me with this music-publishing mediation, Kate.
I have not been stalling you.
Perhaps I just overstated a touch when, uh, I said that I was rounding third base.
How much did you overstate?
The "rounding third base" part.
It's more of like a, mm, first base kind of situation.
Clients like B.M.E. keep the lights on.
No lights equals no office.
No office equals no job.
Does that cold tone of voice of yours... does that come naturally, or is that something that you practice?
I practice, every time I talk to you.
You've got 48 hours to get this done,
- or I'm gonna have to step in.
- I'll take care of it.
God, how am I gonna take care of it?

Go to the conference room.
So if they won't talk to us, what do we do?
Paul, there's not much that we can do.
I mean, we've been pressing their lawyer, and he has said repeatedly that Mac and Sherry are not interested in a licensing agreement, period.
I guess that'll probably be a no on the reunion tour too.
Yeah, what's their deal anyway?
Are they allergic to money?
Well, maybe they just don't like me.
Really?
You seem like a decent enough kind of guy.
Well, they remember the rock star prick I used to be.
Let's just say a few, uh, TVs lost their lives in a flight off hotel balconies.
Mm.
Well, look, no one is the same person that they were 15 years ago, but TV-catapulting aside,
I mean, I just don't understand why they won't engage in an arm's-length business deal with you.
Well...
Paul...
Come on.
This is confidential.
And I can't help you if you don't lay your cards out on the table.
I'm dying.
Blood cancer...
I've got three months to live.
Chased all the wrong things in my life, Kate, but I did have one hit song.
Hey...
I'm not worried about dying.
I'm worried about dying with regret.
I want to get the song out there again.
B.M.E.'s only giving us 48 hours to get this resolved.
If you can just try one more time.
Okay, um...
I'll go around their lawyer.
I will talk to Mac and Sherry in person.
- Mm-hmm.
- And, uh...
Once I tell them that you're sick, I mean...
- No...
No.
- But they'll understand.
No, I don't want them to know.
You're gonna tell them anyway, right?
No.
No, I can't.
I-I mean, unless they agree to participate in the mediation process, or you allow me to tell them.
Uh-huh.
I don't want them to think that I'm using my illness to force them into something, you know?
Okay, then that's that.
But I am gonna see them.
Well, that's great.
Thank you.
I'll be back by 4:00.
Um, the gamers' mediation's at 3:00.
That's what I said... 3:00.
Uh, Kate, this could be a tricky one.
Online role-playing games are a multibillion-dollar industry.
Have you read the emails that I sent?
All 800 of them?
Nope.
Don't underestimate the complexity of the online-gaming world.
Oh, Leo, I read the file.
- Read or skimmed?
- Um, somewhere in between.
Okay, let's review.
The two pasty-faced people coming to our boardroom this afternoon lead the armies of 10,000 gamers that pay $20 a month to our client to fight virtual battles on virtual battlefields.
Which is 200 grand a month, not including the cost of original software.
Are you really quizzing me?
I just want to make sure you're taking this seriously.
Yes, I will mediate their dispute,
"The Battle of Xerxerus", two "x"s... will go on as planned, and our client will not lose 200 grand a month.
So you're saying you read the file.
I told you, I "skread" it.
Mm, "skimmed" plus "read"... cute.
I'm not gonna embarrass you in front of the geek squad.
♪ promise ♪
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm Kate Reed.
I'm the mediator from your publishing firm, B.M.E.
I'm sorry.
We've been very clear.
We want nothing to do with the song licensing.
Okay, um, you have been clear, super clear.
Now let me be super clear.
Hi.
I'm Kate Reed, and all I want is five minutes of your time, but if you'd rather not talk to me,
I'm sure that Paul Shelton will be more than happy to come down and talk to you himself.
- Okay, come on in.
- Thank you.
You sign your name.
The advertising agency hands you a large check.
Maybe it's, like, one of those comically large ones that you get when you win the lottery.
Money's not everything.
No, but this is a lot of money.
Well, whatever it is, it's not enough for us to want to deal with Paul Shelton.
What did this guy do to you?
Just tell me, and I promise you, if I can't convince you that whatever it is doesn't matter anymore,
I'm gonna walk out that door.
It's hard to explain how addictive it is to be in a rock band, even at the level that we were at... just the one hit song.
Mac and I, we handled it badly.
Paul handled it worse.
It came to a head in '96 at the Vogue Theater.
Yeah yeah had reached number nine on the Billboard charts.
Paul was out of control...
Get off the phone, man!
Come on!
Trashing hotel rooms, tearing apart dressing rooms.
Hey.
When he attacked that roadie during sound check, that was the last straw.
Paul!
Who knows why he went after the guy, but by the time I got to him and pulled him off, he started swinging at me.
He left the theater, missed that night's show.
We never saw him again.
And you two were able to just walk away?
We're public-school teachers now.
That life is far, far in the past.
Hey, Brandon, can you turn it down a little?
Wow.
Sounds like a chip off the old block.
He's a lot better than I ever was.
When I found out I was pregnant,
Mac and I knew life on the road wasn't for us.
And no one's asking you to go back on the road, Sherry.
No, but if the song gets some exposure, people will pay attention again.
Somebody will do a "where are they now" piece on the band, and Paul will feed off of that stuff.
But our son deserves the nice, quiet life we've carved out for him.
Yes, and that's something that you can control.
If you want to be brutally honest, we just don't want Paul back in our lives.
Okay, I understand why you wouldn't want that Paul back in your lives, but I'm telling you, the guy that I met, he's not that guy.
Now, are you really willing to walk away from a big payday just because of some bad memories?
Excuse me.
Hey, uh, I'm Mac and Sherry's son, Brandon.
- Right, the guitar.
- Yeah.
Oh, I'm Kate.
You sounded really good.
Thanks.
Was there something that you wanted to tell me?
Just tell Paul Shelton to stay away from me and my parents.
- You heard us talking?
- Yeah.
That guy's a major prick.
Yeah, and then some.
He told me everything.
- He needs to stay away.
- Yeah, I got that.
He ruined their lives, okay?
And he's gonna do it again.
Brandon, what's going on?
Are you afraid that Paul's trying to get the band together?
Because your dad has... just keep him away from us, okay?
Today's feeling like a ham and swiss day, Benny.
Oh, sorry.
I'm out of ham and swiss.
Oh.
- Hey, Kim.
- Hey.
You're not Benny.
Where's Benny?
Did the jets have something to do with it?
Uh, Benny's on vacation, so I'm...
I'm picking up his shifts.
I'll be here every day this week.
Oh, my God.
That's so rough on me.
Did you want some turkey and cheddar?
I could never do that to ham and swiss.
- They'd hate me forever.
- I'll bring one tomorrow.
Uh, tomorrow's my peanut butter day.
So it's like I make it at home.
I'm home alone, which I usually am, so don't worry about tomorrow.
Right.
Okay.
I got to go.
Um, I'll walk with you.
Ah!
You know, because, uh, uh, cramps are an occupational hazard.
So you can be honest.
I mean, uh...
Uh, coming for more shifts, is it really an excuse to...
I needed to make some extra money.
That is what I mean...
money.
Money's a very good thing to have, if you're not a hermit.
Seeing you is a bonus.
Sorry.
I got a leg cramp right there.
I had to, uh, speed-walk it out.
Right.
Well, I should probably...
Move those sandwiches...
yes, yes.
Don't let me, uh, keep you from that.
Sorry I didn't have what you wanted.
Don't apologize to me.
Apologize to, uh, ham and swiss.
Oh, so sensitive.
You'd think they'd be neutral, because of the whole swiss thing, but, no.
Okay.
Ah, Leonardo.
Yeah, that was about as smooth as an alligator's butt.
Nothing's changed.
Looks exactly the same.
Should I try my key?
You still have your key?
Yeah.
You still have yours?
Well, I forgot to throw it out.
You think they changed the locks?
I don't know.
Oh, my God.
What did they do to our condo?
It's not our condo anymore.
I'm gonna check the pipes.
What were they going for here, like, brothel chic?
Yep!
Galvanized steel.
- What a jerk!
- What, me jerk?
No... plumber jerk.
No, really, Justin...
You can take on a drug cartel but then a guy in a tool belt...
he can get the best of you?
- Are you kidding me?
- Why is it suddenly my responsibility to do an extensive background check on a plumber?
- He said he was gonna put in...
- Hello!
- Hello.
- Hi.
- You must be Justin Patrick
- Kate Reid...
I kept my name.
- Oh, good for you.
- Yes.
Uh, and you are?
Margo Reston.
I represent the sellers.
Should we, uh, have a look at the pipes?
We already did.
It's steel.
Our plumber screwed us.
Look, we closed escrow, like, a year ago.
How come it took them so long to call us?
They just noticed.
You know, the neighborhood's had a big uptick, so they decided to take their profits and move to the Peninsula.
So, uh, they make a profit, and then they sue us for the pipes... excellent.
You know, I told you we shouldn't have sold to lawyers.
Oh, my God.
Enough with the lawyer digs.
New copper pipes are $2,000.
Someone is going to need to write a check.
You can mail it to me.
- She seemed like...
- Don't.
There's nothing to be nervous about.
Just show them that you're a new man.
Hey, Mac.
Long time.
Mac, thank you for coming.
Is Sherry joining us?
Uh, Brandon had a soccer game.
Oh.
All right, well, why don't you just have a seat and...
Oh, I'm good standing.
Great.
I'm...
I'm good, good to stand.
Paul, uh, why don't you start?
I really appreciate that you came, Mac.
I, uh...
I know there's been a lot of rough water between us and, uh, maybe we could just, you know, leave it behind us, move forward.
That's him as a changed man?
- What do you want me to say?
- How about "I'm sorry"?
Of course I'm sorry.
There you go, an apology...
that's a good first step.
I screwed up.
I drove you and...
and Sherry and Brandon,
I drove you all from my life.
I knew it.
That's what this is about.
What do you mean?
Tell her.
Yeah, tell me.
It's about, uh...
It's about the fans.
It's about us.
It's about everything.
You haven't got the guts to admit you made a huge mistake.
You want him back in your life.
Well, you know what?
It's too late.
Okay, somebody please tell me what's going on here.
Stay the hell away from us.
What is he talking about?
Brandon...
He's my son.
He's right, isn't he?
This isn't about the song.
You're just trying to get the money to get close to Brandon.
I'm using the only leverage I have.
Paul, B.M.E. retained this Firm to mediate a half-million-dollar case involving three songwriters and whether or not they use your song, that's just completely irrelevant to you.
All I have is Mac and Sherry and Brandon.
You should have told me the truth, Paul.
I told you I was a prick.
Okay, just hold on a second.
How did we get here?
Well, we'd been a band since we were 16.
Mac and Sherry were together right from the start.
And then in, uh, '96, they broke up.
Now, I'd always had a thing for Sherry.
She was the most amazing woman I'd ever met.
So I just went for it.
And for a few weeks, it was beautiful.
But when I saw them that day, kissing at the vogue, I knew it was over.
She picked him.
I had to lash out at somebody.
I was probably high.
I don't really remember.
Mac pulled me off, told me to get lost.
And Brandon?
I found out later that Sherry was pregnant and that the baby was mine.
But by that time, I was long gone.
Excuse me.
Kate, I need just a minute.
- I'm almost done here.
- Yeah.
Paul, I'm sorry that you're sick, but I can't work with clients who don't tell me the truth.
I understand.
I do.
From now on, we're gonna play by my rules, and that means that we tell everybody the truth.
So we're gonna tell Mac and Sherry that you're dying and that you want to see your son.
Okay.
What?
I'm rounding second.
Last week you were rounding third.
Do you know how baseball works?
You didn't call me in here to correct my metaphors.
B.M.E. Says the ad agency is sensing an impasse.
This may be over by the end of the day.
But you gave me 48 hours.
Apparently, they weren't mine to give.
The gamers are here.
Coming.
Hey, did you know that in the 1870s,
David Smith's bar was a surveyor's weigh station?
What?
Prospectors would bring their findings, get them weighed, and then get paid.
How is this helpful to my mediation?
It's not.
I just thought it was cool.
You're a very special man, Leonardo.
Where are the gamers?
May I introduce phoenixxx16.
I am the greatest warrior of them all.
Kneel before me.
And in this corner...
Darkenova45.
I will eviscerate all who walk in my path.
Good luck with that.
Ah, who's this?
This is you.
Hi, I'm Kate.
Hi, I'm Kate.
- I'm an elf?
- Actually, you're a druid.
A druid's sort of a half-elf.
And they're very powerful...
large spell books.
Leonardo, I work with real people.
I don't mediate cartoons.
Avatars.
Get me live human...
Leonardo, I work with real people.
I don't mediate cartoons.
Are you finished?
Get me live human beings in this conference room.
You're just mad because I made you a druid, okay?
The boils are a sign of beauty.
People...
I work with people.
You can't even command a druid.
Me?
The druid scoffed at you.
- Uh...
- the only scoffing was at your idiocy.
- Hey!
- Pig!
- Moron!
- Guys?
Mac, what are you doing here?
I took a walk to blow off some steam.
Come into my office, will you, please?
We've decided to give Paul the rights to the song, free and clear.
That's not what he wants.
Isn't that the case you were hired for?
Does Brandon know that Paul's his father?
Of course.
After Brandon was born, we tried to bring Paul into his life, but he was too busy... always on the road.
We raised our son.
We just want to be left alone to finish our job as parents.
Paul can have the song.
What's the catch?
He signs over all parental rights and a legal guarantee that he never tries to contact Brandon again.
Mac, people make mistakes.
That doesn't mean that they should have to live with them forever.
Ms. Reed, I've known Paul a long time.
All he's ever wanted is to be famous.
He'll take this deal, and it won't take him too long to figure it out.
♪ it's your hometown ♪
♪ it's your hometown ♪
♪ it's your hometown ♪
♪ your hometown ♪
♪ ooh whoa whoa ♪
- Thank you.
- Whoo, whoo, whoo!
I'm gonna take a short break.
Oh.
You still got it.
Well, playing for 12 people isn't like playing for 20,000, but, uh, there aren't a lot of jobs where people applaud when you're finished.
Was that an Ultravinyl song?
No, I don't play those, uh, anymore.
Doesn't seem right.
Mm.
Well, I like your new sound.
Thanks.
Been writing again.
I hadn't written a song in ten years.
Now I got them pouring out of me.
Hey, Paul...
Uh-oh.
I talked to Mac and Sherry.
They've agreed to give you the copyright to yeah yeah, but in exchange, they want you to sign a legal statement saying that you are never going to contact them or try to see Brandon ever again.
It's not your fault.
Um, you did the best you could, considering I lied to you about... about what I really wanted.
So that's it?
You've been absent from Brandon's life for 15 years, and now you're gonna just roll over?
Paul, I mean, how are we gonna show them that you've changed, that you still care?
Um...
Well, then I reject their offer.
Good.
I want to give my rights to the song to Brandon.
- Okay.
- Uh...
Mac and Sherry can use the money for... for his college tuition.
That's great.
And then what about seeing Brandon?
He's got good parents.
They're doing what they think is best for him.
Draw up the contract, so I can do what's best for him too.
Sure.
Brandon?
Hi.
My parents told me he was playing here.
Yeah.
Are you gonna go inside?
I was thinking about it.
Okay.
Yeah, you know, uh, your dad told me about Paul and who he is to you, Brandon... what kind of person forgets his own son, forgets he even exists?
- I don't know.
- Yeah.
Me neither.
But maybe you should go inside and ask.
What's he gonna say?
"Sorry I missed the first 16 years of your life"?
Brandon, it took him a long time to realize what's important.
But I think he knows it now.
Why now?
Oh, just let your parents fill in the blanks.
Yeah, that's what Paul is to me... a blank.
Maybe it's better that way.
No, nothing's better that way.
Brandon.
- I've got the short-form agreement for the Ultravinyl mediation.
Um, okay, great.
So then I'll just call you after my meeting.
What meeting?
There's nothing on your calendar.
Sometimes there are things that you just you don't know about, Leo.
Uh, no, there's not, ever.
If it's in your calendar, I put it there.
Well, you forgot about this one.
Well, I'm...
I'm sorry.
I, uh...
Don't worry about it.
People make mistakes.
Dave, tell him the one about the lawnmower.
What, and ruin his image of me as a man who's good with his hands?
Hey, David.
Hi, Kate.
Can I talk to you?
Well, I'm a little busy right now.
It'll only take a second.
Kate, I've got a bar full of customers.
Maybe some other time, okay?
If you don't come in and get that ointment...
That herpes will never clear up.
Have a good day.
Gentlemen.
I don't have it.
Ham and swiss.
Hey, you're back.
I didn't want ham and swiss to get the wrong impression of me.
It's a little late for lunch.
Midnight snack?
It's on me.
Thanks.
Yeah, I'll...
I'll probably be here late, because I'm about to rip into an epic game of, uh, World of Warcraft.
I just had a marathon session last night.
Really?
I took down a 50th-level warlock.
- You know, I-I'm actually working on a big online-gaming mediation right now...
I mean, uh, Kate and I are.
Right.
So I should probably get going.
See you tomorrow.
I'm happy Benny's on vacation.
Me too.
I wish Benny could be on vacation forever.
That wouldn't be a vacation...
- Technically.
- That's true.
And I would have to leave, since it's his business.
Another detail that I overlooked.
So...
Good-bye, Leonardo.
Bye, Kim.
Don't get lonely in the elevator.
I won't.
Can you hold that, please?
If she goes to the lobby, meets someone and falls in love instantly, flies to Las Vegas and gets married,
I gonna be so upset.
It's happened to me before.
I brought you a veggie patty with an extra side of veggie.
Thanks.
Look, Kate, about the plumber...
Oh, yes, you know what?
I brought my checkbook.
No, no, no, no, I'm gonna pay for this.
I'm not mad at you anymore.
Mad?
Why would you be mad?
You're the one who hired the plumber... what, without references?
Is that what you were gonna say?
No, no.
It doesn't matter.
Okay, if you recall, during that remodel,
I was in court with the tax evasion case.
Yes, and I was away on the Sumter case.
It was always something, wasn't it?
Always?
Let's just stick to the pipes, okay?
Yep.
That's a great idea.
It's the only way she'll meet with you.
She wants to meet in person.
- No way.
- That's crazy.
I know, I know, I know.
But trust me, she's the best there is.
If anyone can get this feud resolved, it's her.
I spent 18 hours designing this avatar... the armor, the weaponry.
- How will I defend myself?
- Against what?
It's not like the real Darkenova is gonna be riding up in here on a metal horse with a javelin.
I could bring a real javelin.
- No, you can't.
- Crossbow?
- No.
- Catapult?
You have those things in real life?
I'm bringing my scimitar.
No.
No.
No weapons, just yourselves.
And wear some decent clothes.
Bathrobes do not count...
common mistake among gamers.
There's been a slight change of plans.
Didn't I say something like this would happen?
We gave him the rights to the song.
Yes, and instead of you giving Paul your share of the rights, he would like to give Brandon his share.
- W-what's in it for Paul?
Well, he wanted to reconnect with you, but you've said that that's not possible, and he wants Brandon to have money for college or whatever else you think is best.
And I have the contract right here.
Don't sign it.
There are other things going on.
Meaning Brandon.
No.
Then what?
I can't tell you.
Paul's my client, and, unfortunately, I can't talk about it.
Just give me the contract so I can sign something and get him out of our lives.
Mediations are confidential.
Did you know that?
But because you refused to enter into mediation with Paul, you are outside of that circle of confidentiality.
So how about you come inside the circle just for a little bit?
So enter a mediation to end a mediation?
Exactly, yes.
And I have the engagement letter for the mediation right here.
Please sign it.
Okay.
He's dying.
What?
He has less than three months to live.
You said the artist agreements were signed.
All signed...
- So I called B.M.E.
- Oh, awesome.
So what...
what is the problem?
There's a paternity issue embedded in Paul's side of the deal that I would like to extricate.
- No.
- Oh, come on, Lauren.
Momentum's on my side right now.
I just really want to make everybody happy.
It's irrelevant to our transaction.
Paul's dying.
He's never spent any time with his son.
It's relevant to him.
Well, t-that's tragic.
The only reason he got this ball rolling to begin with was to fix all this before he dies.
So, technically, if he did not want to see his son, there would be no fee from the successfully mediated licensing deal... big fee, big big.
Just stall B.M.E. Just for a little while.
- How long?
- The rest of the day?
That's not gonna happen.
Give me an hour.
Ah.
And just what exactly do I tell the men from B.M.E.?
I believe in the force of your charming personality.
An hour.
Hi.
They're here.
Hey, Sher.
Hey, Paul.
Why don't we all have a seat, make ourselves comfortable?
Okay, it's now or never.
There's one huge advantage to having three months to live.
It gives you instant clarity.
I screwed up my life.
I don't want to screw up the next three months.
The three of us...
we really had something.
And I'm not talking about the music.
I'm talking about us.
You two were the only people who really knew me and cared about me.
And when I broke up the band,
I had...
I had no idea of the damage it would cause.
I was already leaving for my own sake, for the sake of our son.
I'm really, really sorry about you getting sick.
We don't always get an encore.
You know, Paul, for a few years, because of you, we had a lot of fun.
- It was a blast, wasn't it?
- Yeah.
That's true.
Oh, excuse me.
Done.
Or, uh, undone, I guess.
So we're good.
Yeah.
The revised contracts are on the table, and they're ready to go.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
You too.
You're not gonna hug me, are you?
- Never even dawned on me.
- Okay, good.
Yeah.
This is something I thought I'd never see.
I told you he's changed.
You just had to see it to believe it.
You know, his sound has changed too... he's amazing.
He's playing later at Buzz Coffee, and you should check it out.
You never give up, do you?
I wish I knew how.
Brandon!
Is he in there?
Brandon, why don't you just go in and meet him?
No.
Then go in and punch him.
No.
- Kick him.
- No.
- Scream at him!
Do something!
- No!
No!
Come on, punch me!
Do something!
Do something!
No!
Do something.
You keep showing up, but you're not doing anything, Brandon.
You're... you're... you're angry.
You're sad.
You're both.
You need to express these feelings.
He's dying.
I can't make you go in there.
I just...
I can't.
Okay, um, remember the coffee shop where you came to visit?
This is his last performance.
Why don't you just come through the back...
And just watch?
Okay?
They're here.
For real this time.
You're nervous.
Just a little bit.
They're just people.
They command large armies.
Virtual armies.
Paying real money.
Point taken.
Thank you both for stepping out from behind your avatars.
In a mediation, it's, uh... it's very important for both sides to not only be physically present, uh...
Nobody likes to be called that.
Okay, so then let's start.
Billy, why don't you go first?
Oh, it's okay.
You don't need to...
- What?
- Go right ahead.
You buy weapons from other people who have earned them.
That's not fair.
That's it?
Okay.
B-be seated.
Donna?
You don't...
you don't need to... it's not fair at you organize outlawed individuals into groups.
Excuse me.
Leonardo?
- It's going great.
- Really?
Yeah, you're really getting through to them.
But that doesn't mean anything if they're not communicating.
They're comfortable in an environment where you wouldn't be... a place where millions of people use a de facto form of communication that crosses borders and transcends cultural differences.
I-I-I'm serious.
- It's a multibillion-dollar...
- yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it.
Let me try again.
Phoenixxx16, Darkenova45, please rise.
I'm disappointed in you two.
You should be leading thousands of your minions to victory, but instead, you're both sitting here like lily-livered miscreants.
Where's your dignity, Phoenixxx16?
I have dignity.
I have volumes of dignity.
Then show some.
Fight.
And you, Darkenova45, have some pride.
I am proud.
Okay, then it's decided.
Let's hear a call to arms.
Tonight, we will dine together in hell.
Tell your legions that the Battle of Xerxerus will begin at 20:10 sharp!
Into the fire!
Into the fire!
Sometimes you scare me.
No.
No, no.
This is a nice surprise.
I never got to hear the rest of the song.
How did you get her to show up?
I gave her a flyer.
Mac's parking the car.
I'm so glad you came.
Good evening, everyone.
It's a big night for me.
And, um, I'm gonna play a...
I'm gonna play a song that...
That I haven't played in a long time.

- Hi.
- Hi.
I sent the money to the real-estate agent, and I ripped up your check.
I never should have hired that crackpot plumber in the first place.
I should've taken responsibility for stuff around the condo.
Yeah...
Maybe.
I didn't...
Always choose work over home.
Well, sometimes it felt like it.
You know, sometimes when we fight, it turns me on.
Always?
Yeah, always.
Now's not a good time.
Oh, why not?
I'm getting ready for the lunch crowd.
If you don't talk to me, I'm gonna come in here every day and say embarrassing things in front of your friends.
Um, Tequila?
Nope, not again.
How about a scotch?
Yeah.
One scotch.
- How do you take it?
- Neat.
Atta girl.
18-year-old Macallan.
She knows her scotch.
Nice.
My dad taught me about scotch.
I'll tell you a secret.
I taught your dad about scotch.
I don't really like secrets.
They always seem to hurt the person that they're trying to protect.
You don't think there are some things that people just shouldn't know?
No.
No.
It's like magic, and I hate magic.
I mean, why would I want to be tricked into believing something that isn't true?
I hate magic too.
So, um...
You taught my dad about scotch.
What else did you teach him?
How to lose the evidence?
Before I give you this,
I want you to know Teddy was a good man.
Are you saying he didn't lose the evidence?
Your father had to have a good reason for what he did.
But I can't ask him about that, can I?
Maybe that's the way he wanted it.
The Teddy I knew back in the day, the scrappy guy that would do what it took to get out of the neighborhood, what does it matter who that guy was?
It matters to me.
If I don know who my dad is, then how the hell do I know who I am, David?
There are some things about people's pasts that aren't worth knowing.
I'm kind of the opposite.
I like to know everything.
I got to start prepping for lunch.
Thank you for the drink.

That's a vaguely familiar song, yet still unappealing.
It's yeah yeah by Ultravinyl.
Ah, doesn't ring a bell.
Well, they broke up about, uh, 15 years ago, and I'm mediating... or I'm trying to mediate an agreement to license the song for a car commercial, but two of the band members...
they won't sign off on a deal.
Listen, Kate, I said a lot of things the other night.
- We both said a lot of things.
- I know.
I just don't know how we're gonna move on from here good on you for washing her down.
Too many sand crabs have boats, but aren't willing to put in the time.

Kate Reed, you've been served.
We're being sued by the people who bought our condo.
What for?
Remember that guy we hired to put copper plumbing in our bathrooms?
Turns out, he didn't put in copper plumbing.
Okay, well, why don't we call him and have him pay for this?
Oh, I tried.
His phone is disconnected.
I went down to see him at his store, it's a yogurt shop now.
So we're on the hook.

Ohh!
Yes, nothing says Monday like a fresh bottle of Tequila.
Leo...
You are gonna make a very popular boss.
Wasn't me, actually.
"Kate, because you are a connoisseur,
"David Smith."
I shared my knowledge.
I thought you went to talk to him about whether your father lost evidence in his trial.
I did, and we had some drinks to break the ice.
- How'd it go?
- We broke it heavily.
- And he told me nothing.
- Mm.
I've got to go to that bar.
He's hiding something.
I just need to figure out what it is.
Who?
Nobody.
Good morning, Lauren.
What can I do for you?
Well, you've been stalling me with this music-publishing mediation, Kate.
I have not been stalling you.
Perhaps I just overstated a touch when, uh, I said that I was rounding third base.
How much did you overstate?
The "rounding third base" part.
It's more of like a, mm, first base kind of situation.
Clients like B.M.E. keep the lights on.
No lights equals no office.
No office equals no job.
Does that cold tone of voice of yours... does that come naturally, or is that something that you practice?
I practice, every time I talk to you.
[Chuckles]
You've got 48 hours to get this done,
- or I'm gonna have to step in.
- I'll take care of it.
God, how am I gonna take care of it?
Those band members...
they won't even talk to me.
Maybe they can only communicate through the power of song.
♪ oh, yeah yeah ♪
♪ oh, yeah yeah ♪
♪ oh, yeah yeah ♪ please stop doing that.
Go to the conference room.
So if they won't talk to us, what do we do?
Paul, there's not much that we can do.
I mean, we've been pressing their lawyer, and he has said repeatedly that Mac and Sherry are not interested in a licensing agreement, period.
I guess that'll probably be a no on the reunion tour too.
Yeah, what's their deal anyway?
Are they allergic to money?
[Chuckles] Well, maybe they just don't like me.
Really?
You seem like a decent enough kind of guy.
[Chuckles]
Well, they remember the rock star prick I used to be.
Let's just say a few, uh, TVs lost their lives in a flight off hotel balconies.
Mm.
Well, look, no one is the same person that they were 15 years ago, but TV-catapulting aside,
I mean, I just don't understand why they won't engage in an arm's-length business deal with you.
Well...
Paul...
Come on.
This is confidential.
And I can't help you if you don't lay your cards out on the table.
I'm dying.
Blood cancer...
I've got three months to live.
Chased all the wrong things in my life, Kate, but I did have one hit song.
Hey...
I'm not worried about dying.
I'm worried about dying with regret.
I want to get the song out there again.
B.M.E.'s only giving us 48 hours to get this resolved.
If you can just try one more time.
Okay, um...
I'll go around their lawyer.
I will talk to Mac and Sherry in person.
- Mm-hmm.
- And, uh...
Once I tell them that you're sick, I mean...
- No...
No.
- But they'll understand.
No, I don't want them to know.
You're gonna tell them anyway, right?
No.
No, I can't.
I-I mean, unless they agree to participate in the mediation process, or you allow me to tell them.
Uh-huh.
I don't want them to think that I'm using my illness to force them into something, you know?
Okay, then that's that.
But I am gonna see them.
Well, that's great.
Thank you.
I'll be back by 4:00.
Um, the gamers' mediation's at 3:00.
That's what I said... 3:00.
Uh, Kate, this could be a tricky one.
Online role-playing games are a multibillion-dollar industry.
Have you read the emails that I sent?
All 800 of them?
Nope.
Don't underestimate the complexity of the online-gaming world.
Oh, Leo, I read the file.
- Read or skimmed?
- Um, somewhere in between.
Okay, let's review.
The two pasty-faced people coming to our boardroom this afternoon lead the armies of 10,000 gamers that pay $20 a month to our client to fight virtual battles on virtual battlefields.
Which is 200 grand a month, not including the cost of original software.
Are you really quizzing me?
I just want to make sure you're taking this seriously.
Yes, I will mediate their dispute,
"The Battle of Xerxerus", two "x"s... will go on as planned, and our client will not lose 200 grand a month.
So you're saying you read the file.
I told you, I "skread" it.
Mm, "skimmed" plus "read"... cute.
I'm not gonna embarrass you in front of the geek squad.
♪ promise ♪
[humming yeah yeah]
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm Kate Reed.
I'm the mediator from your publishing firm, B.M.E.
I'm sorry.
We've been very clear.
We want nothing to do with the song licensing.
Okay, um, you have been clear, super clear.
Now let me be super clear.
Hi.
I'm Kate Reed, and all I want is five minutes of your time, but if you'd rather not talk to me,
I'm sure that Paul Shelton will be more than happy to come down and talk to you himself.
- Okay, come on in.
- Thank you.
You sign your name.
The advertising agency hands you a large check.
Maybe it's, like, one of those comically large ones that you get when you win the lottery.
Money's not everything.
No, but this is a lot of money.
Well, whatever it is, it's not enough for us to want to deal with Paul Shelton.
What did this guy do to you?
Just tell me, and I promise you, if I can't convince you that whatever it is doesn't matter anymore,
I'm gonna walk out that door.
It's hard to explain how addictive it is to be in a rock band, even at the level that we were at... just the one hit song.
Mac and I, we handled it badly.
Paul handled it worse.
It came to a head in '96 at the Vogue Theater.
Yeah yeah had reached number nine on the Billboard charts.
Paul was out of control...
Get off the phone, man!
Come on!
Trashing hotel rooms, tearing apart dressing rooms.
Hey.
[Slurring words]
When he attacked that roadie during sound check, that was the last straw.
- [Shouting]
- Paul!
Who knows why he went after the guy, but by the time I got to him and pulled him off, he started swinging at me.
He left the theater, missed that night's show.
We never saw him again.
And you two were able to just walk away?
We're public-school teachers now.
That life is far, far in the past.
[Electric guitar playing]
Hey, Brandon, can you turn it down a little?
Wow.
Sounds like a chip off the old block.
He's a lot better than I ever was.
When I found out I was pregnant,
Mac and I knew life on the road wasn't for us.
And no one's asking you to go back on the road, Sherry.
No, but if the song gets some exposure, people will pay attention again.
Somebody will do a "where are they now" piece on the band, and Paul will feed off of that stuff.
But our son deserves the nice, quiet life we've carved out for him.
Yes, and that's something that you can control.
If you want to be brutally honest, we just don't want Paul back in our lives.
Okay, I understand why you wouldn't want that Paul back in your lives, but I'm telling you, the guy that I met, he's not that guy.
Now, are you really willing to walk away from a big payday just because of some bad memories?
Excuse me.
Hey, uh, I'm Mac and Sherry's son, Brandon.
- Right, the guitar.
- Yeah.
Oh, I'm Kate.
You sounded really good.
Thanks.
Was there something that you wanted to tell me?
Just tell Paul Shelton to stay away from me and my parents.
- You heard us talking?
- Yeah.
That guy's a major prick.
[Laughs] Yeah, and then some.
He told me everything.
- He needs to stay away.
- Yeah, I got that.
He ruined their lives, okay?
And he's gonna do it again.
Brandon, what's going on?
Are you afraid that Paul's trying to get the band together?
Because your dad has... just keep him away from us, okay?
Today's feeling like a ham and swiss day, Benny.
Oh, sorry.
I'm out of ham and swiss.
Oh.
- Hey, Kim.
- Hey.
You're not Benny.
Where's Benny?
Did the jets have something to do with it?
[Laughs] Uh, Benny's on vacation, so I'm...
I'm picking up his shifts.
I'll be here every day this week.
Oh, my God.
That's so rough on me.
Did you want some turkey and cheddar?
I could never do that to ham and swiss.
- They'd hate me forever.
- I'll bring one tomorrow.
Uh, tomorrow's my peanut butter day.
So it's like I make it at home.
I'm home alone, which I usually am, so don't worry about tomorrow.
Right.
Okay.
I got to go.
Um, I'll walk with you.
Ah!
You know, because, uh, uh, cramps are an occupational hazard.
So you can be honest.
I mean, uh...
Uh, coming for more shifts, is it really an excuse to...
I needed to make some extra money.
That is what I mean...
money.
Money's a very good thing to have, if you're not a hermit.
Seeing you is a bonus.
Sorry.
I got a leg cramp right there.
I had to, uh, speed-walk it out.
Right.
Well, I should probably...
Move those sandwiches...
yes, yes.
Don't let me, uh, keep you from that.
Sorry I didn't have what you wanted.
Don't apologize to me.
Apologize to, uh, ham and swiss.
Oh, so sensitive.
You'd think they'd be neutral, because of the whole swiss thing, but, no.
Okay.
Ah, Leonardo.
Yeah, that was about as smooth as an alligator's butt.
Nothing's changed.
Looks exactly the same.
Should I try my key?
You still have your key?
Yeah.
You still have yours?
Well, I forgot to throw it out.
You think they changed the locks?
I don't know.
Oh, my God.
What did they do to our condo?
It's not our condo anymore.
I'm gonna check the pipes.
What were they going for here, like, brothel chic?
Yep!
Galvanized steel.
- What a jerk!
- What, me jerk?
No... plumber jerk.
No, really, Justin...
You can take on a drug cartel but then a guy in a tool belt...
he can get the best of you?
- Are you kidding me?
- Why is it suddenly my responsibility to do an extensive background check on a plumber?
- He said he was gonna put in...
- Hello!
- Hello.
- Hi.
- You must be Justin Patrick
- Kate Reid...
I kept my name.
- Oh, good for you.
- Yes.
Uh, and you are?
Margo Reston.
I represent the sellers.
Should we, uh, have a look at the pipes?
We already did.
It's steel.
Our plumber screwed us.
Look, we closed escrow, like, a year ago.
How come it took them so long to call us?
They just noticed.
You know, the neighborhood's had a big uptick, so they decided to take their profits and move to the Peninsula.
So, uh, they make a profit, and then they sue us for the pipes... excellent.
You know, I told you we shouldn't have sold to lawyers.
Oh, my God.
Enough with the lawyer digs.
New copper pipes are $2,000.
Someone is going to need to write a check.
You can mail it to me.
- She seemed like...
- Don't.
There's nothing to be nervous about.
Just show them that you're a new man.
Hey, Mac.
Long time.
Mac, thank you for coming.
Is Sherry joining us?
Uh, Brandon had a soccer game.
Oh.
All right, well, why don't you just have a seat and...
Oh, I'm good standing.
Great.
I'm...
I'm good, good to stand.
Paul, uh, why don't you start?
I really appreciate that you came, Mac.
I, uh...
I know there's been a lot of rough water between us and, uh, maybe we could just, you know, leave it behind us, move forward.
That's him as a changed man?
- What do you want me to say?
- How about "I'm sorry"?
Of course I'm sorry.
There you go, an apology...
that's a good first step.
I screwed up.
I drove you and...
and Sherry and Brandon,
I drove you all from my life.
I knew it.
That's what this is about.
What do you mean?
Tell her.
Yeah, tell me.
It's about, uh...
It's about the fans.
It's about us.
It's about everything.
You haven't got the guts to admit you made a huge mistake.
You want him back in your life.
Well, you know what?
It's too late.
Okay, somebody please tell me what's going on here.
Stay the hell away from us.
What is he talking about?
Brandon...
He's my son.
He's right, isn't he?
This isn't about the song.
You're just trying to get the money to get close to Brandon.
I'm using the only leverage I have.
Paul, B.M.E. retained this Firm to mediate a half-million-dollar case involving three songwriters and whether or not they use your song, that's just completely irrelevant to you.
All I have is Mac and Sherry and Brandon.
You should have told me the truth, Paul.
I told you I was a prick.
Okay, just hold on a second.
How did we get here?
Well, we'd been a band since we were 16.
Mac and Sherry were together right from the start.
And then in, uh, '96, they broke up.
Now, I'd always had a thing for Sherry.
She was the most amazing woman I'd ever met.
So I just went for it.
And for a few weeks, it was beautiful.
But when I saw them that day, kissing at the vogue, I knew it was over.
She picked him.
I had to lash out at somebody.
I was probably high.
I don't really remember.
Mac pulled me off, told me to get lost.
And Brandon?
I found out later that Sherry was pregnant and that the baby was mine.
But by that time, I was long gone.
Excuse me.
Kate, I need just a minute.
- I'm almost done here.
- Yeah.
Paul, I'm sorry that you're sick, but I can't work with clients who don't tell me the truth.
I understand.
I do.
From now on, we're gonna play by my rules, and that means that we tell everybody the truth.
So we're gonna tell Mac and Sherry that you're dying and that you want to see your son.
Okay.
What?
I'm rounding second.
Last week you were rounding third.
Do you know how baseball works?
You didn't call me in here to correct my metaphors.
B.M.E. Says the ad agency is sensing an impasse.
This may be over by the end of the day.
But you gave me 48 hours.
Apparently, they weren't mine to give.
The gamers are here.
Coming.
Hey, did you know that in the 1870s,
David Smith's bar was a surveyor's weigh station?
What?
Prospectors would bring their findings, get them weighed, and then get paid.
How is this helpful to my mediation?
It's not.
I just thought it was cool.
You're a very special man, Leonardo.
Where are the gamers?
May I introduce phoenixxx16.
I am the greatest warrior of them all.
Kneel before me.
And in this corner...
Darkenova45.
I will eviscerate all who walk in my path.
Good luck with that.
Ah, who's this?
This is you.
Hi, I'm Kate.
Hi, I'm Kate.
- I'm an elf?
- Actually, you're a druid.
A druid's sort of a half-elf.
And they're very powerful...
large spell books.
Leonardo, I work with real people.
I don't mediate cartoons.
Avatars.
Get me live human...
Leonardo, I work with real people.
I don't mediate cartoons.
Are you finished?
Get me live human beings in this conference room.
You're just mad because I made you a druid, okay?
The boils are a sign of beauty.
People...
I work with people.
You can't even command a druid.
Me?
The druid scoffed at you.
- Uh...
- the only scoffing was at your idiocy.
- Hey!
- Pig!
- Moron!
- Guys?
Mac, what are you doing here?
I took a walk to blow off some steam.
Come into my office, will you, please?
We've decided to give Paul the rights to the song, free and clear.
That's not what he wants.
Isn't that the case you were hired for?
Does Brandon know that Paul's his father?
Of course.
After Brandon was born, we tried to bring Paul into his life, but he was too busy... always on the road.
We raised our son.
We just want to be left alone to finish our job as parents.
Paul can have the song.
What's the catch?
He signs over all parental rights and a legal guarantee that he never tries to contact Brandon again.
Mac, people make mistakes.
That doesn't mean that they should have to live with them forever.
Ms. Reed, I've known Paul a long time.
All he's ever wanted is to be famous.
He'll take this deal, and it won't take him too long to figure it out.

- Thank you.
- Whoo, whoo, whoo!
I'm gonna take a short break.
Oh.
You still got it.
Well, playing for 12 people isn't like playing for 20,000, but, uh, there aren't a lot of jobs where people applaud when you're finished.
[Chuckles] Was that an Ultravinyl song?
No, I don't play those, uh, anymore.
Doesn't seem right.
Mm.
Well, I like your new sound.
Thanks.
Been writing again.
I hadn't written a song in ten years.
Now I got them pouring out of me.
Hey, Paul...
Uh-oh.
I talked to Mac and Sherry.
They've agreed to give you the copyright to yeah yeah, but in exchange, they want you to sign a legal statement saying that you are never going to contact them or try to see Brandon ever again.
It's not your fault.
Um, you did the best you could, considering I lied to you about... about what I really wanted.
So that's it?
You've been absent from Brandon's life for 15 years, and now you're gonna just roll over?
Paul, I mean, how are we gonna show them that you've changed, that you still care?
Um...
Well, then I reject their offer.
Good.
I want to give my rights to the song to Brandon.
- Okay.
- Uh...
Mac and Sherry can use the money for... for his college tuition.
That's great.
And then what about seeing Brandon?
He's got good parents.
They're doing what they think is best for him.
Draw up the contract, so I can do what's best for him too.
Sure.
Brandon?
Hi.
My parents told me he was playing here.
Yeah.
Are you gonna go inside?
I was thinking about it.
Okay.
Yeah, you know, uh, your dad told me about Paul and who he is to you, Brandon... what kind of person forgets his own son, forgets he even exists?
- I don't know.
- Yeah.
Me neither.
But maybe you should go inside and ask.
What's he gonna say?
"Sorry I missed the first 16 years of your life"?
Brandon, it took him a long time to realize what's important.
But I think he knows it now.
Why now?
Oh, just let your parents fill in the blanks.
Yeah, that's what Paul is to me... a blank.
Maybe it's better that way.
No, nothing's better that way.
Brandon.
- I've got the short-form agreement for the Ultravinyl mediation.
Um, okay, great.
So then I'll just call you after my meeting.
What meeting?
There's nothing on your calendar.
Sometimes there are things that you just you don't know about, Leo.
Uh, no, there's not, ever.
If it's in your calendar, I put it there.
Well, you forgot about this one.
Well, I'm...
I'm sorry.
I, uh...
Don't worry about it.
People make mistakes.
Dave, tell him the one about the lawnmower.
What, and ruin his image of me as a man who's good with his hands?
[Laughter] Hey, David.
Hi, Kate.
Can I talk to you?
Well, I'm a little busy right now.
It'll only take a second.
Kate, I've got a bar full of customers.
Maybe some other time, okay?
If you don't come in and get that ointment...
That herpes will never clear up.
Have a good day.
Gentlemen.
[Men snickering]
I don't have it.
Ham and swiss.
Hey, you're back.
I didn't want ham and swiss to get the wrong impression of me.
It's a little late for lunch.
Midnight snack?
It's on me.
Thanks.
Yeah, I'll...
I'll probably be here late, because I'm about to rip into an epic game of, uh, World of Warcraft.
I just had a marathon session last night.
Really?
I took down a 50th-level warlock.
- You know, I-I'm actually working on a big online-gaming mediation right now...
I mean, uh, Kate and I are.
Right.
So I should probably get going.
See you tomorrow.
I'm happy Benny's on vacation.
Me too.
I wish Benny could be on vacation forever.
That wouldn't be a vacation...
- Technically.
- That's true.
And I would have to leave, since it's his business.
Another detail that I overlooked.
So...
Good-bye, Leonardo.
Bye, Kim.
Don't get lonely in the elevator.
I won't.
Can you hold that, please?
If she goes to the lobby, meets someone and falls in love instantly, flies to Las Vegas and gets married,
I gonna be so upset.
It's happened to me before.
I brought you a veggie patty with an extra side of veggie.
Thanks.
Look, Kate, about the plumber...
Oh, yes, you know what?
I brought my checkbook.
No, no, no, no, I'm gonna pay for this.
I'm not mad at you anymore.
Mad?
Why would you be mad?
You're the one who hired the plumber... what, without references?
Is that what you were gonna say?
No, no.
It doesn't matter.
Okay, if you recall, during that remodel,
I was in court with the tax evasion case.
Yes, and I was away on the Sumter case.
It was always something, wasn't it?
Always?
Let's just stick to the pipes, okay?
Yep.
That's a great idea.
It's the only way she'll meet with you.
She wants to meet in person.
- No way.
- That's crazy.
I know, I know, I know.
But trust me, she's the best there is.
If anyone can get this feud resolved, it's her.
I spent 18 hours designing this avatar... the armor, the weaponry.
- How will I defend myself?
- Against what?
It's not like the real Darkenova is gonna be riding up in here on a metal horse with a javelin.
I could bring a real javelin.
- No, you can't.
- Crossbow?
- No.
- Catapult?
You have those things in real life?
I'm bringing my scimitar.
No.
No.
No weapons, just yourselves.
And wear some decent clothes.
Bathrobes do not count...
common mistake among gamers.
[Computer beeps]
There's been a slight change of plans.
Didn't I say something like this would happen?
We gave him the rights to the song.
Yes, and instead of you giving Paul your share of the rights, he would like to give Brandon his share.
- W-what's in it for Paul?
Well, he wanted to reconnect with you, but you've said that that's not possible, and he wants Brandon to have money for college or whatever else you think is best.
And I have the contract right here.
Don't sign it.
There are other things going on.
Meaning Brandon.
No.
Then what?
I can't tell you.
Paul's my client, and, unfortunately, I can't talk about it.
Just give me the contract so I can sign something and get him out of our lives.
Mediations are confidential.
Did you know that?
But because you refused to enter into mediation with Paul, you are outside of that circle of confidentiality.
So how about you come inside the circle just for a little bit?
So enter a mediation to end a mediation?
Exactly, yes.
And I have the engagement letter for the mediation right here.
Please sign it.
Okay.
He's dying.
What?
He has less than three months to live.
You said the artist agreements were signed.
All signed...
- So I called B.M.E.
- Oh, awesome.
So what...
what is the problem?
There's a paternity issue embedded in Paul's side of the deal that I would like to extricate.
- No.
- Oh, come on, Lauren.
Momentum's on my side right now.
I just really want to make everybody happy.
It's irrelevant to our transaction.
Paul's dying.
He's never spent any time with his son.
It's relevant to him.
Well, t-that's tragic.
The only reason he got this ball rolling to begin with was to fix all this before he dies.
So, technically, if he did not want to see his son, there would be no fee from the successfully mediated licensing deal... big fee, big big.
Just stall B.M.E. Just for a little while.
- How long?
- The rest of the day?
[Elevator bell dings] That's not gonna happen.
Give me an hour.
Ah.
And just what exactly do I tell the men from B.M.E.?
I believe in the force of your charming personality.
An hour.
Hi.
They're here.
Hey, Sher.
Hey, Paul.
Why don't we all have a seat, make ourselves comfortable?
Okay, it's now or never.
There's one huge advantage to having three months to live.
It gives you instant clarity.
I screwed up my life.
I don't want to screw up the next three months.
The three of us...
we really had something.
And I'm not talking about the music.
I'm talking about us.
You two were the only people who really knew me and cared about me.
And when I broke up the band,
I had...
I had no idea of the damage it would cause.
I was already leaving for my own sake, for the sake of our son.
I'm really, really sorry about you getting sick.
We don't always get an encore.
You know, Paul, for a few years, because of you, we had a lot of fun.
- It was a blast, wasn't it?
- Yeah.
[Laughs] That's true.
[Knock at door]
Oh, excuse me.
Done.
Or, uh, undone, I guess.
So we're good.
Yeah.
The revised contracts are on the table, and they're ready to go.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
You too.
You're not gonna hug me, are you?
- Never even dawned on me.
- Okay, good.
Yeah.
[Indistinct chatter, Kate laughs]
This is something I thought I'd never see.
I told you he's changed.
You just had to see it to believe it.
You know, his sound has changed too... he's amazing.
He's playing later at Buzz Coffee, and you should check it out.
You never give up, do you?
I wish I knew how.
[Chuckles]
Brandon!
Is he in there?
Brandon, why don't you just go in and meet him?
No.
Then go in and punch him.
No.
- Kick him.
- No.
- Scream at him!
Do something!
- No!
No!
Come on, punch me!
Do something!
Do something!
No!
Do something.
You keep showing up, but you're not doing anything, Brandon.
You're... you're... you're angry.
You're sad.
You're both.
You need to express these feelings.
He's dying.
I can't make you go in there.
I just...
I can't.
Okay, um, remember the coffee shop where you came to visit?
This is his last performance.
[Sniffles]
Why don't you just come through the back...
And just watch?
Okay?
They're here.
For real this time.
You're nervous.
Just a little bit.
They're just people.
They command large armies.
Virtual armies.
Paying real money.
Point taken.
Thank you both for stepping out from behind your avatars.
In a mediation, it's, uh... it's very important for both sides to not only be physically present, uh...
Nobody likes to be called that.
Okay, so then let's start.
Billy, why don't you go first?
Oh, it's okay.
You don't need to...
- What?
- Go right ahead.
You buy weapons from other people who have earned them.
That's not fair.
That's it?
Okay.
B-be seated.
Donna?
You don't...
you don't need to... it's not fair at you organize outlawed individuals into groups.
Excuse me.
Leonardo?
- It's going great.
- Really?
Yeah, you're really getting through to them.
But that doesn't mean anything if they're not communicating.
They're comfortable in an environment where you wouldn't be... a place where millions of people use a de facto form of communication that crosses borders and transcends cultural differences.
I-I-I'm serious.
- It's a multibillion-dollar...
- yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it.
Let me try again.
Phoenixxx16, Darkenova45, please rise.
I'm disappointed in you two.
You should be leading thousands of your minions to victory, but instead, you're both sitting here like lily-livered miscreants.
Where's your dignity, Phoenixxx16?
I have dignity.
I have volumes of dignity.
Then show some.
Fight.
And you, Darkenova45, have some pride.
I am proud.
Okay, then it's decided.
Let's hear a call to arms.
Tonight, we will dine together in hell.
Tell your legions that the Battle of Xerxerus will begin at 20:10 sharp!
Into the fire!
Into the fire!
Sometimes you scare me.
No.
No, no.
This is a nice surprise.
I never got to hear the rest of the song.
How did you get her to show up?
I gave her a flyer.
Mac's parking the car.
I'm so glad you came.
Good evening, everyone.
It's a big night for me.
And, um, I'm gonna play a...
I'm gonna play a song that...
That I haven't played in a long time.

Wow.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I sent the money to the real-estate agent, and I ripped up your check.
I never should have hired that crackpot plumber in the first place.
I should've taken responsibility for stuff around the condo.
Yeah...
Maybe.
I didn't...
Always choose work over home.
Well, sometimes it felt like it.
You know, sometimes when we fight, it turns me on.
Always?
Yeah, always.
Now's not a good time.
Oh, why not?
I'm getting ready for the lunch crowd.
If you don't talk to me, I'm gonna come in here every day and say embarrassing things in front of your friends.
Um, Tequila?
Nope, not again.
How about a scotch?
Yeah.
One scotch.
- How do you take it?
- Neat.
Atta girl.
18-year-old Macallan.
She knows her scotch.
Nice.
My dad taught me about scotch.
I'll tell you a secret.
I taught your dad about scotch.
I don't really like secrets.
They always seem to hurt the person that they're trying to protect.
You don't think there are some things that people just shouldn't know?
No.
[Laughs]
No.
It's like magic, and I hate magic.
I mean, why would I want to be tricked into believing something that isn't true?
I hate magic too.
So, um...
You taught my dad about scotch.
What else did you teach him?
How to lose the evidence?
Before I give you this,
I want you to know Teddy was a good man.
Are you saying he didn't lose the evidence?
Your father had to have a good reason for what he did.
But I can't ask him about that, can I?
Maybe that's the way he wanted it.
The Teddy I knew back in the day, the scrappy guy that would do what it took to get out of the neighborhood, what does it matter who that guy was?
It matters to me.
If I don know who my dad is, then how the hell do I know who I am, David?
There are some things about people's pasts that aren't worth knowing.
I'm kind of the opposite.
I like to know everything.
I got to start prepping for lunch.
Thank you for the drink.
Sari, do you need to use the bathroom?
No, I don't have to go.
- All right, then.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Mommy.
- Yes?
Oh, right.
That okay?
I don't like this house.
We're okay.
You'll get used to it soon.
I promise, there's nothing in the closet.
Okay?
Richie's already asleep.
- Your turn, Sari.
- Good night, Mommy.
Power outage?
I wonder if this belongs to the previous owner.
Moving's such a hassle.
"My beloved wife, Mary, Dean and Sam Winchester."
- Go back to the house?
- Something's been bothering me.
I can't get it out of my head.
Don't you wanna go back, Dean?
- No, I don't.
I'm not going.
- Dean.
Why are you bringing this up out of the blue anyway?
I saw it, very clearly.
Help me!
- You're deluded.
- No, I'm not.
To tell you the truth, this isn't the first time this has happened to me.
Calm down, will you?
What, you think you've got psychic abilities or something?
I don't know.
But I do know that I can't just do nothing.
So please, Dean, I need you to do this with me.
Hmm.
Hmm.
- Dean, about Mom...
- Don't wanna talk about it.
- Why not?
- Not in the mood.
Why is that neither you nor Dad will talk about it?
It's like you guys are trying to leave me in the dark.
I envy you, Dean.
You were always Dad's favorite.
When I was a kid, I wanted to play soccer.
Dad wouldn't let me.
He insisted that I practice shooting arrows.
That's an important skill.
Yes?
Hi.
I know this is bit awkward, but we used to live here.
We happened to be in the neighborhood and were wondering how things were at the old house.
By any chance are you the Winchester brothers?
- How did you know?
- An old photo.
I found it in the basement.
I'm Jenny Tucker.
Please come in.
- Well?
- She's the one from my dream.
Seriously?
Please excuse the mess.
This is my son, Richie, and my daughter, Sari.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Can I get you something to drink?
- No, thank you.
Have you been having any problems around the house?
Hmm...
Let's see.
It needs repairs here and there.
It's an old house after all.
What kind of repairs?
There have been some electrical problems.
Sometimes the lights go on and off.
It's probably rats.
I hear sounds up in the attic.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to complain about it to you.
- Anything else?
- Not that I can think of.
My closet.
There's something in my closet.
- Tell me.
- Oh, pay no attention.
- She had a bad dream.
- It wasn't a dream.
I know I saw it.
Sari, I've told you over and over, you just had a bad dream, okay?
Uh...
Yes.
Your mom's right, Sari.
There's nothing in your closet.
Are you happy now?
We need to look into this a little more.
- Oh, come on.
- Jenny said nothing's wrong.
Well, she did say there were electrical issues.
And the sounds of rats running around.
There's no doubt it's a poltergeist.
- Hey.
- Also Sari said there was something in her closet.
You're seriously taking the word of a kid?
What's up with you?
Why are you trying so hard not to see the truth?
What exactly happened in the house 20 years ago?
- You already know what happened.
- No, I don't!
- You really wanna know?
- Tell me.
That day, 20 years ago I came running into your room the moment I heard Mom scream.
Mom!
Mom!
Dad.
- Mom is...
- Dean, take Sam and get out!
- But...
But...
- Hurry up!
Don't look back.
I ran for my life, holding you in my arms.
You were just a baby.
Dad tried everything he could to save Mom.
But he just couldn't.
- Was it the same person that killed Jessica?
- I don't know.
Dean, we need to find out exactly what happened in that house 20 years ago.
What's the point?
It's not going to bring Mom back.
But we might find out who killed Mom and Jessica.
Dean.
All right.
Uh...
Why are the police reopening a 20-year-old case?
Wasn't it a short circuit that caused the fire?
Willie, you were a good friend of Da...?
I mean John Winchester's, correct?
Yeah.
John was a former Marine.
Real nice guy.
He must've really loved his wife.
He completely changed after that incident.
Meaning?
He got obsessed with strange delusions.
He started saying that his wife was killed by a monster.
Later on, he started hanging around with a psychic.
- A psychic?
- Yeah.
And then, I don't know what got into him but John left town, and we never heard from him again.
This is the house.
It's in Dad's notebook.
The psychic, Missouri Mosely.
I've been waiting for you.
I figured it was about time.
I made you some tea.
My goodness.
You've grown so big, Sam and Dean.
- Huh?
- How do you know about us?
Because that's what my power is all about.
- I'm very sorry, Sam.
- You've been through so much.
Not only did you lose your mother, but your girlfriend as well.
- Are you reading my mind?
- No.
I can feel your past.
So you think the house is haunted?
I'm not sure about that.
Why?
I visited the house once after the incident with your mother.
John asked me to.
There was a sort of residue smell left by the evil spirit.
Do you think it's possible that the evil spirit has returned to the house?
I don't think so.
I've been keeping an eye on the house but I haven't sensed anything like I did back then.
- Give me this.
- But the little girl in the house...
- Sari.
- Yes.
- She said she definitely saw something in her closet.
It's not the same thing that killed your mother.
That I know for sure.
Here we go.
Great tea.
I had too much, though.
I gotta go use the bathroom.
Dad.
It's Dean.
This is John Winchester.
If this is urgent, please leave a message.
If you're calling regarding 11-2-83 please let me know your current whereabouts.
- And this.
- Okay.
Jenny!
Jenny.
The doctor told me about the burns on Richie's back.
It's my fault.
I left him alone.
Calm down.
It's not your fault.
Something must've happened in the house.
Jenny, if we don't do anything, Sari may be in danger too.
We need to check out the house before anything else happens.
- Well?
- I definitely sense it.
- It's an evil spirit filled with hatred.
- Why is it here?
The energy waves left by the evil spirit from your mother's incident have attracted another evil spirit.
This sort of thing happens often.
Hold on.
I sense something else.
- This is a different presence.
- What do you mean?
There's no doubt.
There is another presence here.
There are two spirits in this house.
This is John Winchester.
If this is urgent, please leave a message.
If you're calling regarding 11-2-83 please let me know your current whereabouts.
Dad, it's Dean.
We're in Lawrence.
We're checking out Mom's incident.
Please.
We need your help.
If you get this message, please come.
I miss you.
Dad.
So, what was Mom like?
- Dean.
- Honestly how much longer are we going to do this?
Missouri told us to keep watching the place, remember?
And what I saw in my dream, it's supposed to materialize.
It's freezing.
It's freezing.
No!
Sari!
Sari!
Sari!
Sari!
Someone...
Someone, help!
Help!
Someone!
Jenny!
- Sam!
Dean!
- Jenny, are you all right?
- Sam, the kids are still inside.
- I'll go.
Come with me.
Let's get down from here.
Sari, come here!
Sari!
Come with me.
Damn it.
Sam!
Take your brother and get out!
Don't look back!
Are you all right?
- Sam...
- What about Sam?
He's inside!
He's still in there!
Sam!
Sam!
Are you all right?
Sam?
- Bastard!
- Dean, don't shoot!
What?
This might be...
- Impossible.
- I knew it.
She was protecting the kids from the evil spirit.
I'm so happy to see you Mom.
Sam.
Dean.
You're all grown up.
You've been here all along?
Yes.
To see us?
I'm not the one that brought you back here.
It was the evil spirit that killed me.
What?
Never give in.
Dean, please protect Sam.
I know you can do it.
Get out of our house.
I'm so happy that I got to see you again.
You are my precious treasures forever.
Sam, Dean I love you.
Thank you.
Mom.
Thank you so very much, Sam and Dean.
Goodbye.
Take care.
It's done.
I buried my secret concoction to ward off evil spirits in four corners of the house.
Evil spirits will never be able to haunt this house again.
Did Mom's spirit die?
I don't know.
But I don't sense anything in this house anymore.
I see.
Let's go, Sam.
Missouri, thanks for everything.
Get in touch once in a while, will you?
I don't understand.
Sam's supposed to have a special ability.
I wonder why he didn't notice that his dad was here.
Hey, John, are you sure you're okay, letting them go like that?
I miss them, but...
So do you think Mom's spirit died to save us?
No, it's not dead.
But Missouri said she couldn't feel anything anymore.
She must've gone to a better place then.
That's what you said.
Don't you believe that?
I do believe that.
Of course I do.
Sari, do you need to use the bathroom?
No, I don't have to go.
- All right, then.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Mommy.
- Yes?
Oh, right.
That okay?
I don't like this house.
We're okay.
You'll get used to it soon.
I promise, there's nothing in the closet.
Okay?
Richie's already asleep.

I do believe that.
Of course I do.
My name is Lee Siu Sheung
When i was a child, i loved watching cartoons
Every time when Ultraman appeared, i would be super excited it was he who told me there was justice in this world
Justice badge?
don't move, mind the pin
OK, there
However, after i was 8 i have never watched cartoons again i don't believe in anything now i only believe in my own fists
ake out all your money quickly, you stupid
What a waste of time
You call it a 9-section iron chain just by joining some iron pellets?
Why don't you chop off your fingers to make a 1 0-section iron chain?
Come on, i am not afraid of pain
You really believe you are the Captain of Earth Guard
Siu Sheung is the Captain
What?
i said Siu Sheung is the Captain, dude
To hell with Siu Sheung
Today i delivered goods to Block 8 and bumped into 5 bastards from So Uk Estate
1 0 feet trod on my head is your head that big?
Not only that they even pinched my finger with a knife
But i knew i had to keep calm at that moment i said to myself
Thunder!
You are bullying me like this
You will have to pay for it!
And then i was so smart i pretended to be scared, i yelled
Kid, no need to be afraid in fact that was a signal
Upon receiving my order, Siu Sheung rushed to the scene
The Captain of Earth Guard eventually turned out i and Siu Sheung exchanged knowing glances
He told me
Earth Guard cannot do without me at that moment, i was somewhat touched
Then i retreated in order to advance, so as to coordinate with Siu Sheung
At last, the 2 of us defeated the 5 master-hands
Siu Sheung, you are marvellous!
.
Sorry, sorry i am destined to be in the company of righteous friends so i don't mind saying this once more if you don't join Siu Sheung's and my Earth Guard, i don't care
But the loss is ultimately yours
Take your shower and shut up
Sir, i hope your hands won't shake
They started the fight first it doesn't matter that i go to the police station with you put down your gun first
Get on the van
How many times have you done this?
.
The damn cops started it first
Of course i had to fight back i won't bail you out again next time
Hey, don't be like that i will treat you to chicken in glutinous rice
To hell with your chicken in glutinous rice
Chasing the bad guys and the devils
We all dream big i want the world to be peaceful and all evils be overcome
The army, navy and airforce launch a joint attack
The army, navy and airforce launch a joint attack
Hurry up, the big combination!
.
Hey, didn't you say you would buy parts to fix the fan?
.
Mommy, come on out quick!
.
The big combination!
.
The big combination!
.
Coming, coming!
.

dinner will be served soon
Let's go, let's go
Hey, let's go!
.
God Sigma is waiting for you i am coming!
.
daddy!
.
daddy do you reckon Ultraman can defeat the 3-head monster?
.
it is indeed risky it all depends on whether his hand can be combined if so, that would be OK if not, he may lose
Then won't the earth be in great danger?
.
Even our estate will be in trouble
You don't have to worry
Our estate has always been guarded by Ultraman
Really?
.
Who?
.
Me
You are not even as good as Mommy
Even Ultraman would occasionally lose to monsters
That's too bad
Siu Sheung, it's time to go home for dinner it's time, let's go daddy, that's the Ultraman sword i want

You junior security guard!

You are so fond of playing in the band why don't you return to Taiwan and i'll get Wu Bai to produce an album for you
i want Jay Chou to produce it for me daddy, actually i don't really need to play in a band
Moreover, i don't want to return to Taiwan it's so boring
Mr. Hon Yu those idiots didn't target me they targeted you
You have to find out who did it, chop chop it is i who should worry about you, instead of you worrying about me
Having studied abroad really makes a difference i will ask Shing to get someone to protect you don't!
.
With a bunch of followers like that, it is in fact most dangerous i feel perfectly safe walking around all by myself
Nobody knows i am your daughter
How about Tai Muk?
.
He's both uncouth and weird
Eating congee with fried egg?
.
You weirdo
Let's do it this way
You deploy this new guy to protect me
He's younger, so it's less gross
He looks dumb is he OK?
.
Your bodyguards were genuinely dumb
He was the only one who could catch up with me
Oh, he could catch up with you

i've heard about this wonderful mask.
Have you tried it out?
.
it whitens and reduces wrinkles
So dramatic?
.
He dashed onto the stage and tried to draw his pistol so i bashed him with my guitar
Gunmen are reckless they would shoot indiscriminately i was so smart i bumped him off, and i jumped out trying to attract attention so more people would come rescue me
Great, what a heroine
Then what happened?
.
Then... the first person who rushed to rescue me was... your son
Siu Sheung?
.
Right, he loved saving people when he was a kid
His favourite cartoon was...
What Stigma?
.
What 3 loyal warriors?
.
Oh, God Sigma!
.
Yes, God Sigma!
.
it was my favourite cartoon when i was a kid she also liked watching God Sigma
The theme song was sung by Leslie Cheung
Leslie Cheung didn't sing it well
My Siu Sheung does a better job singing it
Really?
.
When he was a kid, his singing was famous in our neighbourhood
His late father loved listening to him sing
Really?
.
i have a karaoke version of the song
Great!
.
Take it out
Wow, you are really something i am not that good
God Sigma rules the universe
The 3 loyal warriors
With courage and passion he is like a righteous big child
Flying in the starry sky he discharges mysterious missions
Looking at the home star afar which is so bright and beautiful
Chasing the bad guys and the devils
Hey, i rarely see you so late
Where are your wife and daughter?
.
Traveling in Thailand
What happened outside?
.
it's too bad that i am so busy, otherwise i would have gone with them
That chap didn't die, what do you think?
.
Which chap?
.
i saw Wah Chiu trying to do it.
You didn't see him?
.
The boss will take care of it
Hon Yu's success... is attributable to our efforts
1 0 years already!
.
Now he has a business empire
Money laundered, he is the chairman of a listed company
What are we doing now?
.
Head of security?
.
if we didn't block off bullets for him, he would have died 9 times
Who else is in it?
.
You should ask me why i revolt against him
Search your heart
Haven't you thought of taking over his position?
.
i haven't
i were not you, i have
if need be, i kill.
We are brothers, so what?
.
Where is Wah Chiu?
.
Call him now
Shing, you have followed me for years this is the first time you don't answer my call
There is an internal fraud in the Security department i need two days to take care of it
Security department?
.
does that include you?
.
Shing was not involved
did you hear it?
.
Your men said you were not involved despite being so experienced, you don't know about your men's revolt
Tell me if i should still trust you
Brother Hon if we were to revolt, you would have fallen long time again
That means you want to revolt
You can't even protect your wife and daughter
You'd better shut up
We built the "society" together i don't understand why we are still your lackeys
Because you are incapable
This world no longer needs "societies"
i cleared your names for you i made Matsumoto a listed company
i want to let you know what is meant by morality and justice
Revolt?
.
You all!
.
if we were to revolt, you won't be standing here
No matter what...
Shing, learn how to be a man in your next life!
.
Siu Sheung don't you think it's dangerous for Ultraman to fight with the monsters?
.
Should be if his hand cannot be combined, it will be dangerous
What should we do then?
.
No need to fear there are other Ultramen in the world
Really?
.
Where?
.
Me!
.
Hey, you are speeding again, i will throw up
The boat has arrived, are we leaving?
.
No matter what, we will die
Either we die separately or we die together i don't know what you want.
Leave when there is a chance
Hon Yu will not let us off
You fought so hard for a way out then you refused to leave
Now you are back, you have no more choice
You can only kill me, take over my position then wait to be killed
This is your fate
daddy!
.
Run!
.
daddy!
.
do not ask me why
Because you have never treated me as a brother
How are they?
.
Your son only suffers minor injuries
The man sent in with your son is in more serious condition
i've got it
Sorry don't say sorry every time you see me
it's not your fault i am really sorry
don't claim responsibility for everything if it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen
i did harm to you and your son
don't say that
You have never let go for so many years i am all right
My husband and my son are the same
They would sacrifice their lives for justice
Whatever.
i'd like to thank your son for saving Siu Sheung please ask him not to protect Siu Sheung anymore
He spends his whole life protecting another person
That is not necessary
My son is no longer the old Lee Siu Sheung it is he who decided to do that
He knew what happened to you and your son so he decided to protect Siu Sheung
Because he thinks that is the most basic duty of a policeman
Mom...
Mom...
You have woken up
Go home if you are sleepy
Are you hungry?
.
i... i will never do it again
it's OK
Sorry
don't cry
Really?
.
it's really OK
Silly boy, don't cry
Mom
Have you seen Annie?
.
don't worry, she is safe i brought the papers for you to sign.
it's your father's last will i want to sell them all
But, madam, that's gonna take a minimum of 2 weeks
No, i need it right now
What is Matsumoto Group?
.
Who does Hon Yu think he is?
.
You have to help him
You scum.
You scum.
don't go!
.
it's none of your business
You think too highly of yourself.
This is your Achilles' heel don't think of revenge
Shing is not someone you can handle
Your father was a coward i am not if you don't forgive him, i can't do anything
But i have saved you, that makes you my friend i don't need a friend like you
Get lost!
.
do you want to lose your life?
.
You have already lost one hand.
You can never defeat him
Losing one hand is my own business
My life is mine, it's none of your business
Your life is not yours alone
You can't even defeat me if you just go out like that, how is it different from suicide?
.
When i was a kid, i thought you were superb
You had courage, passion... and a sense of justice
You said you would beat the bad guys up
Look at you, what a trash!
.
Even my daddy was cheated by you don't you know you have fooled many people?
.
Rubbish!
.
it's fine that you are like this
You will be sent to the landfill
You are better off than me i am sitting here everyday doing nothing
You cannot be a hero anyway
Let me give you a hand, so that you won't implicate other people
if you were Lee Siu Sheung will you forgive your father?
.
if i were Lee Siu Sheung i will definitely not forgive a man who turns a blind eye to my father's death
daddy i have always respected you
i know you are a righteous man
Since i was a child, i have been able to tell people proudly that my father is But Ching Mo
He is a good cop i have learned something from Siu Sheung
if you think it is right persist in it till the end
What do you want?
.
i come to find out what you want
i really want to help the world create a new order
Who do you think you are?
.
i have chips, i can do whatever i want
You have no chips
You are not qualified to talk to me
Uncle Choi
Will you come to help Siu Sheung retaliate?
.
Retaliate against whom so late at night?
.
To beat up the bad guys of South Group
Are you nuts?
.
How dare you beat up the South Group guys?
.
i am not that stupid
Shing, come out!
.
You come out, Shing!
.
So you are Shing.
You look so gross i am the Vice Captain of Earth Guard
You come out and let's have a man-to-man fight
Are you afraid?
.
A man-to-man fight!
.
What captain are you?
.
My name is Big Bird, the Vice Captain of Earth Guard
Siu Sheung is the Captain i come here today to seek justice for Siu Sheung!
.
is the cripple not dead yet?
.
What are you talking about?
.
He is completely fine, just has a little flu
Cut the crap.
Let's have a man-to-man fight!
.
Let him in i am not afraid of you
Although i personally can fight 1 0 people since you and i are on the same level
i now give you a chance to fight me one-on-one
That's really something
So i am forced to use my unique skill
The invincible... triple rod!
.
Come again!
.
Shing, finish fighting before you leave!
.
Boss, do you have spicy hot noodle?
.
You two finish retaliation so fast?
.
Come again!
.
Come again!
.
You have not won as long as i am not dead
Shing, stop!
.
Stop!
. don't!
.
don't, Brother Shing!
.
don't!
.
Let my friend off
No!
.
No!
.
Big Bird!
.
No, Brother Shing!
.
i beg you
Brother Shing, please don't!
.
i kowtow to you
Sorry So you want to retaliate against me?
.
i won't retaliate, i won't retaliate
Big Bird!
.
Big Bird!
.
Brother Shing, sorry
Take the trash away
Big Bird, let's go
You have to lick the ground clean first
if you want to be a hero, you should not have friends
Big Bird, it's OK now
Big Bird, we have arrived
Big Bird...
Siu Sheung, i have brought you a big drumstick
Look, i asked Uncle Choi to add more condiments it's delicious
Hey, no need to worry
You just nurse your injuries here i and my buddies will take care of your mom and Annie
Your injuries are just minor
Enough!
.
don't you know you are disgusting
Get lost!
.
don't ever bother me again!
.
Go!
.
No matter what,
Earth Guard can't do without you
You will forever be the Captain in my heart
Hello, professor?
.
This is Annie i need your help, as soon as possible
...you return at the right time
Come back to Earth Guard it's a bit exhausting that i am the only guard
Too little good guy too many bad guy do you really believe there are Ultramen in this world?
.
Hey, don't belittle yourself
Ultramen are everywhere
Big Bird's birthday party 7pm tonight, Rhododendron Restaurant
dear neighbours, Big Bird had a wish before his death which was forming Earth Guard
His plan was to assemble the brothers from Blocks 9 and 1 0 plus our home delivery team, waiters and bartenders
Then we can form an unified Earth Guard to ensure that justice is done
if you insist on justice justice will kill all the people around you
As a cop, i am prepared for death
Really?
.
The protective uniforms designed by Big Bird have arrived
We also have 5 delivery cars which were all fixed by Big Bird
4 of us can share 1 car
Big Bird has done so much.
His only hope was more people could join our Earth Guard
Someone will come for you i want you to watch your rescuer die
How he dies for justice
do you believe there are Ultramen in this world?
.
Big Bird said Ultramen are everywhere i used to think he was so dumb
But now... i believe
That Ultramen is everywhere in this world
Let's go
Where to?
.
i will go beat up the scoundrels
Big Bird was killed by them
We used to beat him up too
That's right.
We may die if we go
Have you thought carefully?
.
Have you thought about this in our whole lives, have we ever been stylishly brave for once?
.
Big Bird has always treated me as the Captain but i have never shouldered the responsibility of a captain
You have always loved fighting but not once was worthwhile
However, some people really have to be beaten up
do you remember the day my father died?
.
There is a price to pay... if justice is to be done
He was willing to dash out like that for a stranger
Today, i finally understand why he did that
Because it is our responsibility
We are very old anyway
Besides
Besides, we have learned martial arts if we just do home delivery, it would be a huge waste
Shall we reserve a place for the boss?
.
Are you ready to go?
.
Tonight, Earth Guard eventually discharges its duty
i will bring Big Bird along to rescue a person whom we believe is worth the effort
Let's set off, friends!
.
What is the total cost of the uniforms?
.
Get me 1 1 suits
Run, son!
.
Mom, i didn't fight because of this medal i know, you want to punish the bad guys
Yes!
.
Next time when i punish the bad guys i will notify you
You can count me out
By the way, i prefer... daddy's badge
Justice Set d
2 more bowls of beat-up-the-bad-guy noodle
Big bad guy or small bad guy?
.
Big, of course
Here come the fresh pineapple buns!
.
Sir, it's wrong to jump the queue
You will get your bun
But if you don't follow the rules we will use the Mantis Boxing on you
it was a good fight
But you couldn't protect the glass of water
God Sigma rules the universe
The 3 loyal warriors
With courage and passion he is like a righteous big child
Flying in the starry sky
Neighbours, here come the egg tarts!
.
Great!
.
Eat while it's hot dear neighbours, how do you do?
.
Help!
.
Ghost!
.
This young man with such a hot temper must be Brother Siu Sheung dear neighbours, you don't have to scream in fact i am Big Bird's little brother
Little Bird
Oh, Little Bird i come to inherit my brother's post as the Vice Captain of Earth Guard

Ouch.
That had to hurt.
Stupid shelf!
You're okay.
Just a little bump, right?
It's my birthday.
Seriously?
Well, you can't cry on your birthday!
It's against the rules.
I'm 23 years old.
I'm having sex in a tree house!
You say it like it's not the awesome-est thing ever!
Know how many babes would lose their (bleep) if I brought them back here to my pad?
Maybe you should date a girl your own age.
Uh-uh.
I love you, Tina.
Chris!
Hey, Chris!
Chris!
Don't let him come up here!
Hey 'Bbud.
What's good?
You can come down now.
Parents are gone.
Mom made pancakes.
"Blueberry pancakes!"
"Blueberry pancakes?"
"Yes!
Yum!
They're delicious!"
You too, Tina!
There's lots!
Abbud, I know this seems a little weird.
But Chris' grades have been suffering and he really needs the extra tutoring.
Yep, I need me some learning, 'Bbud, all night long!
Tutor me, baby!
Chris, shut up!
Relax, Slip.
I know.
You know?
You know what?
You know.
I "know" know.
No.
I don't know.
Tell me.
About you two, grinding groins.
Grinding?
Jesus, Abbud, look, I'm just helping Chris out...
I saw you two bumping nasties.
When I climb onto the roof, I get a pretty nice view.
Okay, I don't know what you think you saw but...
I saw you, naked, and your perfect medium-sized "chesticles"
bouncing around while you...
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
They're perfect, aren't they?
Yeah, bro.
Your girl is stacked, yo!
You listen to me very carefully.
You keep your mouth shut or I will rip your tongue out of your head and shove it up your ass so fast, you'll taste your lunch.
Are we clear?
Yes!
Jesus!
What do I get out of this?
Look, don't tell anyone and I'll give you an "A".
Deal.
What the hell are you doing?

It's weird, right?
It's not that weird.
We live right across the hall from each other.
Oh, yeah.
Duh.
It's my birthday.
Oh.
And that's why they call them fish-sticks.
Oh, crap!
Oh, stupid alarm.
I got it.
Thanks.
It's a panic button, in case I get, you know, assaulted, in an empty parking garage.
Like, if some guy was to just pin me up against my car, and have his way with me.
Well, you don't have to worry about me.
I'd at least take you out for dinner first.
I'd like that.
Yeah.
See you around.
Okay.

Hello!
"How I'm Going To Bone You Tonight" by Chris Collins.
David, do you mind?
Yikes, I thought my physics homework was exciting.
Guess I'll have to crank it up a notch.
What is that?
What does it look like?
Your great-great-great grandmother's vibrator?
No.
I imagine she would've just used a piece of wood, carved in the shape of...
What is it then?
This is a Jensen 75 steam engine power plant.
Or as I like to call it, crack cocaine for us science nerds.
A toy.
Sure.
Maybe we could play with it together some time, tonight even, over some beef Wellington and wine.
I could show you how to get the piston pumping.
Gross.
And, no.
I could be over at your place by 9:00.
Red or white?
You don't know where I live.
I knew you'd play hard to get.
What is this?
This street-level images of all the T. Nolan addresses
I found on the internet.
I'll be able to tell by your reaction which one is yours.
Okay, that's a bit creepy, Dave, like, not even cute creepy.
Women love to be chased, Tina, hunted, stalked like prey.
What may seem "creepy" now will someday be a great how-we-met story.
Okay, stay calm, people!
But this could be the real deal!
This is not a drill.
Please walk to your nearest exit...
Let's go!
Move it!
You're going to burn!
students and faculty.
This is not a drill...
Tina, please!
I can't believe this.
It seems like there's a fire drill every day.
Those aren't drills, Tina.
They're false alarms.
What?
Hold on.
You mean someone actually has the nerve to just pull the fire alarm?
Who would do that?
Try Stanley.
Tea!
What?
It's just Tina.
Stan?
Why?
Test, exam, pop quiz.
He didn't study.
So, he pulls the alarm at the beginning of the class, school's evacuated and, by the time we all get back inside, no time for the test.
Teacher has to reschedule, Stan gets another day to study, which he won't, of course.
So then he pulls the alarm again.
And here we are, caught up in his sick cycle.
It's actually genius.
Kid's got balls.
Kid's got big, fat, hairy balls.
Ew!
Hey, babe.
Read my homework?
Chris, don't call me "babe" at school.
Yep, she's doing him.
Yeah, well that's not gonna work out.
That's probably true, D.
you and me.
You and me already does work, Tina.
No, Chris, it doesn't.
We have no future.
Wrong.
Hey guys, check it out.
Has he told her his plan?
He's got a plan?
We run away to Nebraska.
There's tons of empty houses there 'cause of the economy!
It's awesome!
We'll get a hot dog truck and call it
"Chris and Tina's Spicy 'Wienas.'"
Wow.
Wow.
Yeah, I know.
Living in a foreclosed home, working on a hot dog truck in Nebraska.
Gee, I'm a lucky girl!
We can't just run away.
You think she bought it?
Wieners?
Not a chance.
But hey, I guess there just isn't gonna be time for our exam.
Stanley!
I'm right here!
Sorry.
Here.

So, when's Tony coming back?
I haven't seen him in a while.
Never, I hope.
Mostly, I feel like I'm so over that dickwad.
But sometimes, I really miss him a lot.
You should just forget about him and move on.
Seriously, Michelle, Tony's just a boy.
He's way too young and immature for you.
I mean, I'm sure the sex is amazing...
Oh yeah.
But it's not enough.
You need to be the grown-up.
End it.
Trust me.
As your friend, this is good advice.
Do you have any actual grown-up friends?
Like, your own age?
No.
I mean, not really.
Well, what about other teachers?
Teachers aren't grown-ups.
We hang around kids so much that we're all infected by this weird, like, kid disease that destroys our "adultness".
It's gone!
My Jensen 75, gone!
Your what?
My steam engine, Ms. Nolan!
It's missing!
You see what I'm talking about?
Attention, thieves!
One of you has stolen my property.
But all of you are guilty of stealing my soul.
As of this day, "Nice Dave" is dead.
You killed him.
All of your lockers will be searched!
Then the strip searches begin!
I'm not sure that's legal.
Full cavity searches!
How big is this thing?
Nice work, Daisy.
So, now it's you and Abbud, huh?
Yeah.
We're screwing each other's brains out a lot after school.
Oh.
Well, that's nice.
Sometimes during school too, behind those big mats in the gym.
Okay, yeah, great spot.
I mean, you shouldn't be having sex at school.
Is it serious?
No.
It's just sex.
I mean, means nothing to me.
He's just a warm body.
You sure you don't want to talk to someone older and wiser about it?
Huh?
Me.
Oh.
No, it's cool, Tina.
Thanks anyway.
Come on, Daisy, teacher-student confidentiality.
As your Yearbook Committee President,
I hereby order you to share some juicy details.
Actually, this is weird.
You're not exactly our president anymore.
What?
We had a vote and replaced you with Allison Brown.
When did this happen?
You repla...
Why?
You've been missing submission deadlines, Tina.
We felt like we needed to go with someone more... responsible.
Responsible?
Allison's 15!
I'm sorry, Tina.
It's nothing personal.
Ms Nolan.
I'd like to speak to you.
Me?
Now?
Right now.
Is everything okay?
No.
We both know with certainty that everything is not okay.
Nothing gets past me Ms. Nolan.
I've noticed what's been going on these past few months.
Principal Turner, I can explain!
Look, I never meant for this to happen.
It's just his mom ran away and he really needed a place...
These test scores have been falling for months now and that is your responsibility.
They're abominable, a disgrace.
We want to see a huge improvement, don't we?
Yes.
Yes, we do.
Can everyone please be quiet?
Please be quiet.
Will everyone please stop talking?
Everybody shut the (bleep) up!
Tina's trying to talk!
You're all being (bleep) and pissing her off on her birthday.
Birthday?
Really?
Happy birthday, Slippy!
My name is not Slippy!
Don't ever call me that again, okay?
Sorry, Tina.
You don't have to go all psycho on me.
It's not Tina either!
It's not?
No.
You will call me Miss Nolan.
You got that?
'Cause I'm not your buddy or one of your friends.
I'm your (bleep) teacher.

Yes.

Chris.

So what?
Who cares about a stupid job?
I care!
This is my life.
I know I'm a broken record but I really mean it this time, okay?
We cannot see each other anymore, ever.
But we will still see each other, every day.
That's what's so awesome about high school.
You can never get away.
Then I'll quit my job.
So, you'll quit your job so you won't have to see me, 'cause you want to break up cause you're scared you'll lose your job?
Yes?
Then, do we even need to break up?

I don't care what happens to me out there, but I got to get home.
I can't be cheated out of my 21 gun salute.
I gave up too much already.
Talk to the Colonel, make sure that happens, right?
You have my word, sir!
Dog tags, everybody!
Colonel's orders!
Aw, come on, sir!
This is bullshit!
This is bullshit!
Just do it, get them out, come on!
Say sayonara to those of us who never existed.
Try not to get a rash kissing all that ass!
Fucking bureaucrat!
Good morning, Lieutenant!
Cassandra Mason, CIA.
Congratulations.
So, where would you like me to sit?
(Laughing)
Um, sorry, but there's no women, not on this field trip.
Oh, come on, Lieutenant!
What, the girls can't play with the boys?
What, you're serious?
Guys, I got to go speak to the Colonel.
Sir.
Yes, sir!
To the Colonel?
Come on, this is way above his head.
Now, I'm getting on that boat, and if I were you,
I wouldn't waste my time trying to stop me.
Whoa, whoa!
And why would we need you?
I know you find this a little hard to believe, but this isn't my first field trip.
I know the area better than anyone.
So, once again, where would you like me to sit, Lieutenant?
You slow us down;
we'll leave you behind.
That's a promise.
That's what I'm talking about, bonita!
She wants to be all she can be!
Ahhh, my God!
Choice between bad and worse.
Well, if these guys can't fix it, hell, nobody can!
(Helicopter buzzing)
¶
TYLER:
Move out!
Boss!
You bet your sweet bippy, these boys:
They died a painful death.
What do you got?
Sir, the skull seems to have been pierced with some sort of drill.
The inside contents within the cranial wall, they've been sucked out.
The White House is worried about water-boarding.
Oh, ain't no tellin' what we just walked into.
I'll tell you one thing, this wasn't done by a Latino.
Whoa, whoa!
Where do you think you're going?
Get your hands off me!
I've got a job to do, just like you do!
Really?
And what is that job?
I'll tell you exactly--
No, let me tell you something, Little Miss Sunshine!
You're not going to come here and screw up my operation.
You know, I don't give a crap what government bureaucrat sent you down here, but now that you are down here, you're under my command, you understand that?
I--
Just nod your head, yes, or I will leave your ass behind.
Boss, these are some real killers.
This definitely ain't no rag-tag terrorist trainees.
Something a lot more serious.
Boss, I think you need to come see this.
This here's some serious fucking weaponry.
Ain't no AK-47 that'll do that to a man.
Son of a bitches are getting help from somewhere.
As sure as a chicken'll eat his own shit, you can count on that, bub.
Excuse me.
If you're withholding intel from me, you're going to regret the day you were born.
Jackie, search the boat, search for bodies.
Find me something.
Jessie, you got perimeter.
See if there's any more casualties out here.
Yes, sir!
Jack, when you're done, torch the boat.
My pleasure, sir.
(Kissing sounds)
Hey!
Oh, damn!
I just lost my appetite.
Must have been one hell of a fight.
(Flies buzzing)
Boss, there's a whole lot of shells.
They must have let off at least 1000 rounds.
Lot of shells, but I don't see any bodies of the bad guys.
What's up with that?
Boss, I ain't got an answer for you.
I mean, I ain't never seen nothing like this before.
Now, you know I ain't one for quitting, but I mean, they sent us out in a trap.
A death trap, look at this!
This is some stuff you only see on TV.
Hey, honey, you get scared?
You can always grab onto Papa.
Two tours in Baghdad, a year with the U.N. peacekeepers in Sudan.
I'm not scared of this crap!
(Laughing)
What a hardcore woman.
What a turn-on!
Hey, I think she likes me, boss!
All right, guys, come on.
Let's pick up the track.
Let's find these assholes.
Yes, sir.
Move.
Damn!
More flies than my ex.
Damn it!
(Gunshots)
Take him out.
(Gunshot)
Go, go, go.
All right, Colby, you stay on point.
Yes, sir.
Everybody else, tight formation, double time, okay?
Whoa, whoa!
What about me?
What about you?
I'm not staying here!
Yeah, you are.
If any of these assholes come running this way, it's probably in your best interest to shoot 'em, okay?
Excuse me.
Jackie, Jessie, left side!
Colby, you're with me.
Rest of you, to the right!
Go, go, go!
Go, go!
(Gunshots)
(Rapid gunfire)
Ugh!
Ahhh!
Get my back, move!
(Gunfire)
Ugh!
(Punching, grunting sounds)
(Splashing)
(Gunshot)
Shit.
Ugh!
Ahh!
All right, let's see what they got, gentlemen.
Boss!
Boss, you got to see this.
Son of a bitch!
It's a request for more weapons from the Department of Defence.
Sir, this is a U.S. Army training manual.
What?
These weapons are U.S. military-issue.
This is bullshit, sir!
Sir, is this bullshit?
It's most definitely bullshit.
We're training these assholes to fight against us!
Jesus!
I thought we told you to stay your ass up there!
I got bored.
(Gunshots)
Get down!
(Screaming)
(Explosion)
(Screaming)
Clear!
Clear!
Clear!
Explain to me why the government sent us down here.
This was a search-and-destroy mission, wasn't it?
Listen, you Jughead grunt, your job is to shoot that gun and not ask any questions.
So, follow your orders and keep your mouth shut!
How dare you bastards send my men into a deathtrap!
You knew damn well that those scientists were dead!
You sent us here so we could clean up your mess!
You've earned your gold star, Lieutenant.
Jackie, torch this place.
Colby?
(Explosion)
Tyler!
Hey, right now, my focus is to make sure my men get out of here alive, but I got a lot of questions for you, lady.
Hey, did you ever think that sometimes there's questions you really don't want to know the answers to?
Not when it concerns my men.
Fuck your men!
The interest of the United States government comes first!
And sometimes, you got to lose one to save a thousand.
Next time you want someone to clean up your dirt, you bring in your own operatives.
We are not your puppets.
You are whatever the United States government says you are!
And so am I!
Get your hands off of me.
Gentlemen, double time!
Colby's got point.
You are whatever the United States government says you are, and so am I!
Jessie.
Keep an eye on her ass.
If she tries to run away, shoot her.
All right, men, let's move out.
Don't worry, mamacita.
I'll keep an eye on your ass.
What have you got, soldier?
Something's out there.
Where am I looking?
I'm not sure, sir.
False alarm, I guess.
At ease, guys.
Let's take a break.
Cigarette?
It's a disgusting habit.
How about you?
Sure, man, yeah.
Hey, Colby, don't be such a pussy your whole life, huh?
Shut up!
Hey, what do you think about that señorita over there, huh?
I haven't worked with a dame since I was a grunt.
Ain't a grunt no more?
She's some under-wraps scam.
Going to weaken our forces.
Can't trust no female!
It's that whole emotional thing.
It's their time of the month, they go postal.
Heh!
Hey, puto, let me get a swig of that!
Give me a cigarette.
The bar I was telling you about back home?
Pussy everywhere.
Why don't you come down when we get back?
Who do you think you're fooling?
You wouldn't know what to do with a piece of ass if it landed in your lap.
(Laughing)
Bullshit!
Hey, I thought you were gay.
That's what I thought, bro.
Hey, don't ask, don't tell, all right?
(Laughing)
That was a sheep, man.
Don't make me gay.
No, just real strange.
Quite a motley group of guys you got there.
Those are real men.
Of course, you've never met one of those with all those pussies you work with in Washington.
Hmm, I believe I've never actually met a real man, ever.
(Laughing)
Oh, yeah.
Hey, what are you guys sipping on?
Want daytime or night, sir?
Both.
Here you go, Sarge.
Got you covered.
This one's tequila.
This one on the right.
You want this one.
You want that one first.
¶
(Blowing)
What are you doing?
Nothing.
What was that?
I said nothing!
(Cracking neck)
I'm sick of your shit.
Ugh!
(Gunshot)
You just saved your life.
(Gunshots)
Whoo!
Whoo, that's right!
Yeah!
(Screaming)
Where you going, mother-fucker?
Where you going?
(Gunshot)
(Laughing)
Ugh!
Ahh!
(Groaning)
What exactly are we looking for?
No idea.
As long as the cheque clears, makes no difference to me.
Hey, you still suffering from that post-traumatic stress disorder?
Maybe.
Want to talk about it?
Not really.
You can talk to me, man!
I'm like Dr. Phil!
My counsellor said I got good ears.
I can listen.
You got medication?
Yeah.
Can I have some?
Yeah, it's back at the base.
I'll get you one.
Whatever keeps you quiet, man.
Hey, let me get a lighter, let me get a lighter.
Do you people ever stop talking?
Whoa!
You may want to close your eyes.
He's dead.
This guy never got a shot off.
No, he didn't.
Look, see that?
It's a high-powered rifle.
We got company out here.
Looks like he was carrying supplies.
There's more of them.
Get back to the team, let's go.
(Whistling "Pop Goes the Weasel")
(Sniffing)
Oh!
Cassandra, hey!
(Hyperventilating)
Jesus Christ, this guy's brains are missing.
Diablo!
They sure ain't playing, boss.
He's dead.
What's wrong with you?
Talk to me, what happened here?
He-- it--
Where's Jackie?
Where'd he go?
He, uh--
Let's get you out of here, come on.
Let's move out, men.
What is that?
(Speaking Spanish)
¶
What's going on?
I'll tell you one thing.
We're not fighting a terrorist.
Boss, I've seen some things in my days, but that-- that, I don't know what that is!
She knows something!
Okay, all right, all right, back off!
Cassandra, talk to me.
I saw it!
Saw what?
I saw it.
It's not like anything I've ever seen before.
We should just kill her.
She's in on it!
She's in on it!
She's a fucking liar!
This is bullshit!
Can't trust a woman, sir.
Listen, stop!
Just stop!
All right, fine.
They told me that there was something out here.
Other than that-- Jesus Christ!
No, other than that, I don't know!
(Men all shouting)
All right, all right!
No, no, no, wait, wait!
Go, all right?
Go do something.
Go.
Sir.
Go!
The hell with this.
Something out here?
That's all I know.
That's just great.
Hey, where the hell are you going?
Enough!
I'm done, I quit!
She's crazy!
Well, how about you give me a cigarette before you catch a Greyhound out of here?
Man, I got to stop smoking these things.
Used to be able to punish the booty two hours straight.
Now, I can't even go 20 minutes.
Maybe that's why your girl's always creeping over to my place.
Your place?
Yeah.
Hey, let me tell you something.
I'm world-renowned for my baby-making skills.
I'm like the Puerto Rican baby-making machine!
I'm like the U.N. in this bitch!
God sent me here for two things.
That's making babies, and saving the fucking day.
You need to get your head checked!
Oh, I need to get my head checked?
Yes!
The last time I checked, you had post-partum depression.
Do you have any idea what you're talking about?
Oh, I know what I'm talking about.
I've been to a seminar once.
We sat around, we talked, played Yenga.
Don't you mean Jenga?
Yeah, and we hugged.
Want to hug?
You can't keep this stuff bottled up inside, man!
Head'll get all cloudy.
Liable to hurt somebody.
What do you think we're out here to do in the first place?
(Twig snapping)
Shh!
Take the shot, soldier.
What are you waiting for?
Take the shot!
I can't.
That's what we get paid to do.
Take the fucking shot!
I can't!
(Whimpering)
Sayonara, buddy.
Ahhh!
(Knives clashing)
Get up!
(Coughing)
I said get up!
You want to tell me who you work for?
Man, I don't know!
You don't know?
(Speaking Spanish) I don't know!
What are you doing out here?
I don't know!
Who do you work for?
I don't know, man!
No!
Ugh, ugh!
Maybe you want to talk now?
No, man!
Nada?
No!
I think you've got answers.
No, I don't got-- what are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you-- no!
What are you doing?
No!
You've got 5 fingers.
You're going to give me some answers.
I don't know nothing!
No!
(Screaming)
Now you got 4 fingers!
I don't know!
(Screaming in Spanish)
Who do you work for?
No?
(Screaming)
You got 3 fingers left.
You want to tell me who you work for?
I don't know!
(Screaming)
Hunter!
Hunter?
What are you talking about?
The hunter!
(Choking)
Jackie!
Allen!
Where the hell are these guys?
Hey, hey!
(Screaming)
Brent!
Jesus Christ!
It was just right here.
Where?
Right here!
Where is it?
Where's the body?
Something came down and snatched it, man.
Like that!
(Snapping fingers)
What?
It was right here!
This ain't right.
That's a whole lot of blood.
Why would somebody take a body?
Not somebody, man.
Something!
What do you mean, something?
Something!
Okay, we're out of here.
To the chopper, now come on!
Let's go, move, move!
Guys!
Tyler, Christ!
(Struggling, moaning)
(Screaming)
What do you see?
I seen something, but it moved.
Good job, country boy.
(Screaming)
No!
(Gunshots)
Give me that AK.
Now!
(Gunshots)
Cease fire!
I said, cease fire!
What the hell are we shooting at?
I don't know, goddamn it!
Colby got hit!
We got to get to that chopper.
What about Colby, sir?
He's dead, all right?
He's gone!
Now, move!
Ah, look who joined us.
Where the fuck have you been?
Taking care of business.
Taking care of business?
What, you think you can just waltz around here by yourself?
You need to give me 6 feet, mother-fucker.
Oh, is that what you think?
TYLER:
All right, come on!
Hey, hey, hey!
Break it up, okay?
You want to kill each other, you can do it later.
Jackie, like to be alone?
Two clicks, recon, go!
Roger that, sir.
Bitch!
This is bullshit!
(Beeping)
(Whirring)
(Screeching)
Keep moving.
SENATOR ROGER'S:
You know, gentlemen, there's nothing, absolutely nothing more honourable, more pure, more selfless than to serve your country.
This is a covert program, gentlemen, and you know what that means.
The things that you will have to give up to enter this program are too numerous to count.
Let's just say that you'd be losing every inch of the life that you dreamed of.
(Children laughing)
Every thought and every person that you ever loved, every moment that you can remember.
From this second forward, that is all that you have.
No secret of this republic can leave this building.
Because of that, I must love my country... even when tough love is the order of the day.
Candidate number one, stand to your feet.
Unfortunately, your blood work was not satisfactory to the committee.
You're not qualified for the E16 programme.
It's also unfortunate that you're not a cabinet member.
(Gunshot) 0600h, candidate number one terminated.
Protocol 6A.
Candidate number two, stand to your feet.
You don't meet the physical requirements that this committee recommends for an ideal candidate for the E16 programme.
It seems as though that you contracted the herpes virus at one of your stops.
Hell, Grandma always told me to stay away from the whores.
I'm glad I listened to Grandma.
(Gunshot)
Stand up!
Turn around and face the wall.
(Sound of unlocking handcuffs)
Turn around.
Welcome to the program.
Candidate number three, you must realize that sometimes killing's also protecting life.
Even though you will be a ferocious killer, you will also be a life-saver.
You will receive a series of injections.
The first one is a chemical compound that will alter the somatosensory cortex--
Ugh!
Which is the pain centre of the brain.
That's the last pain sensation that you will feel.
This party is getting better and better every moment.
Give him the second shot.
This little cocktail is not your average one that you get at happy hour, son.
This will cause a deficiency in the brain chemical norepinephrine, which you need periodically to survive.
This will allow us to control your ass in case there's a glitch in the program, and you decide to get cute on us.
We're done here!
Take him to Wing 4, for surgery.
SENATOR:
Yes, I understand.
Execute the order to take out the team.
Order a collateral damage assessment of the area.
Give the execute order to our asset on the ground.
Evac him ASAP!
Get me satellite imagery of the area.
Find a way to clean up this mess.
Shit!
Alpha, bravo, six!
Do you read me?
(Static, indiscernible)
Alpha, bravo, six!
(Static)
Muerta!
This helicopter better be there!
What else do you know, chica, huh?
You know, it's your fault that all these men are dead!
You're the reason we're out here in this godforsaken jungle!
Jessie!
The way they played us for their own game?
That's enough, Jessie!
That's enough!
Whatever is out there, it's going to take all of us to kill it.
Whether Command responds or not, it doesn't matter!
We need to kill this thing, or it will kill us.
What are we fighting, boss?
When did you train for this?
When did you sign up for this, 'cause I sure as hell didn't!
You know he's right, sir.
Well, we don't have much of a choice now, do we?
Don't get paid enough!
That's enough, stand down, soldier!
That's an order.
You don't know anything else?
Sir, look, we need to play offence as well as defence here.
Okay, that's the only way we're going to make it out of here.
No, the only way we're going to make it out of here is to make it to the extraction point.
That's if there is an extraction.
They'll be here!
How are we supposed to trust her, sir?
We can't!
Brent's right.
We need to play offence against this bastard.
(Spitting)
It's getting late.
We'll make camp here.
We need to play offence against this bastard.
¶
So, now what?
Do what we do best.
We wait.
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Come on, mother-fucker!
Come on!
(Explosion)
Aie-aie-aie!
(Explosion)
Sir, that's just another terrorist.
Leg's going this way.
Yeah, and his head's going that way.
He didn't know which way he was going.
This guy was dead before the explosion.
They used his body to trip the mine.
He's playing us for a fool!
Yeah, I think I'm officially freaked out.
All right, reset the trap.
Are you serious?
Come on, let's get out of here!
Do I look like I'm joking?
This thing is hunting us.
Let me guess.
This is bullshit?
Bingo.
¶
You think you're going to be able to take me out that easy?
You got another think coming, puto.
Come on, lead me... through the valley of the shadow of death.
This is not a bad little rig you got here.
For a woman.
It's not a bad little rig you got there.
For a boy.
Yeah, well, whatever.
Yes?
You want to see this rig?
And God made Adam!
(Laughing)
You're missing out!
(Laughing)
Hey.
Hey.
Look, I'm sorry what I said about your team before.
Okay, they're good guys.
They're the best.
It started off as a beautiful day, huh?
Yeah.
When I was stationed in Iraq, the colonel used to say all the time it was a beautiful day to die.
Odd how that somehow sounds romantic.
So, what was the worst you'd ever been in?
I was in a chopper, shot down over Somalia.
We were ambushed, kidnapped, and I was the only one who survived.
You must be blessed.
(Laughing)
Yeah, or maybe I'm cursed.
Look, I didn't want to scare the team before.
The area was the testing ground for the E16.
Okay, I'm listening.
What's the E16?
It's a covert project to create the perfect cyborg soldier.
I'm talking half-man, half-computer.
This thing can withstand temperatures and terrains that no human can, equipped with weapons straight out of a comic book.
They were injecting this thing with human brain cells, which ended up morphing and multiplying into an intelligence level we would never understand.
Now, they've lost control of it.
Complete!
So, tell me one thing.
Why's it taking human brains?
I have no idea.
Half-man, half-machine, huh?
Mmm.
Well, then I guess it is a beautiful day to die.
(Explosion)
(Gunfire)
Move, move!
(Shouting in Spanish)
Jessie!
Ugh!
(Gunshots)
(Groaning)
Jessie!
All right, where'd it go?
Where'd it go?
I think I shot it!
Oh!
Let's get to that chopper, come on.
Where's everybody else?
They're dead.
This is--
Argh!
(Gunshots)
Go, go, go!
Get out of here!
(Gunfire, screaming)
You bastard!
(Screeching)
(Gunshots)
I ain't impressed!
You can't kill me, mother-fucker!
I'm from Philly!
Bitch!
Show time.
Come on, you bastard.
Come and get me, come and get me.
(Explosion)
There we go.
Ha, ha, got you!
How's it feel, buddy?
(Gunshot)
(Gunfire)
Oh, yeah, you're hurting now, aren't you, buddy?
You're hurting now.
What the hell?
Ugh!
(Gunshots)
Argh!
(Crashing)
It's never easy!
(Gunshots)
Man!
(Explosion)
(Explosion)
¶
CASSANDRA:
Tyler!
Tyler!
Hang in there, soldier.
¶
SENATOR:
Destroyed?
Okay, send out a search team and look for survivors.
Destroy all the information, and design a deniability story.
You know, when I was a young boy,
I would have dreams and fantasies of being there the day that Thomas Jefferson signed the Declaration of Independence, or Francis Scott Key, the night that he penned the Star-Spangled Banner.
This is the greatest nation in the history of civilization.
No secret this republic can leave this building.
Because of that, I must love my country... even when tough love is the order of the day.
My only comfort is knowing right now, this second, that I did what was best for the country that I call my own.
Gentlemen, from this second forward, that is all that I have.
(Gunshot)
Great work, soldier.
I'm going to put you in for a medal for this.
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry, son.
That's the way it is.
I mean, that's protocol in these types of operations.
Now, you do understand that, don't you?
And again, you did an amazing job.
You know something, Colonel.
I never did like cigars.
Oh!
Jessie was right.
This is bullshit.
Hey!
Hey.
So, what's next, Lieutenant?
I'm going to go... meet the families of my team.
And tell them the truth.
You know, I was wrong about you.
Thank you for coming back out there to get me.
You saved my life.
Anytime.
Take care.
Tyler!
¶
See you around.
¶
You know, there is a strange beauty to the landscape out here.
How long do we have to be here?
I don't know.
Ask the Einsteins back there.
SCIENTIST:
I can't seem to find the problem.
We've searched all the codecs.
Everything seems to be working perfectly.
Well, you're wrong, or we wouldn't even be here!
So, there is a problem!
We have to find it.
Try the beacon system again.
I've tried, and--
Well, try it again!
An entire world full of geniuses and scientists, and this is what they send us?
(Beeping)
(Splashing in lake)
What is that?
Oh, my God, it must be close.
Yeah, real close!
(Beeping)
Shit!
(Gunfire, panicked shouting)
¶
The colonel's been expecting you.
So glad you could make it.
He'd like to speak to you alone.
Wait here, gentlemen.
¶
You should see this, sir.
Hold that, please.
Could you take that and give me a minute, please?
Yes, sir.
(Phone ringing)
Alpha 4, I need hourly updates on what's going on there.
Priority number one!
Under no circumstances do you compromise our position.
Black-curtain all transmissions, and keep recon away from the team.
You understand me?
Good!
Stacy!
Sir?
This is going to take more time than I thought.
Push my lunch back to 2, and get me all the information you can on the team that the general put on the ground, and anything else pertaining to the project.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Colonel?
Have a seat.
Thank you, sir.
One of the last fine pleasures in life, son.
A good cigar.
Now, a good piece of ass is the only thing it'll top.
We seem to think alike.
Couldn't agree with you more, sir.
You, uh--
(Clearing throat)
You know I wouldn't have called you back after what happened.
But my orders come straight from the Secretary of Defence, and he said he wanted my very best man.
My ass is on the line on this one, son.
That pencil-pushing prick'll have my nuts for lunch if I screw this one up.
You've always been good to me, sir.
If you call, you know that I'll be here.
You think you've bounced back already?
You never really bounce back from war, sir.
All you can do is learn to live with the new person that you see in the mirror.
Amen, brother.
I was in the middle of some nice, huge fucking tetas, and I got to put up with this bullshit!
Hey, how you been, pussy-boy?
Quit messing around!
Whoa!
Hey, why don't you watch where you're going, meat-head?
Hey, Romeo!
Remember what happened last time!
Remember what happened last time.
Come on, man, Jesus Christ.
Don't you got enough illegitimate children, mother-fucker?
We've got 2 scientists and 5 soldiers that have gone missing from a training facility that never existed, if you understand what I'm saying.
Yes, sir.
We've lost contact with them.
Now, intelligence says that there's a terrorist training camp nearby.
Bottom line?
I want you to go and find them, and bring them back.
What were they testing?
Son, would I be in a shithole like this if I was privileged with that kind of information?
Hell, I don't care what they were testing, and you shouldn't either.
Well, why don't they just send in the regular special ops?
Like I said, this place never existed.
Yes, sir.
Hey, what are you guys going to do with this money anyway?
If you did it for the money, you would have quit after Syria.
I tell you what--
Damn right, mother-fucker.
Tequila, Mexico and hos!
Ain't nothing wrong with D.J. and tequila, boy!
Who's the bag boy in this mother-fucker?
Hey, bag boy!
Bag boy!
TYLER:
What's the take?
$150,000 for each of you.
That is, if you get a gold star on the top of your book report.
Special ops.
Black ops straight from Congress, baby.
Don't you love it?
Appropriated for covert operations.
God bless America, sir.
(Laughing)
There'll be a briefing report under each one of your pillows.
I'm going to have you and your team bunk in A-wing barracks.
Now, the airboat'll pull out at 0600h to take you to the chopper.
There'll be a chopper at the extraction point exactly--
Exactly, 24 hours after your feet touch the ground.
If you're not there, you better like your surroundings 'cause that's going to be home sweet home, son.
We get any contact with reinforcements?
Do I look like the Tooth Fairy, son?
Stick your hand under that pillow, you ain't going to find nothing there.
You're on your own.
Yeah, well, figures.
All right, dismissed, soldier.
Thank you, sir.
Good luck.
Oh, Tyler!
Hmm?
What if you can't deal with this new person you see in the mirror?
Well then, sir, I'll just get myself a nice piece of ass and a good cigar.
I don't feel sorry for myself 'cause no one else gives a shit.
(Phone ringing)
Yes?
The order's already sent!
All right, send in an asset to be our eyes on the ground.
Gather intel from the local operatives, and brief us on the situation on the ground.
I know, sir.
Yes, you can count on me to make the right decision.
Yes, we're sending our best, sir.
Dragon Den's a go.
They're sending the information now.
We should be getting information in an hour.
Call my wife, and tell her it's going to be a long day.
I have a bad feeling.
The government don't even regulate these things like they should.
That must be why your wife left you, huh?
Pepe!
Let me tell you something.
I took half a Viagra once, and I was like He-Man!
You mother-fuckers should have seen me!
All right, boys, we all loaded up?
Yes, sir!
Good morning, Lieutenant.
Is it?
Every day above ground is a good day, sir.
Well, speak for yourself!
Sir, uh, it's Colonel's orders.
I'm going to need everyone's dog tags.
Come again?
What?
Why in a rat's ass we got to give back our dog tags, huh?
Huh?
I want my mama to have me sitting pretty, you hear me, boy?
Sitting pretty in a shiny black casket back in Knoxville.
Y'all ain't fixing to bury me out here in Puerto Rico.
I'll tell you that much.
It's not Puerto Rico;
that's in the Caribbean.
Whatever the hell it is!
It's just all Taco Bell city to me, boy!
You hear me?
Look here, boss.
I don't care what happens to me out there, but I got to get home.
I can't be cheated out of my 21 gun salute.
I gave up too much already.
Talk to the Colonel, make sure that happens, right?
You have my word, sir!
Dog tags, everybody!
Colonel's orders!
Aw, come on, sir!
This is bullshit!
This is bullshit!
Just do it, get them out, come on!
Say sayonara to those of us who never existed.
Try not to get a rash kissing all that ass!
Fucking bureaucrat!
Good morning, Lieutenant!
Cassandra Mason, CIA.
Congratulations.
So, where would you like me to sit?
(Laughing)
Um, sorry, but there's no women, not on this field trip.
Oh, come on, Lieutenant!
What, the girls can't play with the boys?
What, you're serious?
Guys, I got to go speak to the Colonel.
Sir.
Yes, sir!
To the Colonel?
Come on, this is way above his head.
Now, I'm getting on that boat, and if I were you,
I wouldn't waste my time trying to stop me.
Whoa, whoa!
And why would we need you?
I know you find this a little hard to believe, but this isn't my first field trip.
I know the area better than anyone.
So, once again, where would you like me to sit, Lieutenant?
You slow us down;
we'll leave you behind.
That's a promise.
That's what I'm talking about, bonita!
She wants to be all she can be!
Ahhh, my God!
Choice between bad and worse.
Well, if these guys can't fix it, hell, nobody can!
(Helicopter buzzing)
¶
TYLER:
Move out!
Boss!
You bet your sweet bippy, these boys:
They died a painful death.
What do you got?
Sir, the skull seems to have been pierced with some sort of drill.
The inside contents within the cranial wall, they've been sucked out.
The White House is worried about water-boarding.
Oh, ain't no tellin' what we just walked into.
I'll tell you one thing, this wasn't done by a Latino.
Whoa, whoa!
Where do you think you're going?
Get your hands off me!
I've got a job to do, just like you do!
Really?
And what is that job?
I'll tell you exactly--
No, let me tell you something, Little Miss Sunshine!
You're not going to come here and screw up my operation.
You know, I don't give a crap what government bureaucrat sent you down here, but now that you are down here, you're under my command, you understand that?
I--
Just nod your head, yes, or I will leave your ass behind.
Boss, these are some real killers.
This definitely ain't no rag-tag terrorist trainees.
Something a lot more serious.
Boss, I think you need to come see this.
This here's some serious fucking weaponry.
Ain't no AK-47 that'll do that to a man.
Son of a bitches are getting help from somewhere.
As sure as a chicken'll eat his own shit, you can count on that, bub.
Excuse me.
If you're withholding intel from me, you're going to regret the day you were born.
Jackie, search the boat, search for bodies.
Find me something.
Jessie, you got perimeter.
See if there's any more casualties out here.
Yes, sir!
Jack, when you're done, torch the boat.
My pleasure, sir.
(Kissing sounds)
Hey!
Oh, damn!
I just lost my appetite.
Must have been one hell of a fight.
(Flies buzzing)
Boss, there's a whole lot of shells.
They must have let off at least 1000 rounds.
Lot of shells, but I don't see any bodies of the bad guys.
What's up with that?
Boss, I ain't got an answer for you.
I mean, I ain't never seen nothing like this before.
Now, you know I ain't one for quitting, but I mean, they sent us out in a trap.
A death trap, look at this!
This is some stuff you only see on TV.
Hey, honey, you get scared?
You can always grab onto Papa.
Two tours in Baghdad, a year with the U.N. peacekeepers in Sudan.
I'm not scared of this crap!
(Laughing)
What a hardcore woman.
What a turn-on!
Hey, I think she likes me, boss!
All right, guys, come on.
Let's pick up the track.
Let's find these assholes.
Yes, sir.
Move.
Damn!
More flies than my ex.
Damn it!
(Gunshots)
Take him out.
(Gunshot)
Go, go, go.
All right, Colby, you stay on point.
Yes, sir.
Everybody else, tight formation, double time, okay?
Whoa, whoa!
What about me?
What about you?
I'm not staying here!
Yeah, you are.
If any of these assholes come running this way, it's probably in your best interest to shoot 'em, okay?
Excuse me.
Jackie, Jessie, left side!
Colby, you're with me.
Rest of you, to the right!
Go, go, go!
Go, go!
(Gunshots)
(Rapid gunfire)
Ugh!
Ahhh!
Get my back, move!
(Gunfire)
Ugh!
(Punching, grunting sounds)
(Splashing)
(Gunshot)
Shit.
Ugh!
Ahh!
All right, let's see what they got, gentlemen.
Boss!
Boss, you got to see this.
Son of a bitch!
It's a request for more weapons from the Department of Defence.
Sir, this is a U.S. Army training manual.
What?
These weapons are U.S. military-issue.
This is bullshit, sir!
Sir, is this bullshit?
It's most definitely bullshit.
We're training these assholes to fight against us!
Jesus!
I thought we told you to stay your ass up there!
I got bored.
(Gunshots)
Get down!
(Screaming)
(Explosion)
(Screaming)
Clear!
Clear!
Clear!
Explain to me why the government sent us down here.
This was a search-and-destroy mission, wasn't it?
Listen, you Jughead grunt, your job is to shoot that gun and not ask any questions.
So, follow your orders and keep your mouth shut!
How dare you bastards send my men into a deathtrap!
You knew damn well that those scientists were dead!
You sent us here so we could clean up your mess!
You've earned your gold star, Lieutenant.
Jackie, torch this place.
Colby?
(Explosion)
Tyler!
Hey, right now, my focus is to make sure my men get out of here alive, but I got a lot of questions for you, lady.
Hey, did you ever think that sometimes there's questions you really don't want to know the answers to?
Not when it concerns my men.
Fuck your men!
The interest of the United States government comes first!
And sometimes, you got to lose one to save a thousand.
Next time you want someone to clean up your dirt, you bring in your own operatives.
We are not your puppets.
You are whatever the United States government says you are!
And so am I!
Get your hands off of me.
Gentlemen, double time!
Colby's got point.
You are whatever the United States government says you are, and so am I!
Jessie.
Keep an eye on her ass.
If she tries to run away, shoot her.
All right, men, let's move out.
Don't worry, mamacita.
I'll keep an eye on your ass.
What have you got, soldier?
Something's out there.
Where am I looking?
I'm not sure, sir.
False alarm, I guess.
At ease, guys.
Let's take a break.
Cigarette?
It's a disgusting habit.
How about you?
Sure, man, yeah.
Hey, Colby, don't be such a pussy your whole life, huh?
Shut up!
Hey, what do you think about that señorita over there, huh?
I haven't worked with a dame since I was a grunt.
Ain't a grunt no more?
She's some under-wraps scam.
Going to weaken our forces.
Can't trust no female!
It's that whole emotional thing.
It's their time of the month, they go postal.
Heh!
Hey, puto, let me get a swig of that!
Give me a cigarette.
The bar I was telling you about back home?
Pussy everywhere.
Why don't you come down when we get back?
Who do you think you're fooling?
You wouldn't know what to do with a piece of ass if it landed in your lap.
(Laughing)
Bullshit!
Hey, I thought you were gay.
That's what I thought, bro.
Hey, don't ask, don't tell, all right?
(Laughing)
That was a sheep, man.
Don't make me gay.
No, just real strange.
Quite a motley group of guys you got there.
Those are real men.
Of course, you've never met one of those with all those pussies you work with in Washington.
Hmm, I believe I've never actually met a real man, ever.
(Laughing)
Oh, yeah.
Hey, what are you guys sipping on?
Want daytime or night, sir?
Both.
Here you go, Sarge.
Got you covered.
This one's tequila.
This one on the right.
You want this one.
You want that one first.
¶
(Blowing)
What are you doing?
Nothing.
What was that?
I said nothing!
(Cracking neck)
I'm sick of your shit.
Ugh!
(Gunshot)
You just saved your life.
(Gunshots)
Whoo!
Whoo, that's right!
Yeah!
(Screaming)
Where you going, mother-fucker?
Where you going?
(Gunshot)
(Laughing)
Ugh!
Ahh!
(Groaning)
What exactly are we looking for?
No idea.
As long as the cheque clears, makes no difference to me.
Hey, you still suffering from that post-traumatic stress disorder?
Maybe.
Want to talk about it?
Not really.
You can talk to me, man!
I'm like Dr. Phil!
My counsellor said I got good ears.
I can listen.
You got medication?
Yeah.
Can I have some?
Yeah, it's back at the base.
I'll get you one.
Whatever keeps you quiet, man.
Hey, let me get a lighter, let me get a lighter.
Do you people ever stop talking?
Whoa!
You may want to close your eyes.
He's dead.
This guy never got a shot off.
No, he didn't.
Look, see that?
It's a high-powered rifle.
We got company out here.
Looks like he was carrying supplies.
There's more of them.
Get back to the team, let's go.
(Whistling "Pop Goes the Weasel")
(Sniffing)
Oh!
Cassandra, hey!
(Hyperventilating)
Jesus Christ, this guy's brains are missing.
Diablo!
They sure ain't playing, boss.
He's dead.
What's wrong with you?
Talk to me, what happened here?
He-- it--
Where's Jackie?
Where'd he go?
He, uh--
Let's get you out of here, come on.
Let's move out, men.
What is that?
(Speaking Spanish)
¶
What's going on?
I'll tell you one thing.
We're not fighting a terrorist.
Boss, I've seen some things in my days, but that-- that, I don't know what that is!
She knows something!
Okay, all right, all right, back off!
Cassandra, talk to me.
I saw it!
Saw what?
I saw it.
It's not like anything I've ever seen before.
We should just kill her.
She's in on it!
She's in on it!
She's a fucking liar!
This is bullshit!
Can't trust a woman, sir.
Listen, stop!
Just stop!
All right, fine.
They told me that there was something out here.
Other than that-- Jesus Christ!
No, other than that, I don't know!
(Men all shouting)
All right, all right!
No, no, no, wait, wait!
Go, all right?
Go do something.
Go.
Sir.
Go!
The hell with this.
Something out here?
That's all I know.
That's just great.
Hey, where the hell are you going?
Enough!
I'm done, I quit!
She's crazy!
Well, how about you give me a cigarette before you catch a Greyhound out of here?
Man, I got to stop smoking these things.
Used to be able to punish the booty two hours straight.
Now, I can't even go 20 minutes.
Maybe that's why your girl's always creeping over to my place.
Your place?
Yeah.
Hey, let me tell you something.
I'm world-renowned for my baby-making skills.
I'm like the Puerto Rican baby-making machine!
I'm like the U.N. in this bitch!
God sent me here for two things.
That's making babies, and saving the fucking day.
You need to get your head checked!
Oh, I need to get my head checked?
Yes!
The last time I checked, you had post-partum depression.
Do you have any idea what you're talking about?
Oh, I know what I'm talking about.
I've been to a seminar once.
We sat around, we talked, played Yenga.
Don't you mean Jenga?
Yeah, and we hugged.
Want to hug?
You can't keep this stuff bottled up inside, man!
Head'll get all cloudy.
Liable to hurt somebody.
What do you think we're out here to do in the first place?
(Twig snapping)
Shh!
Take the shot, soldier.
What are you waiting for?
Take the shot!
I can't.
That's what we get paid to do.
Take the fucking shot!
I can't!
(Whimpering)
Sayonara, buddy.
Ahhh!
(Knives clashing)
Get up!
(Coughing)
I said get up!
You want to tell me who you work for?
Man, I don't know!
You don't know?
(Speaking Spanish) I don't know!
What are you doing out here?
I don't know!
Who do you work for?
I don't know, man!
No!
Ugh, ugh!
Maybe you want to talk now?
No, man!
Nada?
No!
I think you've got answers.
No, I don't got-- what are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you-- no!
What are you doing?
No!
You've got 5 fingers.
You're going to give me some answers.
I don't know nothing!
No!
(Screaming)
Now you got 4 fingers!
I don't know!
(Screaming in Spanish)
Who do you work for?
No?
(Screaming)
You got 3 fingers left.
You want to tell me who you work for?
I don't know!
(Screaming)
Hunter!
Hunter?
What are you talking about?
The hunter!
(Choking)
Jackie!
Allen!
Where the hell are these guys?
Hey, hey!
(Screaming)
Brent!
Jesus Christ!
It was just right here.
Where?
Right here!
Where is it?
Where's the body?
Something came down and snatched it, man.
Like that!
(Snapping fingers)
What?
It was right here!
This ain't right.
That's a whole lot of blood.
Why would somebody take a body?
Not somebody, man.
Something!
What do you mean, something?
Something!
Okay, we're out of here.
To the chopper, now come on!
Let's go, move, move!
Guys!
Tyler, Christ!
(Struggling, moaning)
(Screaming)
What do you see?
I seen something, but it moved.
Good job, country boy.
(Screaming)
No!
(Gunshots)
Give me that AK.
Now!
(Gunshots)
Cease fire!
I said, cease fire!
What the hell are we shooting at?
I don't know, goddamn it!
Colby got hit!
We got to get to that chopper.
What about Colby, sir?
He's dead, all right?
He's gone!
Now, move!
Ah, look who joined us.
Where the fuck have you been?
Taking care of business.
Taking care of business?
What, you think you can just waltz around here by yourself?
You need to give me 6 feet, mother-fucker.
Oh, is that what you think?
TYLER:
All right, come on!
Hey, hey, hey!
Break it up, okay?
You want to kill each other, you can do it later.
Jackie, like to be alone?
Two clicks, recon, go!
Roger that, sir.
Bitch!
This is bullshit!
(Beeping)
(Whirring)
(Screeching)
Keep moving.
SENATOR ROGER'S:
You know, gentlemen, there's nothing, absolutely nothing more honourable, more pure, more selfless than to serve your country.
This is a covert program, gentlemen, and you know what that means.
The things that you will have to give up to enter this program are too numerous to count.
Let's just say that you'd be losing every inch of the life that you dreamed of.
(Children laughing)
Every thought and every person that you ever loved, every moment that you can remember.
From this second forward, that is all that you have.
No secret of this republic can leave this building.
Because of that, I must love my country... even when tough love is the order of the day.
Candidate number one, stand to your feet.
Unfortunately, your blood work was not satisfactory to the committee.
You're not qualified for the E16 programme.
It's also unfortunate that you're not a cabinet member.
(Gunshot) 0600h, candidate number one terminated.
Protocol 6A.
Candidate number two, stand to your feet.
You don't meet the physical requirements that this committee recommends for an ideal candidate for the E16 programme.
It seems as though that you contracted the herpes virus at one of your stops.
Hell, Grandma always told me to stay away from the whores.
I'm glad I listened to Grandma.
(Gunshot)
Stand up!
Turn around and face the wall.
(Sound of unlocking handcuffs)
Turn around.
Welcome to the program.
Candidate number three, you must realize that sometimes killing's also protecting life.
Even though you will be a ferocious killer, you will also be a life-saver.
You will receive a series of injections.
The first one is a chemical compound that will alter the somatosensory cortex--
Ugh!
Which is the pain centre of the brain.
That's the last pain sensation that you will feel.
This party is getting better and better every moment.
Give him the second shot.
This little cocktail is not your average one that you get at happy hour, son.
This will cause a deficiency in the brain chemical norepinephrine, which you need periodically to survive.
This will allow us to control your ass in case there's a glitch in the program, and you decide to get cute on us.
We're done here!
Take him to Wing 4, for surgery.
SENATOR:
Yes, I understand.
Execute the order to take out the team.
Order a collateral damage assessment of the area.
Give the execute order to our asset on the ground.
Evac him ASAP!
Get me satellite imagery of the area.
Find a way to clean up this mess.
Shit!
Alpha, bravo, six!
Do you read me?
(Static, indiscernible)
Alpha, bravo, six!
(Static)
Muerta!
This helicopter better be there!
What else do you know, chica, huh?
You know, it's your fault that all these men are dead!
You're the reason we're out here in this godforsaken jungle!
Jessie!
The way they played us for their own game?
That's enough, Jessie!
That's enough!
Whatever is out there, it's going to take all of us to kill it.
Whether Command responds or not, it doesn't matter!
We need to kill this thing, or it will kill us.
What are we fighting, boss?
When did you train for this?
When did you sign up for this, 'cause I sure as hell didn't!
You know he's right, sir.
Well, we don't have much of a choice now, do we?
Don't get paid enough!
That's enough, stand down, soldier!
That's an order.
You don't know anything else?
Sir, look, we need to play offence as well as defence here.
Okay, that's the only way we're going to make it out of here.
No, the only way we're going to make it out of here is to make it to the extraction point.
That's if there is an extraction.
They'll be here!
How are we supposed to trust her, sir?
We can't!
Brent's right.
We need to play offence against this bastard.
(Spitting)
It's getting late.
We'll make camp here.
We need to play offence against this bastard.
¶
So, now what?
Do what we do best.
We wait.
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Come on, mother-fucker!
Come on!
(Explosion)
Aie-aie-aie!
(Explosion)
Sir, that's just another terrorist.
Leg's going this way.
Yeah, and his head's going that way.
He didn't know which way he was going.
This guy was dead before the explosion.
They used his body to trip the mine.
He's playing us for a fool!
Yeah, I think I'm officially freaked out.
All right, reset the trap.
Are you serious?
Come on, let's get out of here!
Do I look like I'm joking?
This thing is hunting us.
Let me guess.
This is bullshit?
Bingo.
¶
You think you're going to be able to take me out that easy?
You got another think coming, puto.
Come on, lead me... through the valley of the shadow of death.
This is not a bad little rig you got here.
For a woman.
It's not a bad little rig you got there.
For a boy.
Yeah, well, whatever.
Yes?
You want to see this rig?
And God made Adam!
(Laughing)
You're missing out!
(Laughing)
Hey.
Hey.
Look, I'm sorry what I said about your team before.
Okay, they're good guys.
They're the best.
It started off as a beautiful day, huh?
Yeah.
When I was stationed in Iraq, the colonel used to say all the time it was a beautiful day to die.
Odd how that somehow sounds romantic.
So, what was the worst you'd ever been in?
I was in a chopper, shot down over Somalia.
We were ambushed, kidnapped, and I was the only one who survived.
You must be blessed.
(Laughing)
Yeah, or maybe I'm cursed.
Look, I didn't want to scare the team before.
The area was the testing ground for the E16.
Okay, I'm listening.
What's the E16?
It's a covert project to create the perfect cyborg soldier.
I'm talking half-man, half-computer.
This thing can withstand temperatures and terrains that no human can, equipped with weapons straight out of a comic book.
They were injecting this thing with human brain cells, which ended up morphing and multiplying into an intelligence level we would never understand.
Now, they've lost control of it.
Complete!
So, tell me one thing.
Why's it taking human brains?
I have no idea.
Half-man, half-machine, huh?
Mmm.
Well, then I guess it is a beautiful day to die.
(Explosion)
(Gunfire)
Move, move!
(Shouting in Spanish)
Jessie!
Ugh!
(Gunshots)
(Groaning)
Jessie!
All right, where'd it go?
Where'd it go?
I think I shot it!
Oh!
Let's get to that chopper, come on.
Where's everybody else?
They're dead.
This is--
Argh!
(Gunshots)
Go, go, go!
Get out of here!
(Gunfire, screaming)
You bastard!
(Screeching)
(Gunshots)
I ain't impressed!
You can't kill me, mother-fucker!
I'm from Philly!
Bitch!
Show time.
Come on, you bastard.
Come and get me, come and get me.
(Explosion)
There we go.
Ha, ha, got you!
How's it feel, buddy?
(Gunshot)
(Gunfire)
Oh, yeah, you're hurting now, aren't you, buddy?
You're hurting now.
What the hell?
Ugh!
(Gunshots)
Argh!
(Crashing)
It's never easy!
(Gunshots)
Man!
(Explosion)
(Explosion)
¶
CASSANDRA:
Tyler!
Tyler!
Hang in there, soldier.
¶
SENATOR:
Destroyed?
Okay, send out a search team and look for survivors.
Destroy all the information, and design a deniability story.
You know, when I was a young boy,
I would have dreams and fantasies of being there the day that Thomas Jefferson signed the Declaration of Independence, or Francis Scott Key, the night that he penned the Star-Spangled Banner.
This is the greatest nation in the history of civilization.
No secret this republic can leave this building.
Because of that, I must love my country... even when tough love is the order of the day.
My only comfort is knowing right now, this second, that I did what was best for the country that I call my own.
Gentlemen, from this second forward, that is all that I have.
(Gunshot)
Great work, soldier.
I'm going to put you in for a medal for this.
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry, son.
That's the way it is.
I mean, that's protocol in these types of operations.
Now, you do understand that, don't you?
And again, you did an amazing job.
You know something, Colonel.
I never did like cigars.
Oh!
Jessie was right.
This is bullshit.
Hey!
Hey.
So, what's next, Lieutenant?
I'm going to go... meet the families of my team.
And tell them the truth.
You know, I was wrong about you.
Thank you for coming back out there to get me.
You saved my life.
Anytime.
Take care.
Tyler!
¶
See you around.
¶
You know, there is a strange beauty to the landscape out here.
How long do we have to be here?
I don't know.
Ask the Einsteins back there.
I can't seem to find the problem.
We've searched all the codecs.
Everything seems to be working perfectly.
Well, you're wrong, or we wouldn't even be here!
So, there is a problem!
We have to find it.
Try the beacon system again.
I've tried, and--
Well, try it again!
An entire world full of geniuses and scientists, and this is what they send us?
What is that?
Oh, my God, it must be close.
Yeah, real close!
Shit!
¶
The colonel's been expecting you.
So glad you could make it.
He'd like to speak to you alone.
Wait here, gentlemen.
¶
You should see this, sir.
Hold that, please.
Could you take that and give me a minute, please?
Yes, sir.
Alpha 4, I need hourly updates on what's going on there.
Priority number one!
Under no circumstances do you compromise our position.
Black-curtain all transmissions, and keep recon away from the team.
You understand me?
Good!
Stacy!
Sir?
This is going to take more time than I thought.
Push my lunch back to 2, and get me all the information you can on the team that the general put on the ground, and anything else pertaining to the project.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Colonel?
Have a seat.
Thank you, sir.
One of the last fine pleasures in life, son.
A good cigar.
Now, a good piece of ass is the only thing it'll top.
We seem to think alike.
Couldn't agree with you more, sir.
You, uh--
You know I wouldn't have called you back after what happened.
But my orders come straight from the Secretary of Defence, and he said he wanted my very best man.
My ass is on the line on this one, son.
That pencil-pushing prick'll have my nuts for lunch if I screw this one up.
You've always been good to me, sir.
If you call, you know that I'll be here.
You think you've bounced back already?
You never really bounce back from war, sir.
All you can do is learn to live with the new person that you see in the mirror.
Amen, brother.
I was in the middle of some nice, huge fucking tetas, and I got to put up with this bullshit!
Hey, how you been, pussy-boy?
Quit messing around!
Whoa!
Hey, why don't you watch where you're going, meat-head?
Hey, Romeo!
Remember what happened last time!
Remember what happened last time.
Come on, man, Jesus Christ.
Don't you got enough illegitimate children, mother-fucker?
We've got 2 scientists and 5 soldiers that have gone missing from a training facility that never existed, if you understand what I'm saying.
Yes, sir.
We've lost contact with them.
Now, intelligence says that there's a terrorist training camp nearby.
Bottom line?
I want you to go and find them, and bring them back.
What were they testing?
Son, would I be in a shithole like this if I was privileged with that kind of information?
Hell, I don't care what they were testing, and you shouldn't either.
Well, why don't they just send in the regular special ops?
Like I said, this place never existed.
Yes, sir.
Hey, what are you guys going to do with this money anyway?
If you did it for the money, you would have quit after Syria.
I tell you what--
Damn right, mother-fucker.
Tequila, Mexico and hos!
Ain't nothing wrong with D.J. and tequila, boy!
Who's the bag boy in this mother-fucker?
Hey, bag boy!
Bag boy!
What's the take?
$150,000 for each of you.
That is, if you get a gold star on the top of your book report.
Special ops.
Black ops straight from Congress, baby.
Don't you love it?
Appropriated for covert operations.
God bless America, sir.
There'll be a briefing report under each one of your pillows.
I'm going to have you and your team bunk in A-wing barracks.
Now, the airboat'll pull out at 0600h to take you to the chopper.
There'll be a chopper at the extraction point exactly--
Exactly, 24 hours after your feet touch the ground.
If you're not there, you better like your surroundings 'cause that's going to be home sweet home, son.
We get any contact with reinforcements?
Do I look like the Tooth Fairy, son?
Stick your hand under that pillow, you ain't going to find nothing there.
You're on your own.
Yeah, well, figures.
All right, dismissed, soldier.
Thank you, sir.
Good luck.
Oh, Tyler!
Hmm?
What if you can't deal with this new person you see in the mirror?
Well then, sir, I'll just get myself a nice piece of ass and a good cigar.
I don't feel sorry for myself 'cause no one else gives a shit.
Yes?
The order's already sent!
All right, send in an asset to be our eyes on the ground.
Gather intel from the local operatives, and brief us on the situation on the ground.
I know, sir.
Yes, you can count on me to make the right decision.
Yes, we're sending our best, sir.
Dragon Den's a go.
They're sending the information now.
We should be getting information in an hour.
Call my wife, and tell her it's going to be a long day.
I have a bad feeling.
The government don't even regulate these things like they should.
That must be why your wife left you, huh?
Pepe!
Let me tell you something.
I took half a Viagra once, and I was like He-Man!
You mother-fuckers should have seen me!
All right, boys, we all loaded up?
Yes, sir!
Good morning, Lieutenant.
Is it?
Every day above ground is a good day, sir.
Well, speak for yourself!
Sir, uh, it's Colonel's orders.
I'm going to need everyone's dog tags.
Come again?
What?
Why in a rat's ass we got to give back our dog tags, huh?
Huh?
I want my mama to have me sitting pretty, you hear me, boy?
Sitting pretty in a shiny black casket back in Knoxville.
Y'all ain't fixing to bury me out here in Puerto Rico.
I'll tell you that much.
It's not Puerto Rico;
that's in the Caribbean.
Whatever the hell it is!
It's just all Taco Bell city to me, boy!
You hear me?
Look here, boss.
I don't care what happens to me out there, but I got to get home.
I can't be cheated out of my 21 gun salute.
I gave up too much already.
Talk to the Colonel, make sure that happens, right?
You have my word, sir!
Dog tags, everybody!
Colonel's orders!
Aw, come on, sir!
This is bullshit!
This is bullshit!
Just do it, get them out, come on!
Say sayonara to those of us who never existed.
Try not to get a rash kissing all that ass!
Fucking bureaucrat!
Good morning, Lieutenant!
Cassandra Mason, CIA.
Congratulations.
So, where would you like me to sit?
Um, sorry, but there's no women, not on this field trip.
Oh, come on, Lieutenant!
What, the girls can't play with the boys?
What, you're serious?
Guys, I got to go speak to the Colonel.
Sir.
Yes, sir!
To the Colonel?
Come on, this is way above his head.
Now, I'm getting on that boat, and if I were you,
I wouldn't waste my time trying to stop me.
Whoa, whoa!
And why would we need you?
I know you find this a little hard to believe, but this isn't my first field trip.
I know the area better than anyone.
So, once again, where would you like me to sit, Lieutenant?
You slow us down;
we'll leave you behind.
That's a promise.
That's what I'm talking about, bonita!
She wants to be all she can be!
Ahhh, my God!
Choice between bad and worse.
Well, if these guys can't fix it, hell, nobody can!
¶
Move out!
Boss!
You bet your sweet bippy, these boys:
They died a painful death.
What do you got?
Sir, the skull seems to have been pierced with some sort of drill.
The inside contents within the cranial wall, they've been sucked out.
The White House is worried about water-boarding.
Oh, ain't no tellin' what we just walked into.
I'll tell you one thing, this wasn't done by a Latino.
Whoa, whoa!
Where do you think you're going?
Get your hands off me!
I've got a job to do, just like you do!
Really?
And what is that job?
I'll tell you exactly--
No, let me tell you something, Little Miss Sunshine!
You're not going to come here and screw up my operation.
You know, I don't give a crap what government bureaucrat sent you down here, but now that you are down here, you're under my command, you understand that?
I--
Just nod your head, yes, or I will leave your ass behind.
Boss, these are some real killers.
This definitely ain't no rag-tag terrorist trainees.
Something a lot more serious.
Boss, I think you need to come see this.
This here's some serious fucking weaponry.
Ain't no AK-47 that'll do that to a man.
Son of a bitches are getting help from somewhere.
As sure as a chicken'll eat his own shit, you can count on that, bub.
Excuse me.
If you're withholding intel from me, you're going to regret the day you were born.
Jackie, search the boat, search for bodies.
Find me something.
Jessie, you got perimeter.
See if there's any more casualties out here.
Yes, sir!
Jack, when you're done, torch the boat.
My pleasure, sir.
Hey!
Oh, damn!
I just lost my appetite.
Must have been one hell of a fight.
Boss, there's a whole lot of shells.
They must have let off at least 1000 rounds.
Lot of shells, but I don't see any bodies of the bad guys.
What's up with that?
Boss, I ain't got an answer for you.
I mean, I ain't never seen nothing like this before.
Now, you know I ain't one for quitting, but I mean, they sent us out in a trap.
A death trap, look at this!
This is some stuff you only see on TV.
Hey, honey, you get scared?
You can always grab onto Papa.
Two tours in Baghdad, a year with the U.N. peacekeepers in Sudan.
I'm not scared of this crap!
What a hardcore woman.
What a turn-on!
Hey, I think she likes me, boss!
All right, guys, come on.
Let's pick up the track.
Let's find these assholes.
Yes, sir.
Move.
Damn!
More flies than my ex.
Damn it!
Take him out.
Go, go, go.
All right, Colby, you stay on point.
Yes, sir.
Everybody else, tight formation, double time, okay?
Whoa, whoa!
What about me?
What about you?
I'm not staying here!
Yeah, you are.
If any of these assholes come running this way, it's probably in your best interest to shoot 'em, okay?
Excuse me.
Jackie, Jessie, left side!
Colby, you're with me.
Rest of you, to the right!
Go, go, go!
Go, go!
Ugh!
Ahhh!
Get my back, move!
Ugh!
Shit.
Ugh!
Ahh!
All right, let's see what they got, gentlemen.
Boss!
Boss, you got to see this.
Son of a bitch!
It's a request for more weapons from the Department of Defence.
Sir, this is a U.S. Army training manual.
What?
These weapons are U.S. military-issue.
This is bullshit, sir!
Sir, is this bullshit?
It's most definitely bullshit.
We're training these assholes to fight against us!
Jesus!
I thought we told you to stay your ass up there!
I got bored.
Get down!
Clear!
Clear!
Clear!
Explain to me why the government sent us down here.
This was a search-and-destroy mission, wasn't it?
Listen, you Jughead grunt, your job is to shoot that gun and not ask any questions.
So, follow your orders and keep your mouth shut!
How dare you bastards send my men into a deathtrap!
You knew damn well that those scientists were dead!
You sent us here so we could clean up your mess!
You've earned your gold star, Lieutenant.
Jackie, torch this place.
Colby?
Tyler!
Hey, right now, my focus is to make sure my men get out of here alive, but I got a lot of questions for you, lady.
Hey, did you ever think that sometimes there's questions you really don't want to know the answers to?
Not when it concerns my men.
Fuck your men!
The interest of the United States government comes first!
And sometimes, you got to lose one to save a thousand.
Next time you want someone to clean up your dirt, you bring in your own operatives.
We are not your puppets.
You are whatever the United States government says you are!
And so am I!
Get your hands off of me.
Gentlemen, double time!
Colby's got point.
You are whatever the United States government says you are, and so am I!
Jessie.
Keep an eye on her ass.
If she tries to run away, shoot her.
All right, men, let's move out.
Don't worry, mamacita.
I'll keep an eye on your ass.
What have you got, soldier?
Something's out there.
Where am I looking?
I'm not sure, sir.
False alarm, I guess.
At ease, guys.
Let's take a break.
Cigarette?
It's a disgusting habit.
How about you?
Sure, man, yeah.
Hey, Colby, don't be such a pussy your whole life, huh?
Shut up!
Hey, what do you think about that señorita over there, huh?
I haven't worked with a dame since I was a grunt.
Ain't a grunt no more?
She's some under-wraps scam.
Going to weaken our forces.
Can't trust no female!
It's that whole emotional thing.
It's their time of the month, they go postal.
Heh!
Hey, puto, let me get a swig of that!
Give me a cigarette.
The bar I was telling you about back home?
Pussy everywhere.
Why don't you come down when we get back?
Who do you think you're fooling?
You wouldn't know what to do with a piece of ass if it landed in your lap.
Bullshit!
Hey, I thought you were gay.
That's what I thought, bro.
Hey, don't ask, don't tell, all right?
That was a sheep, man.
Don't make me gay.
No, just real strange.
Quite a motley group of guys you got there.
Those are real men.
Of course, you've never met one of those with all those pussies you work with in Washington.
Hmm, I believe I've never actually met a real man, ever.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, what are you guys sipping on?
Want daytime or night, sir?
Both.
Here you go, Sarge.
Got you covered.
This one's tequila.
This one on the right.
You want this one.
You want that one first.
¶
What are you doing?
Nothing.
What was that?
I said nothing!
I'm sick of your shit.
Ugh!
You just saved your life.
Whoo!
Whoo, that's right!
Yeah!
Where you going, mother-fucker?
Where you going?
Ugh!
Ahh!
What exactly are we looking for?
No idea.
As long as the cheque clears, makes no difference to me.
Hey, you still suffering from that post-traumatic stress disorder?
Maybe.
Want to talk about it?
Not really.
You can talk to me, man!
I'm like Dr. Phil!
My counsellor said I got good ears.
I can listen.
You got medication?
Yeah.
Can I have some?
Yeah, it's back at the base.
I'll get you one.
Whatever keeps you quiet, man.
Hey, let me get a lighter, let me get a lighter.
Do you people ever stop talking?
Whoa!
You may want to close your eyes.
He's dead.
This guy never got a shot off.
No, he didn't.
Look, see that?
It's a high-powered rifle.
We got company out here.
Looks like he was carrying supplies.
There's more of them.
Get back to the team, let's go.
Oh!
Cassandra, hey!
Jesus Christ, this guy's brains are missing.
Diablo!
They sure ain't playing, boss.
He's dead.
What's wrong with you?
Talk to me, what happened here?
He-- it--
Where's Jackie?
Where'd he go?
He, uh--
Let's get you out of here, come on.
Let's move out, men.
What is that?
¶
What's going on?
I'll tell you one thing.
We're not fighting a terrorist.
Boss, I've seen some things in my days, but that-- that, I don't know what that is!
She knows something!
Okay, all right, all right, back off!
Cassandra, talk to me.
I saw it!
Saw what?
I saw it.
It's not like anything I've ever seen before.
We should just kill her.
She's in on it!
She's in on it!
She's a fucking liar!
This is bullshit!
Can't trust a woman, sir.
Listen, stop!
Just stop!
All right, fine.
They told me that there was something out here.
Other than that-- Jesus Christ!
No, other than that, I don't know!
All right, all right!
No, no, no, wait, wait!
Go, all right?
Go do something.
Go.
Sir.
Go!
The hell with this.
Something out here?
That's all I know.
That's just great.
Hey, where the hell are you going?
Enough!
I'm done, I quit!
She's crazy!
Well, how about you give me a cigarette before you catch a Greyhound out of here?
Man, I got to stop smoking these things.
Used to be able to punish the booty two hours straight.
Now, I can't even go 20 minutes.
Maybe that's why your girl's always creeping over to my place.
Your place?
Yeah.
Hey, let me tell you something.
I'm world-renowned for my baby-making skills.
I'm like the Puerto Rican baby-making machine!
I'm like the U.N. in this bitch!
God sent me here for two things.
That's making babies, and saving the fucking day.
You need to get your head checked!
Oh, I need to get my head checked?
Yes!
The last time I checked, you had post-partum depression.
Do you have any idea what you're talking about?
Oh, I know what I'm talking about.
I've been to a seminar once.
We sat around, we talked, played Yenga.
Don't you mean Jenga?
Yeah, and we hugged.
Want to hug?
You can't keep this stuff bottled up inside, man!
Head'll get all cloudy.
Liable to hurt somebody.
What do you think we're out here to do in the first place?
Shh!
Take the shot, soldier.
What are you waiting for?
Take the shot!
I can't.
That's what we get paid to do.
Take the fucking shot!
I can't!
Sayonara, buddy.
Ahhh!
Get up!
I said get up!
You want to tell me who you work for?
Man, I don't know!
You don't know?
I don't know!
What are you doing out here?
I don't know!
Who do you work for?
I don't know, man!
No!
Ugh, ugh!
Maybe you want to talk now?
No, man!
Nada?
No!
I think you've got answers.
No, I don't got-- what are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you-- no!
What are you doing?
No!
You've got 5 fingers.
You're going to give me some answers.
I don't know nothing!
No!
Now you got 4 fingers!
I don't know!
Who do you work for?
No?
You got 3 fingers left.
You want to tell me who you work for?
I don't know!
Hunter!
Hunter?
What are you talking about?
The hunter!
Jackie!
Allen!
Where the hell are these guys?
Hey, hey!
Brent!
Jesus Christ!
It was just right here.
Where?
Right here!
Where is it?
Where's the body?
Something came down and snatched it, man.
Like that!
What?
It was right here!
This ain't right.
That's a whole lot of blood.
Why would somebody take a body?
Not somebody, man.
Something!
What do you mean, something?
Something!
Okay, we're out of here.
To the chopper, now come on!
Let's go, move, move!
Guys!
Tyler, Christ!
What do you see?
I seen something, but it moved.
Good job, country boy.
No!
Give me that AK.
Now!
Cease fire!
I said, cease fire!
What the hell are we shooting at?
I don't know, goddamn it!
Colby got hit!
We got to get to that chopper.
What about Colby, sir?
He's dead, all right?
He's gone!
Now, move!
Ah, look who joined us.
Where the fuck have you been?
Taking care of business.
Taking care of business?
What, you think you can just waltz around here by yourself?
You need to give me 6 feet, mother-fucker.
Oh, is that what you think?
All right, come on!
Hey, hey, hey!
Break it up, okay?
You want to kill each other, you can do it later.
Jackie, like to be alone?
Two clicks, recon, go!
Roger that, sir.
Bitch!
This is bullshit!
Keep moving.
You know, gentlemen, there's nothing, absolutely nothing more honourable, more pure, more selfless than to serve your country.
This is a covert program, gentlemen, and you know what that means.
The things that you will have to give up to enter this program are too numerous to count.
Let's just say that you'd be losing every inch of the life that you dreamed of.
Every thought and every person that you ever loved, every moment that you can remember.
From this second forward, that is all that you have.
No secret of this republic can leave this building.
Because of that, I must love my country... even when tough love is the order of the day.
Candidate number one, stand to your feet.
Unfortunately, your blood work was not satisfactory to the committee.
You're not qualified for the E16 programme.
It's also unfortunate that you're not a cabinet member.
0600h, candidate number one terminated.
Protocol 6A.
Candidate number two, stand to your feet.
You don't meet the physical requirements that this committee recommends for an ideal candidate for the E16 programme.
It seems as though that you contracted the herpes virus at one of your stops.
Hell, Grandma always told me to stay away from the whores.
I'm glad I listened to Grandma.
Stand up!
Turn around and face the wall.
Turn around.
Welcome to the program.
Candidate number three, you must realize that sometimes killing's also protecting life.
Even though you will be a ferocious killer, you will also be a life-saver.
You will receive a series of injections.
The first one is a chemical compound that will alter the somatosensory cortex--
Ugh!
Which is the pain centre of the brain.
That's the last pain sensation that you will feel.
This party is getting better and better every moment.
Give him the second shot.
This little cocktail is not your average one that you get at happy hour, son.
This will cause a deficiency in the brain chemical norepinephrine, which you need periodically to survive.
This will allow us to control your ass in case there's a glitch in the program, and you decide to get cute on us.
We're done here!
Take him to Wing 4, for surgery.
Yes, I understand.
Execute the order to take out the team.
Order a collateral damage assessment of the area.
Give the execute order to our asset on the ground.
Evac him ASAP!
Get me satellite imagery of the area.
Find a way to clean up this mess.
Shit!
Alpha, bravo, six!
Do you read me?
Alpha, bravo, six!
Muerta!
This helicopter better be there!
What else do you know, chica, huh?
You know, it's your fault that all these men are dead!
You're the reason we're out here in this godforsaken jungle!
Jessie!
The way they played us for their own game?
That's enough, Jessie!
That's enough!
Whatever is out there, it's going to take all of us to kill it.
Whether Command responds or not, it doesn't matter!
We need to kill this thing, or it will kill us.
What are we fighting, boss?
When did you train for this?
When did you sign up for this, 'cause I sure as hell didn't!
You know he's right, sir.
Well, we don't have much of a choice now, do we?
Don't get paid enough!
That's enough, stand down, soldier!
That's an order.
You don't know anything else?
Sir, look, we need to play offence as well as defence here.
Okay, that's the only way we're going to make it out of here.
No, the only way we're going to make it out of here is to make it to the extraction point.
That's if there is an extraction.
They'll be here!
How are we supposed to trust her, sir?
We can't!
Brent's right.
We need to play offence against this bastard.
It's getting late.
We'll make camp here.
We need to play offence against this bastard.
¶
So, now what?
Do what we do best.
We wait.
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Come on, mother-fucker!
Come on!
Aie-aie-aie!
Sir, that's just another terrorist.
Leg's going this way.
Yeah, and his head's going that way.
He didn't know which way he was going.
This guy was dead before the explosion.
They used his body to trip the mine.
He's playing us for a fool!
Yeah, I think I'm officially freaked out.
All right, reset the trap.
Are you serious?
Come on, let's get out of here!
Do I look like I'm joking?
This thing is hunting us.
Let me guess.
This is bullshit?
Bingo.
¶
You think you're going to be able to take me out that easy?
You got another think coming, puto.
Come on, lead me... through the valley of the shadow of death.
This is not a bad little rig you got here.
For a woman.
It's not a bad little rig you got there.
For a boy.
Yeah, well, whatever.
Yes?
You want to see this rig?
And God made Adam!
You're missing out!
Hey.
Hey.
Look, I'm sorry what I said about your team before.
Okay, they're good guys.
They're the best.
It started off as a beautiful day, huh?
Yeah.
When I was stationed in Iraq, the colonel used to say all the time it was a beautiful day to die.
Odd how that somehow sounds romantic.
So, what was the worst you'd ever been in?
I was in a chopper, shot down over Somalia.
We were ambushed, kidnapped, and I was the only one who survived.
You must be blessed.
Yeah, or maybe I'm cursed.
Look, I didn't want to scare the team before.
The area was the testing ground for the E16.
Okay, I'm listening.
What's the E16?
It's a covert project to create the perfect cyborg soldier.
I'm talking half-man, half-computer.
This thing can withstand temperatures and terrains that no human can, equipped with weapons straight out of a comic book.
They were injecting this thing with human brain cells, which ended up morphing and multiplying into an intelligence level we would never understand.
Now, they've lost control of it.
Complete!
So, tell me one thing.
Why's it taking human brains?
I have no idea.
Half-man, half-machine, huh?
Mmm.
Well, then I guess it is a beautiful day to die.
Move, move!
Jessie!
Ugh!
Jessie!
All right, where'd it go?
Where'd it go?
I think I shot it!
Oh!
Let's get to that chopper, come on.
Where's everybody else?
They're dead.
This is--
Argh!
Go, go, go!
Get out of here!
You bastard!
I ain't impressed!
You can't kill me, mother-fucker!
I'm from Philly!
Bitch!
Show time.
Come on, you bastard.
Come and get me, come and get me.
There we go.
Ha, ha, got you!
How's it feel, buddy?
Oh, yeah, you're hurting now, aren't you, buddy?
You're hurting now.
What the hell?
Ugh!
Argh!
It's never easy!
Man!

Destroyed?
Okay, send out a search team and look for survivors.
Destroy all the information, and design a deniability story.
You know, when I was a young boy,
I would have dreams and fantasies of being there the day that Thomas Jefferson signed the Declaration of Independence, or Francis Scott Key, the night that he penned the Star-Spangled Banner.
This is the greatest nation in the history of civilization.
No secret this republic can leave this building.
Because of that, I must love my country... even when tough love is the order of the day.
My only comfort is knowing right now, this second, that I did what was best for the country that I call my own.
Gentlemen, from this second forward, that is all that I have.
Great work, soldier.
I'm going to put you in for a medal for this.
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry, son.
That's the way it is.
I mean, that's protocol in these types of operations.
Now, you do understand that, don't you?
And again, you did an amazing job.
You know something, Colonel.
I never did like cigars.
Oh!
Jessie was right.
This is bullshit.
Hey!
Hey.
So, what's next, Lieutenant?
I'm going to go... meet the families of my team.
And tell them the truth.
You know, I was wrong about you.
Thank you for coming back out there to get me.
You saved my life.
Anytime.
Take care.
Tyler!

In short ...
We want to find and bring them back.
What were they testing?
Son, I think it would be in a hole like this ... if privileged with this kind of information?
I'm not worried with what we were testing.
And neither should you be.
Why do they simply do not send a patrol common?
Well, like I said ... officially this place does not exist.

Chill out, soldier.
Ê an order.
You do not know anything else?
Lord, have to attack as much to defend here.
Is the only way we can get out of here.
No.
The only way out of here ê get to the point of withdrawal.

This guy was dead before the explosion.
He used this body to explode the mine.
He is fooling us.
I'm officially angry!
- Okay, reset the trap.
- Really?
Please, let's get outta here.
Looks like I'm kidding?
This thing is hunting us.

The Colonel used to say all the time ... it was a beautiful day to die.
Strange how some way it sounds romantic.
So what's the worst situation he faced?
I was in a helicopter ... on Somalia.
We were attacked, abducted ... and I was the only one who survived.
Shall be blessed.
Ê ...
Ê ...
Maybe it's cursed.
Listen, I did not scare the group before.
This region was the area Test E-16.
OK.
I'm listening.
What is E-16?
It was a secret project to create the perfect cyborg soldier.
We're talking half-man, half computer.
This thing can survive temperatures and land ... that no human could.
Equipped with weapons outputs comic book.
They were injecting into this thing human brain cells ... who had just turned and multiplied ... at a level of intelligence that we ... we will never comprehend.
And they lost loves control over it.
Completely.
That's right.
So tell me one thing ... why this thing is catching the human brain?
I have no idea.
Half man, half machine, is not it?
Well ..

Let's go to that helicopter.
Come on.
Where are the others?
They're dead.
This is ...
Go!
Go!
Get out!
Son of a bitch!
I'm not impressed.
You can not miss me bastard!
Do not understand yet?
Naughty!
Showtime.
Well ...
Come, you son of a bitch.
Come get me.
Come get me.
Come on.
I got it.
How is it, man?
Ê ...
Are you scared now is not, pal?
Where are you?
But what ...
It is never easy.
Dude ...
Tyler?
Tyler?
Hold on, soldier.
Destroyed?
Right.
Send a search party and search for survivors.
Destroy all the information ... and develop a narrative of denial.
You know when I was young ...
I had dreams and fantasies ... to be there on the day in which Thomas Jefferson ... signed the declaration of independence or when Francis Scott Key ..
wrote the national anthem.
This is the greatest nation ... in the history of civilization.
No secret this republic should leave this building.
So ...
I love my country ... even when ... love for the austere agenda.
My only comfort is knowing now this second ...
I did the best for the country I call mine.
Gentlemen, this second on, that's all I have.
Great job, soldier.
I will indicate Io for a medal for that.
Ê ...
Sorry, son.
And so it is.
I mean, this is protocol this type of operation.
Now ... you understand that, do not?
And again ...
You did a great job.
You know something, sir?
I never liked cigars.
Jesse was right.
This is stupid.
So what now, lieutenant?
I'll ... find families of my men ... and tell them the truth.
You know, I was wrong about you.
Thank you for going after me.
- You saved my life.
- Anytime.
Take care.
Tyler.
I see there.
On October 13, 2008, Filmkameratene AS received an anonymous package with two hard disks containing 283 minutes of filmed material.
This film is a rough-cut version of that material.
Everything is shown in chronological order and no images have been manipulated.
A team of investigators spent more than a year trying to establish whether this was a practical joke or if the material was authentic.
They concluded that it was authentic.
Ready?
Turn on the radio.
- Johanna, do you have sound?
- Yes.
This isn't working.
Bear tracks were found yesterday in Volda.
A hunting party arrived there today.
The leader of the hunting party had the following to say:
We expect to locate this bear fairly quickly.
Our real concern is that a poacher has been following us.
Only a select few ever get bear-hunting licenses.
I know every single bear hunter in Norway.
That guy in the Land Rover is no bear hunter.
If he's gunning for our bear, he's breaking the law.
- Have you ever seen him?
- We see him all over.
If I see him again, there'll be consequences.
He's nothing but a poacher.
- What would you like to tell him?
- To lay his cards on the table.
Drive!
- There's too much traffic.
- We're going to lose him!
Ready?
We know his name is Hans, but we have no last name.
Thomas, try being more serious.
But what is he doing in Volda?
Who is he?
- Do we have sound?
- You haven't plugged in the...
You won't get an interview with a poacher.
I don't like it when you ridicule him.
That's great!
Thank you.
Bye.
Thomas, that poacher is staying at the campground!
I can't say I know him, but he is here.
He's staying right over here.
Want me to show you?
I don't know what that smell is, but his camper sure reeks!
- What are all those things?
- I have no idea.
Thyme?
He drives off and stays out all night.
He's never back before sunrise.
- He stays out all night?
- Yes.
Every night.
- In good spirits?
- Sure.
We don't know when or if he'll show up.
- There he is!
- I'm filming.
Just ask him directly.
Hi.
My name's Thomas.
We're from Volda College.
Could we ask you a few questions?
Get lost.
Maybe we could come back...
- Did it work?
- Quiet, I hear something.
Yes, I'm on my way out now.
I expect to find it tonight.
Okay, fine.
Bye.
- He isn't here.
- He was right in front of us!
Sure, but...
- Shit!
- Nice work, Thomas.
- Can you see anything?
- Yeah.
Some furry things are hanging down from the ceiling.
And there's a shotgun.
We're on our way to where a bear was just found shot.
Could he have been the shooter?
Lord knows where this one came from.
I've checked with every registered bear hunter I know.
None of them shot this one.
The bear population is managed by the state.
So a downed bear like this one causes quite a fuss.
Look at this.
These tracks don't match the way a bear normally walks.
I think someone brought this bear and dumped it here.
- That's weird.
- I agree.
Very weird.
You're from the Wildlife Board.
Finn Haugan, right?
These hunters say those aren't bear tracks.
That's ridiculous.
What else would they be?
There is a bear right there, with tracks all around it.
- But why are they in doubt?
- Ask them!
It's crazy.
We have waited for Hans for hours, but now he's finally moving.
We think he's heading somewhere, and we are going to follow him.
Go!
It looks like he's heading for the ferry.
How long are we going to keep following him?
Can you see what he's carrying?
It's a car tire.
- What's he doing?
- I can't tell.
Three, two, one, and...
Sogn og Fjordane county!
Okay, he's over there.
Just hide here.
We met a little while back.
- Really?
- Thomas, from Volda College.
- Is that...
- Are you following me?
We just want to ask you a couple of questions.
No.
Are you...
What were you doing in Volda?
Did you shoot that bear?
Stay the hell away from me.
Turn that off.
Leave me alone!
Once we get what we need, we can go back.
It would be so awesome to get him to talk.
We have tried, plenty of times.
Do you think Michael Moore gave up after the first try?
Left arm or right foot?
The one you kick with?
We have been here all afternoon.
I think he's sleeping in his trailer.
So now we wait until something happens.
Are you serious?
Okay.
I have to get my sound gear.
What is this?
"No trespassing.
Blasting area."
Did you see that?
Was that a road?
Did you?
This road is horrible.
If we run into a bunch of inbred pig farmers, your ass is first...
- I'm not...
- Stop whining.
- I'm just being honest.
- Want to go back?
- Fine by me.
- That's not what I meant.
Hey, wait for me!
Look here.
I don't think he's in his car.
- So we know he's here...
- But what is he up to?
Here's a trail.
- I hear something in the distance.
- What?
Troll!
Thomas!
Hurry!
My car is right over here!
- What?
- Something bit me!
- Are you all right?
- It stings.
- You heard him yell "troll," right?
- Shut up.
You need some more.
- Can I help?
- There's gauze in the first-aid kit.
- Ow!
Don't...
- We have to get this out.
You look like hell, Thomas.
- What the hell was that?
- Tetanus shot.
You yelled something back there in the woods.
- You heard him, Johanna.
- What's this slime?
What did he say?
- More?
- Yes.
Can you give us a ride to our car?
It isn't very smart to follow me.
Did you yell "troll" out there?
- Is that your car?
- What the hell?
- What happened?
- That's our car!
Someone crushed our car.
It's completely demolished.
Look at this, Thomas.
- Hans, do you understand this?
- I have an idea.
Okay, what...
A bear didn't do this.
What do you think happened?
- What...
- Ask him if a troll did it.
Hey, if you know what happened to my car, you should say so!
- You yelled "troll".
- Forget about that!
What the hell do you want?
You want me to say trolls exist, on film?
- You find that funny?
- No, but you don't actually believe...
If you want a ride, you'd better come right now.
- What should we do?
- I think I'll walk.
You have our bags?
Just so we get this straight:
you actually believe trolls exist?
Why are you so sure it was a bear that attacked you?
What's the matter?
Why are we stopping?
Thanks for giving us a ride.
We'd love to join you, and film what you do.
We'd be very interested.
I'll let you film me killing whatever scratched you, on one condition:
You do exactly as I say, no matter what I say.
Okay?
Yes.
I feel like I'm bleeding everywhere.
- Are you admiring your wound?
- Yuck!
Don't film that!
- You're crazy.
- I'm serious.
- Why call them?
- To tell them where we are.
He isn't dangerous, just weird.
Remember, he runs the show.
We do exactly as he says.
Then we'll get our footage.
No one here believes in God or Jesus?
Nope.
None of us.
Don't look at me.
Serious?
Because they can smell "the blood of a Christian man"?
Is that alright?
Close the gate and hang up that sign.
NO TRESPASSING.
BLASTING AREA.
- Is this a land mine?
- Yes.
But it isn't armed.
I'm sitting on a land mine?
Are you nuts?
Anyone who doesn't want to join me?
Who's changed their mind?
Who's afraid of trolls?
- No.
- No?
Good.
Go down to that creek, take off all your clothes, and scrub yourselves.
- Especially your armpits and groin.
- No way!
- Why?
- To remove any body odor.
Then rub this all over yourselves and your clothes.
- What is that?
- Troll stench.
- Rub it all over your bodies.
- It reeks!
No way.
Forget about it.
You have to smell like a troll, or they'll smell us and run away.
Christ!
- No.
No way!
- I'm not doing this, Thomas.
Forget about it!
You agreed to do exactly as I said.
If you don't do it, I'll go up there alone and leave you here.
Is that understood?
Are you ready?
You're all greased up?
You look cute.
Here, flashlights for you.
- What is that?
- A big flash bulb, basically.
Hans?
That weapon.
How do you use it?
It blasts a powerful ultraviolet beam.
UVB rays.
The same as the sun, or a tanning lamp.
Don't you know sunlight turns them to stone, Thomas?
- Right.
Or they explode.
- Haven't you read anything?
I read fairy tales when I was a kid, but...
Did you know that, Kalle?
So, what do you do if a troll wants to have an eating contest with you?
Eating contest?
Fairy tales usually don't match reality.
They seem to in this case.
- Troll piss.
- Christ!
You can smell it all the way over here.
Listen, I'm hunting a Ringlefinch.
There's piss everywhere.
He's marking.
Looks like he's been chased from his territory.
He seems sick.
I'd like to find out what's wrong with him.
A blood sample from the troll?
I don't have the right equipment.
You too.
Bye.
I need help to find out what's wrong.
But a blood sample...
That won't be easy.
Who were you talking to?
A veterinarian.
A vet!
If you wait here, I'll try to chase the troll out.
Is this what you imagined?
I bet it's going to take him some time to find a troll out there.
I feel sorry for him if he really believes in trolls.
Maybe he's filming us.
- That's probably what he's doing.
- He's somewhere laughing at us.
While we sit here like idiots.
Lingonberry?
- In the woods?
- Yes, with no food or water.
- Cool!
- What?
It's a night-vision camera.
Listen!
That's just him.
One week, or being bitten by a bear.
- It makes for a good story.
- You would look ridiculous!
- So I think I'll choose that.
- Being bitten by a bear?
Do you feel that?
I'm picking up some strange sounds.
What is that?
Seriously.
What's going on?
What is this?
This is one real bad joke.
It's a Tosserlad!
Get the hell out of here!
Run, dammit!
- Did you see that?
- Yes.
Where did it go?
Do you see it?
Get behind my car!
No!
- Give me the camera!
- No!
Where is Johanna?
Thomas!
Kalle!
- Johanna!
- It's real!
I told you so!
I knew it!
They are real!
- Say something.
- It's been turned to stone!
We ran through the woods...
Why the hell did you say that none of you were Christian?
The way that troll sniffed around...
Obviously one of you believes in God.
I don't believe in God.
I sang in a church teen choir...
But that's because my parents forced me to.
I don't believe in God.
I'm serious.
- I can tell it's not her.
- What?
How?
Knock it off.
That was some genetically-engineered monster.
- That's a troll.
- Nonsense!
Question!
Why doesn't anybody know about this?
Because someone doesn't want people to know.
The government?
Is the government behind this?
Do you work for them?
- Why show it to us now?
- Because I'm tired of this shitty job.
I have no rights whatsoever.
I get no night bonus.
No overtime.
No nuisance compensation.
Maybe it's time for a change in troll management.
- So if you could get this on TV...
- That shouldn't be a problem.
Come on.
You want to see more of these, learn what's really going on?
You might want to step back.
Holy shit!
Anyone need some gravel?
Who the hell is that?
- Who is that?
- I don't know.
Hi there.
It's that guy we filmed...
What is this, Hans?
A film crew?
They wanted to see some trolls.
Aren't you that guy from the Wildlife Board?
This is an exceptionally bad idea.
Turn off that camera.
I have enough problems.
The valley is full of dead cattle.
I can't talk about this on film.
Turn off that camera.
- Put it down.
- We're allowed to film here.
- Sure you're on top of this?
- Totally.
As soon as the scapegoat arrives, I will take care of the rest.
PIO TER'S POLISH PAINT SERVICE
The Ringlefinch is still out there.
Then find it!
Two German tourists disappeared last night.
- We expect to lose a few more.
- That isn't my problem.
If you think I'll let you keep those recordings, you're wrong!
It says "Pioter's Polish Paint Service".
What exactly is your job description?
My job is to kill any troll that breaks out of its territory
- and comes near people.
- How often do they break out?
Rarely.
This is a special situation.
Too many trolls are out and about.
Finn is a... bureaucrat.
He works for TSS.
His primary job is to prevent...
To keep people from knowing that trolls exist.
In one sense, you are a true Norwegian hero.
No, you're wrong about that.
There's nothing heroic about what I do.
It's dirty work.
How can no one know about this?
Let's take these recordings, drive to Oslo, and sell them for a fortune.
We can't do that yet.
We have to keep following him.
Finn is pissed off.
- Now what?
- Breakfast.
- You should eat something too.
- I'm not hungry.
I feel a little... nauseous.
How many types of troll are there?
You have two main groups:
mountain trolls and woodland trolls.
The subgroups include Ringlefinch, Tosserlad, Rimetosser.
Mountain Kings.
The Harding, out west.
But that troll we saw...
Do they all have three heads?
No, there are many variations.
The heads develop as they age.
They aren't born with three.
They are usually born with one.
The others appear later.
They only have an eye in the middle, the original, head.
The other heads aren't really heads.
They're a sort of protuberance.
Their function is to scare other trolls.
Or impress the females.
What is that form?
- What does TSS stand for?
- Troll Security Service.
We have to fill out this form after each kill.
Location, gender, whether it blew up or turned to stone...
SLAYED TROLL FORM
In fairy tales, trolls wear clothes and talk like people.
- They're just like people.
- Fairy tales are for kids.
Trolls are animals.
Predators.
They eat, shit and mate.
Eat anything they can.
- How old can trolls get?
- 1000, 1200 years.
- And their intelligence level?
- In the pits.
They are not bright.
They manage to eat.
But how hard is it to survive on rocks?
I once saw a troll try to eat its own tail.
His head between his legs, he tried to suck down his own tail.
He started gagging on it, tipped over and rolled down a hill like a wheel.
- I was a Navy Ranger.
- And that led you to troll hunting?
No, they were looking for someone who could...
- So you're the only one in Norway?
- Yes.
Are we leaving?
- They eat all sorts of crap.
- Do they eat people?
- You want to offer yourself?
- No.
But have they eaten people?
- Are those troll tails?
- Yes.
Some skinned, some whole.
- Why?
- So it smells like troll in here.
Why do you want a troll smell?
So I can approach the trolls without them noticing.
- Tanning lamps?
- Yes.
- You can get skin cancer.
- I use sunscreen.
I have trouble sleeping in the dark.
- Is that what we rubbed on ourselves?
- Yes.
- What is it?
- Concentrated troll stench.
A mixture of all the crap you can squeeze out of a troll.
Let's go find that Ringlefinch before he eats every animal in the county.
Two German tourists were found killed by a bear.
Finn Haugan from the Wildlife Board is investigating the tragedy.
Do you know where the troll might be?
No.
What are you looking for?
Rock slides, toppled trees, things like that.
See anything?
- Do I look like that famous painting?
- Yeah.
Maybe you should see a doctor?
- Do you really feel sick?
- It comes and goes.
- Are we safe here?
- They only come out at night.
Kalle, can't we...
It hasn't been triggered.
Some small trolls have taken the bait.
Concrete and charcoal is an unbeatable combination.
- Do it now!
- Now?
Hans thinks he has found the trail of a Ringlefinch...
Hans thinks he has found tracks.
Some farmers have found sheep carcasses nearby.
Hans thinks there's a link between the two.
Hurry up!
Global warming has led to changes in our flora and fauna.
These tracks you see around here... are from a Russian bear that came through Finland and Sweden.
The bear stores its food here under the bridge.
- Isn't that strange behavior?
- Not for Russian bears.
Due to the long, hard winters, they store their food.
Just like squirrels.
Aren't these tracks a little strange?
That's the left foot.
And the right foot is over here.
Has the bear walked cross-legged?
I assume you have seen bear tracks before.
Hey, what about those tracks?
He's gnawed at the bark.
Typical Ringlefinch behavior.
He'll be back tonight.
I have something to lure him with.
- And then you'll kill him?
- Yes.
But first, I need to get that blood sample.
Is this the syringe?
This is horrible!
It's cruelty to animals.
Cruelty?
He's just using them as bait.
You're too far away.
Move closer.
No, I'll just zoom.
We can see fine from here.
What working hours...
We've been here forever.
Maybe no troll will show up?
- We can see fine from here.
- But we can see better from there!
Come on.
It's here.
Hear that?
Run!
God, I hate this crap!
Keep your distance.
I'm about to toss out some Christian man's blood.
Move back!
Shit!
Kalle!
Thomas!
Move!
Move over!
Are you alright?
Hey...
Are you alright?
Help him up.
- Come on, Hans.
- Are you alright?
Careful with that red button.
Give me the syringe.
Stay up there.
Now we know that trolls also explode.
- How are you doing?
- Fine, thanks.
Could've been worse.
Just a little sore.
A little sore?
This is crazy!
At least I got the blood sample.
I'll be there in a half hour.
Thanks.
Bye.
You look like a newborn!
It's just a film team.
They have some questions.
ARDAL PET CLINIC
- Is that the blood?
- Yes.
- It was quite a struggle.
- I can tell.
You're a mess!
- Thanks.
- There's a bathroom in there.
- What do you see?
- There aren't enough red blood cells.
This will take me a couple of days.
Could we have a short interview?
If you could just stand...
or maybe sit over there.
- What should I tell them?
- Everything.
- We aren't allowed.
- I take full responsibility.
The trolls' main problem is that they can't convert vitamin D from the sunlight, into calcium.
So when they are exposed to bright sunlight, their bodies overreact.
Their stomachs expand.
Gases are forced into their intestines and veins.
This becomes unbearable.
- And they explode?
- They explode.
- But some trolls turn to stone.
- Yes, the older ones.
Their veins are too constricted, so the expansion occurs in their bones.
In a matter of seconds, everything calcifies and they turn to stone.
I wish they didn't have to experience such pain.
It is traumatic for them, even though it only takes a few seconds.
We would have preferred to give them an injection.
- I'll have the results in a few days.
- And you'll call me?
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Ready to go?
- Sure.
- Why all these local newspapers?
- To collect information.
- About what?
- Trolls.
Accidents and things that have happened, that trolls are behind.
- I have files back there.
- Can I take a look?
- "Road disappeared."
- People want natural explanations.
But if you know what to look for, you'll see what's caused by trolls.
This bridge was smashed by a wading troll that bumped his head.
Are there trolls that big?
Yes, the Jotnar.
I'm the only person to have seen one.
There's a mountain troll territory on the Finnmark plateau.
And one on the Hardanger plateau.
Three in Jotunheimen, one in Dovre.
We have to find out where the problem lies.
Jotunheimen is closest.
We are on our way to the first territory Hans wants to check.
At the moment, we are circling around the territory.
The territory ends up here, and because this tire is intact...
Hans says no trolls have left this territory.
If they had left, they would have gnawed on this tire.
Smile!
Film over there.
Trolls love to gnaw on old car tires.
One has tried to kick his way into the good stuff here, but failed.
- How many trolls are there?
- Impossible to say.
You must have some idea?
The gestation period is 10 to 15 years.
And they only have one kid.
- Are they mammals?
- Yes.
Let's see...
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
This looks fine.
All the stones are in the same position.
This is apparently a battle area.
Mountain trolls and woodland trolls often come to blows here.
They throw stones at each other.
But there has been little activity here lately.
The guy behind us is paying.
Isn't that what they say?
Remember that big Jotnar?
They live here in Jotunheimen.
- Where?
- Inside the mountains.
- What are we doing?
- Just wait here.
I ate an entire loaf of bread.
Finn refuses to give in.
He claims all the runaways are from Dovre.
Because he doesn't see any in this satellite photo.
But you can't see trolls in satellite photos!
Let's get to the bottom of this.
We are on our way to a farm that was on the local news recently.
Hans thinks it's troll related.
Wow, look at that!
Did you get that?
- What happened here?
- A tornado.
- Did you see it happen?
- No.
Look at the position of those trees.
They should all point in the same direction.
Who showed you that map?
They didn't say who they were.
But they had fancy weather charts and satellite images.
And we saw what looked like a tornado.
At least three trolls ran though here and continued northward.
How can it be that no one sees huge beasts rampage across a field like this?
We'll come back tonight.
Head into the woods.
I'm tired.
- I don't like this.
- Let's stick together.
Seriously, Kalle.
We have to follow him.
What do you think we should do?
There are tracks further in.
Here's their trail.
They've passed through here.
- We can't stay here alone.
- This way!
An abandoned mine.
- They've been here.
- I'm not going in there!
There aren't any trolls there now.
Come on.
- Are you sure?
- Sure.
No, there's nobody home.
I need the troll stench.
- Here.
- I can take the camera.
Everything okay?
A whole pack of trolls lives here.
This is a lair.
- We can leave.
- Come on, let's get out of here!
Let's go.
Come on!
I'm coming!
Closer to the wall!
Head back inside!
Quick, in here!
Turn off your flashlights!
I have to get out of here.
- Do you have any more troll stench?
- No, not here.
Just relax.
Breathe easy.
Calm down.
- Why are you so nervous?
- I'm Christian!
- We're going to die!
- Damn!
You'd better not start sweating!
Dear Lord...
Shut up!
Run!
Sunlight!
It still works.
There are more in there.
I'll have to get them later.
Mountain Kings.
Why didn't he just say he was Christian?
I have to go to Dovre to find out why they keep running away.
I can give you a ride down, if you want to quit.
- What are you doing?
- Looking for those tapes.
In my trailer?
- Are you filming?
- No.
- It's out of control.
- Why aren't you up there?
I refuse to go into their territory.
There's no way.
- Turn off that camera.
- It's off.
But don't people have a right to know?
- What is your job?
- That's confidential information.
Why don't we have a right to know?
People are dying!
Why is this so secret?
- People have a right to know.
- No.
- Hands off the camera.
- This is none of your business.
Yes, this happens to be my business!
- Get lost!
- This isn't over.
I'm going to check it out.
Do you want to join me?
- Yes.
- Are you ready for that?
- Yes.
- Okay, let's keep on filming.
Let's find a new camera and continue.
Here comes our new camerawoman.
Malica.
- Malica.
- Thomas.
You are not Christian.
- You don't believe in Jesus or God?
- I'm a Muslim.
Excellent.
Muslim is okay, right?
I honestly don't know.
We'll see what happens.
- It must be okay.
- We're filming musk oxen, right?
No, not exactly.
- Let's go.
- Yes, we might as well.
We'll explain on the way.
- Where have you worked?
- Norwegian TV, BBC...
- I just filmed some lions in Tanzania.
- Lions.
Good.
I've never seen anything like this.
Holy shit.
They've broken every single tree over several acres.
I assume what has happened is that a Jotnar has run through here.
A giant, over 200 feet tall, has chased the Dovre trolls down here.
We don't want Jotnars running around.
Give me a break.
Do you all actually believe in trolls?
You think a squirrel rampaged through here?
If only the trolls were happy.
But TSS wants to keep a lid on everything.
Those may look like normal power lines, but they're electric fences to keep the trolls at bay.
I don't know how they broke through.
I'll have to check.
Let's go visit the clowns in charge of the power grid.
- Do they know about the trolls?
- No way.
Have you had any problems up in Dovre?
Yes, you could say that.
You can hang your coats here.
Over here.
Several hundred meters of power line, knocked to the ground. 300,000 volts.
- When did this happen?
- Three weeks ago.
- Do you know how it happened?
- No.
No one does.
Those cables are supposed to withstand hurricanes.
We have no clue.
- Is this a school project?
- Yes.
Volda College.
- Are you a teacher?
- No.
Where does that line go?
It runs from here... then north, in a loop, and back to here.
- So it runs in a circle?
- Yes, exactly.
You don't find that strange?
Maybe a little.
- Yes, it is strange.
- The power leads to nowhere.
Well, it does lead in a circle.
And in a beautiful landscape.
If a Jotnar runs through a power line, something is seriously wrong.
I'd better get up there and try to find it.
The territory starts there.
It's hell to put up new pylons.
Activists and farmers always complain.
I think they're pretty.
Those were placed out here as food for trolls.
This is the territory.
We have been here.
And here.
And no sign of trolls.
I think we should try this area next.
There's a TSS cabin up there where we can wait.
Some scientists say it is caused by natural phenomena, while others more than 1000 quakes registered...
We are in a troll territory now.
You don't seem to like entering these territories.
Is there some particular reason?
There was a mountain troll territory up in Strynefjell.
Back in the '70s they decided to build tunnels through that troll-rich area.
Both the TSS and I tried to object, but to no avail.
I was given the task of going in and exterminating all the trolls.
Every last one.
Pregnant females.
Kids.
Newborns that hadn't even learned to walk.
It was a massacre.
Hans' entire life has revolved around trolls.
Every day has been a struggle with and for trolls.
In many ways, he is a superhero here in Norway.
What would we have done without him?
That makes it all the more important for us to make this movie.
My shoulder.
Are you alright?
The sun will be up in an hour.
Should we go too?
He sounds a bit big, but I'll give it a shot.
It sounds like he's snapped completely.
This could be problematic.
Your phone is ringing, Hans.
- Where is it?
- On my seat.
Thomas speaking.
He's a little busy right now.
Can I...
Rabies?
- That Ringlefinch had rabies.
- Let me talk to Hilde.
Hi Hilde.
Are you sure?
That makes sense.
Okay.
You take care too.
Bye.
I'll bet all the trolls we've met had rabies.
This guy has spread it to the Ringlefinches and Mountain Kings.
- And even to you, Thomas.
- Me?
I don't have rabies.
Hello!
Dogs have rabies.
If you have rabies, you have to get to a hospital.
If you think he has rabies, he needs medical attention!
I don't have rabies.
You can't just say I have rabies!
If so, we need a hospital now!
- That beast is on its way.
Get inside!
- I couldn't care less!
- We can't stay in here.
- Look!
Is it coming this way?
Go outside?
Are you crazy?
He's leaving!
Don't move!
I'll try to lure him this way.
What a friend we have in Jesus...
What is he doing?
What's happening?
The flash ran out of power.
Definitely rabies.
Can we go to the hospital now?
- No, he needs a few more doses.
- What are you talking about?
But first I have to wear him out.
He's closing in on us!
- Now we're getting away!
- Good.
- There's somebody up ahead!
- Stop, Hans!
- Get in!
- Hurry, dammit!
Go!
Go!
- Where are you going?
- Stay here!
- Hans!
- Get back inside!
Oh my God!
Get back in the car!
- Who are you?
- A seismologist.
I have to get in front of him.
Look out!
Is it on?
Hans, what are you doing?
I have to give him the finishing blow!
- With that?
- Yes.
I hope you have all the footage you need.
This road will lead you to the highway.
There's no more roaring!
Malica...
Stop fooling around.
That's troll on tape.
Here is the footage.
Am I bleeding?
What did you say?
- Are you okay?
- Sure, I'm fine.
Look!
Over there!
Isn't that Finn and the others?
Shit, it's Finn.
Give me the camera!
Thomas, what are you doing?
The recordings end here.
No body was ever found in the mine and the teenagers behind the recordings have vanished without a trace.
We strongly encourage anyone with information about their fate to contact Filmkameratene AS or your nearest police station.
It has been impossible to get the Government to confirm the existence of the Troll Security Service.
However, an indirect confirmation was given during Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg's biannual press conference in Oslo on June 25, 2010.
The press didn't get the point.
We want to protect the Norwegian environment as best we can.
Few people find power grids attractive.
I certainly don't.
Norwegians are pro electricity, but against power lines.
That won't work in the long run.
Norway has trolls, so more power lines are needed.
- That's just the way it is.
- That's a wrap!
TROLLHUNTER
On October 13, 2008, Filmkameratene AS received an anonymous package with two hard disks containing 283 minutes of filmed material.
This film is a rough-cut version of that material.
Everything is shown in chronological order and no images have been manipulated.
A team of investigators spent more than a year trying to establish whether this was a practical joke or if the material was authentic.
They concluded that it was authentic.
Ready?
Turn on the radio.
- Johanna, do you have sound?
- Yes.
This isn't working.
Bear tracks were found yesterday in Volda.
A hunting party arrived there today.
The leader of the hunting party had the following to say:
We expect to locate this bear fairly quickly.
Our real concern is that a poacher has been following us.
Only a select few ever get bear-hunting licenses.
I know every single bear hunter in Norway.
That guy in the Land Rover is no bear hunter.
If he's gunning for our bear, he's breaking the law.
- Have you ever seen him?
- We see him all over.
If I see him again, there'll be consequences.
He's nothing but a poacher.
- What would you like to tell him?
- To lay his cards on the table.
Drive!
- There's too much traffic.
- We're going to lose him!
Ready?
We know his name is Hans, but we have no last name.
Thomas, try being more serious.
But what is he doing in Volda?
Who is he?
- Do we have sound?
- You haven't plugged in the...
You won't get an interview with a poacher.
I don't like it when you ridicule him.
That's great!
Thank you.
Bye.
Thomas, that poacher is staying at the campground!
I can't say I know him, but he is here.
He's staying right over here.
Want me to show you?
I don't know what that smell is, but his camper sure reeks!
- What are all those things?
- I have no idea.
Thyme?
He drives off and stays out all night.
He's never back before sunrise.
- He stays out all night?
- Yes.
Every night.
- In good spirits?
- Sure.
We don't know when or if he'll show up.
- There he is!
- I'm filming.
Just ask him directly.
Hi.
My name's Thomas.
We're from Volda College.
Could we ask you a few questions?
Get lost.
Maybe we could come back...
- Did it work?
- Quiet, I hear something.
Yes, I'm on my way out now.
I expect to find it tonight.
Okay, fine.
Bye.
- He isn't here.
- He was right in front of us!
Sure, but...
- Shit!
- Nice work, Thomas.
- Can you see anything?
- Yeah.
Some furry things are hanging down from the ceiling.
And there's a shotgun.
We're on our way to where a bear was just found shot.
Could he have been the shooter?
Lord knows where this one came from.
I've checked with every registered bear hunter I know.
None of them shot this one.
The bear population is managed by the state.
So a downed bear like this one causes quite a fuss.
Look at this.
These tracks don't match the way a bear normally walks.
I think someone brought this bear and dumped it here.
- That's weird.
- I agree.
Very weird.
You're from the Wildlife Board.
Finn Haugan, right?
These hunters say those aren't bear tracks.
That's ridiculous.
What else would they be?
There is a bear right there, with tracks all around it.
- But why are they in doubt?
- Ask them!
It's crazy.
We have waited for Hans for hours, but now he's finally moving.
We think he's heading somewhere, and we are going to follow him.
Go!
It looks like he's heading for the ferry.
How long are we going to keep following him?
Can you see what he's carrying?
It's a car tire.
- What's he doing?
- I can't tell.
Three, two, one, and...
Sogn og Fjordane county!
Okay, he's over there.
Just hide here.
We met a little while back.
- Really?
- Thomas, from Volda College.
- Is that...
- Are you following me?
We just want to ask you a couple of questions.
No.
Are you...
What were you doing in Volda?
Did you shoot that bear?
Stay the hell away from me.
Turn that off.
Leave me alone!
Once we get what we need, we can go back.
It would be so awesome to get him to talk.
We have tried, plenty of times.
Do you think Michael Moore gave up after the first try?
Left arm or right foot?
The one you kick with?
We have been here all afternoon.
I think he's sleeping in his trailer.
So now we wait until something happens.
Are you serious?
Okay.
I have to get my sound gear.
What is this?
"No trespassing.
Blasting area."
Did you see that?
Was that a road?
Did you?
This road is horrible.
If we run into a bunch of inbred pig farmers, your ass is first...
- I'm not...
- Stop whining.
- I'm just being honest.
- Want to go back?
- Fine by me.
- That's not what I meant.
Hey, wait for me!
Look here.
I don't think he's in his car.
- So we know he's here...
- But what is he up to?
Here's a trail.
- I hear something in the distance.
- What?
Troll!
Thomas!
Hurry!
My car is right over here!
- What?
- Something bit me!
- Are you all right?
- It stings.
- You heard him yell "troll," right?
- Shut up.
You need some more.
- Can I help?
- There's gauze in the first-aid kit.
- Ow!
Don't...
- We have to get this out.
You look like hell, Thomas.
- What the hell was that?
- Tetanus shot.
You yelled something back there in the woods.
- You heard him, Johanna.
- What's this slime?
What did he say?
- More?
- Yes.
Can you give us a ride to our car?
It isn't very smart to follow me.
Did you yell "troll" out there?
- Is that your car?
- What the hell?
- What happened?
- That's our car!
Someone crushed our car.
It's completely demolished.
Look at this, Thomas.
- Hans, do you understand this?
- I have an idea.
Okay, what...
A bear didn't do this.
What do you think happened?
- What...
- Ask him if a troll did it.
Hey, if you know what happened to my car, you should say so!
- You yelled "troll".
- Forget about that!
What the hell do you want?
You want me to say trolls exist, on film?
- You find that funny?
- No, but you don't actually believe...
If you want a ride, you'd better come right now.
- What should we do?
- I think I'll walk.
You have our bags?
Just so we get this straight:
you actually believe trolls exist?
Why are you so sure it was a bear that attacked you?
What's the matter?
Why are we stopping?
Thanks for giving us a ride.
We'd love to join you, and film what you do.
We'd be very interested.
I'll let you film me killing whatever scratched you, on one condition:
You do exactly as I say, no matter what I say.
Okay?
Yes.
I feel like I'm bleeding everywhere.
- Are you admiring your wound?
- Yuck!
Don't film that!
- You're crazy.
- I'm serious.
- Why call them?
- To tell them where we are.
He isn't dangerous, just weird.
Remember, he runs the show.
We do exactly as he says.
Then we'll get our footage.
No one here believes in God or Jesus?
Nope.
None of us.
Don't look at me.
Serious?
Because they can smell "the blood of a Christian man"?
Is that alright?
Close the gate and hang up that sign.
NO TRESPASSING.
BLASTING AREA.
- Is this a land mine?
- Yes.
But it isn't armed.
I'm sitting on a land mine?
Are you nuts?
Anyone who doesn't want to join me?
Who's changed their mind?
Who's afraid of trolls?
- No.
- No?
Good.
Go down to that creek, take off all your clothes, and scrub yourselves.
- Especially your armpits and groin.
- No way!
- Why?
- To remove any body odor.
Then rub this all over yourselves and your clothes.
- What is that?
- Troll stench.
- Rub it all over your bodies.
- It reeks!
No way.
Forget about it.
You have to smell like a troll, or they'll smell us and run away.
Christ!
- No.
No way!
- I'm not doing this, Thomas.
Forget about it!
You agreed to do exactly as I said.
If you don't do it, I'll go up there alone and leave you here.
Is that understood?
Are you ready?
You're all greased up?
You look cute.
Here, flashlights for you.
- What is that?
- A big flash bulb, basically.
Hans?
That weapon.
How do you use it?
It blasts a powerful ultraviolet beam.
UVB rays.
The same as the sun, or a tanning lamp.
Don't you know sunlight turns them to stone, Thomas?
- Right.
Or they explode.
- Haven't you read anything?
I read fairy tales when I was a kid, but...
Did you know that, Kalle?
So, what do you do if a troll wants to have an eating contest with you?
Eating contest?
Fairy tales usually don't match reality.
They seem to in this case.
- Troll piss.
- Christ!
You can smell it all the way over here.
Listen, I'm hunting a Ringlefinch.
There's piss everywhere.
He's marking.
Looks like he's been chased from his territory.
He seems sick.
I'd like to find out what's wrong with him.
A blood sample from the troll?
I don't have the right equipment.
You too.
Bye.
I need help to find out what's wrong.
But a blood sample...
That won't be easy.
Who were you talking to?
A veterinarian.
A vet!
If you wait here, I'll try to chase the troll out.
Is this what you imagined?
I bet it's going to take him some time to find a troll out there.
I feel sorry for him if he really believes in trolls.
Maybe he's filming us.
- That's probably what he's doing.
- He's somewhere laughing at us.
While we sit here like idiots.
Lingonberry?
- In the woods?
- Yes, with no food or water.
- Cool!
- What?
It's a night-vision camera.
Listen!
That's just him.
One week, or being bitten by a bear.
- It makes for a good story.
- You would look ridiculous!
- So I think I'll choose that.
- Being bitten by a bear?
Do you feel that?
I'm picking up some strange sounds.
What is that?
Seriously.
What's going on?
What is this?
This is one real bad joke.
It's a Tosserlad!
Get the hell out of here!
Run, dammit!
- Did you see that?
- Yes.
Where did it go?
Do you see it?
Get behind my car!
No!
- Give me the camera!
- No!
Where is Johanna?
Thomas!
Kalle!
- Johanna!
- It's real!
I told you so!
I knew it!
They are real!
- Say something.
- It's been turned to stone!
We ran through the woods...
Why the hell did you say that none of you were Christian?
The way that troll sniffed around...
Obviously one of you believes in God.
I don't believe in God.
I sang in a church teen choir...
But that's because my parents forced me to.
I don't believe in God.
I'm serious.
- I can tell it's not her.
- What?
How?
Knock it off.
That was some genetically-engineered monster.
- That's a troll.
- Nonsense!
Question!
Why doesn't anybody know about this?
Because someone doesn't want people to know.
The government?
Is the government behind this?
Do you work for them?
- Why show it to us now?
- Because I'm tired of this shitty job.
I have no rights whatsoever.
I get no night bonus.
No overtime.
No nuisance compensation.
Maybe it's time for a change in troll management.
- So if you could get this on TV...
- That shouldn't be a problem.
Come on.
You want to see more of these, learn what's really going on?
You might want to step back.
Holy shit!
Anyone need some gravel?
Who the hell is that?
- Who is that?
- I don't know.
Hi there.
It's that guy we filmed...
What is this, Hans?
A film crew?
They wanted to see some trolls.
Aren't you that guy from the Wildlife Board?
This is an exceptionally bad idea.
Turn off that camera.
I have enough problems.
The valley is full of dead cattle.
I can't talk about this on film.
Turn off that camera.
- Put it down.
- We're allowed to film here.
- Sure you're on top of this?
- Totally.
As soon as the scapegoat arrives, I will take care of the rest.
PIO TER'S POLISH PAINT SERVICE
The Ringlefinch is still out there.
Then find it!
Two German tourists disappeared last night.
- We expect to lose a few more.
- That isn't my problem.
If you think I'll let you keep those recordings, you're wrong!
It says "Pioter's Polish Paint Service".
What exactly is your job description?
My job is to kill any troll that breaks out of its territory
- and comes near people.
- How often do they break out?
Rarely.
This is a special situation.
Too many trolls are out and about.
Finn is a... bureaucrat.
He works for TSS.
His primary job is to prevent...
To keep people from knowing that trolls exist.
In one sense, you are a true Norwegian hero.
No, you're wrong about that.
There's nothing heroic about what I do.
It's dirty work.
How can no one know about this?
Let's take these recordings, drive to Oslo, and sell them for a fortune.
We can't do that yet.
We have to keep following him.
Finn is pissed off.
- Now what?
- Breakfast.
- You should eat something too.
- I'm not hungry.
I feel a little... nauseous.
How many types of troll are there?
You have two main groups:
mountain trolls and woodland trolls.
The subgroups include Ringlefinch, Tosserlad, Rimetosser.
Mountain Kings.
The Harding, out west.
But that troll we saw...
Do they all have three heads?
No, there are many variations.
The heads develop as they age.
They aren't born with three.
They are usually born with one.
The others appear later.
They only have an eye in the middle, the original, head.
The other heads aren't really heads.
They're a sort of protuberance.
Their function is to scare other trolls.
Or impress the females.
What is that form?
- What does TSS stand for?
- Troll Security Service.
We have to fill out this form after each kill.
Location, gender, whether it blew up or turned to stone...
SLAYED TROLL FORM
In fairy tales, trolls wear clothes and talk like people.
- They're just like people.
- Fairy tales are for kids.
Trolls are animals.
Predators.
They eat, shit and mate.
Eat anything they can.
- How old can trolls get?
- 1000, 1200 years.
- And their intelligence level?
- In the pits.
They are not bright.
They manage to eat.
But how hard is it to survive on rocks?
I once saw a troll try to eat its own tail.
His head between his legs, he tried to suck down his own tail.
He started gagging on it, tipped over and rolled down a hill like a wheel.
- I was a Navy Ranger.
- And that led you to troll hunting?
No, they were looking for someone who could...
- So you're the only one in Norway?
- Yes.
Are we leaving?
- They eat all sorts of crap.
- Do they eat people?
- You want to offer yourself?
- No.
But have they eaten people?
- Are those troll tails?
- Yes.
Some skinned, some whole.
- Why?
- So it smells like troll in here.
Why do you want a troll smell?
So I can approach the trolls without them noticing.
- Tanning lamps?
- Yes.
- You can get skin cancer.
- I use sunscreen.
I have trouble sleeping in the dark.
- Is that what we rubbed on ourselves?
- Yes.
- What is it?
- Concentrated troll stench.
A mixture of all the crap you can squeeze out of a troll.
Let's go find that Ringlefinch before he eats every animal in the county.
Two German tourists were found killed by a bear.
Finn Haugan from the Wildlife Board is investigating the tragedy.
Do you know where the troll might be?
No.
What are you looking for?
Rock slides, toppled trees, things like that.
See anything?
- Do I look like that famous painting?
- Yeah.
Maybe you should see a doctor?
- Do you really feel sick?
- It comes and goes.
- Are we safe here?
- They only come out at night.
Kalle, can't we...
It hasn't been triggered.
Some small trolls have taken the bait.
Concrete and charcoal is an unbeatable combination.
- Do it now!
- Now?
Hans thinks he has found the trail of a Ringlefinch...
Hans thinks he has found tracks.
Some farmers have found sheep carcasses nearby.
Hans thinks there's a link between the two.
Hurry up!
Global warming has led to changes in our flora and fauna.
These tracks you see around here... are from a Russian bear that came through Finland and Sweden.
The bear stores its food here under the bridge.
- Isn't that strange behavior?
- Not for Russian bears.
Due to the long, hard winters, they store their food.
Just like squirrels.
Aren't these tracks a little strange?
That's the left foot.
And the right foot is over here.
Has the bear walked cross-legged?
I assume you have seen bear tracks before.
Hey, what about those tracks?
He's gnawed at the bark.
Typical Ringlefinch behavior.
He'll be back tonight.
I have something to lure him with.
- And then you'll kill him?
- Yes.
But first, I need to get that blood sample.
Is this the syringe?
This is horrible!
It's cruelty to animals.
Cruelty?
He's just using them as bait.
You're too far away.
Move closer.
No, I'll just zoom.
We can see fine from here.
What working hours...
We've been here forever.
Maybe no troll will show up?
- We can see fine from here.
- But we can see better from there!
Come on.
It's here.
Hear that?
Run!
God, I hate this crap!
Keep your distance.
I'm about to toss out some Christian man's blood.
Move back!
Shit!
Kalle!
Thomas!
Move!
Move over!
Are you alright?
Hey...
Are you alright?
Help him up.
- Come on, Hans.
- Are you alright?
Careful with that red button.
Give me the syringe.
Stay up there.
Now we know that trolls also explode.
- How are you doing?
- Fine, thanks.
Could've been worse.
Just a little sore.
A little sore?
This is crazy!
At least I got the blood sample.
I'll be there in a half hour.
Thanks.
Bye.
You look like a newborn!
It's just a film team.
They have some questions.
ARDAL PET CLINIC
- Is that the blood?
- Yes.
- It was quite a struggle.
- I can tell.
You're a mess!
- Thanks.
- There's a bathroom in there.
- What do you see?
- There aren't enough red blood cells.
This will take me a couple of days.
Could we have a short interview?
If you could just stand...
or maybe sit over there.
- What should I tell them?
- Everything.
- We aren't allowed.
- I take full responsibility.
The trolls' main problem is that they can't convert vitamin D from the sunlight, into calcium.
So when they are exposed to bright sunlight, their bodies overreact.
Their stomachs expand.
Gases are forced into their intestines and veins.
This becomes unbearable.
- And they explode?
- They explode.
- But some trolls turn to stone.
- Yes, the older ones.
Their veins are too constricted, so the expansion occurs in their bones.
In a matter of seconds, everything calcifies and they turn to stone.
I wish they didn't have to experience such pain.
It is traumatic for them, even though it only takes a few seconds.
We would have preferred to give them an injection.
- I'll have the results in a few days.
- And you'll call me?
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Ready to go?
- Sure.
- Why all these local newspapers?
- To collect information.
- About what?
- Trolls.
Accidents and things that have happened, that trolls are behind.
- I have files back there.
- Can I take a look?
- "Road disappeared."
- People want natural explanations.
But if you know what to look for, you'll see what's caused by trolls.
This bridge was smashed by a wading troll that bumped his head.
Are there trolls that big?
Yes, the Jotnar.
I'm the only person to have seen one.
There's a mountain troll territory on the Finnmark plateau.
And one on the Hardanger plateau.
Three in Jotunheimen, one in Dovre.
We have to find out where the problem lies.
Jotunheimen is closest.
We are on our way to the first territory Hans wants to check.
At the moment, we are circling around the territory.
The territory ends up here, and because this tire is intact...
Hans says no trolls have left this territory.
If they had left, they would have gnawed on this tire.
Smile!
Film over there.
Trolls love to gnaw on old car tires.
One has tried to kick his way into the good stuff here, but failed.
- How many trolls are there?
- Impossible to say.
You must have some idea?
The gestation period is 10 to 15 years.
And they only have one kid.
- Are they mammals?
- Yes.
Let's see...
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
This looks fine.
All the stones are in the same position.
This is apparently a battle area.
Mountain trolls and woodland trolls often come to blows here.
They throw stones at each other.
But there has been little activity here lately.
The guy behind us is paying.
Isn't that what they say?
Remember that big Jotnar?
They live here in Jotunheimen.
- Where?
- Inside the mountains.
- What are we doing?
- Just wait here.
I ate an entire loaf of bread.
Finn refuses to give in.
He claims all the runaways are from Dovre.
Because he doesn't see any in this satellite photo.
But you can't see trolls in satellite photos!
Let's get to the bottom of this.
We are on our way to a farm that was on the local news recently.
Hans thinks it's troll related.
Wow, look at that!
Did you get that?
- What happened here?
- A tornado.
- Did you see it happen?
- No.
Look at the position of those trees.
They should all point in the same direction.
Who showed you that map?
They didn't say who they were.
But they had fancy weather charts and satellite images.
And we saw what looked like a tornado.
At least three trolls ran though here and continued northward.
How can it be that no one sees huge beasts rampage across a field like this?
We'll come back tonight.
Head into the woods.
I'm tired.
- I don't like this.
- Let's stick together.
Seriously, Kalle.
We have to follow him.
What do you think we should do?
There are tracks further in.
Here's their trail.
They've passed through here.
- We can't stay here alone.
- This way!
An abandoned mine.
- They've been here.
- I'm not going in there!
There aren't any trolls there now.
Come on.
- Are you sure?
- Sure.
No, there's nobody home.
I need the troll stench.
- Here.
- I can take the camera.
Everything okay?
A whole pack of trolls lives here.
This is a lair.
- We can leave.
- Come on, let's get out of here!
Let's go.
Come on!
I'm coming!
Closer to the wall!
Head back inside!
Quick, in here!
Turn off your flashlights!
I have to get out of here.
- Do you have any more troll stench?
- No, not here.
Just relax.
Breathe easy.
Calm down.
- Why are you so nervous?
- I'm Christian!
- We're going to die!
- Damn!
You'd better not start sweating!
Dear Lord...
Shut up!
Run!
Sunlight!
It still works.
There are more in there.
I'll have to get them later.
Mountain Kings.
Why didn't he just say he was Christian?
I have to go to Dovre to find out why they keep running away.
I can give you a ride down, if you want to quit.
- What are you doing?
- Looking for those tapes.
In my trailer?
- Are you filming?
- No.
- It's out of control.
- Why aren't you up there?
I refuse to go into their territory.
There's no way.
- Turn off that camera.
- It's off.
But don't people have a right to know?
- What is your job?
- That's confidential information.
Why don't we have a right to know?
People are dying!
Why is this so secret?
- People have a right to know.
- No.
- Hands off the camera.
- This is none of your business.
Yes, this happens to be my business!
- Get lost!
- This isn't over.
I'm going to check it out.
Do you want to join me?
- Yes.
- Are you ready for that?
- Yes.
- Okay, let's keep on filming.
Let's find a new camera and continue.
Here comes our new camerawoman.
Malica.
- Malica.
- Thomas.
You are not Christian.
- You don't believe in Jesus or God?
- I'm a Muslim.
Excellent.
Muslim is okay, right?
I honestly don't know.
We'll see what happens.
- It must be okay.
- We're filming musk oxen, right?
No, not exactly.
- Let's go.
- Yes, we might as well.
We'll explain on the way.
- Where have you worked?
- Norwegian TV, BBC...
- I just filmed some lions in Tanzania.
- Lions.
Good.
I've never seen anything like this.
Holy shit.
They've broken every single tree over several acres.
I assume what has happened is that a Jotnar has run through here.
A giant, over 200 feet tall, has chased the Dovre trolls down here.
We don't want Jotnars running around.
Give me a break.
Do you all actually believe in trolls?
You think a squirrel rampaged through here?
If only the trolls were happy.
But TSS wants to keep a lid on everything.
Those may look like normal power lines, but they're electric fences to keep the trolls at bay.
I don't know how they broke through.
I'll have to check.
Let's go visit the clowns in charge of the power grid.
- Do they know about the trolls?
- No way.
Have you had any problems up in Dovre?
Yes, you could say that.
You can hang your coats here.
Over here.
Several hundred meters of power line, knocked to the ground. 300,000 volts.
- When did this happen?
- Three weeks ago.
- Do you know how it happened?
- No.
No one does.
Those cables are supposed to withstand hurricanes.
We have no clue.
- Is this a school project?
- Yes.
Volda College.
- Are you a teacher?
- No.
Where does that line go?
It runs from here... then north, in a loop, and back to here.
- So it runs in a circle?
- Yes, exactly.
You don't find that strange?
Maybe a little.
- Yes, it is strange.
- The power leads to nowhere.
Well, it does lead in a circle.
And in a beautiful landscape.
If a Jotnar runs through a power line, something is seriously wrong.
I'd better get up there and try to find it.
The territory starts there.
It's hell to put up new pylons.
Activists and farmers always complain.
I think they're pretty.
Those were placed out here as food for trolls.
This is the territory.
We have been here.
And here.
And no sign of trolls.
I think we should try this area next.
There's a TSS cabin up there where we can wait.
Some scientists say it is caused by natural phenomena, while others more than 1000 quakes registered...
We are in a troll territory now.
You don't seem to like entering these territories.
Is there some particular reason?
There was a mountain troll territory up in Strynefjell.
Back in the '70s they decided to build tunnels through that troll-rich area.
Both the TSS and I tried to object, but to no avail.
I was given the task of going in and exterminating all the trolls.
Every last one.
Pregnant females.
Kids.
Newborns that hadn't even learned to walk.
It was a massacre.
Hans' entire life has revolved around trolls.
Every day has been a struggle with and for trolls.
In many ways, he is a superhero here in Norway.
What would we have done without him?
That makes it all the more important for us to make this movie.
My shoulder.
Are you alright?
The sun will be up in an hour.
Should we go too?
He sounds a bit big, but I'll give it a shot.
It sounds like he's snapped completely.
This could be problematic.
Your phone is ringing, Hans.
- Where is it?
- On my seat.
Thomas speaking.
He's a little busy right now.
Can I...
Rabies?
- That Ringlefinch had rabies.
- Let me talk to Hilde.
Hi Hilde.
Are you sure?
That makes sense.
Okay.
You take care too.
Bye.
I'll bet all the trolls we've met had rabies.
This guy has spread it to the Ringlefinches and Mountain Kings.
- And even to you, Thomas.
- Me?
I don't have rabies.
Hello!
Dogs have rabies.
If you have rabies, you have to get to a hospital.
If you think he has rabies, he needs medical attention!
I don't have rabies.
You can't just say I have rabies!
If so, we need a hospital now!
- That beast is on its way.
Get inside!
- I couldn't care less!
- We can't stay in here.
- Look!
Is it coming this way?
Go outside?
Are you crazy?
He's leaving!
Don't move!
I'll try to lure him this way.
What a friend we have in Jesus...
What is he doing?
What's happening?
The flash ran out of power.
Definitely rabies.
Can we go to the hospital now?
- No, he needs a few more doses.
- What are you talking about?
But first I have to wear him out.
He's closing in on us!
- Now we're getting away!
- Good.
- There's somebody up ahead!
- Stop, Hans!
- Get in!
- Hurry, dammit!
Go!
Go!
- Where are you going?
- Stay here!
- Hans!
- Get back inside!
Oh my God!
Get back in the car!
- Who are you?
- A seismologist.
I have to get in front of him.
Look out!
Is it on?
Hans, what are you doing?
I have to give him the finishing blow!
- With that?
- Yes.
I hope you have all the footage you need.
This road will lead you to the highway.
There's no more roaring!
Malica...
Stop fooling around.
That's troll on tape.
Here is the footage.
Am I bleeding?
What did you say?
- Are you okay?
- Sure, I'm fine.
Look!
Over there!
Isn't that Finn and the others?
Shit, it's Finn.
Give me the camera!
Thomas, what are you doing?
The recordings end here.
No body was ever found in the mine and the teenagers behind the recordings have vanished without a trace.
We strongly encourage anyone with information about their fate to contact Filmkameratene AS or your nearest police station.
It has been impossible to get the Government to confirm the existence of the Troll Security Service.
However, an indirect confirmation was given during Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg's biannual press conference in Oslo on June 25, 2010.
The press didn't get the point.
We want to protect the Norwegian environment as best we can.
Few people find power grids attractive.
I certainly don't.
Norwegians are pro electricity, but against power lines.
That won't work in the long run.
Norway has trolls, so more power lines are needed.
- That's just the way it is.
- That's a wrap!

Miss Bennett, yesterday in court, you received an order to be paroled into foster care, which made you eligible since you won't tllm 15 fOl' 3 few fTlofllhS.
Right?
Uh-huh.
Don't "uh-huh" her.
What?
I know you know better.
She knows better.
Mmm-hmm.
Okay, now, Mrs. Daniels, you do understand that as Maria's appointed foster parent, you take full responsibility of this minor?
Do I €V€I'.
Okay.
That's it.
That's it?
Yes, it is.
Just follow the yellow line down to the exit.
And good lu¢I_
Thank you.
Thank you so very much.
Thank you.
I was talking to Maria.
All right, follow me.
Going to come out here, and we are going to put you to work.
Great.
Okay.
Let'S start with these.
An right.
And let's set a couple of rules.
Like what?
Like curfew at 9:00, and you're not allowed to hang out with your old crew.
You ain't got to worry about that.
They ditched me a while back.
Any more rules?
Well, not a rule, but I would like you to start thinking about your future,
Like, what do you wanna do with your life?
If it was up to me...
VVl'\3ll€V€I".
It doeSr'I"[ matter.
What about your dancing?
You used to love that.
Look, I got to get a real job.
It's not like I can make any money dancing,
Excuse me?
Honey built this studio with her dance career.
We all can't be like your daughter, Mrs, Daniels.
Well, if anybody could be, it'd be you.
What have you...
Give me that!
This ain't no mirror cleaning.
Now, see, your problem is, you are not motivated,
Now, look at that.
That is what a mirror's supposed to look like.
No, come on.
Please, Maria.
Oh, come on.
Maria, please.
Please.
What?
I don't think you working here is a good idea.
Why?
You want to heal' me num?
I don't trust you anymore.
Okay?
Mr. Kapoor, you know me.
I messed up one time.
One time!
You know what they say.
Once you go bad, you never go back.
Wait, no.
It's... it's once you go "black," you never go back.
But that makes no sense.
How can you go...
Is that what they really say?
Hmm.
I'll try 10 I'€mEfT'Ib€I' that.
Besides, Maria, I'm running a business here, not a charity, okay?
I'd really like to help you, but I just can't.
All right, maybe not.
But I can help you out.
Right?
And hows mar?
Hey!
Put it back.
Put what back?
I ain't got nothing.
Yeah?
Damn!
HOW did that get in there?
I saw you take the bracelet, too.
Hey!
Nobody steals from Kapoor!
Big Lester, grab him!
Grab him!
Big Lester, did you see him?
It was just her.
Oh, God.
These frigging kids.
Now, tell me, how did you know she was stealing?
When she walked in, I just had this feeling something was up.
Mmm.
Maybe I cound use you here after all.
So, I go!
the job?
Yes, but on a trial basis.
Okay.
If you screw up...
Whoop!
Outside, okay?
Out, yeah.
Thank you.
Can you start today?
I see you ain't lost your sexy.
Damn it, Luis.
How did you get in here?
The place is locked.
Since when has that stopped me?
What do you want?
I heard you were here, and I wanted to see you.
Well, you saw me.
Now leave.
Ll'S like that, huh?
Yeah.
I thought we could hang out.
Maybe catch up.
That's what you get for thinking.
You sun tripping off mar stuff mar happened?
Did you really just ask me that?
You need to get out of my face.
What did you expect me to do, Maria?
It ain't like we would've shared a cell.
You did juvie.
I would've got real time.
Hen, what I got felt rean to me.
And I wouldn't have even been there if it wasn't for you.
So, what do you want me to say?
Look, I'm sorry.
Oh, well.
There it is.
Ll makes il Ell Deffel' HOW.
Ldidn'I Come hSl'€ to fight.
I got some good news.
What?
You heard about the 718?
What about them?
Well, we won the Dance Battle Zone competition.
So?
So, I want you to come back and dance with us.
Yo, we missed you, and we still got mad love for you.
Yeah, I've had your kind of love.
And you can keep it.
Look, I've changed.
I ain't caught up in all that bullshit anymore.
I've been straight since you left.
No hustling or stealing!
I don't believe you.
Then let me prove it to you.
I know you still want to be a real dancer.
I can make that happen.
You know what?
I think you should leave.
Rigm now.
Okay.
I won't push.
But do me a favor, just Ihink about it.
Okay?
Goodbye, Luis.

All right!
Damn.
Crazy woman.
Ta-da!
Ls that for me?
Of course!
Bui don't get used 10 it.
Now, you may be living in Bay Ridge now, but room service is a one-time only thing.
Thanks, Mrs. Daniels.
You're welcome.
Now, don't you feel bad for cursing me out?
Oh, I was having a nightmare,
YO, SOD.
What?
Damn!
That's got to be the finest janitor ever.
Hen, yeah.
And you know what?
I think she needs some of this pimping right here,
Darnell, don't do this to yourself, man.
You got no swag and no chance with that.
Come on.
Watch me, kid.
Darnell.
I'm telling you, man...
Excuse me, sweetheart?
An right.
Excuse me, miss?
You are far too fine to be sweeping these floors.
What if I told you I could change your life if you just take my hand?
Uh.,.
What?
Can't speak?
I'm waiting for the punch line.
That was a joke, right?
Uh,
Awkward.
Yeah.
Of course.
Okay.
Yeah.
All jokes.
I'll let you do what you do.
YOU are me Wol'S\.
What?
You couldn't have did it, man.
Hey, boys!
Hey!
Whoo!
Jump in there!
Whoa, whoa!
Can I help you?
Not you, her.
$38.75.
Pay up.
What?
I don't even know...
That's how much you owe for the stuff you tried to steal, the mess you caused and that bracelet.
You better get out of my face!
What are you going to do?
First, you need to check your tone.
This is my cousin.
And please believe I will break your little, skinny ass in half.
I wasn't talking to you!
You belief back Off!
Cool it!
I got this chick.
Back Off!
Tina, stop!
Stop.
Look, now, I don't know who you are, but you can't just roll up here and harass my crew.
She's a thief.
I caught her shoplifting.
You did that, Tina?
Brandon!
Who are you going to believe?
Me or this janitor?
I'm sure the janitor has a name.
Who are you?
Don't worry about who I am.
Just keep your little hoodrat on a leash.
Damn!
I know that chick.
Her name's Maria, She used to dance with Luis and them.
The 718?
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, okay.
No, Carla's right.
Yo, she was fire.
Anyway.
I ain't thinking about them.
All right, it's over.
Let's get back to work.
Word.
Word.
MARIOZ The winning crew WU!

So, if your crew thinks the;/'re the next B-Z champs, go online now for auditions near you.
And we'll see you next week on Battle Zone.
Go hard or go home!
I can't believe this show is making celebrities out of these thugs.
They're the best crew out right now.
I just wish I had...
Maria...
Don't wait up.
Hey.
You stalking me or something?
Me?
Stalking you?
Nor hardly.
Damn, I was kidding, gm.
You always this rude, Maria?
How'd you know my name?
It's on your necklace.
Come on, you want to dance?
No, thanks.
Wow.
What, are you scared?
Scared you might like me?
Or scared you can't hang?
I knew you'd come back to me.
Not even.
Hold up.
The crew is here.
Come hang out with us.
No, thanks.
What's your problem?
Look, I'm just trying to stay out of trouble.
That's all.
We did more than just get into trouble, remember?
Hey, back off, all right?
I'm here with someone.
Who?
I got to go.
Hey!
Hey,
Do me a favor.
What's up?

Just ignore him.
What's wrong?

I can hang.
L.€I'S 566.
Why you all up in our business?
Go find your own chick.
That's my girl!
No, I ain't.
This fool.
So, are we going out tonight?
What?
No!
Not today, boo.
No, no.
What you mean?
Yo, hey, look, for real.
Hey, you're wack.
Hey, what the hell was Ihai?
It was tomorrow's schedule until you made me ruin it.
I'm talking about last night when you played me.
No, I didn't.
I almost got in a fight over you with that fool Luis, and then you baild on me?
What's up with thai?
It's a long story, and I don't want to talk about ii.
That's it?
Pretty much.
Whatever.
You owe me.
I don't owe you anything.
Come with me.
I have 10 finish my board!
...And just all up in my business like, "Who are you?"
Yo, what is she doing here?
Okay.
I want you to show them how you danced last night.
You're kidding me, right?
No, I'm serious.
Do it.
TI nal What's ihe matter?
Are you afraid to dance?
YOU look SCEFSU IO me.
Yo, maybe she can help clean us up.
She can give me a bath any day,
Just what I thought.
This trick ain't got nothing but a big mouth.
An right.
Play the music.
Damn!
That was the business!
Damn, boo, you are the truth!
Carla, really, you got to stop talking like that to people,
What, college boy?
I mean, she knows how I meant it.
Girls can say that to each other, all right?
Lt'S like when black folks call each other "my... "
Quit it while you're behind.
Baby, stop.
Lail"I'll ever seen 8 New York Clal'1CeF that Could turf like that.
Did you live in Cali or something?
No.
I learned it from this girl I used to know.
You think you can teach us how to do it?
Really?
What happened to, "I'm going to break your ass in halt"'?
Yeah, that was before I saw you dance, though.
Whatever, Lyric.
We don't need her.
I think we do, Tina, because I've never seen you get down like that.
So, you interested?
No, thanks.
Why not?
YOU'I'€ here an me time.
What you got to lose?
Is cleaning toilets keeping you busy?
I bet she's going Crawling back to the 718.
Girl, if I wasn't on probation..
Ooh!
What would you do?
You know what?
I'm just not interested.
Hey, what's going on?
It's the 718.
They're buying everybody slices.
When why?
They always do stuff like that,
Last time, they handed out school supplies.
My moms really loved that, but I'd rather have the pizza.
YOU'I'€jUSI in time.
For whai?
What is all Of this?
What does it look like?
We take care of our own, Ma.
I mean, if not US, who will?
So, this is what you meant when you said you changed?
Yeah, part of it.
I'm trying to do right, at least.
Didr'I't Seem like it last night.
Man, I was just having some fun.
Hey, did you eat yet?
No.
Thefl Com inSid€.
Difll'1El"S On me.
Thanks, but no.
I'm just trying to feed you, I ain't trying to get you pregnant.
Okay.
But I'm not staying long.
Do you remember your cousin's wedding?
Yo, you got so lit.
I wasn'I too buzzed to catch the bouquet, though.
Right.
After you knocked over the old lady and the flower girl.
Oh, my gosh, it was an accident!
Nobody got hurt.
The flower girl lost a tooth, Maria.
It was already loose.
And I gave her the bouquet to make up for it!
True.
True.
Okay, then.
Oh, man.
You know, after a while, the DJ wasn't that bad.
We danced for a while after everybody left.
It was nice, though.
I thought about that night a lot when I was gone.
Have you thought about coming back to the crew?
I'm so tempted.
You know how much dancing means to me.
Come dance with us tomorrow.
I know once we get back at it, it'll be just like Old times.
That's what I'm afraid Of.
Hey, you know I got you.
Wow.
So, this is where it all goes down.
Let's show her how we rock the 718.
So, are you ready to join in?
Man, it feels good to have you back.
It just seems right.
You feel me?
Yeah.
It made me realize how much I miss being with our crew,
Is that all you missed?
You know, we could have it all now.
I just wish you would've listened to me back in the day,
Are you blaming me for what happened?
Don't sweat it.
We can start all over.
Yo, we got company.
Let's go!
Let's go!
What are you doing?
Hold this.
What are you doing?
Relax.
What up, Luis?
What's u p, homes?
What you got for us tonight?
Same thing I got for you every night.
Nothing.
We can play ii that way, too.
I know you got something.
Nope.
He's clean.
We'll get him next time.
The fool is bound to slip up.
You must have a thing for losers, huh, baby?
You two have a good night.
Are you okay?
BESKHFU!
You lied to me!
Listen, you don't understand.
li'S just a Side hustle!
Li's how I'm able to do the good shit
I do around here and give back!
Don't you see that?
They don't care about us.
We got to do for ourselves.
Me and you.
No!
Not me.
Not anymore.
I don'\ want ii.
Hey,
Hey,
I'll dance with your crew on one condition.
Yeah, what's that?
We get on Battle Zane and we beat the 718.
Wait, hold up.
You're trying to use us to get revenge?
That, and part of the grand prize is that your choreographer gets an internship.
That'S the kind of break I need.
Who said you were going to take over our choreography?
I mean, we could use the help.
Rigm now, we're just winging it.
Her Stuff could push us over the top.
Au right, so can we get started?
No, see, you're tripping.
AUdmOl'1S BTS if the end of the month.
Let's do this.
BRANDON;
Tina, Lyric.
Part of the grand prize is $100,000.
I know we could all use that money, but with your grandma's medical expenses, I thoug ht.,.
Why you got to put us on blast?
No, I'm not.
Look, you know I got your back, always.
And if you really don't want her in, just say the word and I'm down.
But I think we should do it for Grandma.
I do.
And if I say no, I'm the bad guy, right?
Pretty much.
All right, Fine, she's in.
Yeah!
But if she gets in my face again, I'm going to cut her.
With what?
Your razor sharp wit?
My what?
I just said yes to you to get in my crew.
dof't'1i'lalk to ITIS like that.
All right.
Five, six, seven, eight.
It's one, two, three, four, five, six and seven, eight.
One, two, three...
One, two, yep, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
You guys got to trust that the guys have your back.
And you guys need to turn, and you guys need to know that they're coming.
Three and four, five and six, and seven, eight.
One, two, four, six, eight,
Are you serious?
Get up!
Ge!
up!
Carla, pay attention!
Whoa!
Oh, my God!
This is So Stupid.
I'm not into it, right?
Yo, can we just stop arguing for two seconds and focus?
How are we supposed to know what we're doing if we can't even see?
That's the whole point.
You guys are using your eyes and those mirrors as crutches.
You need to learn how to trust your instincts.
Trust each other.
Think you can do il?
Just turn the damn music on already.
Shit.
Watch ii!
Whoa!
That was dope.
That was amazing, yo!
All right, y'all ready to go full out?
I_6ll'S do if..
Whoo!
All right, HD!
That was dope.
I got to hand it to you, girl.
You're really getting us there.
I feel like we might even have a shot to win this thing.
We'll See!
We're going to need to come a lot stronger than this,
I know that much.
Wow!
What is your problem?
I guess I can't help telling the truth.
My bad.
Hey, I like what you're doing.
Keep it up, and all the haters are going to have left is hate.
I appreciate that.
Later, y'all.
PSHCG.
Same time tomorrow, B?
Yep.
Fife me.
Later, D. You got it, bro.
Bye,
Don't listen to Tina.
She talks a lot of smack, but she's a good girl.
Yeah, it's not her smack talk that pisses me off.
I think she might be right.
Was Tina right when she said that you're trying to win this thing to get back at Luis?
Notjust Luis.
It's like, most of my life, people told me I'd never be anything.
So, what is it you wanted to be?
Honestly?
I want to be a dancer.
And I always have.
I think we should go somewhere.
Okay.
Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?
You'll see.
We're going to get cleaned up.
Yeah.
Yeah, watch, watch.
Whoo!
How did you know about all those places?
I'm a dance major at NYU.
And part of our curriculum is to experience the arts.
My head is just busting with ideas right now.
All the stuff we could do, like mixing the stuff we saw.
You know what I mean?
Like, if we go...
Barn!
Bam!
Bam!
Bam!
You know?
Thank you!
Do you even realize what you do with your choreography?
It's like you're telling this beautiful story.
What?
"Beautiful"?
Yeah, I said it.
Beautiful.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing.
Just, if that's the way you step to girls, your game is pretty weak.
You might want to take some lessons from Darnell.
What?
Are you serious?
Yeah!
Darnell?
Okay, I would never do that, first of all.
Second, I bet I do know what impresses you.
What?
What?
What are you doing?
Yo, yo, what up, Ma?
You dig my swagger now?
Or you still fronting like you stunting?
I'm just saying, shawty.
What's a brotha got to do to get with you?
You need to quit.
Quit what?
Quit this?
Oh, ay!
Ay!
Uh, uh!
Ooh!
Pow!
How you like me now?
No, I liked you beflel' bEfo\'E,
Yeah?
Yeah.
Just go back to your college boy ways.
They're starting to grow on me.
Word?
Yes, word.
Stupid.
Ll'S I'liC€.
YGS,
Maria?
What?
I still think you're beautiful.
Whal else?
Okay, you're going to make me earn this kiss, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Your smile.
I mean, you don't give it up much, but when I catch one,
I just want to make you happy.
Oh,
Now what?
Now, I want you to look at me like I'm the only girl in this world.
I've been doing that since the first moment I saw you.
Okay.
Can I kiss you now?
You really need to kiss me now.
It's another beautiful day here in New York City.
Lef'S heat if up just 5 little m0f'9 with Reflejo de Luna.
Maria!
What are you doing?
The tango!
I know what ii'S called.
What I want to know is why are you doing it when you're supposed to be working?
Mr. Kapoor, you work too hard.
Do you know what you need?
Yes, an employee who doesn't tango with brooms.
No, you need to dance more.
No, thank you.
I only dance at the funerals of people I hate.
Come on!
Stop being so grumpy all the time.
I'm warning you, Maria.
I have bad knees, arthritis and clogged arteries,
I'll make ii easy for you.
Put your hand here.
And keep your shoulders straight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
NO, that wasn't good.
That was good!
No, I did Shit.
You killed it!
Hey!
What are you doing here?
I wasn't expecting to see you until later.
Wen, I thought maybe we can get a bite to eat before rehearsals.
Okay.
And I wan!
to talk to you about something.
Why?
I just found out they moved my finals to the same day as the audition.
YOU have fin8lS in GBHCG?
No, I'm a double major.
I got dance, and I got business,
These are my business exams.
I'm sorry.
I hate that I have to miss it, Maria.
Rm going to be with you guys every step of the way, leading up until the audition.
WS CED do \his.
It's fine.
One, two, three, four, five and six, seven, eight.

Relax them.
Who are you shooting?
Relax them.
This is So stupid.
Tina, lei's just finish it.
It's not stupid, Tina.
Okay, look, I studied the show.
All the past winners are well-rounded.
This will help us.
Right.
And with this new style, it's like we've been dipped in culture.
That's one thing I know the 718 doesn't have.
Culture.
Dipped.
Dipped in culture.
I don't think so.
Come on, it's a good thing.
This stuff will help us.
Come on.
Fine.
Quit whining.
Stop.
Pick me!
That'S ii!
Let's go now!
I said, "My brothers"!
Break it down.

Welcome to the Dance Battle Zone.

That's us, 542.
You're up next.
Come on, guys.
We can do this.
I C3n'I believe they lei Luis sit in Ol'13Udili0f1S.
Just ignore him.
Let's see.
HD Crew, right?
You're out of the Honey Daniels Center.
IS that what the HD stands for?
No.
No, it stands for "High Def. "
Like, clear.
In your face.
Well, Honey Daniels is amazing.
Y'all have got some big, big shoes to fill.
I could tell you righi now, you're just wasting your time.
JONAS;
What, you know them, Luis?
Just her.
She couldn't quite cut it with our crew,
SO I cut her IOOS€.
Why you got to lie?
Yo, can we get this audition going, or what?
Yes, you can.
I do love the drama, though.
Lei'S do it!
All right.
Come on, y'all.
I'm going to show you.
Thank you, but it's a "no," kids.
Sorry.
Maybe next year.
You guys are wack.
I tried to Yell you, Maria, You're just not good enough.
And those two new dancers ain't going to save you either.
Now, beat it.
Get out of here.
Get out.
Beat it!
NO!
NO,
Sweetie, don't make this difficult on yourself.
We're doing it again.
Well, well, well.
Now, this just got more interesting.
Listen, we've decided that because of your dancing and the obvious tension between you and my boy Luis here, that this Should make for great television.
HD, welcome to the Battle Zone.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We did it.
That was insane.
It was nuts.
Not just the way we made the show, but the way you stood up to those judges.
I mean, you were like, "Hell no!
Y'all are going to check us out!"
Okay, I just wanted our crew to have a fair shot.
I give you mad props for that.
We finally feel like a real crew, you know?
And that wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you.
I respect that.
You're welcome.
You can take that one to them.
I'll get the other one.
Okay.
Make them save me a slice, though,
I will.
I'm in.
So, where's Brandon at?
I texted him.
He must still be taking his finals.
Finals?
He could've skipped those to come celebrate, man.
You don't skip finals, bro.
That's why they call them finals,
The boy is trying to get his edu-macation on.
That don't make him any different than the rest of us.
We all just want to dance for a living.
Yeah, but we don't all have filthy rich parents like he does.
What are you talking about?
His family owns half Of Texas.
You didn't know?
His family makes the Hiltons look like the Hammers.
Can't touch this.
Really_ Really?
He's good with kids, too.
He te8Cl'1€S 3 class with kids?
Yeah.
Once a week.
You didn't know that either?
What do you know?
Let me ask you a serious question.
Do y'all actually ever talk or just bone?
She just be like...
Shake it, baby!
Yo, Carla.
Check it out.
CARLAl Oh, uh-uh.
She is about to be sleeping with the enemy.
Good stuff today.
Thank you.
Watching you move was amazing.
Stop it.
Hey, I'm serious.
Tina, is he bothering you?
No, he was just telling me how much he liked our audition.
No, I said I like your audition.
You're the one who brings the heat to this group.
Tina, did he tell you that you're too good for us and that you should be dancing with his crew?
Yeah, he did, but...
Tina, he's trying to play you.
Hey, calm down.
I told him I would stay with the HDS.
Wen, good.
But you act like I ain't even good enough to dance with them.
I diunw say mar.
Sounds like that's what she's saying to me.
You know what?
Stop starting trouble.
Leave our crew alone.
Tina, are you going to let her dis you like that?
I mean, I know if someone in my crew called me out, we'd battle on the spot.
Wow!
I am not calling her out.
And if we're going to battle, we're going to do it as a crew and take your sorry ass out.
And what's stopping you?
What's stopping you?
See that, Tina?
She's scared.
She's scared!
If you were on the 718, baby, you wouldn't run from nothing.
Whatever.
Maria, we got to do this, okay?
We're finally getting some props, and it's time to back it up.
Tina, are YOU sure?
Yeah, I'm as sure as you were in that audition.
That's pretty sure.
Tina's right.
If we aren't going to knock heads, we got to do something.
Hen, yeah!
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah.
Mmm?
Fine.

You call this a crew?
Are you serious?
And you actually think you're going to take us out on Battle Zone?
Toys.
Tina, when you're ready to grow up, come holler at your boy.
Yo, I was wrong.
We ain't no damn crew.
We're just some posers.
Tina, we tried...
But our try wasn't good enough, ain't never good enough!
We got humiliated!
Nobody is going to respect us after this.
Nobody!
Wait, Tina!
Leave me alone!
Tina!
Tina!
YOU'I'S IE\€.
Do I have to remind you what time your curfew is?
I know what time my curfew is,
You know what?
We made rules in this house, and they are going to have to be followed.
Or what?
You're going to send me back to juvie?
Fine.
What is the matter with you?
I'm just sick of trying.
I try and live by your rules.
I try and stay out of trouble.
I try and join a new crew.
And nothing works.
Well, it doesn't mean you have to give up.
Save it.
I'm going to bed.
Hey,
Where you been?
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't get much sleep last night.
What's going on?
Tina quit.
She said she's not coming back.
What the hell?
Do you know what this does to our choreography?
Of course we do!
But I'm...
Bun nothing!
This screws everything up!
Don't take it out on Lyric.
I'm not taking it out on Lyric.
I'm pissed!
So, what do we do?
You tell us.
You're the choreographer.
You know what?
I don't need this right now.
I'm out.
Weil, that's messed up.
What?
A Sf feel bafue?
What were you thinking?
Didn't you know losing would ruin their confidence?
I'm sorry, college boy, I'm not as smart as you.
I didn'1 know that
Well, you should have.
And you should have told me you were just some rich kid slumming it down here for grades.
Now, what does my family's money have to do with any of this?
Makes ii all just a game for you.
If things fall apart, you can just leave, buf the FSSI Of US SFS stuck h€I'S to deal with ii.
In case you haven't noticed, I'm Still here.
You're the one that walked out.
Because i'I['S over!
I quit!
We can't win without Tina!
Fine, If that's the way you feel, then you should quit.
I'm going to go up there with my crew, because I believe in us.
Mafia.
Are you okay?
Yeah. why?
Today's your day off.
What can I say?
I'd rather be here than anywhere else.
Oh, Maria.
Let'S talk.
Let's talk.
You got to follow your heart, Maria.
Is there a problem at home or with your friends?
Both.
And this is how you deal with it?
Come to work?
Yeah.
Huh.
Good.
Why, because you get free labor?
Of course.
But I was thinking, Maria, instead of getting yourself into trouble, you chose to do something constructive.
I like that.
Well, while I'r'r'I being constructive, is there anything else you want me to do?
You go work your register, and I'll take care of this later,
You said no one works the register but you,
What, you expect me to take your word for it that you were going to change?
NO,
I had to wait for you to prove it, and you have.
So, now I trust you.
Thanks, Mr. Kapoor.
That means a lot.
Five, six, seven, eight.
An right.
Try it again.
Five, six, seven, eight.
An right.
So, you're back now?
Why new
I still got to do my community service here anyway.
Right.
Hey,
Hey, nook.
I want to be here, if that's okay with you.
Whatever.
Uh-uh.
Yo, is that Tina?
Okay, I'm just going to go ahead and say it,
Shit!
She joined up with the 718.
That's scandalous, man.
How's she going to play us like that?
Because she only thinks about her damn self, that's how.
We can't sweat this right now, guys,
He's right.
We need to focus Ol'1 \I'1iS CFGW.
So, let's rock this thing, all right?
Bring it in.
Let's get an HD on three, an right?
One, two, three...
HD!
MARIO!
Every S€3SOf1 OD BB"/G ZOITS, we find Ihe hottest, IT'loS\ il'IS3I'l€ CTGWS OH the SCSIIG, and last season was no different.
The 718 set this place on fire with their off-the-chain routines, and at the end of this season, you're going to see them perform against the last crew standing.
There's already been some behind-the-scenes madness with one crew jacking another for a dancer, and we haven't even started yet.
So, what's jumping off next?
Stay tuned, because you don't want to miss Battle Zone.
One of these crews is going home tonight.
Judges, who will it be?
Well, it's obvious that this year's talent is amazing, but, unfortunately, somebody has to go.
And rumgnr, it's Fanny Pak.
Sorry, guys.
ALL;
Ah!
Ah,
I'm sorry to see those guys go.
They were a hot crew.
Yeah, but they weren't the best.
And you have got to be the best if you're gonna go up against the 718.
Enough said.
We'll see you next week in Battle Zone.
Come on, we just killed it!
Yeah, we're still in.
WE I'1S€d\0 iaik.
No, we don't.
Look, I know you think you know what you're doing, but you don't.
You need to stay away from Luis.
He said you were going to say something like that.
Trying to get me back in the crew?
Look, he's right, we need you.
But more importantly,
I don't want to see you get caught up.
You don't know him like I do.
I know he's my best chance at winning that prize money.
Can you guarantee me that?
Yeah, I didn't think 50,
Wait.
For what?
I ain't coming back to your crew.
Then, just be careful.
Can I talk to you for a second?
What do you want?
Lrll only rake E SECOHU.
Come on.
Whats up?
Let me take Tina's place.
Right.
I mean it.
I'll come dance with you if you kick Tina off your crew.
What changed your mind all Of a Sudden?
I know what I'm getting into with you.
Tina doesn't.
And since when did you become a teenage crisis counselor?
You know I'm a better dancer than her, and I can pretty much guarantee you another win.
That's true.
There's just one little problem.
hat'S that?
Come here.
Come close.
I don't trust you, witch.
Ever since you got out ofjuvie, you've been full of yourself and treating me like I'm something you scraped off your shoe.
But, you see that little girl over there?
She has stars in her eyes.
And I can make her do anything I want.
You're a jerk.
Do you know that?
You used to like it.
You tried to fix it, didn't you?
You were listening?
I had to make sure you were okay.
Yeah, I'm good.
Ijusi feel bad.
Tina being with them is all my fault.
NO,
Til'1a'S SIUbbol'fl.
That's her fauli.
But thanks for trying to protect her.
I just want the crew to go back to the way it was, you know?
I do, too.
Hey, do me a favor.
Don't be mad at me anymore, because I'm too tired to fight.
N19 too.
Yeah, the movie was good, but real talk, could you stop killing us in rehearsals?
No, I have to.
We've got to make it to the finals.
We got to be strong enough to win.
You can hang, can't you, college boy?
Oh, I can hang.
Okay, then.
So, say my name.
College boy?
Okay, say it.
Okay, okay!
Brandon!
"Brandon," all right?
Are you happy now?
Very h3PPY-
Do you hear that?
Yeah.
Just wait rig hi here.
Maria, come here.
Tina, are you okay?
MARIA;
Hey, what happened?
Did Luis do this to you?
No, it was his boys.
They beat you up?
No.
Luis told them to walk me home, and then they smashed a store window and told me to grab stuff.
And did you?
I WGS 100 SC3l'€d.
There was glass everywhere.
I got all cut up.
I'll take her to my house.
It's okay there.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
I should've listened to you when you told me to stay away from Luis.
Yeah, well, sometimes you just got to learn the hard way.
Yeah, you're right.
So, what are you going to do now?
I'm not messing with Luis no more.
That's for damn sure.
Word.
VVl"liCl"I ITTSSFIS I C3l"I'll dal'1C€ with his Crew either.
Right.
You 'think I could COITIG back to the HDS?
You know that's not how it works.
Yeah.
Hey!
Owl
Are you an right?
Yeah.
All right.
You guys already know my vote.
I say we let Tina back in the crew.
That would be my vote, too,
All right.
Ricky?
Well,
Tina's my homegirl, so, yeah.
I want her back.
All right.
Carla?
Girl, I'm easy.
Ha!
We know that.
You don'\!
Anyways, my vote is yes.
Not because I think you deserve it, Tina, but because I CENT Sfind I.UiS and his CFSW.
An right.
Well, Tina's crazy.
And you know what they say, crazy ass is the best ass.
And the best ass is some crazy ass!
Then that must be my ass.
HEY, QUYS, not the rig ht time.
Okay.
Yeah.
Lyric,
it's on you.
Carla was right, you don't deserve it.
Every single one of us had your back.
You basically spit in our faces.
That was messed up.
Ldidl'1'\ ITISEH ION.
I don't care what you meant.
I only care about what you did.
We were like sisters, Tina.
I would've done anything for you.
Then you leave me, and now you want to come back like we're all cool?
I'm sorry.
I messed up.
YOU messed Up bad.
You're still family, and I'll always love you.
But if you want my trust, you got to earn it,
Just tell me how.
I'll do it.
You can start by getting back in this crew, and help us whoop Luis' ass.
I might need a tissue.
Damn, I think my allergies kicking in or something.
I thought someone was chopping onions up in here,
Besides 718, who else we got to look out for?
That's hard to say.
I mean, some of the best crews from last year will be back.
If. '$ I'10ll fol' the Weak.
We're going to need your toughness, Tina.
YOU mean thai?
You think I'd give you a compliment if I didn'1 mean ii?
Aw!
Aw!
All right.
Okay!
Get off me!
Th3i'S the bUSif\€SS.
You guys, come on.
You got to loosen up.
Those other crews will smell the fear on you, especially the 718.
MARIO!
Join US fl6Xf week, because you don?
want to miss the semifinals on Dance Battle Zone.
There was this girl when I was in juvie, Julissa, and every time we would battle, she'd always come up with something new,
What was she in for?
She tried to kill her stepdad.
Whoa. why?
She didn't say, but we all knew.
Was it scary in there?
Not in a way you could really imagine or I could really describe to you.
It's like feeling alone with hundreds of people around you.
What did they charge you with?
Breaking and entering.
Luis thought he knew his way in and out of a pawn shop.
What he didn't know was sometimes the owner liked to stay late.
Luis heard 3 noise, Fan OUT and left me to deal with a man with the biggest gun I'd ever seen, pointed right in my face.
How did you get hooked up with that guy in the first place?
He used to COFTIG to the C€I'Tll€F.
He gave me attention.
Ldidrl"t really have 8 lot of that SS 3 foster Kid.
What happened to your parents?
They died in 3 Cal' crash.
I was 10.
Shit-
Can we talk about something else?
No disrespect, but,..
An right.
Yeah, lerslake 3 break.
I just need 10 get outside.
Let's go eat.
You all not coming?
We're going to stay back.
Don't do anything I wouldn'\ do!
What exactly wouldn't you do?
Him.
You see, that's messed up.
I didn't even say nothing,
Why you got to come at me like that?
You're asking for it all the time!
God!
I asked you to stay so we could talk.
I mean, there's still a lot I don't know about you.
What do you want to know?
Well, for St3l'I6fS, a dance and business major?
Whal'S ihal about?
My father is the one that's pressing me into finance.
He just doesn't think that there's a future for me in dance.
But the way I look at it is, if we win Battle Zone,
I could go on tour for a year just doing what I love.
And I can go back to school with no regrets.
And it'S like I gave it that shot.
You know what I mean?
I know.
I know what it's like to have people not believe in you,
Is that why you want to win so bad?
It's not even about that, really.
I mean, the people that really count,
Mrs. Daniels.

And let's set a couple of rules.
Like what?
Like curfew at 9:00, and you're not allowed to hang out with your old crew.
You ain't got to worry about that.
They ditched me a while back.
Any more rules?
Well, not a rule, but I would like you to start thinking about your future,
Like, what do you wanna do with your life?
If it was up to me...

We all can't be like your daughter, Mrs, Daniels.
Well, if anybody could be, it'd be you.
What have you...
Give me that!
This ain't no mirror cleaning.
Now, see, your problem is, you are not motivated,
Now, look at that.
That is what a mirror's supposed to look like.
MR. KAPOOR:

Please, Maria.
MARIA:
Oh, come on.
Maria, please.

Okay?
Mr. Kapoor, you know me.
I messed up one time.
One time!
You know what they say.
Once you go bad, you never go back.

But that makes no sense.
How can you go...
Is that what they really say?
Hmm.
I'll try 10 I'€mEfT'lb€I' that.
Besides, Maria, I'm running a business here, not a charity, okay?

Quit it while you're behind.
Baby, stop.
Lail"I'll ever seen 8 New York Clal'1CeF that Could turf like that.

Really?
What happened to, "I'm going to break your ass in halt"'?
Yeah, that was before I saw you dance, though.
Whatever, Lyric.
We don't need her.
I think we do, Tina, because I've never seen you get down like that.
So, you interested?
No, thanks.
Why not?
YOU'l'€ here an me time.

Girl, if I wasn't on probation..
Ooh!
What would you do?
You know what?
I'm just not interested.
Hey, what's going on?
It's the 718.
They're buying everybody slices.
When why?
They always do stuff like that,
Last time, they handed out school supplies.
My moms really loved that, but I'd rather have the pizza.
YOU'l'€jUSI in time.

What does it look like?
We take care of our own, Ma.
I mean, if not US, who will?

Oh, my gosh, it was an accident!
Nobody got hurt.
The flower girl lost a tooth, Maria.
It was already loose.
And I gave her the bouquet to make up for it!
True.
True.
Okay, then.
Oh, man.
You know, after a while, the DJ wasn't that bad.
We danced for a while after everybody left.
It was nice, though.
I thought about that night a lot when I was gone.
Have you thought about coming back to the crew?
I'm so tempted.
You know how much dancing means to me.
Come dance with us tomorrow.
I know once we get back at it, it'll be just like Old times.

Wait, hold up.
You're trying to use us to get revenge?
That, and part of the grand prize is that your choreographer gets an internship.
That'S the kind of break I need.

We're going to need to come a lot stronger than this,
I know that much.
Wow!
What is your problem?
I guess I can't help telling the truth.
My bad.
Hey, I like what you're doing.
Keep it up, and all the haters are going to have left is hate.
I appreciate that.
Later, y'all.
PSHCG.
Same time tomorrow, B?
Yep.
Fife me.
Later, D. You got it, bro.
Bye,
(LAUGHS)
Don't listen to Tina.
She talks a lot of smack, but she's a good girl.
Yeah, it's not her smack talk that pisses me off.
I think she might be right.
Was Tina right when she said that you're trying to win this thing to get back at Luis?
Notjust Luis.
It's like, most of my life, people told me I'd never be anything.
So, what is it you wanted to be?
Honestly?
I want to be a dancer.
And I always have.
I think we should go somewhere.
Okay.
Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?
You'll see.
We're going to get cleaned up.
(MARIA GRUNTS) Yeah.
Yeah, watch, watch.
Whoo!
How did you know about all those places?
I'm a dance major at NYU.
And part of our curriculum is to experience the arts.
My head is just busting with ideas right now.
All the stuff we could do, like mixing the stuff we saw.
You know what I mean?
Like, if we go...
Barn!
Bam!
Bam!
Bam!
You know?
(CAR HONKING)
Thank you!
Do you even realize what you do with your choreography?
It's like you're telling this beautiful story.
What?
"Beautiful"?
Yeah, I said it.
Beautiful.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing.
Just, if that's the way you step to girls, your game is pretty weak.
You might want to take some lessons from Darnell.
What?
Are you serious?
Yeah!
Darnell?
Okay, I would never do that, first of all.
Second, I bet I do know what impresses you.
What?
What?
What are you doing?
Yo, yo, what up, Ma?
You dig my swagger now?
Or you still fronting like you stunting?
I'm just saying, shawty.
What's a brotha got to do to get with you?
You need to quit.
Quit what?
Quit this?
Oh, ay!
Ay!
Uh, uh!
Ooh!
Pow!
How you like me now?
No, I liked you beflel' bEfo'E,
Yeah?
Yeah.
Just go back to your college boy ways.
They're starting to grow on me.
Word?
Yes, word.
Stupid.
Ll'S I'liC€.
YGS,
Maria?
What?
I still think you're beautiful.
Whal else?
Okay, you're going to make me earn this kiss, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Your smile.
I mean, you don't give it up much, but when I catch one,
I just want to make you happy.
Oh,
Now what?
Now, I want you to look at me like I'm the only girl in this world.
I've been doing that since the first moment I saw you.
Okay.
Can I kiss you now?
You really need to kiss me now.

Maria!
What are you doing?
The tango!
I know what ii'S called.
What I want to know is why are you doing it when you're supposed to be working?
Mr. Kapoor, you work too hard.
Do you know what you need?
Yes, an employee who doesn't tango with brooms.
No, you need to dance more.
No, thank you.
I only dance at the funerals of people I hate.
Come on!
Stop being so grumpy all the time.
I'm warning you, Maria.
I have bad knees, arthritis and clogged arteries,
I'll make ii easy for you.
Put your hand here.
And keep your shoulders straight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
NO, that wasn't good.
That was good!
No, I did Shit.
You killed it!
Hey!
What are you doing here?
I wasn't expecting to see you until later.
Wen, I thought maybe we can get a bite to eat before rehearsals.
Okay.
And I wan!
to talk to you about something.
Why?
I just found out they moved my finals to the same day as the audition.
YOU have fin8lS in GBHCG?
No, I'm a double major.
I got dance, and I got business,
These are my business exams.
I'm sorry.
I hate that I have to miss it, Maria.
Rm going to be with you guys every step of the way, leading up until the audition.

This is So stupid.
CARLA:
Tina, lei's just finish it.
It's not stupid, Tina.
Okay, look, I studied the show.
All the past winners are well-rounded.
This will help us.
Right.
And with this new style, it's like we've been dipped in culture.
That's one thing I know the 71 8 doesn't have.
Culture.
(SOFTLY) Dipped.
Dipped in culture.
I don't think so.
BRANDON:
Come on, it's a good thing.
This stuff will help us.
Come on.
Fine.
LYRIC:
Quit whining.
TINA:
Stop.

Let's see.
HD Crew, right?
You're out of the Honey Daniels Center.
IS that what the HD stands for?
No.
No, it stands for "High Def."
Like, clear.
In your face.
JONAS:
Well, Honey Daniels is amazing.
Y'all have got some big, big shoes to fill.
I could tell you righi now, you're just wasting your time.
JONAS;
What, you know them, Luis?
LUIS:
Just her.
She couldn't quite cut it with our crew,
SO I cut her IOOS€.
Why you got to lie?
Yo, can we get this audition going, or what?
(LAUGHS) Yes, you can.
I do love the drama, though.

(HIP HOP BEATS)
(ALL LAUGHING)
Thank you, but it's a "no," kids.
KATRINA:
Sorry.
Maybe next year.
You guys are wack.
(LAUGHING)
I tried to Yell you, Maria, You're just not good enough.
And those two new dancers ain't going to save you either.

We're doing it again.
JONAS:
Well, well, well.
Now, this just got more interesting.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(PANNNG)
Listen, we've decided that because of your dancing and the obvious tension between you and my boy Luis here, that this Should make for great television.
HD, welcome to the Battle Zone.
(ALL SCREAM JOYOUSLY)
Thank you.
Thank you.
We did it.
That was insane.
It was nuts.
Not just the way we made the show, but the way you stood up to those judges.
I mean, you were like, "Hell no!
Y'all are going to check us out!"
Okay, I just wanted our crew to have a fair shot.
I give you mad props for that.
We finally feel like a real crew, you know?
And that wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you.
I respect that.
You're welcome.
You can take that one to them.
I'll get the other one.
Okay.
Make them save me a slice, though,
I will.
I'm in.
So, where's Brandon at?
I texted him.
He must still be taking his finals.
Finals?
He could've skipped those to come celebrate, man.
You don't skip finals, bro.
That's why they call them finals,
The boy is trying to get his edu-macation on.
That don't make him any different than the rest of us.
We all just want to dance for a living.
Yeah, but we don't all have filthy rich parents like he does.
What are you talking about?
His family owns half Of Texas.
You didn't know?
His family makes the Hiltons look like the Hammers.
(LAUGHING)
Can't touch this.
Really_ Really?
He's good with kids, too.
He te8Cl'1€S 3 class with kids?
Yeah.
Once a week.
You didn't know that either?
What do you know?
Let me ask you a serious question.
Do y'all actually ever talk or just bone?
She just be like...
Shake it, baby!
Yo, Carla.
Check it out.
CARLAI Oh, uh-uh.
She is about to be sleeping with the enemy.
Good stuff today.
Thank you.
Watching you move was amazing.
Stop it.
Hey, I'm serious.
Tina, is he bothering you?
No, he was just telling me how much he liked our audition.
No, I said I like your audition.
You're the one who brings the heat to this group.
Tina, did he tell you that you're too good for us and that you should be dancing with his crew?
Yeah, he did, but...
Tina, he's trying to play you.
Hey, calm down.
I told him I would stay with the HDS.
Wen, good.
But you act like I ain't even good enough to dance with them.
I diunw say mar.
Sounds like that's what she's saying to me.
MARIA:
You know what?
Stop starting trouble.
Leave our crew alone.
Tina, are you going to let her dis you like that?
I mean, I know if someone in my crew called me out, we'd battle on the spot.
Wow!
I am not calling her out.
And if we're going to battle, we're going to do it as a crew and take your sorry ass out.
And what's stopping you?
What's stopping you?
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)
See that, Tina?
She's scared.
She's scared!
If you were on the 718, baby, you wouldn't run from nothing.
Whatever.
Maria, we got to do this, okay?
We're finally getting some props, and it's time to back it up.
Tina, are YOU sure?
Yeah, I'm as sure as you were in that audition.
That's pretty sure.
Tina's right.
If we aren't going to knock heads, we got to do something.
Hen, yeah!
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah.
Mmm?
Fine.

You call this a crew?
Are you serious?
And you actually think you're going to take us out on Battle Zone?
(scoFFs)
Toys.
Tina, when you're ready to grow up, come holler at your boy.
Yo, I was wrong.
We ain't no damn crew.
We're just some posers.
Tina, we tried...
But our try wasn't good enough, ain't never good enough!
We got humiliated!
Nobody is going to respect us after this.
Nobody!
Wait, Tina!
Leave me alone!
Tina!
Tina!
(CROWD JEERING)
YOU'l'S IE€.
Do I have to remind you what time your curfew is?
I know what time my curfew is,
You know what?
We made rules in this house, and they are going to have to be followed.
Or what?
You're going to send me back to juvie?
Fine.
What is the matter with you?
I'm just sick of trying.
I try and live by your rules.
I try and stay out of trouble.
I try and join a new crew.
And nothing works.
Well, it doesn't mean you have to give up.
Save it.
I'm going to bed.
Hey,
Where you been?
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't get much sleep last night.
What's going on?
Tina quit.
She said she's not coming back.
What the hell?
Do you know what this does to our choreography?
Of course we do!
But I'm...
Bun nothing!
This screws everything up!
Don't take it out on Lyric.
I'm not taking it out on Lyric.
I'm pissed!
So, what do we do?
You tell us.
You're the choreographer.
You know what?
I don't need this right now.
I'm out.
Weil, that's messed up.
What?
A Sf feel bafue?
What were you thinking?
Didn't you know losing would ruin their confidence?
I'm sorry, college boy, I'm not as smart as you.
I didn'1 know that
Well, you should have.
And you should have told me you were just some rich kid slumming it down here for grades.
Now, what does my family's money have to do with any of this?
Makes ii all just a game for you.
If things fall apart, you can just leave, buf the FSSI Of US SFS stuck h€I'S to deal with ii.
In case you haven't noticed, I'm Still here.
You're the one that walked out.
Because i'l['S over!
I quit!
We can't win without Tina!
Fine, If that's the way you feel, then you should quit.
I'm going to go up there with my crew, because I believe in us.
Mafia.
Are you okay?
Yeah. why?
Today's your day off.
What can I say?
I'd rather be here than anywhere else.
Oh, Maria.
Let'S talk.
Let's talk.
You got to follow your heart, Maria.
Is there a problem at home or with your friends?
Both.
And this is how you deal with it?
Come to work?
Yeah.
Huh.
Good.
Why, because you get free labor?
Of course.
But I was thinking, Maria, instead of getting yourself into trouble, you chose to do something constructive.
I like that.
Well, while I'r'r'l being constructive, is there anything else you want me to do?
You go work your register, and I'll take care of this later,
You said no one works the register but you,
What, you expect me to take your word for it that you were going to change?
NO,
I had to wait for you to prove it, and you have.
So, now I trust you.
Thanks, Mr. Kapoor.
That means a lot.
BRANDON:
Five, six, seven, eight.
An right.
Try it again.
Five, six, seven, eight.
An right.
So, you're back now?
Why new
I still got to do my community service here anyway.
Right.
Hey,
Hey, nook.
I want to be here, if that's okay with you.
Whatever.
Uh-uh.
Yo, is that Tina?
Okay, I'm just going to go ahead and say it,
Shit!
She joined up with the 718.
That's scandalous, man.
How's she going to play us like that?
Because she only thinks about her damn self, that's how.
BRANDON:
We can't sweat this right now, guys,
MARIA:
He's right.
We need to focus 0l'1 l'1iS CFGW.
So, let's rock this thing, all right?
Bring it in.
Let's get an HD on three, an right?
One, two, three...
ALL:
HD!
MARIO!
Every S€3S0f1 OD BB"/G ZOITS, we find Ihe hottest, IT'loS il'lS3I'l€ CTGWS OH the SCSIIG, and last season was no different.
The 718 set this place on fire with their off-the-chain routines, and at the end of this season, you're going to see them perform against the last crew standing.
There's already been some behind-the-scenes madness with one crew jacking another for a dancer, and we haven't even started yet.
So, what's jumping off next?
Stay tuned, because you don't want to miss Battle Zone.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
(LOUD CHEERING)
One of these crews is going home tonight.
Judges, who will it be?
Well, it's obvious that this year's talent is amazing, but, unfortunately, somebody has to go.
And rumgnr, it's Fanny Pak.
(SCREAMS JOYOUSLY)
Sorry, guys.
ALL; (DRAMATICALLY) Ah!
Ah,
I'm sorry to see those guys go.
They were a hot crew.
Yeah, but they weren't the best.
And you have got to be the best if you're gonna go up against the 71 8.
MARIO:
Enough said.
We'll see you next week in Battle Zone.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Come on, we just killed it!
Yeah, we're still in.
WE I'1S€dIalk.
No, we don't.
Look, I know you think you know what you're doing, but you don't.
You need to stay away from Luis.
He said you were going to say something like that.
Trying to get me back in the crew?
Look, he's right, we need you.
But more importantly,
I don't want to see you get caught up.
You don't know him like I do.
I know he's my best chance at winning that prize money.
Can you guarantee me that?
Yeah, I didn't think 50,
Wait.
For what?
I ain't coming back to your crew.
Then, just be careful.
Can I talk to you for a second?
What do you want?
Lrll only rake E SECOHU.
Come on.
Whats up?
Let me take Tina's place.
Right.
I mean it.
I'll come dance with you if you kick Tina off your crew.
What changed your mind all Of a Sudden?
I know what I'm getting into with you.
Tina doesn't.
And since when did you become a teenage crisis counselor?
You know I'm a better dancer than her, and I can pretty much guarantee you another win.
That's true.
There's just one little problem.
Nhat'S that?
Come here.
Come close.
I don't trust you, witch.
Ever since you got out ofjuvie, you've been full of yourself and treating me like I'm something you scraped off your shoe.
But, you see that little girl over there?
She has stars in her eyes.
And I can make her do anything I want.
You're a jerk.
Do you know that?
You used to like it.
You tried to fix it, didn't you?
You were listening?
I had to make sure you were okay.
Yeah, I'm good.
Ijusi feel bad.
Tina being with them is all my fault.
NO,
Til'1a'S SIUbbol'fl.
That's her fauli.
But thanks for trying to protect her.
I just want the crew to go back to the way it was, you know?
I do, too.
Hey, do me a favor.
Don't be mad at me anymore, because I'm too tired to fight.
N19 too.
BRANDON:
Yeah, the movie was good, but real talk, could you stop killing us in rehearsals?
No, I have to.
We've got to make it to the finals.
We got to be strong enough to win.
You can hang, can't you, college boy?
Oh, I can hang.
Okay, then.
So, say my name.
College boy?
Okay, say it.
(LAUGHS) Okay, okay!
Brandon!
"Brandon," all right?
Are you happy now?
Very h3PPY-
(GIRL SOBBING)
Do you hear that?
Yeah.
Just wait rig hi here.
Maria, come here.
Tina, are you okay?
MARIA;
Hey, what happened?
Did Luis do this to you?
No, it was his boys.
They beat you up?
No.
Luis told them to walk me home, and then they smashed a store window and told me to grab stuff.
And did you?
I WGS 100 SC3l'€d.
There was glass everywhere.
I got all cut up.
I'll take her to my house.
It's okay there.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
I should've listened to you when you told me to stay away from Luis.
Yeah, well, sometimes you just got to learn the hard way.
Yeah, you're right.
So, what are you going to do now?
I'm not messing with Luis no more.
That's for damn sure.
Word.
VVl"liCl"l ITTSSFIS I C3l"I'll dal'1C€ with his Crew either.
Right.
You 'think I could COITIG back to the HDS?
You know that's not how it works.
Yeah.
Hey!
Owl
Are you an right?
Yeah.
MARIA:
All right.
You guys already know my vote.
I say we let Tina back in the crew.
That would be my vote, too,
MARIA:
All right.
Ricky?
Well,
Tina's my homegirl, so, yeah.
I want her back.
All right.
Carla?
Girl, I'm easy.
Ha!
We know that.
You don'!
Anyways, my vote is yes.
Not because I think you deserve it, Tina, but because I CENT Sfind l.UiS and his CFSW.
An right.
Well, Tina's crazy.
And you know what they say, crazy ass is the best ass.
And the best ass is some crazy ass!
Then that must be my ass.
HEY, QUYS, not the rig ht time.
Okay.
Yeah.
Lyric,
it's on you.
Carla was right, you don't deserve it.
Every single one of us had your back.
You basically spit in our faces.
That was messed up.
Ldidl'1' ITISEH ION.
I don't care what you meant.
I only care about what you did.
We were like sisters, Tina.
I would've done anything for you.
Then you leave me, and now you want to come back like we're all cool?
I'm sorry.
I messed up.
YOU messed Up bad.
You're still family, and I'll always love you.
But if you want my trust, you got to earn it,
Just tell me how.
I'll do it.
You can start by getting back in this crew, and help us whoop Luis' ass.
I might need a tissue.
(SOBBING) Damn, I think my allergies kicking in or something.
I thought someone was chopping onions up in here,
(SOBBING)
(HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
Besides 718, who else we got to look out for?
That's hard to say.
I mean, some of the best crews from last year will be back.
If.'$ I'1Oll fol' the Weak.
(AUDIENCE BOOING)
(LOUD CHEERING)
We're going to need your toughness, Tina.
YOU mean thai?
You think I'd give you a compliment if I didn'1 mean ii?
Aw!
Aw!
All right.
Okay!
Get off me!
Th3i'S the bUSif€SS.
You guys, come on.
You got to loosen up.
Those other crews will smell the fear on you, especially the 71 8.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
MARIO!
Join US fl6Xf week, because you don?
want to miss the semifinals on Dance Battle Zone.
(ALL WHOOPING)
There was this girl when I was in juvie, Julissa, and every time we would battle, she'd always come up with something new,
What was she in for?
She tried to kill her stepdad.
Whoa. why?
She didn't say, but we all knew.
Was it scary in there?
Not in a way you could really imagine or I could really describe to you.
It's like feeling alone with hundreds of people around you.
What did they charge you with?
Breaking and entering.
Luis thought he knew his way in and out of a pawn shop.
What he didn't know was sometimes the owner liked to stay late.
Luis heard 3 noise, Fan OUT and left me to deal with a man with the biggest gun I'd ever seen, pointed right in my face.
How did you get hooked up with that guy in the first place?
He used to COFTIG to the C€I'Tll€F.
He gave me attention.
Ldidrl"t really have 8 lot of that SS 3 foster Kid.
What happened to your parents?
They died in 3 Cal' crash.
I was 10.
Shit-
Can we talk about something else?
No disrespect, but,..
An right.
Yeah, lerslake 3 break.
I just need 10 get outside.
Let's go eat.
You all not coming?
We're going to stay back.
Don't do anything I wouldn' do!
What exactly wouldn't you do?
Him.
You see, that's messed up.
I didn't even say nothing,
Why you got to come at me like that?
You're asking for it all the time!
God!
I asked you to stay so we could talk.
I mean, there's still a lot I don't know about you.
What do you want to know?
Well, for St3l'l6fS, a dance and business major?
Whal'S ihal about?
My father is the one that's pressing me into finance.
He just doesn't think that there's a future for me in dance.
But the way I look at it is, if we win Battle Zone,
I could go on tour for a year just doing what I love.
And I can go back to school with no regrets.
And it'S like I gave it that shot.
You know what I mean?
I know.
I know what it's like to have people not believe in you,
Is that why you want to win so bad?
It's not even about that, really.
I mean, the people that really count,
Mrs. Daniels.
You.
I mean, they've always had my back, even when I didn't see it.
And whether we win or lose, I'm going to keep dancing.

Great.
Okay.
Let'S start with these.
An right.
And let's set a couple of rules.
Like what?
Like curfew at 9:00, and you're not allowed to hang out with your old crew.
You ain't got to worry about that.
They ditched me a while back.
Any more rules?
Well, not a rule, but I would like you to start thinking about your future,
Like, what do you wanna do with your life?
If it was up to me...
VVl'\3ll€V€I".

What about your dancing?
You used to love that.
Look, I got to get a real job.
It's not like I can make any money dancing,
Excuse me?
Honey built this studio with her dance career.
We all can't be like your daughter, Mrs, Daniels.
Well, if anybody could be, it'd be you.
What have you...
Give me that!
This ain't no mirror cleaning.
Now, see, your problem is, you are not motivated,
Now, look at that.
That is what a mirror's supposed to look like.
MR. KAPOOR:
No, come on.
Please, Maria.
MARIA:
Oh, come on.
Maria, please.
Please.

I don't think you working here is a good idea.
Why?
You want to heal' me num?
I don't trust you anymore.
Okay?
Mr. Kapoor, you know me.
I messed up one time.
One time!
You know what they say.
Once you go bad, you never go back.
Wait, no.
It's... it's once you go "black," you never go back.
But that makes no sense.
How can you go...
Is that what they really say?
Hmm.
I'll try 10 I'€mEfT'lb€I' that.
Besides, Maria, I'm running a business here, not a charity, okay?
I'd really like to help you, but I just can't.

Quit it while you're behind.
Baby, stop.
Lail"I'll ever seen 8 New York Clal'1CeF that Could turf like that.

Really?
What happened to, "I'm going to break your ass in halt"'?
Yeah, that was before I saw you dance, though.
Whatever, Lyric.
We don't need her.
I think we do, Tina, because I've never seen you get down like that.
So, you interested?
No, thanks.
Why not?
YOU'l'€ here an me time.

Girl, if I wasn't on probation..
Ooh!
What would you do?
You know what?
I'm just not interested.
Hey, what's going on?
It's the 718.
They're buying everybody slices.

They always do stuff like that,
Last time, they handed out school supplies.
My moms really loved that, but I'd rather have the pizza.
YOU'l'€jUSI in time.

Nobody got hurt.
The flower girl lost a tooth, Maria.
It was already loose.
And I gave her the bouquet to make up for it!
True.
True.
Okay, then.
Oh, man.
You know, after a while, the DJ wasn't that bad.
We danced for a while after everybody left.
It was nice, though.
I thought about that night a lot when I was gone.
Have you thought about coming back to the crew?
I'm so tempted.
You know how much dancing means to me.
Come dance with us tomorrow.
I know once we get back at it, it'll be just like Old times.
That's what I'm afraid Of.

Three and four, five and six, and seven, eight.
One, two, four, six, eight,
Are you serious?
Get up!
Ge!
up!
Carla, pay attention!
Whoa!
Oh, my God!
TINA:
This is So Stupid.
I'm not into it, right?
Yo, can we just stop arguing for two seconds and focus?
How are we supposed to know what we're doing if we can't even see?
That's the whole point.
You guys are using your eyes and those mirrors as crutches.
You need to learn how to trust your instincts.
Trust each other.
Think you can do il?
Just turn the damn music on already.
Shit.
LYRIC:
Watch ii!
Whoa!
(FAST-PACED MUSIC)
(ALL CHEERING)
That was dope.
That was amazing, yo!
MARIA:
All right, y'all ready to go full out?
BRANDON:
I_6ll'S do if..
Whoo!
All right, HD!
(ALL WHOOPING)
That was dope.
I got to hand it to you, girl.
You're really getting us there.
I feel like we might even have a shot to win this thing.
We'll See!
We're going to need to come a lot stronger than this,
I know that much.
Wow!
What is your problem?
I guess I can't help telling the truth.
My bad.
Hey, I like what you're doing.
Keep it up, and all the haters are going to have left is hate.
I appreciate that.
Later, y'all.
PSHCG.
Same time tomorrow, B?
Yep.
Fife me.
Later, D. You got it, bro.
Bye,
(LAUGHS)
Don't listen to Tina.
She talks a lot of smack, but she's a good girl.
Yeah, it's not her smack talk that pisses me off.
I think she might be right.
Was Tina right when she said that you're trying to win this thing to get back at Luis?
Notjust Luis.
It's like, most of my life, people told me I'd never be anything.
So, what is it you wanted to be?
Honestly?
I want to be a dancer.
And I always have.
I think we should go somewhere.
Okay.
Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?
You'll see.
We're going to get cleaned up.
(MARIA GRUNTS) Yeah.
Yeah, watch, watch.
Whoo!
How did you know about all those places?
I'm a dance major at NYU.
And part of our curriculum is to experience the arts.
My head is just busting with ideas right now.
All the stuff we could do, like mixing the stuff we saw.
You know what I mean?
Like, if we go...
Barn!
Bam!
Bam!
Bam!
You know?
(CAR HONKING)
Thank you!
Do you even realize what you do with your choreography?
It's like you're telling this beautiful story.
What?
"Beautiful"?
Yeah, I said it.
Beautiful.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing.
Just, if that's the way you step to girls, your game is pretty weak.
You might want to take some lessons from Darnell.
What?
Are you serious?
Yeah!
Darnell?
Okay, I would never do that, first of all.
Second, I bet I do know what impresses you.
What?
What?
What are you doing?
Yo, yo, what up, Ma?
You dig my swagger now?
Or you still fronting like you stunting?
I'm just saying, shawty.
What's a brotha got to do to get with you?
You need to quit.
Quit what?
Quit this?
Oh, ay!
Ay!
Uh, uh!
Ooh!
Pow!
How you like me now?
No, I liked you beflel' bEfo\'E,

They're starting to grow on me.

YGS,

I still think you're beautiful.
Whal else?
Okay, you're going to make me earn this kiss, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Your smile.
I mean, you don't give it up much, but when I catch one,
I just want to make you happy.
Oh,
Now what?
Now, I want you to look at me like I'm the only girl in this world.
I've been doing that since the first moment I saw you.
Okay.
Can I kiss you now?
You really need to kiss me now.

Maria!
What are you doing?
The tango!
I know what ii'S called.
What I want to know is why are you doing it when you're supposed to be working?
Mr. Kapoor, you work too hard.
Do you know what you need?
Yes, an employee who doesn't tango with brooms.
No, you need to dance more.
No, thank you.
I only dance at the funerals of people I hate.
Come on!
Stop being so grumpy all the time.
I'm warning you, Maria.
I have bad knees, arthritis and clogged arteries,
I'll make ii easy for you.
Put your hand here.

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
NO, that wasn't good.
That was good!
No, I did Shit.
You killed it!
Hey!
What are you doing here?
I wasn't expecting to see you until later.
Wen, I thought maybe we can get a bite to eat before rehearsals.
Okay.
And I wan!

Why?
I just found out they moved my finals to the same day as the audition.
YOU have fin8lS in GBHCG?
No, I'm a double major.

These are my business exams.
I'm sorry.
I hate that I have to miss it, Maria.

CARLA:
Tina, lei's just finish it.
It's not stupid, Tina.
Okay, look, I studied the show.
All the past winners are well-rounded.
This will help us.
Right.
And with this new style, it's like we've been dipped in culture.
That's one thing I know the 718 doesn't have.
Culture.
(SOFTLY) Dipped.
Dipped in culture.
I don't think so.
BRANDON:
Come on, it's a good thing.
This stuff will help us.
Come on.
Fine.
LYRIC:

In your face.
JONAS:
Well, Honey Daniels is amazing.
Y'all have got some big, big shoes to fill.
I could tell you righi now, you're just wasting your time.
JONAS;
What, you know them, Luis?
LUIS:
Just her.
She couldn't quite cut it with our crew,
SO I cut her IOOS€.
Why you got to lie?
Yo, can we get this audition going, or what?

(MUSIC PLAYING)
(PANNNG)
Listen, we've decided that because of your dancing and the obvious tension between you and my boy Luis here, that this Should make for great television.
HD, welcome to the Battle Zone.
(ALL SCREAM JOYOUSLY)
Thank you.
Thank you.
We did it.
That was insane.
It was nuts.
Not just the way we made the show, but the way you stood up to those judges.
I mean, you were like, "Hell no!
Y'all are going to check us out!"
Okay, I just wanted our crew to have a fair shot.
I give you mad props for that.
We finally feel like a real crew, you know?
And that wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you.
I respect that.
You're welcome.
You can take that one to them.
I'll get the other one.
Okay.
Make them save me a slice, though,
I will.
I'm in.
So, where's Brandon at?
I texted him.
He must still be taking his finals.
Finals?
He could've skipped those to come celebrate, man.
You don't skip finals, bro.
That's why they call them finals,
The boy is trying to get his edu-macation on.
That don't make him any different than the rest of us.
We all just want to dance for a living.
Yeah, but we don't all have filthy rich parents like he does.
What are you talking about?
His family owns half Of Texas.
You didn't know?
His family makes the Hiltons look like the Hammers.
(LAUGHING)
Can't touch this.
Really_ Really?
He's good with kids, too.
He te8Cl'1€S 3 class with kids?
Yeah.
Once a week.
You didn't know that either?
What do you know?
Let me ask you a serious question.
Do y'all actually ever talk or just bone?
She just be like...
Shake it, baby!
Yo, Carla.
Check it out.
CARLAI Oh, uh-uh.
She is about to be sleeping with the enemy.
Good stuff today.
Thank you.
Watching you move was amazing.
Stop it.
Hey, I'm serious.
Tina, is he bothering you?
No, he was just telling me how much he liked our audition.
No, I said I like your audition.
You're the one who brings the heat to this group.
Tina, did he tell you that you're too good for us and that you should be dancing with his crew?
Yeah, he did, but...
Tina, he's trying to play you.
Hey, calm down.
I told him I would stay with the HDS.
Wen, good.
But you act like I ain't even good enough to dance with them.
I diunw say mar.
Sounds like that's what she's saying to me.
MARIA:
You know what?
Stop starting trouble.
Leave our crew alone.
Tina, are you going to let her dis you like that?
I mean, I know if someone in my crew called me out, we'd battle on the spot.
Wow!
I am not calling her out.
And if we're going to battle, we're going to do it as a crew and take your sorry ass out.
And what's stopping you?
What's stopping you?
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)
See that, Tina?
She's scared.
She's scared!
If you were on the 718, baby, you wouldn't run from nothing.
Whatever.
Maria, we got to do this, okay?
We're finally getting some props, and it's time to back it up.
Tina, are YOU sure?
Yeah, I'm as sure as you were in that audition.
That's pretty sure.
Tina's right.
If we aren't going to knock heads, we got to do something.
Hen, yeah!
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah.
Mmm?

And you actually think you're going to take us out on Battle Zone?
(scoFFs)
Toys.
Tina, when you're ready to grow up, come holler at your boy.
Yo, I was wrong.
We ain't no damn crew.
We're just some posers.
Tina, we tried...
But our try wasn't good enough, ain't never good enough!
We got humiliated!
Nobody is going to respect us after this.
Nobody!
Wait, Tina!
Leave me alone!
Tina!
Tina!
(CROWD JEERING)
YOU'l'S IE\€.
Do I have to remind you what time your curfew is?
I know what time my curfew is,
You know what?
We made rules in this house, and they are going to have to be followed.
Or what?
You're going to send me back to juvie?
Fine.
What is the matter with you?
I'm just sick of trying.
I try and live by your rules.
I try and stay out of trouble.
I try and join a new crew.
And nothing works.
Well, it doesn't mean you have to give up.
Save it.
I'm going to bed.
Hey,
Where you been?
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't get much sleep last night.
What's going on?
Tina quit.
She said she's not coming back.
What the hell?
Do you know what this does to our choreography?
Of course we do!
But I'm...
Bun nothing!
This screws everything up!
Don't take it out on Lyric.
I'm not taking it out on Lyric.
I'm pissed!
So, what do we do?
You tell us.
You're the choreographer.
You know what?
I don't need this right now.
I'm out.
Weil, that's messed up.
What?
A Sf feel bafue?
What were you thinking?
Didn't you know losing would ruin their confidence?
I'm sorry, college boy, I'm not as smart as you.
I didn'1 know that
Well, you should have.
And you should have told me you were just some rich kid slumming it down here for grades.
Now, what does my family's money have to do with any of this?
Makes ii all just a game for you.
If things fall apart, you can just leave, buf the FSSI Of US SFS stuck h€I'S to deal with ii.
In case you haven't noticed, I'm Still here.
You're the one that walked out.
Because i'l ['S over!
I quit!
We can't win without Tina!
Fine, If that's the way you feel, then you should quit.
I'm going to go up there with my crew, because I believe in us.
Mafia.
Are you okay?
Yeah. why?
Today's your day off.
What can I say?
I'd rather be here than anywhere else.
Oh, Maria.
Let'S talk.
Let's talk.
You got to follow your heart, Maria.
Is there a problem at home or with your friends?
Both.
And this is how you deal with it?
Come to work?
Yeah.
Huh.
Good.
Why, because you get free labor?
Of course.
But I was thinking, Maria, instead of getting yourself into trouble, you chose to do something constructive.
I like that.
Well, while I'r'r'l being constructive, is there anything else you want me to do?
You go work your register, and I'll take care of this later,
You said no one works the register but you,
What, you expect me to take your word for it that you were going to change?
NO,
I had to wait for you to prove it, and you have.
So, now I trust you.
Thanks, Mr. Kapoor.
That means a lot.
BRANDON:
Five, six, seven, eight.
An right.
Try it again.
Five, six, seven, eight.
An right.
So, you're back now?
Why new
I still got to do my community service here anyway.
Right.
Hey,
Hey, nook.
I want to be here, if that's okay with you.
Whatever.
Uh-uh.
Yo, is that Tina?
Okay, I'm just going to go ahead and say it,
Shit!
She joined up with the 718.
That's scandalous, man.
How's she going to play us like that?
Because she only thinks about her damn self, that's how.
BRANDON:
We can't sweat this right now, guys,
MARIA:
He's right.
We need to focus 0l'1 \l'1iS CFGW.
So, let's rock this thing, all right?
Bring it in.
Let's get an HD on three, an right?
One, two, three...
ALL:
HD!
MARIO!
Every S€3S0f1 OD BB"/G ZOITS, we find Ihe hottest, IT'loS\ il'lS3I'l€ CTGWS OH the SCSIIG, and last season was no different.
The 718 set this place on fire with their off-the-chain routines, and at the end of this season, you're going to see them perform against the last crew standing.
There's already been some behind-the-scenes madness with one crew jacking another for a dancer, and we haven't even started yet.
So, what's jumping off next?
Stay tuned, because you don't want to miss Battle Zone.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
(LOUD CHEERING)
One of these crews is going home tonight.
Judges, who will it be?
Well, it's obvious that this year's talent is amazing, but, unfortunately, somebody has to go.
And rumgnr, it's Fanny Pak.
(SCREAMS JOYOUSLY)
Sorry, guys.
ALL; (DRAMATICALLY) Ah!
Ah,
I'm sorry to see those guys go.
They were a hot crew.
Yeah, but they weren't the best.
And you have got to be the best if you're gonna go up against the 718.
MARIO:
Enough said.
We'll see you next week in Battle Zone.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Come on, we just killed it!
Yeah, we're still in.
WE I'1S€d\0 Ialk.
No, we don't.
Look, I know you think you know what you're doing, but you don't.
You need to stay away from Luis.
He said you were going to say something like that.
Trying to get me back in the crew?
Look, he's right, we need you.
But more importantly,
I don't want to see you get caught up.
You don't know him like I do.
I know he's my best chance at winning that prize money.
Can you guarantee me that?
Yeah, I didn't think 50,
Wait.
For what?
I ain't coming back to your crew.
Then, just be careful.
Can I talk to you for a second?
What do you want?
Lrll only rake E SECOHU.
Come on.
Whats up?
Let me take Tina's place.
Right.
I mean it.
I'll come dance with you if you kick Tina off your crew.
What changed your mind all Of a Sudden?
I know what I'm getting into with you.
Tina doesn't.
And since when did you become a teenage crisis counselor?
You know I'm a better dancer than her, and I can pretty much guarantee you another win.
That's true.
There's just one little problem.
hat'S that?
Come here.
Come close.
I don't trust you, witch.
Ever since you got out ofjuvie, you've been full of yourself and treating me like I'm something you scraped off your shoe.
But, you see that little girl over there?
She has stars in her eyes.
And I can make her do anything I want.
You're a jerk.
Do you know that?
You used to like it.
You tried to fix it, didn't you?
You were listening?
I had to make sure you were okay.
Yeah, I'm good.
Ijusi feel bad.
Tina being with them is all my fault.
NO,
Til'1a'S SIUbbol'fl.
That's her fauli.
But thanks for trying to protect her.
I just want the crew to go back to the way it was, you know?
I do, too.
Hey, do me a favor.
Don't be mad at me anymore, because I'm too tired to fight.
N19 too.
BRANDON:
Yeah, the movie was good, but real talk, could you stop killing us in rehearsals?
No, I have to.
We've got to make it to the finals.
We got to be strong enough to win.
You can hang, can't you, college boy?
Oh, I can hang.
Okay, then.
So, say my name.
College boy?
Okay, say it.
(LAUGHS) Okay, okay!
Brandon!
"Brandon," all right?
Are you happy now?
Very h3PPY-
(GIRL SOBBING)
Do you hear that?
Yeah.
Just wait rig hi here.
Maria, come here.
Tina, are you okay?
MARIA;
Hey, what happened?
Did Luis do this to you?
No, it was his boys.
They beat you up?
No.
Luis told them to walk me home, and then they smashed a store window and told me to grab stuff.
And did you?
I WGS 100 SC3l'€d.
There was glass everywhere.
I got all cut up.
I'll take her to my house.
It's okay there.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
I should've listened to you when you told me to stay away from Luis.
Yeah, well, sometimes you just got to learn the hard way.
Yeah, you're right.
So, what are you going to do now?
I'm not messing with Luis no more.
That's for damn sure.
Word.
VVl"liCl"l ITTSSFIS I C3l"I'll dal'1C€ with his Crew either.
Right.
You 'think I could COITIG back to the HDS?
You know that's not how it works.
Yeah.
Hey!
Owl
Are you an right?
Yeah.
MARIA:
All right.
You guys already know my vote.
I say we let Tina back in the crew.
That would be my vote, too,
MARIA:
All right.
Ricky?
Well,
Tina's my homegirl, so, yeah.
I want her back.
All right.
Carla?
Girl, I'm easy.
Ha!
We know that.
You don'\!
Anyways, my vote is yes.
Not because I think you deserve it, Tina, but because I CENT Sfind l.UiS and his CFSW.
An right.
Well, Tina's crazy.
And you know what they say, crazy ass is the best ass.
And the best ass is some crazy ass!
Then that must be my ass.
HEY, QUYS, not the rig ht time.
Okay.
Yeah.
Lyric,
it's on you.
Carla was right, you don't deserve it.
Every single one of us had your back.
You basically spit in our faces.
That was messed up.
Ldidl'1'\ ITISEH ION.
I don't care what you meant.
I only care about what you did.
We were like sisters, Tina.
I would've done anything for you.
Then you leave me, and now you want to come back like we're all cool?
I'm sorry.
I messed up.
YOU messed Up bad.
You're still family, and I'll always love you.
But if you want my trust, you got to earn it,
Just tell me how.
I'll do it.
You can start by getting back in this crew, and help us whoop Luis' ass.
I might need a tissue.
(SOBBING) Damn, I think my allergies kicking in or something.
I thought someone was chopping onions up in here,
(SOBBING)
(HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
Besides 718, who else we got to look out for?
That's hard to say.
I mean, some of the best crews from last year will be back.

(LOUD CHEERING)
We're going to need your toughness, Tina.

All right.
Okay!

(ALL WHOOPING)
There was this girl when I was in juvie, Julissa, and every time we would battle, she'd always come up with something new,
What was she in for?
She tried to kill her stepdad.
Whoa. why?
She didn't say, but we all knew.
Was it scary in there?
Not in a way you could really imagine or I could really describe to you.
It's like feeling alone with hundreds of people around you.
What did they charge you with?
Breaking and entering.
Luis thought he knew his way in and out of a pawn shop.
What he didn't know was sometimes the owner liked to stay late.
Luis heard 3 noise, Fan OUT and left me to deal with a man with the biggest gun I'd ever seen, pointed right in my face.
How did you get hooked up with that guy in the first place?
He used to COFTIG to the C€I'Tll€F.
He gave me attention.
Ldidrl"t really have 8 lot of that SS 3 foster Kid.
What happened to your parents?
They died in 3 Cal' crash.
I was 10.
Shit-
Can we talk about something else?
No disrespect, but,..
An right.
Yeah, lerslake 3 break.
I just need 10 get outside.
Let's go eat.
You all not coming?
We're going to stay back.
Don't do anything I wouldn'\ do!
What exactly wouldn't you do?
Him.
You see, that's messed up.
I didn't even say nothing,
Why you got to come at me like that?
You're asking for it all the time!
God!
I asked you to stay so we could talk.
I mean, there's still a lot I don't know about you.
What do you want to know?
Well, for St3l'l6fS, a dance and business major?
Whal'S ihal about?
My father is the one that's pressing me into finance.
He just doesn't think that there's a future for me in dance.
But the way I look at it is, if we win Battle Zone,
I could go on tour for a year just doing what I love.
And I can go back to school with no regrets.
And it'S like I gave it that shot.
You know what I mean?
I know.
I know what it's like to have people not believe in you,
Is that why you want to win so bad?
It's not even about that, really.
I mean, the people that really count,
Mrs. Daniels.
You.
I mean, they've always had my back, even when I didn't see it.
And whether we win or lose, I'm going to keep dancing.
It's how I say the things I want to say.

Uh-huh.
Don't "uh-huh" her.

Going to come out here, and we are going to put you to work.
Great.
Okay.
Let'S start with these.
An right.
And let's set a couple of rules.
Like what?
Like curfew at 9:00, and you're not allowed to hang out with your old crew.
You ain't got to worry about that.
They ditched me a while back.
Any more rules?
Well, not a rule, but I would like you to start thinking about your future,
Like, what do you wanna do with your life?
If it was up to me...
VVl'\3ll€V€I".
It doeSr'l" [matter.
What about your dancing?
You used to love that.
Look, I got to get a real job.
It's not like I can make any money dancing,
Excuse me?
Honey built this studio with her dance career.
We all can't be like your daughter, Mrs, Daniels.
Well, if anybody could be, it'd be you.
What have you...
Give me that!
This ain't no mirror cleaning.
Now, see, your problem is, you are not motivated,
Now, look at that.
That is what a mirror's supposed to look like.
MR. KAPOOR:
No, come on.
Please, Maria.
MARIA:
Oh, come on.
Maria, please.
Please.
What?
I don't think you working here is a good idea.
Why?
You want to heal' me num?
I don't trust you anymore.
Okay?
Mr. Kapoor, you know me.
I messed up one time.
One time!
You know what they say.
Once you go bad, you never go back.
Wait, no.
It's... it's once you go "black," you never go back.
But that makes no sense.
How can you go...
Is that what they really say?
Hmm.
I'll try 10 I'€mEfT'lb€I' that.
Besides, Maria, I'm running a business here, not a charity, okay?
I'd really like to help you, but I just can't.

But I can help you out.
Right?
And hows mar?

It was just her.
Oh, God.

Quit it while you're behind.
Baby, stop.
Lail"I'll ever seen 8 New York Clal'1CeF that Could turf like that.
Did you live in Cali or something?
No.
I learned it from this girl I used to know.
You think you can teach us how to do it?
Really?
What happened to, "I'm going to break your ass in halt"'?
Yeah, that was before I saw you dance, though.
Whatever, Lyric.
We don't need her.
I think we do, Tina, because I've never seen you get down like that.
So, you interested?
No, thanks.
Why not?
YOU'l'€ here an me time.

Girl, if I wasn't on probation..
Ooh!
What would you do?
You know what?
I'm just not interested.
Hey, what's going on?
It's the 718.
They're buying everybody slices.
When why?
They always do stuff like that,
Last time, they handed out school supplies.
My moms really loved that, but I'd rather have the pizza.
YOU'l'€jUSI in time.

What is all Of this?
What does it look like?
We take care of our own, Ma.
I mean, if not US, who will?

Yo, you got so lit.
I wasn'l too buzzed to catch the bouquet, though.
Right.
After you knocked over the old lady and the flower girl.
Oh, my gosh, it was an accident!
Nobody got hurt.
The flower girl lost a tooth, Maria.
It was already loose.
And I gave her the bouquet to make up for it!
True.
True.
Okay, then.
Oh, man.
You know, after a while, the DJ wasn't that bad.
We danced for a while after everybody left.
It was nice, though.
I thought about that night a lot when I was gone.
Have you thought about coming back to the crew?
I'm so tempted.
You know how much dancing means to me.
Come dance with us tomorrow.
I know once we get back at it, it'll be just like Old times.
That's what I'm afraid Of.
Hey, you know I got you.

That'S the kind of break I need.
Who said you were going to take over our choreography?
BRANDON:
I mean, we could use the help.

Tina, Lyric.
Part of the grand prize is $100,000.
I know we could all use that money, but with your grandma's medical expenses, I thoug ht.,.
Why you got to put us on blast?
No, I'm not.
Look, you know I got your back, always.
And if you really don't want her in, just say the word and I'm down.
But I think we should do it for Grandma.
I do.
And if I say no, I'm the bad guy, right?
Pretty much.
All right, Fine, she's in.
CARLA:
Yeah!
But if she gets in my face again, I'm going to cut her.
With what?
Your razor sharp wit?
My what?
I just said yes to you to get in my crew.
dof't'1i'lalk to ITIS like that.
All right.
Five, six, seven, eight.
It's one, two, three, four, five, six and seven, eight.
One, two, three...
One, two, yep, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
You guys got to trust that the guys have your back.
And you guys need to turn, and you guys need to know that they're coming.
Three and four, five and six, and seven, eight.
One, two, four, six, eight,
Are you serious?
Get up!
Ge!
up!
Carla, pay attention!
Whoa!
Oh, my God!
TINA:
This is So Stupid.
I'm not into it, right?
Yo, can we just stop arguing for two seconds and focus?
How are we supposed to know what we're doing if we can't even see?
That's the whole point.
You guys are using your eyes and those mirrors as crutches.
You need to learn how to trust your instincts.
Trust each other.
Think you can do il?
Just turn the damn music on already.
Shit.
LYRIC:
Watch ii!
Whoa!
(FAST-PACED MUSIC)
(ALL CHEERING)
That was dope.
That was amazing, yo!
MARIA:
All right, y'all ready to go full out?
BRANDON:
I_6ll'S do if..
Whoo!
All right, HD!
(ALL WHOOPING)
That was dope.
I got to hand it to you, girl.
You're really getting us there.
I feel like we might even have a shot to win this thing.
We'll See!
We're going to need to come a lot stronger than this,
I know that much.
Wow!
What is your problem?
I guess I can't help telling the truth.
My bad.
Hey, I like what you're doing.
Keep it up, and all the haters are going to have left is hate.
I appreciate that.
Later, y'all.
PSHCG.
Same time tomorrow, B?
Yep.
Fife me.
Later, D. You got it, bro.
Bye,
(LAUGHS)
Don't listen to Tina.
She talks a lot of smack, but she's a good girl.
Yeah, it's not her smack talk that pisses me off.
I think she might be right.
Was Tina right when she said that you're trying to win this thing to get back at Luis?
Notjust Luis.
It's like, most of my life, people told me I'd never be anything.
So, what is it you wanted to be?
Honestly?
I want to be a dancer.
And I always have.
I think we should go somewhere.
Okay.
Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?
You'll see.
We're going to get cleaned up.
(MARIA GRUNTS) Yeah.
Yeah, watch, watch.
Whoo!
How did you know about all those places?
I'm a dance major at NYU.
And part of our curriculum is to experience the arts.
My head is just busting with ideas right now.
All the stuff we could do, like mixing the stuff we saw.
You know what I mean?
Like, if we go...
Barn!
Bam!
Bam!
Bam!
You know?
(CAR HONKING)
Thank you!
Do you even realize what you do with your choreography?
It's like you're telling this beautiful story.
What?
"Beautiful"?
Yeah, I said it.
Beautiful.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing.
Just, if that's the way you step to girls, your game is pretty weak.
You might want to take some lessons from Darnell.
What?
Are you serious?
Yeah!
Darnell?
Okay, I would never do that, first of all.
Second, I bet I do know what impresses you.
What?
What?
What are you doing?
Yo, yo, what up, Ma?
You dig my swagger now?
Or you still fronting like you stunting?
I'm just saying, shawty.
What's a brotha got to do to get with you?
You need to quit.
Quit what?
Quit this?
Oh, ay!
Ay!
Uh, uh!
Ooh!
Pow!
How you like me now?
No, I liked you beflel' bEfo\'E,
Yeah?
Yeah.
Just go back to your college boy ways.
They're starting to grow on me.
Word?
Yes, word.
Stupid.
Ll'S I'liC€.
YGS,
Maria?
What?
I still think you're beautiful.
Whal else?
Okay, you're going to make me earn this kiss, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Your smile.
I mean, you don't give it up much, but when I catch one,
I just want to make you happy.
Oh,
Now what?
Now, I want you to look at me like I'm the only girl in this world.
I've been doing that since the first moment I saw you.
Okay.
Can I kiss you now?
You really need to kiss me now.

(INCREASES MUSIC VOLUME)
Maria!
What are you doing?
The tango!
I know what ii'S called.
What I want to know is why are you doing it when you're supposed to be working?
Mr. Kapoor, you work too hard.
Do you know what you need?
Yes, an employee who doesn't tango with brooms.
No, you need to dance more.
No, thank you.
I only dance at the funerals of people I hate.
Come on!
Stop being so grumpy all the time.
I'm warning you, Maria.
I have bad knees, arthritis and clogged arteries,
I'll make ii easy for you.
Put your hand here.
And keep your shoulders straight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
NO, that wasn't good.
That was good!
No, I did Shit.
You killed it!
Hey!
What are you doing here?
I wasn't expecting to see you until later.
Wen, I thought maybe we can get a bite to eat before rehearsals.
Okay.
And I wan!
to talk to you about something.
Why?
I just found out they moved my finals to the same day as the audition.
YOU have fin8lS in GBHCG?
No, I'm a double major.
I got dance, and I got business,
These are my business exams.
I'm sorry.
I hate that I have to miss it, Maria.
Rm going to be with you guys every step of the way, leading up until the audition.

BRANDON:

And one, two, three, four, five and six and seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
P€I'f€C\.

This is So stupid.
CARLA:
Tina, lei's just finish it.
It's not stupid, Tina.
Okay, look, I studied the show.
All the past winners are well-rounded.
This will help us.
Right.
And with this new style, it's like we've been dipped in culture.
That's one thing I know the 718 doesn't have.
Culture.
(SOFTLY) Dipped.
Dipped in culture.
I don't think so.
BRANDON:
Come on, it's a good thing.
This stuff will help us.
Come on.
Fine.
LYRIC:
Quit whining.
TINA:

In your face.
JONAS:
Well, Honey Daniels is amazing.
Y'all have got some big, big shoes to fill.
I could tell you righi now, you're just wasting your time.
JONAS;

LUIS:
Just her.
She couldn't quite cut it with our crew,
SO I cut her IOOS€.
Why you got to lie?
Yo, can we get this audition going, or what?

(MUSIC PLAYING)
(PANNNG)
Listen, we've decided that because of your dancing and the obvious tension between you and my boy Luis here, that this Should make for great television.
HD, welcome to the Battle Zone.
(ALL SCREAM JOYOUSLY)
Thank you.
Thank you.
We did it.
That was insane.
It was nuts.
Not just the way we made the show, but the way you stood up to those judges.
I mean, you were like, "Hell no!
Y'all are going to check us out!"
Okay, I just wanted our crew to have a fair shot.
I give you mad props for that.
We finally feel like a real crew, you know?
And that wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you.
I respect that.
You're welcome.
You can take that one to them.
I'll get the other one.
Okay.
Make them save me a slice, though,
I will.
I'm in.
So, where's Brandon at?
I texted him.
He must still be taking his finals.
Finals?
He could've skipped those to come celebrate, man.
You don't skip finals, bro.
That's why they call them finals,
The boy is trying to get his edu-macation on.
That don't make him any different than the rest of us.
We all just want to dance for a living.
Yeah, but we don't all have filthy rich parents like he does.
What are you talking about?
His family owns half Of Texas.
You didn't know?
His family makes the Hiltons look like the Hammers.
(LAUGHING)
Can't touch this.
Really_ Really?
He's good with kids, too.
He te8Cl'1€S 3 class with kids?
Yeah.
Once a week.
You didn't know that either?
What do you know?
Let me ask you a serious question.
Do y'all actually ever talk or just bone?
She just be like...
Shake it, baby!
Yo, Carla.
Check it out.
CARLAI Oh, uh-uh.
She is about to be sleeping with the enemy.
Good stuff today.
Thank you.
Watching you move was amazing.
Stop it.
Hey, I'm serious.
Tina, is he bothering you?
No, he was just telling me how much he liked our audition.
No, I said I like your audition.
You're the one who brings the heat to this group.
Tina, did he tell you that you're too good for us and that you should be dancing with his crew?
Yeah, he did, but...
Tina, he's trying to play you.
Hey, calm down.
I told him I would stay with the HDS.
Wen, good.
But you act like I ain't even good enough to dance with them.
I diunw say mar.
Sounds like that's what she's saying to me.
MARIA:
You know what?
Stop starting trouble.
Leave our crew alone.
Tina, are you going to let her dis you like that?
I mean, I know if someone in my crew called me out, we'd battle on the spot.
Wow!
I am not calling her out.
And if we're going to battle, we're going to do it as a crew and take your sorry ass out.
And what's stopping you?
What's stopping you?
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)
See that, Tina?
She's scared.
She's scared!
If you were on the 718, baby, you wouldn't run from nothing.
Whatever.
Maria, we got to do this, okay?
We're finally getting some props, and it's time to back it up.
Tina, are YOU sure?
Yeah, I'm as sure as you were in that audition.
That's pretty sure.
Tina's right.
If we aren't going to knock heads, we got to do something.
Hen, yeah!
That's what I'm saying.

And you actually think you're going to take us out on Battle Zone?
(scoFFs)
Toys.
Tina, when you're ready to grow up, come holler at your boy.
Yo, I was wrong.
We ain't no damn crew.
We're just some posers.
Tina, we tried...
But our try wasn't good enough, ain't never good enough!
We got humiliated!
Nobody is going to respect us after this.
Nobody!
Wait, Tina!
Leave me alone!
Tina!
Tina!
(CROWD JEERING)
YOU'l'S IE\€.
Do I have to remind you what time your curfew is?
I know what time my curfew is,
You know what?
We made rules in this house, and they are going to have to be followed.
Or what?
You're going to send me back to juvie?
Fine.
What is the matter with you?
I'm just sick of trying.
I try and live by your rules.
I try and stay out of trouble.
I try and join a new crew.
And nothing works.
Well, it doesn't mean you have to give up.
Save it.
I'm going to bed.
Hey,
Where you been?
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't get much sleep last night.
What's going on?
Tina quit.
She said she's not coming back.
What the hell?
Do you know what this does to our choreography?
Of course we do!
But I'm...
Bun nothing!
This screws everything up!
Don't take it out on Lyric.
I'm not taking it out on Lyric.
I'm pissed!
So, what do we do?
You tell us.
You're the choreographer.
You know what?
I don't need this right now.
I'm out.
Weil, that's messed up.
What?
A Sf feel bafue?
What were you thinking?
Didn't you know losing would ruin their confidence?
I'm sorry, college boy, I'm not as smart as you.
I didn'1 know that
Well, you should have.
And you should have told me you were just some rich kid slumming it down here for grades.
Now, what does my family's money have to do with any of this?
Makes ii all just a game for you.
If things fall apart, you can just leave, buf the FSSI Of US SFS stuck h€I'S to deal with ii.
In case you haven't noticed, I'm Still here.
You're the one that walked out.
Because i'l['S over!
I quit!
We can't win without Tina!
Fine, If that's the way you feel, then you should quit.
I'm going to go up there with my crew, because I believe in us.
Mafia.
Are you okay?
Yeah. why?
Today's your day off.
What can I say?
I'd rather be here than anywhere else.
Oh, Maria.
Let'S talk.
Let's talk.
You got to follow your heart, Maria.
Is there a problem at home or with your friends?
Both.
And this is how you deal with it?
Come to work?
Yeah.
Huh.
Good.
Why, because you get free labor?
Of course.
But I was thinking, Maria, instead of getting yourself into trouble, you chose to do something constructive.
I like that.
Well, while I'r'r'l being constructive, is there anything else you want me to do?
You go work your register, and I'll take care of this later,
You said no one works the register but you,
What, you expect me to take your word for it that you were going to change?
NO,
I had to wait for you to prove it, and you have.
So, now I trust you.
Thanks, Mr. Kapoor.
That means a lot.
BRANDON:
Five, six, seven, eight.
An right.
Try it again.
Five, six, seven, eight.
An right.
So, you're back now?
Why new
I still got to do my community service here anyway.
Right.
Hey,
Hey, nook.
I want to be here, if that's okay with you.
Whatever.
Uh-uh.
Yo, is that Tina?
Okay, I'm just going to go ahead and say it,
Shit!
She joined up with the 718.
That's scandalous, man.
How's she going to play us like that?
Because she only thinks about her damn self, that's how.
BRANDON:
We can't sweat this right now, guys,
MARIA:
He's right.
We need to focus 0l'1 \l'1iS CFGW.
So, let's rock this thing, all right?
Bring it in.
Let's get an HD on three, an right?
One, two, three...
ALL:
HD!
MARIO!
Every S€3S0f1 OD BB"/G ZOITS, we find Ihe hottest, IT'loS\ il'lS3I'l€ CTGWS OH the SCSIIG, and last season was no different.
The 718 set this place on fire with their off-the-chain routines, and at the end of this season, you're going to see them perform against the last crew standing.
There's already been some behind-the-scenes madness with one crew jacking another for a dancer, and we haven't even started yet.
So, what's jumping off next?
Stay tuned, because you don't want to miss Battle Zone.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
(LOUD CHEERING)
One of these crews is going home tonight.
Judges, who will it be?
Well, it's obvious that this year's talent is amazing, but, unfortunately, somebody has to go.
And rumgnr, it's Fanny Pak.
(SCREAMS JOYOUSLY)
Sorry, guys.
ALL; (DRAMATICALLY) Ah!
Ah,
I'm sorry to see those guys go.
They were a hot crew.
Yeah, but they weren't the best.
And you have got to be the best if you're gonna go up against the 71 8.
MARIO:
Enough said.
We'll see you next week in Battle Zone.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Come on, we just killed it!
Yeah, we're still in.
WE I'1S€d\0 Ialk.
No, we don't.
Look, I know you think you know what you're doing, but you don't.
You need to stay away from Luis.
He said you were going to say something like that.
Trying to get me back in the crew?
Look, he's right, we need you.
But more importantly,
I don't want to see you get caught up.
You don't know him like I do.
I know he's my best chance at winning that prize money.
Can you guarantee me that?
Yeah, I didn't think 50,
Wait.
For what?
I ain't coming back to your crew.
Then, just be careful.
Can I talk to you for a second?
What do you want?
Lrll only rake E SECOHU.
Come on.
Whats up?
Let me take Tina's place.
Right.
I mean it.
I'll come dance with you if you kick Tina off your crew.
What changed your mind all Of a Sudden?
I know what I'm getting into with you.
Tina doesn't.
And since when did you become a teenage crisis counselor?
You know I'm a better dancer than her, and I can pretty much guarantee you another win.
That's true.
There's just one little problem.
hat'S that?
Come here.
Come close.
I don't trust you, witch.
Ever since you got out ofjuvie, you've been full of yourself and treating me like I'm something you scraped off your shoe.
But, you see that little girl over there?
She has stars in her eyes.
And I can make her do anything I want.
You're a jerk.
Do you know that?
You used to like it.
You tried to fix it, didn't you?
You were listening?
I had to make sure you were okay.
Yeah, I'm good.
Ijusi feel bad.
Tina being with them is all my fault.
NO,
Til'1a'S SIUbbol'fl.
That's her fauli.
But thanks for trying to protect her.
I just want the crew to go back to the way it was, you know?
I do, too.
Hey, do me a favor.
Don't be mad at me anymore, because I'm too tired to fight.
N19 too.
BRANDON:
Yeah, the movie was good, but real talk, could you stop killing us in rehearsals?
No, I have to.
We've got to make it to the finals.
We got to be strong enough to win.
You can hang, can't you, college boy?
Oh, I can hang.
Okay, then.
So, say my name.
College boy?
Okay, say it.
(LAUGHS) Okay, okay!
Brandon!
"Brandon," all right?
Are you happy now?
Very h3PPY-
(GIRL SOBBING)
Do you hear that?
Yeah.
Just wait rig hi here.
Maria, come here.
Tina, are you okay?
MARIA;
Hey, what happened?
Did Luis do this to you?
No, it was his boys.
They beat you up?
No.
Luis told them to walk me home, and then they smashed a store window and told me to grab stuff.
And did you?
I WGS 100 SC3l'€d.
There was glass everywhere.
I got all cut up.
I'll take her to my house.
It's okay there.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
I should've listened to you when you told me to stay away from Luis.
Yeah, well, sometimes you just got to learn the hard way.
Yeah, you're right.
So, what are you going to do now?
I'm not messing with Luis no more.
That's for damn sure.
Word.
VVl"liCl"l ITTSSFIS I C3l"I'll dal'1C€ with his Crew either.
Right.
You 'think I could COITIG back to the HDS?
You know that's not how it works.
Yeah.
Hey!
Owl
Are you an right?
Yeah.
MARIA:
All right.
You guys already know my vote.
I say we let Tina back in the crew.
That would be my vote, too,
MARIA:
All right.
Ricky?
Well,
Tina's my homegirl, so, yeah.
I want her back.
All right.
Carla?
Girl, I'm easy.
Ha!
We know that.
You don'\!
Anyways, my vote is yes.
Not because I think you deserve it, Tina, but because I CENT Sfind l.UiS and his CFSW.
An right.
Well, Tina's crazy.
And you know what they say, crazy ass is the best ass.
And the best ass is some crazy ass!
Then that must be my ass.
HEY, QUYS, not the rig ht time.
Okay.
Yeah.
Lyric,
it's on you.
Carla was right, you don't deserve it.
Every single one of us had your back.
You basically spit in our faces.
That was messed up.
Ldidl'1'\ ITISEH ION.
I don't care what you meant.
I only care about what you did.
We were like sisters, Tina.
I would've done anything for you.
Then you leave me, and now you want to come back like we're all cool?
I'm sorry.
I messed up.
YOU messed Up bad.
You're still family, and I'll always love you.
But if you want my trust, you got to earn it,
Just tell me how.
I'll do it.
You can start by getting back in this crew, and help us whoop Luis' ass.
I might need a tissue.
(SOBBING) Damn, I think my allergies kicking in or something.
I thought someone was chopping onions up in here,
(SOBBING)
(HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
Besides 718, who else we got to look out for?
That's hard to say.
I mean, some of the best crews from last year will be back.
If.'$ I'1Oll fol' the Weak.
(AUDIENCE BOOING)
(LOUD CHEERING)
We're going to need your toughness, Tina.
YOU mean thai?

Aw!
Aw!
All right.
Okay!
Get off me!
Th3i'S the bUSif\€SS.

You got to loosen up.
Those other crews will smell the fear on you, especially the 71 8.

(ALL WHOOPING)
There was this girl when I was in juvie, Julissa, and every time we would battle, she'd always come up with something new,
What was she in for?
She tried to kill her stepdad.
Whoa. why?
She didn't say, but we all knew.
Was it scary in there?
Not in a way you could really imagine or I could really describe to you.
It's like feeling alone with hundreds of people around you.
What did they charge you with?
Breaking and entering.
Luis thought he knew his way in and out of a pawn shop.
What he didn't know was sometimes the owner liked to stay late.
Luis heard 3 noise, Fan OUT and left me to deal with a man with the biggest gun I'd ever seen, pointed right in my face.
How did you get hooked up with that guy in the first place?
He used to COFTIG to the C€I'Tll€F.
He gave me attention.
Ldidrl"t really have 8 lot of that SS 3 foster Kid.
What happened to your parents?
They died in 3 Cal' crash.
I was 10.
Shit-
Can we talk about something else?
No disrespect, but,..
An right.
Yeah, lerslake 3 break.
I just need 10 get outside.
Let's go eat.
You all not coming?
We're going to stay back.
Don't do anything I wouldn'\ do!
What exactly wouldn't you do?
Him.
You see, that's messed up.
I didn't even say nothing,
Why you got to come at me like that?
You're asking for it all the time!
God!
I asked you to stay so we could talk.
I mean, there's still a lot I don't know about you.
What do you want to know?
Well, for St3l'l6fS, a dance and business major?
Whal'S ihal about?
My father is the one that's pressing me into finance.
He just doesn't think that there's a future for me in dance.
But the way I look at it is, if we win Battle Zone,
I could go on tour for a year just doing what I love.
And I can go back to school with no regrets.
And it'S like I gave it that shot.
You know what I mean?
I know.
I know what it's like to have people not believe in you,
Is that why you want to win so bad?
It's not even about that, really.
I mean, the people that really count,
Mrs. Daniels.
You.
I mean, they've always had my back, even when I didn't see it.
And whether we win or lose, I'm going to keep dancing.
It's how I say the things I want to say.

Uh-huh.
Don't "uh-huh" her.

Going to come out here, and we are going to put you to work.
Great.
Okay.
Let'S start with these.
An right.
And let's set a couple of rules.
Like what?
Like curfew at 9:00, and you're not allowed to hang out with your old crew.
You ain't got to worry about that.
They ditched me a while back.
Any more rules?
Well, not a rule, but I would like you to start thinking about your future,
Like, what do you wanna do with your life?
If it was up to me...
VVl'\3ll€V€I".
It doeSr'l"[ matter.
What about your dancing?
You used to love that.
Look, I got to get a real job.
It's not like I can make any money dancing,
Excuse me?
Honey built this studio with her dance career.
We all can't be like your daughter, Mrs, Daniels.
Well, if anybody could be, it'd be you.
What have you...
Give me that!
This ain't no mirror cleaning.
Now, see, your problem is, you are not motivated,
Now, look at that.
That is what a mirror's supposed to look like.
MR. KAPOOR:
No, come on.
Please, Maria.
MARIA:
Oh, come on.
Maria, please.
Please.
What?
I don't think you working here is a good idea.
Why?
You want to heal' me num?
I don't trust you anymore.
Okay?
Mr. Kapoor, you know me.
I messed up one time.
One time!
You know what they say.
Once you go bad, you never go back.
Wait, no.
It's... it's once you go "black," you never go back.
But that makes no sense.
How can you go...
Is that what they really say?
Hmm.
I'll try 10 I'€mEfT'lb€I' that.
Besides, Maria, I'm running a business here, not a charity, okay?
I'd really like to help you, but I just can't.

But I can help you out.
Right?
And hows mar?

Quit it while you're behind.
Baby, stop.
Lail"I'll ever seen 8 New York Clal'1CeF that Could turf like that.
Did you live in Cali or something?
No.
I learned it from this girl I used to know.
You think you can teach us how to do it?
Really?
What happened to, "I'm going to break your ass in halt"'?
Yeah, that was before I saw you dance, though.
Whatever, Lyric.
We don't need her.
I think we do, Tina, because I've never seen you get down like that.
So, you interested?
No, thanks.
Why not?
YOU'l'€ here an me time.

Girl, if I wasn't on probation..
Ooh!
What would you do?
You know what?
I'm just not interested.
Hey, what's going on?
It's the 718.
They're buying everybody slices.
When why?
They always do stuff like that,
Last time, they handed out school supplies.
My moms really loved that, but I'd rather have the pizza.
YOU'l'€jUSI in time.

Yo, you got so lit.
I wasn'l too buzzed to catch the bouquet, though.
Right.
After you knocked over the old lady and the flower girl.
Oh, my gosh, it was an accident!
Nobody got hurt.
The flower girl lost a tooth, Maria.
It was already loose.
And I gave her the bouquet to make up for it!
True.
True.
Okay, then.
Oh, man.
You know, after a while, the DJ wasn't that bad.
We danced for a while after everybody left.
It was nice, though.
I thought about that night a lot when I was gone.
Have you thought about coming back to the crew?
I'm so tempted.
You know how much dancing means to me.
Come dance with us tomorrow.
I know once we get back at it, it'll be just like Old times.
That's what I'm afraid Of.

You lied to me!
Listen, you don't understand.
Ii'S just a Side hustle!
Li's how I'm able to do the good shit
I do around here and give back!
Don't you see that?
They don't care about us.
We got to do for ourselves.
Me and you.
No!
Not me.
Not anymore.
I don'\ want ii.
(Klcls CANS)
Hey,
Hey,
I'll dance with your crew on one condition.
Yeah, what's that?
We get on Battle Zane and we beat the 718.
Wait, hold up.
You're trying to use us to get revenge?
That, and part of the grand prize is that your choreographer gets an internship.
That'S the kind of break I need.
Who said you were going to take over our choreography?
BRANDON:
I mean, we could use the help.
Rigm now, we're just winging it.
Her Stuff could push us over the top.
Au right, so can we get started?
No, see, you're tripping.
AUdmOl'1S BTS if the end of the month.
Let's do this.
BRANDON;
Tina, Lyric.
Part of the grand prize is $100,000.
I know we could all use that money, but with your grandma's medical expenses, I thoug ht.,.
Why you got to put us on blast?
No, I'm not.
Look, you know I got your back, always.
And if you really don't want her in, just say the word and I'm down.
But I think we should do it for Grandma.
I do.
And if I say no, I'm the bad guy, right?
Pretty much.
All right, Fine, she's in.
CARLA:
Yeah!
But if she gets in my face again, I'm going to cut her.
With what?
Your razor sharp wit?
My what?
I just said yes to you to get in my crew.
dof't'1i'lalk to ITIS like that.
All right.
Five, six, seven, eight.
It's one, two, three, four, five, six and seven, eight.
One, two, three...
One, two, yep, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
You guys got to trust that the guys have your back.
And you guys need to turn, and you guys need to know that they're coming.
Three and four, five and six, and seven, eight.
One, two, four, six, eight,
Are you serious?
Get up!
Ge!
up!
Carla, pay attention!
Whoa!
Oh, my God!
TINA:
This is So Stupid.
I'm not into it, right?
Yo, can we just stop arguing for two seconds and focus?
How are we supposed to know what we're doing if we can't even see?
That's the whole point.
You guys are using your eyes and those mirrors as crutches.
You need to learn how to trust your instincts.
Trust each other.
Think you can do il?
Just turn the damn music on already.
Shit.
LYRIC:
Watch ii!
Whoa!
(FAST-PACED MUSIC)
(ALL CHEERING)
That was dope.
That was amazing, yo!
MARIA:
All right, y'all ready to go full out?
BRANDON:
I_6ll'S do if..
Whoo!
All right, HD!
(ALL WHOOPING)
That was dope.
I got to hand it to you, girl.
You're really getting us there.
I feel like we might even have a shot to win this thing.
We'll See!
We're going to need to come a lot stronger than this,
I know that much.
Wow!
What is your problem?
I guess I can't help telling the truth.
My bad.
Hey, I like what you're doing.
Keep it up, and all the haters are going to have left is hate.
I appreciate that.
Later, y'all.
PSHCG.
Same time tomorrow, B?
Yep.
Fife me.
Later, D. You got it, bro.
Bye,
(LAUGHS)
Don't listen to Tina.
She talks a lot of smack, but she's a good girl.
Yeah, it's not her smack talk that pisses me off.
I think she might be right.
Was Tina right when she said that you're trying to win this thing to get back at Luis?
Notjust Luis.
It's like, most of my life, people told me I'd never be anything.
So, what is it you wanted to be?
Honestly?
I want to be a dancer.
And I always have.
I think we should go somewhere.
Okay.
Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?
You'll see.
We're going to get cleaned up.
(MARIA GRUNTS) Yeah.
Yeah, watch, watch.
Whoo!
How did you know about all those places?
I'm a dance major at NYU.
And part of our curriculum is to experience the arts.
My head is just busting with ideas right now.
All the stuff we could do, like mixing the stuff we saw.
You know what I mean?
Like, if we go...
Barn!
Bam!
Bam!
Bam!
You know?
(CAR HONKING)
Thank you!
Do you even realize what you do with your choreography?
It's like you're telling this beautiful story.
What?
"Beautiful"?
Yeah, I said it.
Beautiful.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing.
Just, if that's the way you step to girls, your game is pretty weak.
You might want to take some lessons from Darnell.
What?
Are you serious?
Yeah!
Darnell?
Okay, I would never do that, first of all.
Second, I bet I do know what impresses you.
What?
What?
What are you doing?
Yo, yo, what up, Ma?
You dig my swagger now?
Or you still fronting like you stunting?
I'm just saying, shawty.
What's a brotha got to do to get with you?
You need to quit.
Quit what?
Quit this?
Oh, ay!
Ay!
Uh, uh!
Ooh!
Pow!
How you like me now?
No, I liked you beflel' bEfo\'E,
Yeah?

They're starting to grow on me.

Yes, word.
Stupid.
Ll'S I'liC€.
YGS,
Maria?
What?
I still think you're beautiful.
Whal else?
Okay, you're going to make me earn this kiss, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Your smile.
I mean, you don't give it up much, but when I catch one,
I just want to make you happy.
Oh,
Now what?
Now, I want you to look at me like I'm the only girl in this world.
I've been doing that since the first moment I saw you.
Okay.
Can I kiss you now?
You really need to kiss me now.

Maria!
What are you doing?
The tango!
I know what ii'S called.
What I want to know is why are you doing it when you're supposed to be working?
Mr. Kapoor, you work too hard.
Do you know what you need?
Yes, an employee who doesn't tango with brooms.
No, you need to dance more.
No, thank you.
I only dance at the funerals of people I hate.
Come on!
Stop being so grumpy all the time.
I'm warning you, Maria.
I have bad knees, arthritis and clogged arteries,
I'll make ii easy for you.
Put your hand here.
And keep your shoulders straight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
NO, that wasn't good.
That was good!
No, I did Shit.
You killed it!
Hey!
What are you doing here?
I wasn't expecting to see you until later.
Wen, I thought maybe we can get a bite to eat before rehearsals.
Okay.
And I wan!
to talk to you about something.
Why?
I just found out they moved my finals to the same day as the audition.
YOU have fin8lS in GBHCG?
No, I'm a double major.
I got dance, and I got business,
These are my business exams.
I'm sorry.
I hate that I have to miss it, Maria.
Rm going to be with you guys every step of the way, leading up until the audition.

Relax them.
Who are you shooting?
Relax them.
This is So stupid.
CARLA:
Tina, lei's just finish it.
It's not stupid, Tina.
Okay, look, I studied the show.
All the past winners are well-rounded.
This will help us.
Right.
And with this new style, it's like we've been dipped in culture.
That's one thing I know the 71 8 doesn't have.
Culture.
(SOFTLY) Dipped.
Dipped in culture.
I don't think so.
BRANDON:
Come on, it's a good thing.
This stuff will help us.
Come on.
Fine.
LYRIC:
Quit whining.
TINA:

In your face.
JONAS:
Well, Honey Daniels is amazing.
Y'all have got some big, big shoes to fill.
I could tell you righi now, you're just wasting your time.
JONAS;

LUIS:

She couldn't quite cut it with our crew,
SO I cut her IOOS€.
Why you got to lie?
Yo, can we get this audition going, or what?

(MUSIC PLAYING)
(PANNNG)
Listen, we've decided that because of your dancing and the obvious tension between you and my boy Luis here, that this Should make for great television.
HD, welcome to the Battle Zone.
(ALL SCREAM JOYOUSLY)
Thank you.
Thank you.
We did it.
That was insane.
It was nuts.
Not just the way we made the show, but the way you stood up to those judges.
I mean, you were like, "Hell no!
Y'all are going to check us out!"
Okay, I just wanted our crew to have a fair shot.
I give you mad props for that.
We finally feel like a real crew, you know?
And that wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you.
I respect that.
You're welcome.
You can take that one to them.
I'll get the other one.
Okay.
Make them save me a slice, though,
I will.
I'm in.
So, where's Brandon at?
I texted him.
He must still be taking his finals.
Finals?
He could've skipped those to come celebrate, man.
You don't skip finals, bro.
That's why they call them finals,
The boy is trying to get his edu-macation on.
That don't make him any different than the rest of us.
We all just want to dance for a living.
Yeah, but we don't all have filthy rich parents like he does.
What are you talking about?
His family owns half Of Texas.
You didn't know?
His family makes the Hiltons look like the Hammers.
(LAUGHING)
Can't touch this.
Really_ Really?
He's good with kids, too.
He te8Cl'1€S 3 class with kids?
Yeah.
Once a week.
You didn't know that either?
What do you know?
Let me ask you a serious question.
Do y'all actually ever talk or just bone?
She just be like...
Shake it, baby!
Yo, Carla.
Check it out.
CARLAI Oh, uh-uh.
She is about to be sleeping with the enemy.
Good stuff today.
Thank you.
Watching you move was amazing.
Stop it.
Hey, I'm serious.
Tina, is he bothering you?
No, he was just telling me how much he liked our audition.
No, I said I like your audition.
You're the one who brings the heat to this group.
Tina, did he tell you that you're too good for us and that you should be dancing with his crew?
Yeah, he did, but...
Tina, he's trying to play you.
Hey, calm down.
I told him I would stay with the HDS.
Wen, good.
But you act like I ain't even good enough to dance with them.
I diunw say mar.
Sounds like that's what she's saying to me.
MARIA:
You know what?
Stop starting trouble.
Leave our crew alone.
Tina, are you going to let her dis you like that?
I mean, I know if someone in my crew called me out, we'd battle on the spot.
Wow!
I am not calling her out.
And if we're going to battle, we're going to do it as a crew and take your sorry ass out.
And what's stopping you?
What's stopping you?
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)
See that, Tina?
She's scared.
She's scared!
If you were on the 718, baby, you wouldn't run from nothing.
Whatever.
Maria, we got to do this, okay?
We're finally getting some props, and it's time to back it up.
Tina, are YOU sure?
Yeah, I'm as sure as you were in that audition.
That's pretty sure.
Tina's right.
If we aren't going to knock heads, we got to do something.
Hen, yeah!
That's what I'm saying.

And you actually think you're going to take us out on Battle Zone?
(scoFFs)
Toys.
Tina, when you're ready to grow up, come holler at your boy.
Yo, I was wrong.
We ain't no damn crew.
We're just some posers.
Tina, we tried...
But our try wasn't good enough, ain't never good enough!
We got humiliated!
Nobody is going to respect us after this.
Nobody!
Wait, Tina!
Leave me alone!
Tina!
Tina!
(CROWD JEERING)
YOU'l'S IE\€.
Do I have to remind you what time your curfew is?
I know what time my curfew is,
You know what?
We made rules in this house, and they are going to have to be followed.
Or what?
You're going to send me back to juvie?
Fine.
What is the matter with you?
I'm just sick of trying.
I try and live by your rules.
I try and stay out of trouble.
I try and join a new crew.
And nothing works.
Well, it doesn't mean you have to give up.
Save it.
I'm going to bed.
Hey,
Where you been?
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't get much sleep last night.
What's going on?
Tina quit.
She said she's not coming back.
What the hell?
Do you know what this does to our choreography?
Of course we do!
But I'm...
Bun nothing!
This screws everything up!
Don't take it out on Lyric.
I'm not taking it out on Lyric.
I'm pissed!
So, what do we do?
You tell us.
You're the choreographer.
You know what?
I don't need this right now.
I'm out.
Weil, that's messed up.
What?
A Sf feel bafue?
What were you thinking?
Didn't you know losing would ruin their confidence?
I'm sorry, college boy, I'm not as smart as you.
I didn'1 know that
Well, you should have.
And you should have told me you were just some rich kid slumming it down here for grades.
Now, what does my family's money have to do with any of this?
Makes ii all just a game for you.
If things fall apart, you can just leave, buf the FSSI Of US SFS stuck h€I'S to deal with ii.
In case you haven't noticed, I'm Still here.
You're the one that walked out.
Because i'l['S over!
I quit!
We can't win without Tina!
Fine, If that's the way you feel, then you should quit.
I'm going to go up there with my crew, because I believe in us.
Mafia.
Are you okay?
Yeah. why?
Today's your day off.
What can I say?
I'd rather be here than anywhere else.
Oh, Maria.
Let'S talk.
Let's talk.
You got to follow your heart, Maria.
Is there a problem at home or with your friends?
Both.
And this is how you deal with it?
Come to work?
Yeah.
Huh.
Good.
Why, because you get free labor?
Of course.
But I was thinking, Maria, instead of getting yourself into trouble, you chose to do something constructive.
I like that.
Well, while I'r'r'l being constructive, is there anything else you want me to do?
You go work your register, and I'll take care of this later,
You said no one works the register but you,
What, you expect me to take your word for it that you were going to change?
NO,
I had to wait for you to prove it, and you have.
So, now I trust you.
Thanks, Mr. Kapoor.
That means a lot.
BRANDON:
Five, six, seven, eight.
An right.
Try it again.
Five, six, seven, eight.
An right.
So, you're back now?
Why new
I still got to do my community service here anyway.
Right.
Hey,
Hey, nook.
I want to be here, if that's okay with you.
Whatever.
Uh-uh.
Yo, is that Tina?
Okay, I'm just going to go ahead and say it,
Shit!
She joined up with the 718.
That's scandalous, man.
How's she going to play us like that?
Because she only thinks about her damn self, that's how.
BRANDON:
We can't sweat this right now, guys,
MARIA:
He's right.
We need to focus 0l'1 \l'1iS CFGW.
So, let's rock this thing, all right?
Bring it in.
Let's get an HD on three, an right?
One, two, three...
ALL:
HD!
MARIO!
Every S€3S0f1 OD BB"/G ZOITS, we find Ihe hottest, IT'loS\ il'lS3I'l€ CTGWS OH the SCSIIG, and last season was no different.
The 718 set this place on fire with their off-the-chain routines, and at the end of this season, you're going to see them perform against the last crew standing.
There's already been some behind-the-scenes madness with one crew jacking another for a dancer, and we haven't even started yet.
So, what's jumping off next?
Stay tuned, because you don't want to miss Battle Zone.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
(LOUD CHEERING)
One of these crews is going home tonight.
Judges, who will it be?
Well, it's obvious that this year's talent is amazing, but, unfortunately, somebody has to go.
And rumgnr, it's Fanny Pak.
(SCREAMS JOYOUSLY)
Sorry, guys.
ALL; (DRAMATICALLY) Ah!
Ah,
I'm sorry to see those guys go.
They were a hot crew.
Yeah, but they weren't the best.
And you have got to be the best if you're gonna go up against the 71 8.
MARIO:
Enough said.
We'll see you next week in Battle Zone.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Come on, we just killed it!
Yeah, we're still in.
WE I'1S€d\0 Ialk.
No, we don't.
Look, I know you think you know what you're doing, but you don't.
You need to stay away from Luis.
He said you were going to say something like that.
Trying to get me back in the crew?
Look, he's right, we need you.
But more importantly,
I don't want to see you get caught up.
You don't know him like I do.
I know he's my best chance at winning that prize money.
Can you guarantee me that?
Yeah, I didn't think 50,
Wait.
For what?
I ain't coming back to your crew.
Then, just be careful.
Can I talk to you for a second?
What do you want?
Lrll only rake E SECOHU.
Come on.
Whats up?
Let me take Tina's place.
Right.
I mean it.
I'll come dance with you if you kick Tina off your crew.
What changed your mind all Of a Sudden?
I know what I'm getting into with you.
Tina doesn't.
And since when did you become a teenage crisis counselor?
You know I'm a better dancer than her, and I can pretty much guarantee you another win.
That's true.
There's just one little problem.
hat'S that?
Come here.
Come close.
I don't trust you, witch.
Ever since you got out ofjuvie, you've been full of yourself and treating me like I'm something you scraped off your shoe.
But, you see that little girl over there?
She has stars in her eyes.
And I can make her do anything I want.
You're a jerk.
Do you know that?
You used to like it.
You tried to fix it, didn't you?
You were listening?
I had to make sure you were okay.
Yeah, I'm good.
Ijusi feel bad.
Tina being with them is all my fault.
NO,
Til'1a'S SIUbbol'fl.
That's her fauli.
But thanks for trying to protect her.
I just want the crew to go back to the way it was, you know?
I do, too.
Hey, do me a favor.
Don't be mad at me anymore, because I'm too tired to fight.
N19 too.
BRANDON:
Yeah, the movie was good, but real talk, could you stop killing us in rehearsals?
No, I have to.
We've got to make it to the finals.
We got to be strong enough to win.
You can hang, can't you, college boy?
Oh, I can hang.
Okay, then.
So, say my name.
College boy?
Okay, say it.
(LAUGHS) Okay, okay!
Brandon!
"Brandon," all right?
Are you happy now?
Very h3PPY-
(GIRL SOBBING)
Do you hear that?
Yeah.
Just wait rig hi here.
Maria, come here.
Tina, are you okay?
MARIA;
Hey, what happened?
Did Luis do this to you?
No, it was his boys.
They beat you up?
No.
Luis told them to walk me home, and then they smashed a store window and told me to grab stuff.
And did you?
I WGS 100 SC3l'€d.
There was glass everywhere.
I got all cut up.
I'll take her to my house.
It's okay there.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
I should've listened to you when you told me to stay away from Luis.
Yeah, well, sometimes you just got to learn the hard way.
Yeah, you're right.
So, what are you going to do now?
I'm not messing with Luis no more.
That's for damn sure.
Word.
VVl"liCl"l ITTSSFIS I C3l"I'll dal'1C€ with his Crew either.
Right.
You 'think I could COITIG back to the HDS?
You know that's not how it works.
Yeah.
Hey!
Owl
Are you an right?
Yeah.
MARIA:
All right.
You guys already know my vote.
I say we let Tina back in the crew.
That would be my vote, too,
MARIA:
All right.
Ricky?
Well,
Tina's my homegirl, so, yeah.
I want her back.
All right.
Carla?
Girl, I'm easy.
Ha!
We know that.
You don'\!
Anyways, my vote is yes.
Not because I think you deserve it, Tina, but because I CENT Sfind l.UiS and his CFSW.
An right.
Well, Tina's crazy.
And you know what they say, crazy ass is the best ass.
And the best ass is some crazy ass!
Then that must be my ass.
HEY, QUYS, not the rig ht time.
Okay.
Yeah.
Lyric,
it's on you.
Carla was right, you don't deserve it.
Every single one of us had your back.
You basically spit in our faces.
That was messed up.
Ldidl'1'\ ITISEH ION.
I don't care what you meant.
I only care about what you did.
We were like sisters, Tina.
I would've done anything for you.
Then you leave me, and now you want to come back like we're all cool?
I'm sorry.
I messed up.
YOU messed Up bad.
You're still family, and I'll always love you.
But if you want my trust, you got to earn it,
Just tell me how.
I'll do it.
You can start by getting back in this crew, and help us whoop Luis' ass.
I might need a tissue.
(SOBBING) Damn, I think my allergies kicking in or something.
I thought someone was chopping onions up in here,
(SOBBING)
(HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
Besides 718, who else we got to look out for?
That's hard to say.
I mean, some of the best crews from last year will be back.
If.'$ I'1Oll fol' the Weak.
(AUDIENCE BOOING)
(LOUD CHEERING)
We're going to need your toughness, Tina.
YOU mean thai?
You think I'd give you a compliment if I didn'1 mean ii?
Aw!
Aw!
All right.
Okay!
Get off me!
Th3i'S the bUSif\€SS.
You guys, come on.
You got to loosen up.
Those other crews will smell the fear on you, especially the 71 8.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
MARIO!
Join US fl6Xf week, because you don?
want to miss the semifinals on Dance Battle Zone.
(ALL WHOOPING)
There was this girl when I was in juvie, Julissa, and every time we would battle, she'd always come up with something new,
What was she in for?
She tried to kill her stepdad.
Whoa. why?
She didn't say, but we all knew.
Was it scary in there?
Not in a way you could really imagine or I could really describe to you.
It's like feeling alone with hundreds of people around you.
What did they charge you with?
Breaking and entering.
Luis thought he knew his way in and out of a pawn shop.
What he didn't know was sometimes the owner liked to stay late.
Luis heard 3 noise, Fan OUT and left me to deal with a man with the biggest gun I'd ever seen, pointed right in my face.
How did you get hooked up with that guy in the first place?
He used to COFTIG to the C€I'Tll€F.
He gave me attention.
Ldidrl"t really have 8 lot of that SS 3 foster Kid.
What happened to your parents?
They died in 3 Cal' crash.
I was 10.
Shit-
Can we talk about something else?
No disrespect, but,..
An right.
Yeah, lerslake 3 break.
I just need 10 get outside.
Let's go eat.
You all not coming?
We're going to stay back.
Don't do anything I wouldn'\ do!
What exactly wouldn't you do?
Him.
You see, that's messed up.
I didn't even say nothing,
Why you got to come at me like that?
You're asking for it all the time!
God!
I asked you to stay so we could talk.
I mean, there's still a lot I don't know about you.
What do you want to know?
Well, for St3l'l6fS, a dance and business major?
Whal'S ihal about?
My father is the one that's pressing me into finance.
He just doesn't think that there's a future for me in dance.
But the way I look at it is, if we win Battle Zone,
I could go on tour for a year just doing what I love.
And I can go back to school with no regrets.
And it'S like I gave it that shot.
You know what I mean?
I know.
I know what it's like to have people not believe in you,
Is that why you want to win so bad?
It's not even about that, really.
I mean, the people that really count,
Mrs. Daniels.
You.
I mean, they've always had my back, even when I didn't see it.
And whether we win or lose, I'm going to keep dancing.
It's how I say the things I want to say.
(SENSUAL MUSIC PLAYING)
One of these crews is going home tonight.
You don't want to miss this.

Yeah.
Girl, God bless you.

RICKY:
Hey, if we lose, we lose.
Worst-case scenario, I go back to trying to find a job.

You all got mad heart.
Why do I feel like there's a "but" coming?
You know me well.
Unfortunately.
Congrats on getting here, but this ES as far as it goes.

Congrats.

That's funny.
I was going to say the exact same thing.
We did it!

Dipped in culture.
Like, you take us, and we are little dancers and you dip us in other cultures.
You weren't going to hit her with that bat, were you?
Her?
No.
But had it been Big Lester,
I would have gone Alex Rodriguez on his butt.

(CHEERING)
Maria Bennett.
It's time to go.
Miss Bennett, yesterday in court, you received an order to be paroled into foster care, which made you eligible since you won't turn 18 for a few months.
Right?
Uh-huh.
Don't "uh-huh" her.
What?
I know you know better.
She knows better.
Mmm-hmm.
Okay, now, Mrs. Daniels, you do understand that as Maria's appointed foster parent, you take full responsibility of this minor?
(CHUCKLES) Do I ever.
Okay.
That's it.
CONNIE:
That's it?
Yes, it is.
Just follow the yellow line down to the exit.
And good luck.
Thank you.
Thank you so very much.
Thank you.
I was talking to Maria.
CONNIE:
All right, follow me.
Going to come out here, and we are going to put you to work.
Great.
Okay.
Let's start with these.
All right.
And let's set a couple of rules.
Like what?
Like curfew at 9:00, and you're not allowed to hang out with your old crew.
You ain't got to worry about that.
They ditched me a while back.
Any more rules?
Well, not a rule, but I would like you to start thinking about your future.
Like, what do you wanna do with your life?
If it was up to me...
Whatever.
It doesn't matter.
What about your dancing?
You used to love that.
Look, I got to get a real job.
It's not like I can make any money dancing.
Excuse me?
Honey built this studio with her dance career.
We all can't be like your daughter, Mrs. Daniels.
Well, if anybody could be, it'd be you.
What have you...
Give me that!
This ain't no mirror cleaning.
Now, see, your problem is, you are not motivated.
Now, look at that.
That is what a mirror's supposed to look like.
MR. KAPOOR:
No, come on.
Please, Maria.
MARIA:
Oh, come on.
Maria, please.
Please.
What?
I don't think you working here is a good idea.
Why?
You want to hear the truth?
I don't trust you anymore.
Okay?
Mr. Kapoor, you know me.
I messed up one time.
One time!
You know what they say.
Once you go bad, you never go back.
Wait, no.
It's...
It's once you go "black," you never go back.
But that makes no sense.
How can you go...
Is that what they really say?
Hmm.
I'll try to remember that.
Besides, Maria, I'm running a business here, not a charity, okay?
I'd really like to help you, but I just can't.
All right, maybe not.
But I can help you out.
Right?
And how's that?
Hey!
Put it back.
Put what back?
I ain't got nothing.
Yeah?
Damn!
How did that get in there?
I saw you take the bracelet, too.
Hey!
Nobody steals from Kapoor!
Big Lester, grab him!
Grab him!
(EXHALES)
Big Lester, did you see him?
It was just her.
Oh, God.
These frigging kids.
Now, tell me, how did you know she was stealing?
When she walked in, I just had this feeling something was up.
Mmm.
Maybe I could use you here after all.
So, I got the job?
Yes, but on a trial basis.
Okay.
If you screw up...
Whoop!
Outside, okay?
Out, yeah.
Thank you.
Can you start today?
(HIP HOP MUSIC)
(TURNS OFF MUSIC)
I see you ain't lost your sexy.
Damn it, Luis.
How did you get in here?
The place is locked.
Since when has that stopped me?
What do you want?
I heard you were here, and I wanted to see you.
Well, you saw me.
Now leave.
It's like that, huh?
Yeah.
I thought we could hang out.
Maybe catch up.
That's what you get for thinking.
You still tripping off that stuff that happened?
Did you really just ask me that?
You need to get out of my face.
What did you expect me to do, Maria?
It ain't like we would've shared a cell.
You did juvie.
I would've got real time.
Hell, what I got felt real to me.
And I wouldn't have even been there if it wasn't for you.
So, what do you want me to say?
Look, I'm sorry.
Oh, well.
There it is.
It makes it all better now.
I didn't come here to fight.
I got some good news.
What?
You heard about the 718?
What about them?
Well, we won the Dance Battle Zone competition.
So?
So, I want you to come back and dance with us.
Yo, we missed you, and we still got mad love for you.
Yeah, I've had your kind of love.
And you can keep it.
Look, I've changed.
I ain't caught up in all that bullshit anymore.
I've been straight since you left.
No hustling or stealing!
I don't believe you.
Then let me prove it to you.
I know you still want to be a real dancer.
I can make that happen.
You know what?
I think you should leave.
Right now.
Okay.
I won't push.
But do me a favor, just think about it.
Okay?
Goodbye, Luis.
(EXHALES)
(ALARM CLOCK BUZZING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
CONNIE:
Maria!
Maria!
MARIA:
What?
I'm up!
Maria!
Get up!
All right!
Damn.
Crazy woman.
Ta-da!
Is that for me?
Of course!
But don't get used to it.
Now, you may be living in Bay Ridge now, but room service is a one-time only thing.
Thanks, Mrs. Daniels.
You're welcome.
Now, don't you feel bad for cursing me out?
Oh, I was having a nightmare.
Yo, son.
What?
Damn!
That's got to be the finest janitor ever.
Hell, yeah.
And you know what?
I think she needs some of this pimping right here.
Darnell, don't do this to yourself, man.
You got no swag and no chance with that.
(SCOFFS) Come on.
Watch me, kid.
Darnell.
I'm telling you, man...
Excuse me, sweetheart?
All right.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Excuse me, miss?
You are far too fine to be sweeping these floors.
What if I told you I could change your life if you just take my hand?
Uh...
What?
Can't speak?
I'm waiting for the punch line.
That was a joke, right?
Uh.
Awkward.
Yeah.
Of course.
Okay.
Yeah.
All jokes.
I'll let you do what you do.
You are the worst.
What?
You couldn't have did it, man.
CARLA:
Hey, boys!
Hey!
(UPBEAT HIP HOP MUSIC)
Whoo!
LYRIC:
Jump in there!
Whoa, whoa!
Can I help you?
Not you, her.
$38.75.
Pay up.
What?
I don't even know...
That's how much you owe for the stuff you tried to steal, the mess you caused and that bracelet.
You better get out of my face!
What are you going to do?
First, you need to check your tone.
This is my cousin.
And please believe I will break your little, skinny ass in half.
I wasn't talking to you!
You better back off!
Cool it!
I got this chick.
Back off!
Tina, stop!
Stop.
Look, now, I don't know who you are, but you can't just roll up here and harass my crew.
She's a thief.
I caught her shoplifting.
You did that, Tina?
Brandon!
Who are you going to believe?
Me or this janitor?
I'm sure the janitor has a name.
Who are you?
Don't worry about who I am.
Just keep your little hoodrat on a leash.
CARLA:
Damn!
I know that chick.
Her name's Maria.
She used to dance with Luis and them.
The 718?
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, okay.
No, Carla's right.
Yo, she was fire.
TINA:
Anyway.
I ain't thinking about them.
All right, it's over.
Let's get back to work.
Word.
CARLA:
Word.
MARIO:
The winning crew will win $100, 000, go on a world tour with a major recording artist and their choreographer will get a year's internship with a world-renowned choreographer.
Three huge prizes.
You don 't want to miss this.
So, if your crew thinks they're the next B-Z champs, go online now for auditions near you.
And we'll see you next week on Battle Zone.
Go hard or go home!
I can't believe this show is making celebrities out of these thugs.
They're the best crew out right now.
I just wish I had...
Maria...
Don't wait up.
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
BRANDON:
Hey.
You stalking me or something?
Me?
Stalking you?
Not hardly.
Damn, I was kidding, girl.
You always this rude, Maria?
How'd you know my name?
It's on your necklace.
Come on, you want to dance?
No, thanks.
Wow.
What, are you scared?
Scared you might like me?
Or scared you can't hang?
I knew you'd come back to me.
Not even.
Hold up.
The crew is here.
Come hang out with us.
No, thanks.
What's your problem?
Look, I'm just trying to stay out of trouble.
That's all.
We did more than just get into trouble, remember?
Hey, back off, all right?
I'm here with someone.
Who?
I got to go.
Hey!
Hey.
Do me a favor.
What's up?
Come on, dance with me.
You're kidding me, right?
No.
Why you desperate all of a sudden?
Come on.
Really?
He'll be back.
Hey, whatever.
All right.
All right.
Come on.
Watch and learn this.
There you go.
Go away.
Is everything all right?
I'm fine, yeah.
Just ignore him.
What's wrong?
Can't hang no more?
I can hang.
Let's see.
Why you all up in our business?
Go find your own chick.
That's my girl!
No, I ain't.
This fool.
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)
So, are we going out tonight?
What?
No!
Not today, boo.
No, no.
What you mean?
Yo, hey, look, for real.
Hey, you're wack.
Hey, what the hell was that?
It was tomorrow's schedule until you made me ruin it.
I'm talking about last night when you played me.
No, I didn't.
I almost got in a fight over you with that fool Luis, and then you bailed on me?
What's up with that?
It's a long story, and I don't want to talk about it.
That's it?
Pretty much.
Whatever.
You owe me.
I don't owe you anything.
Come with me.
I have to finish my board!
...And just all up in my business like, "Who are you?"
Yo, what is she doing here?
Okay.
I want you to show them how you danced last night.
You're kidding me, right?
No, I'm serious.
Do it.
TINA:
What's the matter?
Are you afraid to dance?
You look scared to me.
Yo, maybe she can help clean us up.
She can give me a bath any day.
(ALL LAUGHING)
TINA:
Just what I thought.
This trick ain't got nothing but a big mouth.
All right.
Play the music.
(HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
(ALL WHOOPING)
Damn!
That was the business!
Damn, boo, you are the truth!
Carla, really, you got to stop talking like that to people.
What, college boy?
I mean, she knows how I meant it.
Girls can say that to each other, all right?
It's like when black folks call each other "my..."
Quit it while you're behind.
Baby, stop.
I ain't ever seen a New York dancer that could turf like that.
Did you live in Cali or something?
No.
I learned it from this girl I used to know.
You think you can teach us how to do it?
Really?
What happened to, "I'm going to break your ass in half"?
Yeah, that was before I saw you dance, though.
Whatever, Lyric.
We don't need her.
I think we do, Tina, because I've never seen you get down like that.
So, you interested?
No, thanks.
Why not?
You're here all the time.
What you got to lose?
Is cleaning toilets keeping you busy?
I bet she's going crawling back to the 718.
Girl, if I wasn't on probation...
Ooh!
What would you do?
You know what?
I'm just not interested.
Hey, what's going on?
It's the 718.
They're buying everybody slices.
What?
Why?
They always do stuff like that.
Last time, they handed out school supplies.
My moms really loved that, but I'd rather have the pizza.
You're just in time.
For what?
What is all of this?
What does it look like?
We take care of our own, Ma.
I mean, if not us, who will?
So, this is what you meant when you said you changed?
Yeah, part of it.
I'm trying to do right, at least.
Didn't seem like it last night.
Man, I was just having some fun.
Hey, did you eat yet?
No.
Then come inside.
Dinner's on me.
Thanks, but no.
I'm just trying to feed you, I ain't trying to get you pregnant.
Okay.
But I'm not staying long.
MARIA: (LAUGHS) Do you remember your cousin's wedding?
Yo, you got so lit.
I wasn't too buzzed to catch the bouquet, though.
Right.
After you knocked over the old lady and the flower girl.
Oh, my gosh, it was an accident!
Nobody got hurt.
The flower girl lost a tooth, Maria.
It was already loose.
And I gave her the bouquet to make up for it!
True.
True.
Okay, then.
Oh, man.
You know, after a while, the DJ wasn't that bad.
We danced for a while after everybody left.
It was nice, though.
I thought about that night a lot when I was gone.
Have you thought about coming back to the crew?
I'm so tempted.
You know how much dancing means to me.
Come dance with us tomorrow.
I know once we get back at it, it'll be just like old times.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Hey, you know I got you.
(HIP HOP PLAYING)
Wow.
So, this is where it all goes down.
Let's show her how we rock the 718.

LUIS:
Man, it feels good to have you back.
It just seems right.
You feel me?
Yeah.
It made me realize how much I miss being with our crew.
Is that all you missed?
You know, we could have it all now.
I just wish you would've listened to me back in the day.
Are you blaming me for what happened?
Don't sweat it.
We can start all over.
(POLICE SIREN WAILS)
Yo, we got company.
Let's go!
Let's go!
What are you doing?
Hold this.
What are you doing?
Relax.
What up, Luis?
What's up, homes?
What you got for us tonight?
Same thing I got for you every night.
Nothing.
(LAUGHS)
We can play it that way, too.
I know you got something.
Nope.
He's clean.
We'll get him next time.
The fool is bound to slip up.
You must have a thing for losers, huh, baby?
You two have a good night.
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
Are you okay?
Bastard!
You lied to me!
Listen, you don't understand.
It's just a side hustle!
It's how I'm able to do the good shit
I do around here and give back!
Don't you see that?
They don't care about us.
We got to do for ourselves.
Me and you.
No!
Not me.
Not anymore.
I don't want it.
(KICKS CANS)
Hey.
Hey.
I'll dance with your crew on one condition.
Yeah, what's that?
We get on Battle Zone and we beat the 718.
Wait, hold up.
You're trying to use us to get revenge?
That, and part of the grand prize is that your choreographer gets an internship.
That's the kind of break I need.
Who said you were going to take over our choreography?
BRANDON:
I mean, we could use the help.
Right now, we're just winging it.
Her stuff could push us over the top.
All right, so can we get started?
No, see, you're tripping.
Auditions are at the end of the month.
Let's do this.
BRANDON:
Tina, Lyric.
Part of the grand prize is $100,000.
I know we could all use that money, but with your grandma's medical expenses, I thought...
Why you got to put us on blast?
No, I'm not.
Look, you know I got your back, always.
And if you really don't want her in, just say the word and I'm down.
But I think we should do it for Grandma.
I do.
And if I say no, I'm the bad guy, right?
Pretty much.
All right.
Fine, she's in.
CARLA:
Yeah!
But if she gets in my face again, I'm going to cut her.
With what?
Your razor sharp wit?
My what?
I just said yes to you to get in my crew.
Don't talk to me like that.
All right.
Five, six, seven, eight.
It's one, two, three, four, five, six and seven, eight.
One, two, three...
One, two, yep, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
You guys got to trust that the guys have your back.
And you guys need to turn, and you guys need to know that they're coming.
Three and four, five and six, and seven, eight.
One, two, four, six, eight.
Are you serious?
Get up!
Get up!
Carla, pay attention!
Whoa!
Oh, my God!
TINA:
This is so stupid.
I'm not into it, right?
Yo, can we just stop arguing for two seconds and focus?
How are we supposed to know what we're doing if we can't even see?
That's the whole point.
You guys are using your eyes and those mirrors as crutches.
You need to learn how to trust your instincts.
Trust each other.
Think you can do it?
Just turn the damn music on already.
Shit.
LYRIC:
Watch it!
Whoa!
(FAST-PACED MUSIC)
(ALL CHEERING)
That was dope.
That was amazing, yo!
MARIA:
All right, y'all ready to go full out?
BRANDON:
Let's do it.
Whoo!
All right, HD!
(ALL WHOOPING)
That was dope.
I got to hand it to you, girl.
You're really getting us there.
I feel like we might even have a shot to win this thing.
We'll see!
We're going to need to come a lot stronger than this,
I know that much.
Wow!
What is your problem?
I guess I can't help telling the truth.
My bad.
Hey, I like what you're doing.
Keep it up, and all the haters are going to have left is hate.
I appreciate that.
Later, y'all.
Peace.
Same time tomorrow, B?
Yep.
Fire me.
Later, D. You got it, bro.
Bye.
(LAUGHS)
Don't listen to Tina.
She talks a lot of smack, but she's a good girl.
Yeah, it's not her smack talk that pisses me off.
I think she might be right.
Was Tina right when she said that you're trying to win this thing to get back at Luis?
Not just Luis.
It's like, most of my life, people told me I'd never be anything.
So, what is it you wanted to be?
Honestly?
I want to be a dancer.
And I always have.
I think we should go somewhere.
Okay.
Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?
You'll see.
We're going to get cleaned up.
(MARIA GRUNTS) Yeah.
Yeah, watch, watch.
Whoo!
How did you know about all those places?
I'm a dance major at NYU.
And part of our curriculum is to experience the arts.
My head is just busting with ideas right now.
All the stuff we could do, like mixing the stuff we saw.
You know what I mean?
Like, if we go...
Bam!
Bam!
Bam!
Bam!
You know?
(CAR HONKING)
Thank you!
Do you even realize what you do with your choreography?
It's like you're telling this beautiful story.
What?
"Beautiful"?
Yeah, I said it.
Beautiful.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing.
Just, if that's the way you step to girls, your game is pretty weak.
You might want to take some lessons from Darnell.
What?
Are you serious?
Yeah!
Darnell?
Okay, I would never do that, first of all.
Second, I bet I do know what impresses you.
What?
What?
What are you doing?
Yo, yo, what up, Ma?
You dig my swagger now?
Or you still fronting like you stunting?
I'm just saying, shawty.
What's a brotha got to do to get with you?
You need to quit.
Quit what?
Quit this?
Oh, ay!
Ay!
Uh, uh!
Ooh!
Pow!
How you like me now?
No, I liked you better before.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Just go back to your college boy ways.
They're starting to grow on me.
Word?
Yes, word.
Stupid.
It's nice.
Yes.
Maria?
What?
I still think you're beautiful.
What else?
Okay, you're going to make me earn this kiss, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Your smile.
I mean, you don't give it up much, but when I catch one,
I just want to make you happy.
Oh.
Now what?
Now, I want you to look at me
like I'm the only girl in this world.
I've been doing that since the first moment I saw you.
Okay.
Can I kiss you now?
You really need to kiss me now.
MALE RJ:
It's another beautiful day here in New York City.
Let's heat it up just a little more with Reflejo de Luna.
(LATIN MUSIC PLAYING)
(INCREASES MUSIC VOLUME)
Maria!
What are you doing?
The tango!
I know what it's called.
What I want to know is why are you doing it when you're supposed to be working?
Mr. Kapoor, you work too hard.
Do you know what you need?
Yes, an employee who doesn't tango with brooms.
No, you need to dance more.
No, thank you.
I only dance at the funerals of people I hate.
Come on!
Stop being so grumpy all the time.
I'm warning you, Maria.
I have bad knees, arthritis and clogged arteries.
I'll make it easy for you.
Put your hand here.
And keep your shoulders straight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
No, that wasn't good.
That was good!
No, I did shit.
You killed it!
Hey!
What are you doing here?
I wasn't expecting to see you until later.
Well, I thought maybe we can get a bite to eat before rehearsals.
Okay.
And I want to talk to you about something.
Why?
I just found out they moved my finals to the same day as the audition.
You have finals in dance?
No, I'm a double major.
I got dance, and I got business.
These are my business exams.
I'm sorry.
I hate that I have to miss it, Maria.
I'm going to be with you guys every step of the way,
leading up until the audition.
We can do this.
It's fine.
BRANDON:
One, two, three, four, five and six, seven, eight.
And one, two, three, four, five and six and seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Perfect.
Let's do some miming.
Miming.
You all know what a mime is, right?
Are you kidding?
No, I'm serious.
When I was three, I saw one at the circus.
One, two, three and four.
So that's, one, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
That looks good.
(SOFTLY) Ballet.
I can do ballet.
All right.
One and two and three and four.
Yeah, I mean...
When you do it, just loosen up your arms.
Like that.
Relax them.
Who are you shooting?
Relax them.
This is so stupid.
CARLA:
Tina, let's just finish it.
It's not stupid, Tina.
Okay, look, I studied the show.
All the past winners are well-rounded.
This will help us.
Right.
And with this new style, it's like we've been dipped in culture.
That's one thing I know the 718 doesn't have.
Culture.
(SOFTLY) Dipped.
Dipped in culture.
I don't think so.
BRANDON:
Come on, it's a good thing.
This stuff will help us.
Come on.
Fine.
LYRIC:
Quit whining.
TINA:
Stop.
(PEOPLE CHEERING)
Pick me!
MAN:
That's it!
Let's go now!
(CHEERING)
I said, "My brothers"!
Break it down.
ALL:
Uh!
ALL:
A-G-T.
Strike step!
ALL:
Ah!
ALL:
Get down!
ALL:
Get down!
ALL:
Get down!
ALL:
Let's get funky!
ALL:
Let's get funky!
Welcome to the Dance Battle Zone.
(AUDIENCE CHEERS)
Number 542?
That's us, 542.
You're up next.
Come on, guys.
We can do this.
I can't believe they let Luis sit in on auditions.
Just ignore him.
Let's see.
HD Crew, right?
You're out of the Honey Daniels Center.
Is that what the HD stands for?
No.
No, it stands for "High Def."
Like, clear.
In your face.
JONAS:
Well, Honey Daniels is amazing.
Y'all have got some big, big shoes to fill.
I could tell you right now, you're just wasting your time.
JONAS:
What, you know them, Luis?
LUIS:
Just her.
She couldn't quite cut it with our crew, so I cut her loose.
Why you got to lie?
Yo, can we get this audition going, or what?
(LAUGHS) Yes, you can.
I do love the drama, though.
Let's do it!
All right.
Come on, y'all.
I'm going to show you.
(GIRL SINGING)
(HIP HOP BEATS)
(ALL LAUGHING)
Thank you, but it's a "no," kids.
KATRINA:
Sorry.
Maybe next year.
You guys are wack.
(LAUGHING)
I tried to tell you, Maria.
You're just not good enough.
And those two new dancers ain't going to save you either.
Now, beat it.
MAN:
Get out of here.
Get out.
Beat it!
No!
No.
Sweetie, don't make this difficult on yourself.
We're doing it again.
JONAS:
Well, well, well.
Now, this just got more interesting.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(PANTING)
Listen, we've decided that because of your dancing and the obvious tension between you and my boy Luis here, that this should make for great television.
HD, welcome to the Battle Zone.
(ALL SCREAM JOYOUSLY)
Thank you.
Thank you.
We did it.
That was insane.
It was nuts.
Not just the way we made the show, but the way you stood up to those judges.
I mean, you were like, "Hell no!
Y'all are going to check us out!"
Okay, I just wanted our crew to have a fair shot.
I give you mad props for that.
We finally feel like a real crew, you know?
And that wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you.
I respect that.
You're welcome.
You can take that one to them.
I'll get the other one.
Okay.
Make them save me a slice, though.
I will.
I'm in.
So, where's Brandon at?
I texted him.
He must still be taking his finals.
Finals?
He could've skipped those to come celebrate, man.
You don't skip finals, bro.
That's why they call them finals.
The boy is trying to get his edu-macation on.
That don't make him any different than the rest of us.
We all just want to dance for a living.
Yeah, but we don't all have filthy rich parents like he does.
What are you talking about?
His family owns half of Texas.
You didn't know?
His family makes the Hiltons look like the Hammers.
(LAUGHING)
Can't touch this.
Really.
Really?
He's good with kids, too.
He teaches a class with kids?
Yeah.
Once a week.
You didn't know that either?
What do you know?
Let me ask you a serious question.
Do y'all actually ever talk or just bone?
She just be like...
Shake it, baby!
Yo, Carla.
Check it out.
CARLA:
Oh, uh-uh.
She is about to be sleeping with the enemy.
Good stuff today.
Thank you.
Watching you move was amazing.
Stop it.
Hey, I'm serious.
Tina, is he bothering you?
No, he was just telling me how much he liked our audition.
No, I said I like your audition.
You're the one who brings the heat to this group.
Tina, did he tell you that you're too good for us and that you should be dancing with his crew?
Yeah, he did, but...
Tina, he's trying to play you.
Hey, calm down.
I told him I would stay with the HDs.
Well, good.
But you act like I ain't even good enough to dance with them.
I didn't say that.
Sounds like that's what she's saying to me.
MARIA:
You know what?
Stop starting trouble.
Leave our crew alone.
Tina, are you going to let her dis you like that?
I mean, I know if someone in my crew called me out, we'd battle on the spot.
Wow!
I am not calling her out.
And if we're going to battle, we're going to do it as a crew and take your sorry ass out.
And what's stopping you?
What's stopping you?
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)
See that, Tina?
She's scared.
She's scared!
If you were on the 718, baby, you wouldn't run from nothing.
Whatever.
Maria, we got to do this, okay?
We're finally getting some props, and it's time to back it up.
Tina, are you sure?
Yeah, I'm as sure as you were in that audition.
That's pretty sure.
Tina's right.
If we aren't going to knock heads, we got to do something.
Hell, yeah!
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah.
Mmm?
Fine.
Let's battle.
Yes.
Let's go.
LYRIC:
Yeah, they ain't got shit on us.
GIRL:
Yeah, baby!
(WHOOPING AND CLAMORING)
Come on!
Let's go, HD!
Come on!
Let's see what you got.
Yeah!
What do you know about that?
GIRL:
That's right!
That's right!
That's it!
Let's go!
What?
Yeah, you!
What?
You ain't nothing!
You ain't nobody!
And you ain't got no beat!
Yeah, Darnell!
What?
HD!
Come on!
That's the best you got?
No way!
Get out of my face!
LUIS:
Fall back!
It's over.
Back up.
It's over.
HD, you all suck!
That's it!
MAN 1 :
HD, hit the road.
GIRL 1 :
The 718 killed it!
MAN 2:
Yo, HD is wack!
Hit the bricks!
Go home.
Pack it up.
MAN 3:
718 all day.
GIRL 2:
Go home, HD!
You call this a crew?
Are you serious?
And you actually think you're going to take us out on Battle Zone?
(SCOFFS)
Toys.
Tina, when you're ready to grow up, come holler at your boy.
Yo, I was wrong.
We ain't no damn crew.
We're just some posers.
Tina, we tried...
But our try wasn't good enough, ain't never good enough!
We got humiliated!
Nobody is going to respect us after this.
Nobody!
Wait, Tina!
Leave me alone!
Tina!
Tina!
(CROWD JEERING)
You're late.
Do I have to remind you what time your curfew is?
I know what time my curfew is.
You know what?
We made rules in this house, and they are going to have to be followed.
Or what?
You're going to send me back to juvie?
Fine.
What is the matter with you?
I'm just sick of trying.
I try and live by your rules.
I try and stay out of trouble.
I try and join a new crew.
And nothing works.
Well, it doesn't mean you have to give up.
Save it.
I'm going to bed.
Hey.
Where you been?
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't get much sleep last night.
What's going on?
Tina quit.
She said she's not coming back.
What the hell?
Do you know what this does to our choreography?
Of course we do!
But I'm...
But nothing!
This screws everything up!
Don't take it out on Lyric.
I'm not taking it out on Lyric.
I'm pissed!
So, what do we do?
You tell us.
You're the choreographer.
You know what?
I don't need this right now.
I'm out.
Well, that's messed up.
What?
A street battle?
What were you thinking?
Didn't you know losing would ruin their confidence?
I'm sorry, college boy.
I'm not as smart as you.
I didn't know that.
Well, you should have.
And you should have told me you were just some rich kid slumming it down here for grades.
Now, what does my family's money have to do with any of this?
Makes it all just a game for you.
If things fall apart, you can just leave, but the rest of us are stuck here to deal with it.
In case you haven't noticed, I'm still here.
You're the one that walked out.
Because it's over!
I quit!
We can't win without Tina!
Fine.
If that's the way you feel, then you should quit.
I'm going to go up there with my crew, because I believe in us.
Maria.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Why?
Today's your day off.
What can I say?
I'd rather be here than anywhere else.
Oh, Maria.
Let's talk.
Let's talk.
You got to follow your heart, Maria.
Is there a problem at home or with your friends?
Both.
And this is how you deal with it?
Come to work?
Yeah.
Huh.
Good.
Why, because you get free labor?
Of course.
But I was thinking, Maria, instead of getting yourself into trouble, you chose to do something constructive.
I like that.
Well, while I'm being constructive, is there anything else you want me to do?
You go work your register, and I'll take care of this later.
You said no one works the register but you.
What, you expect me to take your word for it that you were going to change?
No.
I had to wait for you to prove it, and you have.
So, now I trust you.
Thanks, Mr. Kapoor.
That means a lot.
BRANDON:
Five, six, seven, eight.
All right.
Try it again.
Five, six, seven, eight.
All right.
So, you're back now?
Why not?
I still got to do my community service here anyway.
Right.
Hey.
Hey, look.
I want to be here, if that's okay with you.
Whatever.
Uh-uh.
Yo, is that Tina?
Okay, I'm just going to go ahead and say it.
Shit!
She joined up with the 718.
That's scandalous, man.
How's she going to play us like that?
Because she only thinks about her damn self, that's how.
BRANDON:
We can't sweat this right now, guys.
MARIA:
He's right.
We need to focus on this crew.
So, let's rock this thing, all right?
Bring it in.
Let's get an HD on three, all right?
One, two, three...
ALL:
HD!
MARIO:
Every season on Battle Zone, we find the hottest, most insane crews on the scene, and last season was no different.
The 718 set this place on fire with their off-the-chain routines, and at the end of this season, you're going to see them perform against the last crew standing.
There's already been some behind-the-scenes madness with one crew jacking another for a dancer, and we haven't even started yet.
So, what's jumping off next?
Stay tuned, because you don't want to miss Battle Zone.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
(LOUD CHEERING)
One of these crews is going home tonight.
Judges, who will it be?
Well, it's obvious that this year's talent is amazing, but, unfortunately, somebody has to go.
And tonight, it's Fanny Pak.
(SCREAMS JOYOUSLY)
Sorry, guys.
ALL: (DRAMATICALLY) Ah!
Ah.
I'm sorry to see those guys go.
They were a hot crew.
Yeah, but they weren't the best.
And you have got to be the best if you're gonna go up against the 718.
MARIO:
Enough said.
We'll see you next week in Battle Zone.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Come on, we just killed it!
Yeah, we're still in.
We need to talk.
No, we don't.
Look, I know you think you know what you're doing, but you don't.
You need to stay away from Luis.
He said you were going to say something like that.
Trying to get me back in the crew?
Look, he's right, we need you.
But more importantly,
I don't want to see you get caught up.
You don't know him like I do.
I know he's my best chance at winning that prize money.
Can you guarantee me that?
Yeah, I didn't think so.
Wait.
For what?
I ain't coming back to your crew.
Then, just be careful.
Can I talk to you for a second?
What do you want?
It'll only take a second.
Come on.
What's up?
Let me take Tina's place.
Right.
I mean it.
I'll come dance with you if you kick Tina off your crew.
What changed your mind all of a sudden?
I know what I'm getting into with you.
Tina doesn't.
And since when did you become a teenage crisis counselor?
You know I'm a better dancer than her, and I can pretty much guarantee you another win.
That's true.
There's just one little problem.
What's that?
Come here.
Come close.
I don't trust you, witch.
Ever since you got out of juvie, you've been full of yourself and treating me like I'm something you scraped off your shoe.
But, you see that little girl over there?
She has stars in her eyes.
And I can make her do anything I want.
You're a jerk.
Do you know that?
You used to like it.
You tried to fix it, didn't you?
You were listening?
I had to make sure you were okay.
Yeah, I'm good.
I just feel bad.
Tina being with them is all my fault.
No.
Tina's stubborn.
That's her fault.
But thanks for trying to protect her.
I just want the crew to go back to the way it was, you know?
I do, too.
Hey, do me a favor.
Don't be mad at me anymore, because I'm too tired to fight.
Me too.
BRANDON:
Yeah, the movie was good, but real talk, could you stop killing us in rehearsals?
No, I have to.
We've got to make it to the finals.
We got to be strong enough to win.
You can hang, can't you, college boy?
Oh, I can hang.
Okay, then.
So, say my name.
College boy?
Okay, say it.
(LAUGHS) Okay, okay!
Brandon!
"Brandon," all right?
Are you happy now?
Very happy.
(GIRL SOBBING)
Do you hear that?
Yeah.
Just wait right here.
Maria, come here.
Tina, are you okay?
MARIA:
Hey, what happened?
Did Luis do this to you?
No, it was his boys.
They beat you up?
No.
Luis told them to walk me home, and then they smashed a store window and told me to grab stuff.
And did you?
I was too scared.
There was glass everywhere.
I got all cut up.
I'll take her to my house.
It's okay there.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
I should've listened to you when you told me to stay away from Luis.
Yeah, well, sometimes you just got to learn the hard way.
Yeah, you're right.
So, what are you going to do now?
I'm not messing with Luis no more.
That's for damn sure.
Word.
Which means I can't dance with his crew either.
Right.
You think I could come back to the HDs?
You know that's not how it works.
Yeah.
Hey!
Ow!
Are you all right?
Yeah.
MARIA:
All right.
You guys already know my vote.
I say we let Tina back in the crew.
That would be my vote, too.
MARIA:
All right.
Ricky?
Well,
Tina's my homegirl, so, yeah.
I want her back.
All right.
Carla?
Girl, I'm easy.
Ha!
We know that.
You don't!
Anyways, my vote is yes.
Not because I think you deserve it, Tina, but because I can't stand Luis and his crew.
All right.
Well, Tina's crazy.
And you know what they say, crazy ass is the best ass.
And the best ass is some crazy ass!
Then that must be my ass.
Hey, guys, not the right time.
Okay.
Yeah.
Lyric,
it's on you.
Carla was right, you don't deserve it.
Every single one of us had your back.
You basically spit in our faces.
That was messed up.
I didn't mean to...
I don't care what you meant.
I only care about what you did.
We were like sisters, Tina.
I would've done anything for you.
Then you leave me, and now you want to come back like we're all cool?
I'm sorry.
I messed up.
You messed up bad.
You're still family, and I'll always love you.
But if you want my trust, you got to earn it.
Just tell me how.
I'll do it.
You can start by getting back in this crew, and help us whoop Luis' ass.
I might need a tissue.
(SOBBING) Damn, I think my allergies kicking in or something.
I thought someone was chopping onions up in here.
(SOBBING)
(HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
Besides 718, who else we got to look out for?
That's hard to say.
I mean, some of the best crews from last year will be back.
It's not for the weak.
(AUDIENCE BOOING)
(LOUD CHEERING)
We're going to need your toughness, Tina.
You mean that?
You think I'd give you a compliment if I didn't mean it?
Aw!
Aw!
All right.
Okay!
Get off me!
That's the business.
You guys, come on.
You got to loosen up.
Those other crews will smell the fear on you, especially the 718.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
MARIO:
Join us next week, because you don't want to miss the semifinals on Dance Battle Zone.
(ALL WHOOPING)
There was this girl when I was in juvie, Julissa, and every time we would battle, she'd always come up with something new.
What was she in for?
She tried to kill her stepdad.
Whoa.
Why?
She didn't say, but we all knew.
Was it scary in there?
Not in a way you could really imagine or I could really describe to you.
It's like feeling alone with hundreds of people around you.
What did they charge you with?
Breaking and entering.
Luis thought he knew his way in and out of a pawn shop.
What he didn't know was sometimes the owner liked to stay late.
Luis heard a noise, ran out and left me to deal with a man with the biggest gun I'd ever seen, pointed right in my face.
How did you get hooked up with that guy in the first place?
He used to come to the center.
He gave me attention.
I didn't really have a lot of that as a foster kid.
What happened to your parents?
They died in a car crash.
I was 10.
Shit.
Can we talk about something else?
No disrespect, but...
All right.
Yeah, let's take a break.
I just need to get outside.
Let's go eat.
You all not coming?
We're going to stay back.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do!
What exactly wouldn't you do?
Him.
You see, that's messed up.
I didn't even say nothing.
Why you got to come at me like that?
You're asking for it all the time!
God!
I asked you to stay so we could talk.
I mean, there's still a lot I don't know about you.
What do you want to know?
Well, for starters, a dance and business major?
What's that about?
My father is the one that's pressing me into finance.
He just doesn't think that there's a future for me in dance.
But the way I look at it is, if we win Battle Zone,
I could go on tour for a year just doing what I love.
And I can go back to school with no regrets.
And it's like I gave it that shot.
You know what I mean?
I know.
I know what it's like to have people not believe in you.
Is that why you want to win so bad?
It's not even about that, really.
I mean, the people that really count,
Mrs. Daniels.
You.
I mean, they've always had my back, even when I didn't see it.
And whether we win or lose, I'm going to keep dancing.
It's how I say the things I want to say.
(SENSUAL MUSIC PLAYING)
One of these crews is going home tonight.
You don't want to miss this.
So, everyone, let's get this party started on Dance Battle Zone.
(CH EERING)

The last crew standing in the semifinals is the HD Crew!
(CHEERING)
Yes!
Yeah!
What?
No, man!
(CHANTING) HD!
HD!
HD!
The Battle Zone finale will consist of the 718
and the HD Crew!
Judges, any predictions?
718, I was a huge fan of yours last season and trust you guys do not disappoint, but the HD Crew rocks it!
(AUDIENCE CHEERS)
I really could not put money on this.
I'm going to go 50-50.
Fair enough.
Katrina?
I love the HD Crew!
It's time a new dance crew wear the dance crown.
And last but not least, Jonas?
JONAS:
Okay, simply put, the 718 Crew is going to murder the HD Crew.
(CHEERING)
Make sure you come back next week to see who wins the Battle Zone dance competition.
Peace.
(CROWD CHANTING) 718!
718!
718!
Hey, Maria, wait up.
I'll catch up with you later.
Here.
I can't take that.
You got to give it back to Mr. Kapoor.
Tell him what you did.
I took it back to the store, and I paid for it.
You did?
Yeah.
Once I got him to put the bats down, he let me make things right between us.
But I want you to have it.
Why?
I'm trying to say thank you, so just take the damn bracelet.
All right.
Thank you.
Going in for a hug.
Let's just get this over with.
(MARIA LAUGHS)
Hey.
Can I come in?
Sure.
What's on your mind?
I wanted to apologize for the way I've been acting.
And I want to give you these.
What are they?
Passes to the show.
Everyone's giving them to their families.
So, I mean, you're my family.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I'm giving you these, and I gave a couple to Mr. Kapoor.
I hope you guys can come.
Oh, I'll be there.
(INHALES SHARPLY)
Yeah.
Thanks.
Thank you.
All right.
Maria,
I'm really proud of you.
You're my family, too.
Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
All right, listen, I want to say something.
No matter what happens out there tonight, we already won, as far as I'm concerned.
Are you just saying that because you are scared we might lose, and you don't want us to feel like crap if it happens?
Yeah.
Girl, God bless you.
Come here.
RICKY:
Hey, if we lose, we lose.
Worst-case scenario, I go back to trying to find a job.
I don't know what me and Lyric are going to do.
I mean, we're the only ones our grandma can really count on.
Look, let's just stop talking negative, all right?
We didn't go there to lose.
We're not gonna lose.
We're just not.
Go!
HD!
Let's get this party started.
Tonight, we crown the winners of the Dance Battle Zone competition.
We had a coin toss backstage to decide who would go first.
So, give it up for the 718.
Let's do it!
(HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
Yo, go hard!
(MUSIC ENDS)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Yes!
Somebody call the cops, because I think those guys just broke a few laws of physics.
Man!
Up next...
Well, you already know.
Give it up!
HD Crew!
Wow!
(HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
Yeah!
(MUSIC ENDS)
(CHEERING LOUDLY)
Yeah!
Yeah!
That is what I'm talking about.
HD Crew!
Go!
Go!
Okay, the studio audience and the judges' votes have been tabulated, and I have the results right here.
This year's winner of the Dance Battle Zone competition is...
It's a tie!
No!
Are you kidding me?
Aw!
Come on!
(ALL PROTESTING)
Okay.
Well, according to the rules, the winner will be decided in a dance-off battle that we like to call "Dance or Die"!
(CHEERING)
So, this is it, y'all.
Pull out your bag of tricks.
Do whatever you got to do.
In "Dance or Die," anything goes.
We are going to be right back after this break while our crews get ready to rock it.
(ALL WHOOPING)
Yo, Maria.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
What is it, Luis?
I underestimated you and your crew.
You all got mad heart.
Why do I feel like there's a "but" coming?
You know me well.
Unfortunately.
Congrats on getting here, but this is as far as it goes.
You know what's funny, is that you actually think that's true.
MAN:
Okay, guys, you're on.
BRANDON:
One, two, three, HD!
Three, two, one, go!

The decision has been made.
In your face!
MARIO:
All right, that is it!
I am calling the fight.
With a first-round knockout, the winner of this year's Dance Battle Zone is
the HD Crew!
(CHEERING)
I am so proud of you!
We did it!
We did it!
Congratulations, guys.
You nailed it.
BRANDON:
Thank you.
Maria, we got to talk, 'cause, you know, part of the prize is that you all get to tour with Alexis Jordan.
I hope you have some serious luggage, because you all are going on a private jet to meet her in person at the end of the month.
Congrats.
(EXCITED CHATTER)
You know, I could have never done any of this without you.
Right?
That's funny.
I was going to say the exact same thing.
We did it!
Guys, we finally did it!
Yeah, we did.
Oh, my...
You know what this means, right?
I'm your girlfriend now, so stop tripping.
Yes, ma'am.
Here we go!
ALL:
One, two, three, HD!
Ladies and gentlemen, just back from a sold-out world tour, please welcome to the stage, Alexis Jordan and the HD Crew!

Uh-huh.
Don't "uh-huh" her.

Mmm-hmm.
Okay, now, Mrs. Daniels, you do understand that as Maria's appointed foster parent, you take full responsibility of this minor?
(CHUCKLES) Do I €V€I'.
Okay.
That's it.

That's it?
Yes, it is.
Just follow the yellow line down to the exit.

Going to come out here, and we are going to put you to work.
Great.
Okay.
Let'S start with these.
An right.
And let's set a couple of rules.
Like what?
Like curfew at 9:00, and you're not allowed to hang out with your old crew.
You ain't got to worry about that.
They ditched me a while back.
Any more rules?
Well, not a rule, but I would like you to start thinking about your future,
Like, what do you wanna do with your life?
If it was up to me...
VVl'\3ll€V€I".
It doeSr'l"[ matter.
What about your dancing?
You used to love that.
Look, I got to get a real job.
It's not like I can make any money dancing,
Excuse me?
Honey built this studio with her dance career.
We all can't be like your daughter, Mrs, Daniels.
Well, if anybody could be, it'd be you.
What have you...
Give me that!
This ain't no mirror cleaning.
Now, see, your problem is, you are not motivated,
Now, look at that.
That is what a mirror's supposed to look like.
MR. KAPOOR:
No, come on.
Please, Maria.
MARIA:
Oh, come on.
Maria, please.
Please.
What?
I don't think you working here is a good idea.
Why?
You want to heal' me num?
I don't trust you anymore.
Okay?
Mr. Kapoor, you know me.
I messed up one time.
One time!
You know what they say.
Once you go bad, you never go back.
Wait, no.
It's... it's once you go "black," you never go back.
But that makes no sense.
How can you go...
Is that what they really say?
Hmm.
I'll try 10 I'€mEfT'lb€I' that.
Besides, Maria, I'm running a business here, not a charity, okay?
I'd really like to help you, but I just can't.
All right, maybe not.
But I can help you out.
Right?
And hows mar?
Hey!

(EXHALES)
Big Lester, did you see him?
It was just her.
Oh, God.

I caught her shoplifting.
You did that, Tina?

Me or this janitor?
I'm sure the janitor has a name.
Who are you?
Don't worry about who I am.
Just keep your little hoodrat on a leash.

Damn, boo, you are the truth!

Girls can say that to each other, all right?
Lt'S like when black folks call each other "my..."
Quit it while you're behind.
Baby, stop.
Lail"I'll ever seen 8 New York Clal'1CeF that Could turf like that.
Did you live in Cali or something?
No.
I learned it from this girl I used to know.
You think you can teach us how to do it?
Really?
What happened to, "I'm going to break your ass in halt"'?
Yeah, that was before I saw you dance, though.
Whatever, Lyric.
We don't need her.
I think we do, Tina, because I've never seen you get down like that.
So, you interested?
No, thanks.
Why not?
YOU'l'€ here an me time.
What you got to lose?
Is cleaning toilets keeping you busy?
I bet she's going Crawling back to the 718.
Girl, if I wasn't on probation..
Ooh!
What would you do?
You know what?
I'm just not interested.
Hey, what's going on?
It's the 718.
They're buying everybody slices.
When why?
They always do stuff like that,
Last time, they handed out school supplies.
My moms really loved that, but I'd rather have the pizza.
YOU'l'€jUSI in time.
For whai?
What is all Of this?
What does it look like?
We take care of our own, Ma.
I mean, if not US, who will?
So, this is what you meant when you said you changed?
Yeah, part of it.

Okay.
But I'm not staying long.
MARIA: (LAUGHS) Do you remember your cousin's wedding?
Yo, you got so lit.
I wasn'l too buzzed to catch the bouquet, though.
Right.
After you knocked over the old lady and the flower girl.
Oh, my gosh, it was an accident!
Nobody got hurt.
The flower girl lost a tooth, Maria.
It was already loose.
And I gave her the bouquet to make up for it!
True.
True.
Okay, then.
Oh, man.
You know, after a while, the DJ wasn't that bad.
We danced for a while after everybody left.
It was nice, though.
I thought about that night a lot when I was gone.
Have you thought about coming back to the crew?
I'm so tempted.
You know how much dancing means to me.
Come dance with us tomorrow.
I know once we get back at it, it'll be just like Old times.
That's what I'm afraid Of.
Hey, you know I got you.

It just seems right.
You feel me?
Yeah.
It made me realize how much I miss being with our crew,
Is that all you missed?
You know, we could have it all now.
I just wish you would've listened to me back in the day,
Are you blaming me for what happened?
Don't sweat it.
We can start all over.
(POLICE SIREN WAILS)
Yo, we got company.
Let's go!
Let's go!
What are you doing?
Hold this.
What are you doing?
Relax.
What up, Luis?
What's u p, homes?
What you got for us tonight?
Same thing I got for you every night.
Nothing.
(LAUGHS)
We can play ii that way, too.
I know you got something.
Nope.
He's clean.
We'll get him next time.
The fool is bound to slip up.
You must have a thing for losers, huh, baby?
You two have a good night.
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
Are you okay?
BESKHFU!
You lied to me!
Listen, you don't understand.
Ii'S just a Side hustle!
Li's how I'm able to do the good shit
I do around here and give back!
Don't you see that?
They don't care about us.
We got to do for ourselves.
Me and you.
No!
Not me.
Not anymore.
I don'\ want ii.
(Klcls CANS)
Hey,
Hey,
I'll dance with your crew on one condition.
Yeah, what's that?
We get on Battle Zane and we beat the 718.
Wait, hold up.
You're trying to use us to get revenge?
That, and part of the grand prize is that your choreographer gets an internship.
That'S the kind of break I need.
Who said you were going to take over our choreography?
BRANDON:
I mean, we could use the help.
Rigm now, we're just winging it.
Her Stuff could push us over the top.
Au right, so can we get started?
No, see, you're tripping.
AUdmOl'1S BTS if the end of the month.
Let's do this.
BRANDON;
Tina, Lyric.
Part of the grand prize is $100,000.
I know we could all use that money, but with your grandma's medical expenses, I thoug ht.,.
Why you got to put us on blast?
No, I'm not.
Look, you know I got your back, always.
And if you really don't want her in, just say the word and I'm down.
But I think we should do it for Grandma.
I do.
And if I say no, I'm the bad guy, right?
Pretty much.
All right, Fine, she's in.
CARLA:
Yeah!
But if she gets in my face again, I'm going to cut her.
With what?
Your razor sharp wit?
My what?
I just said yes to you to get in my crew.
dof't'1i'lalk to ITIS like that.
All right.
Five, six, seven, eight.
It's one, two, three, four, five, six and seven, eight.
One, two, three...
One, two, yep, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
You guys got to trust that the guys have your back.
And you guys need to turn, and you guys need to know that they're coming.
Three and four, five and six, and seven, eight.
One, two, four, six, eight,
Are you serious?
Get up!
Ge!
up!
Carla, pay attention!
Whoa!
Oh, my God!
TINA:
This is So Stupid.
I'm not into it, right?
Yo, can we just stop arguing for two seconds and focus?
How are we supposed to know what we're doing if we can't even see?
That's the whole point.
You guys are using your eyes and those mirrors as crutches.
You need to learn how to trust your instincts.
Trust each other.
Think you can do il?
Just turn the damn music on already.
Shit.
LYRIC:
Watch ii!
Whoa!
(FAST-PACED MUSIC)
(ALL CHEERING)
That was dope.
That was amazing, yo!
MARIA:
All right, y'all ready to go full out?
BRANDON:
I_6ll'S do if..
Whoo!
All right, HD!
(ALL WHOOPING)
That was dope.
I got to hand it to you, girl.
You're really getting us there.
I feel like we might even have a shot to win this thing.
We'll See!
We're going to need to come a lot stronger than this,
I know that much.
Wow!
What is your problem?
I guess I can't help telling the truth.
My bad.
Hey, I like what you're doing.
Keep it up, and all the haters are going to have left is hate.
I appreciate that.
Later, y'all.
PSHCG.
Same time tomorrow, B?
Yep.
Fife me.
Later, D. You got it, bro.
Bye,
(LAUGHS)
Don't listen to Tina.
She talks a lot of smack, but she's a good girl.
Yeah, it's not her smack talk that pisses me off.
I think she might be right.
Was Tina right when she said that you're trying to win this thing to get back at Luis?
Notjust Luis.
It's like, most of my life, people told me I'd never be anything.
So, what is it you wanted to be?
Honestly?
I want to be a dancer.
And I always have.
I think we should go somewhere.
Okay.
Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?
You'll see.
We're going to get cleaned up.
(MARIA GRUNTS) Yeah.
Yeah, watch, watch.
Whoo!
How did you know about all those places?
I'm a dance major at NYU.
And part of our curriculum is to experience the arts.
My head is just busting with ideas right now.
All the stuff we could do, like mixing the stuff we saw.
You know what I mean?
Like, if we go...
Barn!
Bam!
Bam!
Bam!
You know?
(CAR HONKING)
Thank you!
Do you even realize what you do with your choreography?
It's like you're telling this beautiful story.
What?
"Beautiful"?
Yeah, I said it.
Beautiful.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing.
Just, if that's the way you step to girls, your game is pretty weak.
You might want to take some lessons from Darnell.
What?
Are you serious?
Yeah!
Darnell?
Okay, I would never do that, first of all.
Second, I bet I do know what impresses you.
What?
What?
What are you doing?
Yo, yo, what up, Ma?
You dig my swagger now?
Or you still fronting like you stunting?
I'm just saying, shawty.
What's a brotha got to do to get with you?
You need to quit.
Quit what?
Quit this?
Oh, ay!
Ay!
Uh, uh!
Ooh!
Pow!
How you like me now?
No, I liked you beflel' bEfo\'E,

They're starting to grow on me.

Stupid.
Ll'S I'liC€.
YGS,

What?
I still think you're beautiful.
Whal else?
Okay, you're going to make me earn this kiss, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Your smile.
I mean, you don't give it up much, but when I catch one,
I just want to make you happy.
Oh,
Now what?
Now, I want you to look at me like I'm the only girl in this world.
I've been doing that since the first moment I saw you.
Okay.
Can I kiss you now?
You really need to kiss me now.

(INCREASES MUSIC VOLUME)
Maria!
What are you doing?
The tango!
I know what ii'S called.
What I want to know is why are you doing it when you're supposed to be working?
Mr. Kapoor, you work too hard.
Do you know what you need?
Yes, an employee who doesn't tango with brooms.
No, you need to dance more.
No, thank you.
I only dance at the funerals of people I hate.
Come on!
Stop being so grumpy all the time.
I'm warning you, Maria.
I have bad knees, arthritis and clogged arteries,
I'll make ii easy for you.
Put your hand here.
And keep your shoulders straight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
NO, that wasn't good.
That was good!
No, I did Shit.
You killed it!
Hey!
What are you doing here?
I wasn't expecting to see you until later.
Wen, I thought maybe we can get a bite to eat before rehearsals.
Okay.
And I wan!
to talk to you about something.
Why?
I just found out they moved my finals to the same day as the audition.
YOU have fin8lS in GBHCG?
No, I'm a double major.
I got dance, and I got business,
These are my business exams.
I'm sorry.
I hate that I have to miss it, Maria.
Rm going to be with you guys every step of the way, leading up until the audition.

Relax them.
Who are you shooting?
Relax them.
This is So stupid.
CARLA:
Tina, lei's just finish it.
It's not stupid, Tina.
Okay, look, I studied the show.
All the past winners are well-rounded.
This will help us.
Right.
And with this new style, it's like we've been dipped in culture.
That's one thing I know the 71 8 doesn't have.
Culture.
(SOFTLY) Dipped.
Dipped in culture.
I don't think so.
BRANDON:
Come on, it's a good thing.
This stuff will help us.
Come on.
Fine.
LYRIC:
Quit whining.
TINA:

In your face.
JONAS:
Well, Honey Daniels is amazing.
Y'all have got some big, big shoes to fill.
I could tell you righi now, you're just wasting your time.
JONAS;

LUIS:

She couldn't quite cut it with our crew,
SO I cut her IOOS€.
Why you got to lie?
Yo, can we get this audition going, or what?

(MUSIC PLAYING)
(PANNNG)
Listen, we've decided that because of your dancing and the obvious tension between you and my boy Luis here, that this Should make for great television.
HD, welcome to the Battle Zone.
(ALL SCREAM JOYOUSLY)
Thank you.
Thank you.
We did it.
That was insane.
It was nuts.
Not just the way we made the show, but the way you stood up to those judges.
I mean, you were like, "Hell no!
Y'all are going to check us out!"
Okay, I just wanted our crew to have a fair shot.
I give you mad props for that.
We finally feel like a real crew, you know?
And that wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you.
I respect that.
You're welcome.
You can take that one to them.
I'll get the other one.
Okay.
Make them save me a slice, though,
I will.
I'm in.
So, where's Brandon at?
I texted him.
He must still be taking his finals.
Finals?
He could've skipped those to come celebrate, man.
You don't skip finals, bro.
That's why they call them finals,
The boy is trying to get his edu-macation on.
That don't make him any different than the rest of us.
We all just want to dance for a living.
Yeah, but we don't all have filthy rich parents like he does.
What are you talking about?
His family owns half Of Texas.
You didn't know?
His family makes the Hiltons look like the Hammers.
(LAUGHING)
Can't touch this.
Really_ Really?
He's good with kids, too.
He te8Cl'1€S 3 class with kids?
Yeah.
Once a week.
You didn't know that either?
What do you know?
Let me ask you a serious question.
Do y'all actually ever talk or just bone?
She just be like...
Shake it, baby!
Yo, Carla.
Check it out.
CARLAI Oh, uh-uh.
She is about to be sleeping with the enemy.
Good stuff today.
Thank you.
Watching you move was amazing.
Stop it.
Hey, I'm serious.
Tina, is he bothering you?
No, he was just telling me how much he liked our audition.
No, I said I like your audition.
You're the one who brings the heat to this group.
Tina, did he tell you that you're too good for us and that you should be dancing with his crew?
Yeah, he did, but...
Tina, he's trying to play you.
Hey, calm down.
I told him I would stay with the HDS.
Wen, good.
But you act like I ain't even good enough to dance with them.
I diunw say mar.
Sounds like that's what she's saying to me.
MARIA:
You know what?
Stop starting trouble.
Leave our crew alone.
Tina, are you going to let her dis you like that?
I mean, I know if someone in my crew called me out, we'd battle on the spot.
Wow!
I am not calling her out.
And if we're going to battle, we're going to do it as a crew and take your sorry ass out.
And what's stopping you?
What's stopping you?
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)
See that, Tina?
She's scared.
She's scared!
If you were on the 718, baby, you wouldn't run from nothing.
Whatever.
Maria, we got to do this, okay?
We're finally getting some props, and it's time to back it up.
Tina, are YOU sure?
Yeah, I'm as sure as you were in that audition.
That's pretty sure.
Tina's right.
If we aren't going to knock heads, we got to do something.
Hen, yeah!
That's what I'm saying.

(scoFFs)
Toys.
Tina, when you're ready to grow up, come holler at your boy.
Yo, I was wrong.
We ain't no damn crew.
We're just some posers.
Tina, we tried...
But our try wasn't good enough, ain't never good enough!
We got humiliated!
Nobody is going to respect us after this.
Nobody!
Wait, Tina!
Leave me alone!
Tina!
Tina!
(CROWD JEERING)
YOU'l'S IE\€.
Do I have to remind you what time your curfew is?
I know what time my curfew is,
You know what?
We made rules in this house, and they are going to have to be followed.
Or what?
You're going to send me back to juvie?
Fine.
What is the matter with you?
I'm just sick of trying.
I try and live by your rules.
I try and stay out of trouble.
I try and join a new crew.
And nothing works.
Well, it doesn't mean you have to give up.
Save it.
I'm going to bed.
Hey,
Where you been?
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't get much sleep last night.
What's going on?
Tina quit.
She said she's not coming back.
What the hell?
Do you know what this does to our choreography?
Of course we do!
But I'm...
Bun nothing!
This screws everything up!
Don't take it out on Lyric.
I'm not taking it out on Lyric.
I'm pissed!
So, what do we do?
You tell us.
You're the choreographer.
You know what?
I don't need this right now.
I'm out.
Weil, that's messed up.
What?
A Sf feel bafue?
What were you thinking?
Didn't you know losing would ruin their confidence?
I'm sorry, college boy, I'm not as smart as you.
I didn'1 know that
Well, you should have.
And you should have told me you were just some rich kid slumming it down here for grades.
Now, what does my family's money have to do with any of this?
Makes ii all just a game for you.
If things fall apart, you can just leave, buf the FSSI Of US SFS stuck h€I'S to deal with ii.
In case you haven't noticed, I'm Still here.
You're the one that walked out.
Because i'l['S over!
I quit!
We can't win without Tina!
Fine, If that's the way you feel, then you should quit.
I'm going to go up there with my crew, because I believe in us.
Mafia.
Are you okay?
Yeah. why?
Today's your day off.
What can I say?
I'd rather be here than anywhere else.
Oh, Maria.
Let'S talk.
Let's talk.
You got to follow your heart, Maria.
Is there a problem at home or with your friends?
Both.
And this is how you deal with it?
Come to work?
Yeah.
Huh.
Good.
Why, because you get free labor?
Of course.
But I was thinking, Maria, instead of getting yourself into trouble, you chose to do something constructive.
I like that.
Well, while I'r'r'l being constructive, is there anything else you want me to do?
You go work your register, and I'll take care of this later,
You said no one works the register but you,
What, you expect me to take your word for it that you were going to change?
NO,
I had to wait for you to prove it, and you have.
So, now I trust you.
Thanks, Mr. Kapoor.
That means a lot.
BRANDON:
Five, six, seven, eight.
An right.
Try it again.
Five, six, seven, eight.
An right.
So, you're back now?
Why new
I still got to do my community service here anyway.
Right.
Hey,
Hey, nook.
I want to be here, if that's okay with you.
Whatever.
Uh-uh.
Yo, is that Tina?
Okay, I'm just going to go ahead and say it,
Shit!
She joined up with the 718.
That's scandalous, man.
How's she going to play us like that?
Because she only thinks about her damn self, that's how.
BRANDON:
We can't sweat this right now, guys,
MARIA:
He's right.
We need to focus 0l'1 \l'1iS CFGW.
So, let's rock this thing, all right?
Bring it in.
Let's get an HD on three, an right?
One, two, three...
ALL:
HD!
MARIO!
Every S€3S0f1 OD BB"/G ZOITS, we find Ihe hottest, IT'loS\ il'lS3I'l€ CTGWS OH the SCSIIG, and last season was no different.
The 718 set this place on fire with their off-the-chain routines, and at the end of this season, you're going to see them perform against the last crew standing.
There's already been some behind-the-scenes madness with one crew jacking another for a dancer, and we haven't even started yet.
So, what's jumping off next?
Stay tuned, because you don't want to miss Battle Zone.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
(LOUD CHEERING)
One of these crews is going home tonight.
Judges, who will it be?
Well, it's obvious that this year's talent is amazing, but, unfortunately, somebody has to go.
And rumgnr, it's Fanny Pak.
(SCREAMS JOYOUSLY)
Sorry, guys.
ALL; (DRAMATICALLY) Ah!
Ah,
I'm sorry to see those guys go.
They were a hot crew.
Yeah, but they weren't the best.
And you have got to be the best if you're gonna go up against the 71 8.
MARIO:
Enough said.
We'll see you next week in Battle Zone.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Come on, we just killed it!
Yeah, we're still in.
WE I'1S€d\0 Ialk.
No, we don't.
Look, I know you think you know what you're doing, but you don't.
You need to stay away from Luis.
He said you were going to say something like that.
Trying to get me back in the crew?
Look, he's right, we need you.
But more importantly,
I don't want to see you get caught up.
You don't know him like I do.
I know he's my best chance at winning that prize money.
Can you guarantee me that?
Yeah, I didn't think 50,
Wait.
For what?
I ain't coming back to your crew.
Then, just be careful.
Can I talk to you for a second?
What do you want?
Lrll only rake E SECOHU.
Come on.
Whats up?
Let me take Tina's place.
Right.
I mean it.
I'll come dance with you if you kick Tina off your crew.
What changed your mind all Of a Sudden?
I know what I'm getting into with you.
Tina doesn't.
And since when did you become a teenage crisis counselor?
You know I'm a better dancer than her, and I can pretty much guarantee you another win.
That's true.
There's just one little problem.
hat'S that?
Come here.
Come close.
I don't trust you, witch.
Ever since you got out ofjuvie, you've been full of yourself and treating me like I'm something you scraped off your shoe.
But, you see that little girl over there?
She has stars in her eyes.
And I can make her do anything I want.
You're a jerk.
Do you know that?
You used to like it.
You tried to fix it, didn't you?
You were listening?
I had to make sure you were okay.
Yeah, I'm good.
Ijusi feel bad.
Tina being with them is all my fault.
NO,
Til'1a'S SIUbbol'fl.
That's her fauli.
But thanks for trying to protect her.
I just want the crew to go back to the way it was, you know?
I do, too.
Hey, do me a favor.
Don't be mad at me anymore, because I'm too tired to fight.
N19 too.
BRANDON:
Yeah, the movie was good, but real talk, could you stop killing us in rehearsals?
No, I have to.
We've got to make it to the finals.
We got to be strong enough to win.
You can hang, can't you, college boy?
Oh, I can hang.
Okay, then.
So, say my name.
College boy?
Okay, say it.
(LAUGHS) Okay, okay!
Brandon!
"Brandon," all right?
Are you happy now?
Very h3PPY-
(GIRL SOBBING)
Do you hear that?
Yeah.
Just wait rig hi here.
Maria, come here.
Tina, are you okay?
MARIA;
Hey, what happened?
Did Luis do this to you?
No, it was his boys.
They beat you up?
No.
Luis told them to walk me home, and then they smashed a store window and told me to grab stuff.
And did you?
I WGS 100 SC3l'€d.
There was glass everywhere.
I got all cut up.
I'll take her to my house.
It's okay there.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
I should've listened to you when you told me to stay away from Luis.
Yeah, well, sometimes you just got to learn the hard way.
Yeah, you're right.
So, what are you going to do now?
I'm not messing with Luis no more.
That's for damn sure.
Word.
VVl"liCl"l ITTSSFIS I C3l"I'll dal'1C€ with his Crew either.
Right.
You 'think I could COITIG back to the HDS?
You know that's not how it works.
Yeah.
Hey!
Owl
Are you an right?
Yeah.
MARIA:
All right.
You guys already know my vote.
I say we let Tina back in the crew.
That would be my vote, too,
MARIA:
All right.
Ricky?
Well,
Tina's my homegirl, so, yeah.
I want her back.
All right.
Carla?
Girl, I'm easy.
Ha!
We know that.
You don'\!
Anyways, my vote is yes.
Not because I think you deserve it, Tina, but because I CENT Sfind l.UiS and his CFSW.
An right.
Well, Tina's crazy.
And you know what they say, crazy ass is the best ass.
And the best ass is some crazy ass!
Then that must be my ass.
HEY, QUYS, not the rig ht time.
Okay.
Yeah.
Lyric,
it's on you.
Carla was right, you don't deserve it.
Every single one of us had your back.
You basically spit in our faces.
That was messed up.
Ldidl'1'\ ITISEH ION.
I don't care what you meant.
I only care about what you did.
We were like sisters, Tina.
I would've done anything for you.
Then you leave me, and now you want to come back like we're all cool?
I'm sorry.
I messed up.
YOU messed Up bad.
You're still family, and I'll always love you.
But if you want my trust, you got to earn it,
Just tell me how.
I'll do it.
You can start by getting back in this crew, and help us whoop Luis' ass.
I might need a tissue.
(SOBBING) Damn, I think my allergies kicking in or something.
I thought someone was chopping onions up in here,
(SOBBING)
(HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
Besides 718, who else we got to look out for?
That's hard to say.
I mean, some of the best crews from last year will be back.
If.'$ I'1Oll fol' the Weak.
(AUDIENCE BOOING)

Th3i'S the bUSif\€SS.

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
MARIO!
Join US fl6Xf week, because you don?
want to miss the semifinals on Dance Battle Zone.
(ALL WHOOPING)
There was this girl when I was in juvie, Julissa, and every time we would battle, she'd always come up with something new,
What was she in for?
She tried to kill her stepdad.
Whoa. why?
She didn't say, but we all knew.
Was it scary in there?
Not in a way you could really imagine or I could really describe to you.
It's like feeling alone with hundreds of people around you.
What did they charge you with?
Breaking and entering.
Luis thought he knew his way in and out of a pawn shop.
What he didn't know was sometimes the owner liked to stay late.
Luis heard 3 noise, Fan OUT and left me to deal with a man with the biggest gun I'd ever seen, pointed right in my face.
How did you get hooked up with that guy in the first place?
He used to COFTIG to the C€I'Tll€F.
He gave me attention.
Ldidrl"t really have 8 lot of that SS 3 foster Kid.
What happened to your parents?
They died in 3 Cal' crash.
I was 10.
Shit-
Can we talk about something else?
No disrespect, but,..
An right.
Yeah, lerslake 3 break.
I just need 10 get outside.
Let's go eat.
You all not coming?
We're going to stay back.
Don't do anything I wouldn'\ do!
What exactly wouldn't you do?
Him.
You see, that's messed up.
I didn't even say nothing,
Why you got to come at me like that?
You're asking for it all the time!
God!
I asked you to stay so we could talk.
I mean, there's still a lot I don't know about you.
What do you want to know?
Well, for St3l'l6fS, a dance and business major?
Whal'S ihal about?
My father is the one that's pressing me into finance.
He just doesn't think that there's a future for me in dance.
But the way I look at it is, if we win Battle Zone,
I could go on tour for a year just doing what I love.
And I can go back to school with no regrets.
And it'S like I gave it that shot.
You know what I mean?
I know.
I know what it's like to have people not believe in you,
Is that why you want to win so bad?
It's not even about that, really.
I mean, the people that really count,
Mrs. Daniels.
You.
I mean, they've always had my back, even when I didn't see it.
And whether we win or lose, I'm going to keep dancing.
It's how I say the things I want to say.

Congrats.

Hang on, Hürrem!
Not long now!
Enough!
Bring a clean cloth!
Hurry!
Süleyman!
Süleyman!
I need to see Concierge İbrahim.
Open the door.
I cannot, my Agha.
They are resting.
If I don't tell them the news I'll lose my head!
Knock!
Stop yelling, Sümbül Agha.
His Majesty will hear.
Hürrem Hatun is in labour, Effendi!
Isn't the birth early, Daye?
What if my grandchild is not healthy?
Allah forbid, my sultan.
The birth is going well.
Don't worry.
Not much left!
Push it out!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Push!
Push!
Oh, no.
His naval cord is entangled.
Is it a boy?
Is it a boy?
Tell me!
Is it a boy?
Tell me!
Gülnihal Hatun.
Go on, Hürrem Hatun is in labour.
-May I enter, Your Majesty?
-Come in, Pargalı.
The birth has begun.
Hürrem Hatun is in labour.
Good.
I will get dressed and come.
Why are you not giving it to me?
Is it a boy?
Is my boy dead?
Give me my child!
Don't touch him!
Thank Allah, the prince is a lovely child!
A prince?
A son?
Is it a boy?
Great news, my sultan!
We have a beautiful baby prince!
-How about his health?
-Hürrem Hatun is well, just a bit tired.
I wasn't asking about Hürrem, tell me how the prince is.
It was a difficult birth, my sultan.
His naval cord was entangled, I barely saved the prince.
Where is my son the prince?
Give him to me.
Not now.
Go and prepare my prince, and bring him straight back.
My sultan.
Tell me, has the Russian slave given birth?
Yes, she has given birth to a son.
-The prince--
-All right, you may retire.
Go away and leave me alone!
Mother, where are you?
I am here, Mustafa.
I am here, my darling boy.
Don't be afraid, I am with you.
You are my prince.
You are the real prince.
One day you will rule the realm.
Mother, I am thirsty.
Mother.
My lion has had a lion cub.
Congratulations!
How is he?
It was a difficult birth, but the prince is healthy.
Süleyman.
Where were you?
I called out to you.
I begged.
You didn't hear me.
I was left alone.
I am here now.
My son isn't here.
They didn't give me my son.
Have they hidden him?
My mother said he was healthy.
The Valide took my son from me.
I couldn't even smell him.
Mother, did you hear that?
Have them bring the child if he is ready.
Sultan Mahidevran.
The royal family is in Hürrem Hatun's chamber.
The Valide is expecting you too.
-For the celebration--
-What am I to celebrate, Daye Hatun?
Am I to celebrate with the Russian slave while I am grieving with my son?
As you wish, my sultan.
I am just the messenger.
Don't shoot the messenger.
Your name is Mehmet.
Your name is Mehmet.
Your name is Mehmet.
Here you go, Hürrem Hatun.
Is Mahidevran not coming?
She refused to come, my sultan.
May Allah make him righteous.
-Amen.
-Amen.
-May Allah make him happy.
-Amen.
-Amen.
-May Allah bless the Empire with his rule.
Amen.
Mehmet is a beautiful little boy.
May Allah bless him with long life.
Gülfem, did you see that?
I did.
Mashallah .
Have lohusa sharbat prepared.
Have gold and lokma distributed in the name of Prince Mehmet.
Everything must be perfect, Daye.
Spare no expense.
As you command, my sultan.
Thank you for not refusing me and coming, Mahidevran.
It befits your status as the Haseki sultan.
You have given me a son and made me very happy.
I will give you more sons, Your Majesty.
Whatever you wish.
Love me, don't leave me.
She was complaining to my lion saying she gave birth alone and nobody was there.
Hürrem's childish whims will never end.
Is she telling the truth?
Was nobody with her?
Nigar Kalfa helped her.
She found her in the corridor.
Didn't you send for her best friend?
What was her name?
The one from Crimea?
Gülnihal, my sultan.
She was with her until the last moment.
But last night....
Where have you been?
You were not supposed to leave Hürrem Hatun.
She was left all alone.
Where the hell were you?
Valide Sultan, she is not at fault.
His Majesty summoned her to the private chamber.
-Does Hürrem know?
-She doesn't know.
If she did, she would kill her.
Pargalı commanded Sümbül Agha.
İbrahim.
Concierge İbrahim.
You crafty man.
It seems he hates Hürrem too.
Speak to no one.
Keep your mouth shut.
Especially to Hürrem Hatun.
Seal your lips.
Do you understand?
Not a word.
Has Hürrem Hatun given birth?
Is it a boy or a girl, Sümbül Agha?
What's it to you?
Go and clean your rooms.
What are you doing here at this time of night?
Gülnihal, you tell me, is it a boy or a girl?
Hürrem Hatun was screaming for you.
You are still speaking.
What did I just say?
Go on!
Mind your own business!
Where did Gülnihal come from so early?
What was she doing with Sümbül?
She must have had a reason.
She is Sümbül's new favourite.
Don't go.
Don't leave us.
Stay a while with my son.
It's morning.
Sleep and rest.
I have matters to attend to, but I'll come in the evening.
Gülnihal.
Are you finally here?
I looked for you all night.
What would you have done if I was dying?
You are nowhere to be seen.
Look at my son.
Prince Mehmet.
Come and look.
Hürrem Hatun.
Congratulations.
May Allah bless Prince Mehmet with long life.
Gülnihal, now that you have come I entrust the prince to you.
Now I can sleep.
It was a hard birth.
I am so sleepy.
I named him Mehmet.
Now it's your turn, Pargalı.
I hope Allah blesses you with a son.
Inshallah , Your Majesty, inshallah .
What's that?
I see that you are very enthusiastic, Pargalı.
So we need to get you married at once.
Let's pick a beautiful concubine from the harem for you.
You are embarrassing me, Your Majesty.
When can I see my prince?
You will see him soon, Pargalı.
I hope Mehmet is a conqueror like his grandfather and he expands our borders.
I hope that he is remembered as a great Padişa.
I'm sure that Mustafa will also be a great Padişa, Your Majesty.
If I had 10 other princes I know that you would still favour Mustafa.
Let's wait and see.
We cannot know who Allah will bless with longevity.
Of course.
We must not forget that you decide how long they live.
Mehmet, my son!
Hürrem?
-Hürrem, what is it?
-My son is missing!
She killed my son!
That woman killed him!
The midwife took Mehmet!
Calm down, Mehmet is all right.
How could you let her take him?
I gave him to you!
Now he is gone!
Murderers!
Hürrem!
Hürrem!
My son!
My son!
My son is missing!
-My son is missing!
-Hürrem!
Prince Mehmet!
Where are you?
Return to your room, Hürrem Hatun!
You are disgracing us!
You are the disgrace.
You stole my son!
Go.
Hürrem, I said go!
Don't you dare give me orders!
Who do you think you are?
You can't give me orders.
I am the mother of a prince!
I am Sultan Hürrem!
Take me to my son!
My sultan, has something happened?
What more could happen, İbrahim?
That snake woman gave birth.
And it was a boy who will be Mustafa's rival.
Nothing will take her down now.
My sultan, has Hürrem been disrespectful?
I know that she will do so.
Help us, İbrahim.
You promised me.
You need to stop her.
I saw her eyes this morning.
Her grudge burned like flames behind her eyes.
-She will burn us with those flames.
-My sultan, calm down.
Calm down.
I will keep my promise.
Soon she will bow before you and pay homage.
Come on now, go.
Stay positive.
His Majesty awaits me.
I'm going.
What were you doing outside my door, İbrahim?
There is news from the harem, Your Majesty.
The prince is well.
Good.
Come.
Look at Piri Reis' map of Rhodes.
This will be our guide.
We have nothing else we can use.
But I want to know this island like the palm of my hand.
I want to know its castle, its tunnels its bazaar and its church.
I want to know everything, Pargalı.
Do you understand?
We could send someone to Rhodes who will paint it as if it were our home.
We will send him among the people.
I know who the best man to send is, Your Majesty.
-Matrakçi can do it.
-Yes.
I like how you think, Pargalı.
Don't forget, you use that mind only for me.
Is my grandson healthy, midwife?
-He is as healthy as a little lion cub.
- Mashallah .
Daye Hatun, have you prepared what I told you to prepare?
We have, my sultan.
We'll distribute them this afternoon.
Where is my son?
You stole him from me!
Come to your senses, Hürrem.
How dare you?
Who do you think you are shouting at?
My son, my prince.
Your mother is here.
No one can steal you now.
Nigar, take my grandson from the hands of this fool.
My Valide.
Please, don't take my son from me.
I was confused when I couldn't see him.
Forgive me.
Mehmet is not only your son.
He is a representative of the Ottoman bloodline.
He is a part of the dynasty.
He is too precious to be left in the hands of a concubine.
This child will be cared for and brought up in the best possible way.
Don't cry like a little village girl.
Take her away.
Leave Mehmet here.
She is not intelligent enough to entrust with a child.
For a thousand years, in the Greek palace when a new child was born to the dynasty just like our new prince....
-Yes?
-When such a child was born they'd make sharbat in cauldrons outside the palace and give it to the people.
The bells of Hagia Sophia would ring nonstop.
So, what do you think the Romans called this sharbat ?
What did they call it Matrakçi Effendi?
Lohusa .
They called it lohusa .
That's what we call it!
Lohusa .
Why are you surprised, Seker Agha?
You mean that we are continuing an infidel tradition?
-It's a sin.
Truly it is a sin.
-There is no sin, Seker Agha.
One who drinks it will pray for the prince and it's these prayers that protect children.
For Allah's sake....
You have become an ulema since we last met, Matrakçi.
Welcome, my friend.
Tell me the latest news from the palace.
I asked Seker Agha, but he is beating about the bush.
It is not my place to speak of the harem, Effendi.
I am just a lowly cook.
I came out for shopping and am returning now.
Load the sacks on the cart quickly!
We are late.
The palace awaits the lohusa sharbat .
Let's go for a walk, Matrakçi.
I have things to tell you.
As you command, concierge.
But please, let's walk around areas that I know.
-All right, then, lead on.
-Please follow me.
Be quiet and listen!
Her Excellency Valide Sultan Hafsa has been generous enough to distribute gold in honour of her grandson, Prince Mehmet.
Slow down.
Don't forget your manners and your elegance.
Finally something good has come of Hürrem.
Drink, my lion son.
If it wasn't feeding time they wouldn't bring you to me.
Drink a lot.
Cry a lot when I am not there.
They can't take you from me.
Drink and grow fast, my prince.
You will rule this court.
You will become the Padişa.
You will own the world.
You will be a king and me a queen.
Hürrem.
I....
I....
Last night....
Yes?
What?
I brought the prince's mother of pearl cradle.
My son has a mother of pearl bed.
Like a throne.
Mother, look!
They gave me gold.
A prince has been born.
Yes, Mustafa.
Another prince has been born.
Am I no longer a prince?
Is Father angry with me?
No, Mustafa.
Your father would never be angry with you.
You are the first prince.
You will always be so.
You will be the Padişa.
İbrahim promised me.
Come, paşas.
I am working on the Rhodes campaign.
Take a look at Piri Reis' map.
Rhodes shines like a jewel in the middle of the sea.
Your Majesty, there is a letter from Rhodes.
It was sent by the Grand Master.
"I received your letter in which you wrote that you are thinking of me.
The fact that you are thinking of me does not disturb me.
Because I am thinking of you too."
You speak of the victory at Belgrade Aghain.
And you say that it will not suffice and that you hope to win another great victory.
In fact, you promise yourself that you will and declare it before the war even begins.
"I hope that you don't disappoint yourself."
How are you to know of my dreams, you fool?
Inshallah you have a child too.
Amen.
I can help you if you like.
-What help?
-What help?
Help with İbrahim.
Don't lie to me.
You know it too.
Is this the prince?
He is your brother.
Prince Mehmet.
Hatice.
Will my father still love me?
How can you ask that, Mustafa?
Of course he will.
You are the apple of your father's eye.
You have a special place in his heart.
Look, he is still so tiny.
Look how sweet he is.
We pray for the health of Prince Mehmet, born of Hürrem Hatun, Your Majesty.
Hürrem Hatun?
That's enough for today, you may retire.
Aghas!
Summon my tutor, Kasim Paşa.
Will that baby grow up here with me?
Will Father play with him too?
He is still so small.
We will raise him here.
Then he will go to a province like you.
He will represent the Empire.
Send him to a province immediately.
Send his mother too.
My intelligent prince.
My lion cub.
There is still time for that.
He is your brother.
You will raise him.
Mustafa, look what I am going to show you.
You will love it.
What is it?
Come with me.
Today you showed maturity, well done.
This is the only way you will win my son's heart Aghain.
That is all I ask for from Allah.
I pray for it.
Help me.
I am so alone.
Be patient, find peace.
You summoned me, Your Majesty.
Come, Lala.
Sit before me.
You have been of great service to the Empire.
I will never forget your efforts in raising me.
You honour me, Your Majesty.
But the time has come for you to rest, Lala.
You are to retire with a 200,000 akçe allowance.
Have I offended you unintentionally, Your Majesty?
No.
It is simply how I see fit.
Of course.
The edict is yours to give.
Please give me your blessing, Your Majesty.
I do, Lala.
I have eaten too much.
Take this, Gülnihal.
Wait, let me just put the tray down.
Don't get up.
Eat, drink and sleep.
That's enough!
I want to get up.
Hürrem, let's not go out.
Is it forbidden?
Am I imprisoned?
Get out of the way.
I am going out to see my son.
Don't do that.
Come on.
You were going to tell me something.
You cut off when Hatice arrived.
What was it?
I don't remember.
I have forgotten it.
Were you going to apologise?
Yes.
"I wasn't there at the birth, Hürrem."
Were you going to ask me to forgive you?
Yes.
Come on.
Let's sit down.
Hürrem Hatun.
You are now a sultan.
His Majesty has sent you presents reserved for sultans.
Bring them in.
How is it?
Do you like your weasel stole?
I love it.
Does it suit me?
The weasel stole is reserved for the dynasty, my sultan.
No one else can wear it.
I am a sultan, aren't I?
Sultan Hürrem.
Come in.
Nigar Kalfa has come, Effendi.
Let her in.
You are late.
I had work to do, Effendi.
-The Valide sultan--
-That's enough, don't explain.
Come closer.
Give me the news.
How is Hürrem Hatun?
Effendi now that she has given birth she is acting like a sultan.
Her screams echo in the harem.
The Valide Sultan had her son removed while she was sleeping so that he could be looked after.
When she woke and couldn't see the prince beside her she brought the roof down screaming we had stolen her son and that we were thieves.
What is Gülnihal doing?
Did she tell Hürrem she was in the private chamber?
Allah forbid.
If she did, Hürrem would kill her.
No, she doesn't know.
It seems Hürrem has scared all of you.
No, it's not like that.
-To keep the peace--
-Be quiet.
I understand.
Nigar Kalfa.
I have something to ask of you.
Gülnihal.
Gülnihal?
You are sleeping as you stand.
Go and see if the prince is all right.
-Where did you disappear to?
-My sultan.
Tell me.
No one is speaking to me today.
Have you swallowed you tongue?
I heard Nigar Kalfa speaking in the bath.
While you were in labour last night, His Majesty was in the private chamber.
It's a lie.
It's a lie.
-Süleyman wouldn't do that.
-I swear, that's what I heard.
I am only conveying what I heard.
Damn you!
Hürrem Hatun.
Is there something you need?
Tell me.
Is it true?
Tell me!
Was Sultan Süleyman in the private chamber while I was giving birth?
-I don't know.
Let go of my arm!
-I'll rip your arm off and leave you crippled!
Yes, that is what I heard.
His Majesty was in the private chamber.
Who was it?
Who was in his bed?
Tell me!
I don't know.
What is it to you?
It's not for you to know.
What's it to me?
I am his woman!
His woman!
Gülnihal.
Have you heard?
What lengths they are going to to take Süleyman from me.
Who was it?
Who lay with him?
It doesn't matter.
Let it go.
His Majesty takes whomever he wants.
You know that.
He cannot!
It is forbidden!
I won't allow it!
Gülnihal.
Find out who it was.
Please find out.
I will shower you in gold.
What will you do when you find out?
I will take my hands, like this...
-...and take her life.
-Hürrem.
Hürrem, let go.
Let go.

Your Honor, this man is the surrogate father as well as Cha Ki Young's lover.
I would like to call Jo Eun Cha to the stand.
- She begged me.
- How could you do this to us?
I hereby declare that those rights be divested from Ms. Cha Ki Young.
Parental and custodial rights will be granted to the plaintiff, Mr. Park Tae Yun.
I want to send him off with a smile, but I don't think I can do that.
Mom!
Dan is home now.
Why aren't you coming home?
All he did was to spread his seed.
But if custody is granted to the father for the sole reason of being a man...
Then this law needs to be abolished immediately.
Eun Cha, let's get married.
If you hurt the person you love, you end up hurting yourself more.
[Final Episode] You want me to go on the 'Rivalry' show?
Are you just going to give up like this?
You have to get Dan back!
Still...
Dan will have hope if he sees that you're alive.
And money.
You need a steady income if you want custody again!
Cha Ki Young!
Cha Ki Young!
What the heck are you doing?
I'll return everything to you!
What?
After I destroyed you...
Ki Young, I feel like I'm going to die!
The only reason I took the child away was because of you!
I didn't care about the child from the start.
All I cared about was you!
You only had eyes for the child and not me.
That's why.
That's why I took Dan from you.
You took Dan because of me?
You may think I'm a crazy bastard.
If you accept my love...
Dan or whatever else it is...
I'll return all of it to you.
Do you think Dan is a toy?
Something to take away and give back?
Why?
Are you sick and tired of playing with him now?
You rotten bastard!
Even beasts don't treat their babies like that!
Dan just finished potty training!
He still wets himself if he gets stressed or shocked!
How are you going to return Dan?
You're one thing...
But did Chairman Park agree to leave Dan's last name as it is?
And did your wife, did the kidnapping expert say that's okay, too?
Don't mess with people's lives.
Leave.
Eun Cha, I'll go on the 'Rivalry' show.
Cast me.
Park Tae Yun won't be able to return Dan to you.
Getting him back isn't something you can do on a whim.
It's going to be a long fight and you have to prepare well.
Did you wet the bed again?
Get up.
I said get up!
Come down here.
Come down!
How many times has it been now?
How could you still wet your bed at night?
Just how old are you?
Just who do you take after to be this stupid?
Huh?
I swear!
Are you okay?
Yes.
Well, your child isn't okay.
From what I see, he's depressed.
How could he not be?
The poor thing was literally torn away from his mother.
I specifically told you that Dan could only be taken away from you if you had him.
You should've listened to me back then.
Look at you now.
Hey.
How could you make a pregnant woman wait for you?
I'm a rookie.
I can't just leave in the middle of filming.
You said you don't even have a name in the drama.
I do have one.
'College Student Number Two.'
Forget it.
Let's not make this any more complicated between us.
Let's settle this now.
- You hate kids, right?
- I love them.
Do you want to become a father?
Not... yet.
- You don't want to marry me, right?
- No.
- I want to marry you.
- Really?
Yes.
That's good enough.
Let's go to my house then.
Why are we going to your house?
You have to get my father's permission first if you want to marry me.
What are you doing here?
I've been cast on the 'Rivalry' show.
Not as an MC, but as the woman who got pregnant by sperm donation.
As the star of 'Cha Ah Dol.'
- Will you be okay?
- Yeah.
It's fine.
The skeletons are out of the closet, anyway.
I heard you got evicted.
Where are you staying right now?
I'm staying at Eun Cha's place at the moment.
Jo Eun Cha's place?
But you two have already caused an uproar with with that false scandal.
I'm not concerned about what people say anymore.
In the beginning, I did it to protect Dan.
But everyone found out who he was and it's all over now.
For some reason, I think I'll lose all ties with Dan if I leave that studio.
You'll have to find a job and a place of your own first if you want to get Dan back.
Sun Nyeo told me... that Dan's constantly in front of the TV, waiting to see you.
Then I guess I'll have to show him my face as much as possible on TV.
Yun Hee, introduce me to a lot of programs that you know of.
It doesn't matter if it's unpopular.
Now that I don't have Dan anymore, I can just focus on work.
'Let's return the child to Cha Ki Young.'
She's a hot topic on the SNS and the star of 'Cha Ah Dol.'
Please welcome Cha Ki Young.
Hello, I'm Cha Ki Young.
As a man, I'm really curious about this.
Did you really only think of the father of your child as a sperm bank?
I didn't care about marriage either.
There were many times where I only wanted a baby.
I understand where Cha Ki Young is coming from.
But why didn't you use an actual sperm bank instead of using a man?
Your child has been taken away from you, and your parental rights have been revoked.
This unfortunate ordeal would've never happened if you had used a sperm bank.
I couldn't trust men because of my father's infidelity towards my family.
I saw my mother struggle to raise her own children while we were growing up.
So I never learned how to lean on a man.
I didn't have the confidence to love someone.
I only loved myself and focused my energy into my career.
So I became the best anchor butI alwaysfeltnervous, impatient, and lonely.
And one day, a man appeared in my life.
I was scared of love and I couldn't bring myself to fall in love with him.
It's not because I didn't love him.
I just didn't know how to love him.
And so, I became pregnant.
Because I didn't have the confidence to love this man
I wanted to hide the child from him.
Because a child... is a being you can love forever.
Then you're not a sperm thief that just wanted a man's sperm.
You're an ordinary woman who wanted to have a baby with the man that you loved.
Don't you want to get your son back?
- That's...
- Even if that were possible...
I would only be hurting my child.
So I have no intention of getting him back.
- My son's father is much more...
- Mom!
Eun Chil!
- Eun Chil!
- Mom!
- Mom!
- I want to see him...
Eun Chil, you can't do this.
Eun Chil!
Eun Chil!
I want to be on TV as much as possible, so my son doesn't forget my face.
- Mom!
- What is wrong with you?
- Mom!
- Eun Chil.
Eun Chil.
Mom!
Perfection!
A cupid's arrow has pierced my heart and love has started
I've fallen into the hands of destiny again.
Is it okay if I love...
Aren't you glad you went on the show?
Have a seat.
The pay is pretty strong.
I went to the market today, and bought some crabs.
In celebration of your first freelance appearance
I made you crab stew!
It looks delicious!
You'll get a nice buzz if you mix the soju and beer just right.
Just the first glass.
Really?
Cha Ki Young.
Let's get married.
If it's a yes, drink this in one shot.
If it's a no... then get out of my place this instant.
Eun Cha, do you love me?
As the typical man of the 21st century and you being dubbed as a witch, talking about love doesn't suit us.
I'm saying let's make an alliance by getting married.
What kind of alliance?
Honestly, our country revolves around family and marriage.
Being a divorced man will be a handicap for me at the elections.
You're slowly making a comeback.
And marriage will help you get Dan back.
This will be advantageous for you.
If I become an assemblyman...
I'll amend this ridiculous custody law of giving sole custody to the man just because he impregnated a woman.
And I'm going to give Dan back to you.
It's going to be titled 'Cha Ki Young Law.'
That's my campaign strategy.
We're only getting married because we need each other.
Both of us need each other right now.
Okay, okay.
I know how you women love cheesy surprises.
Wait just a minute.
The cupid's arrow has pierced my heart and love has started
I've fallen into the hands of destiny again
Forget the proposal.
I approve of your strategy, so I'll go ahead and drink this glass.
Why are you crying?
Because I miss my mom!
Did you wet the bed again?
Seriously, you're driving me crazy!
I just changed the sheets not long ago!
How could you wet the bed again?
Hyung Myung Yi.
- Go sleep on the sofa.
- Why?
And get me a new set of pajamas for Dan.
Come here.
Mister, are you really my dad?
That sounds about right.
- Dad.
- What?
Dad.
Dad.
Show him.
Her husband poured boiling water on her neck?
How could a person do this to another human being?
That bastard isn't a husband!
He's a monster!
You had it pretty good as an anchor.
Why do you want to become an assemblyman?
It's such a difficult path.
You don't know very well but there are about 200 incentives given to an assemblyman.
And the taste of power that comes with those incentives is irresistible.
A man needs power and wealth in order to be the best.
You're going through all this trouble just so you can obtain that?
After I've listened to the stories of the 'Yeohengman' ladies...
I was really appalled.
Yeohengman has ten thousand members.
And it means there's about ten thousand stories of domestic violence.
Of those ten thousand stories...
Your story is going to be included, and that's the 'Cha Ki Young Law.'
All I'm going to use is the 'Cha Ki Young Law' campaign to get elected.
After I become an assemblyman
I'll make sure that law passes during my term.
That's my dream.
Bang!
Bang!
Die!
Bang!
Bang!
Director Park, is everything to your liking?
Yes.
- Are you Park Eun Chil?
- No, my name is Cha Dan.
Bang!
Bang!
You little rascal.
Director Park, let's go to my office and drink some tea.
You too, Dan.
Let's go together.
There you go.
Let's go.
You can sit right here, little man.
I'll give you something yummy to eat.
Here you go.
- Is it good?
- Yes.
Look at your eyes.
They're so clear I could look into them all day.
Rascal.
Your father bought 14 percent of our company's shares for huge a sum.
He didn't want to be a part of the board.
When all he wanted was authority over personnel...
Everyone... expected you to start chopping off heads left and right.
But you only fired two people.
Jo Eun Cha planned on going into politics, anyway.
And it was just a matter of time before Cha Ki Young got fired.
I was really touched when you showed mercy to Jo Eun Cha.
I plan on giving up my authority over personnel.
Because the Director of Strategic Planning has no business with that kind of authority.
Not at all.
When push came to shove, I was the one who turned tail during a financial crisis.
Go ahead and keep the personnel authority for the time being.
Tae Yun.
Life is long.
The things that you thought were important at your age won't matter at all when you're in your 40s and 50s.
When that time comes... something you've never imagined will become just as precious as your own life.
You're the director of Strategic Planning and own 14 percent of this company.
But one day, you might have to oversee this whole station.
Have confidence in yourself.
I hope that you lead our company well.
- Okay?
- Yes, Sir.
Where is Eun Chil?
Huh?
Tae Yun took him to the news station, Father.
You're home.
Why did you take the child to work?
My wish was to follow you wherever you went when I was a little boy.
I figured he would want to do that, too.
Why would a man take a child to work?
It makes him look like a fool.
Taking care of children is a woman's job.
- Eun Chil, let's go and wash up.
- That's a good idea.
My goodness.
Here you go.
Say 'Ah.'
You don't like meat?
Would you like to eat abalone then?
Say 'Ah.'
Don't feed him if he doesn't want to eat.
He's not going to starve to death if he misses a meal.
Hey... stop eating.
Eun Chil.
It's rude to leave the table before the adults are finished eating.
Eun Chil, just eat one more spoonful, okay?
I learned all these dishes at culinary school just so I could make them for you.
Now, say 'Ah.'
No, I'm going to throw up!
Just let him be.
You probably forgot me, right?
I forgot you, too.
Now that you're with your rich father... are you eating and living well?
I'm going to be just fine without too.
Dan, I miss you.
I miss you so much. that I feel like I'm going to go crazy.
Dan.
What's going on?
What's wrong with this?
Your father unplugged all the TV cords.
Goodness, it seems our Eun Chil is hungry.
Goodness, what do you want to eat?
I want to see the TV.
Grandma will make you something yummy to eat, so don't suck your thumb, okay?
Listen to me.
Don't suck your thumb.
I'll make you something yummy to eat.
Don't suck your thumb.
Even if he doesn't want to eat, how can you just leave him in that state?
Father and Tae Yun told me to just leave him alone.
Would you have done that if he was your own child?
You probably would've made some porridge for him to eat.
I hear chestnut porridge is good for children.
It's very nutritious.
I noticed there were some chestnuts in the freezer.
Shall I make the porridge?
Why would you make porridge with frozen chestnuts for our precious grandson?
Go to the market and buy fresh ones.
Right now?
Princess chestnuts are the best.
They're big and thick.
Make sure you buy ones that weren't eaten by insects.
Yes, Mother.
Why do you want to marry me?
I want to marry you because I like you.
But why do you like me?
I'm much older than you and I'm somewhat attractive, but I'm no beauty.
Not to mention, I have a nasty temper.
Even I don't understand why a hottie like you would find me attractive.
- Can I be honest with you?
- Hey.
You and I are going to get permission for marriage right now.
Of course you should be honest with me.
You're a successful woman and you're rich.
Seriously.
I had my suspicions...
but I'm really disappointed.
Thanks to you, I made the cover of Renoir.
And because of that cover, I've been in high demand ever since.
I feel that your money and talent will get me far.
I want to marry you.
Well, I like your honesty.
But just know that nothing in the world is for free, got it?
Eun Chil.
I bought some huge chestnuts at the market and I made chestnut porridge for you.
It's yummy.
Go ahead and try it.
Say 'Ah.'
Come on, just one bite.
Just give it a taste.
Open your mouth.
Are you ignoring me, too?
Say 'Ah.' Open your mouth.
I said open your mouth!
I said open your mouth!
Don't cry.
Do you think I went out this late to buy chestnuts because I think you're sweet?
I know you hate me, but I hate you more.
Open your mouth.
Say 'Ah' and eat this.
Eat it!
Eat it!
Say 'Ah.' Now, eat it.
What?
You're pregnant?
You got pregnant without getting married first?
Father, I'm a human being!
I want to get married and have children before I die!
Say what?
You're 20 years older than him?
No!
I said the age difference is 15 years!
Hey, I'm the one who's pregnant!
Who should be blocking whom here, huh?
I guess it's impossible then.
Hey!
First, come here and have a seat.
Now then, what is your occupation?
I'm an actor and model.
What?
You're a man, and on top of that you wear makeup for a living?
Is that it?
Makeup or not, you know that an abortion is out of the question.
And what do your parents do?
They got a divorce when I was little, so I'm not sure.
But what is it about Sun Nyeo that you like so much to want to marry her?
I'm her mother and I can't find anything attractive about her.
Right.
- She's success...
- Hey!
Stop right there.
Father, Mother!
There's something wrong with Eun Chil!
What's wrong with Eun Chil?
Eun Chil!
How many times did he throw up?
20 times... no, I think he threw up 21 times.
- My goodness.
- What did he eat?
I only fed him chestnut porridge.
Why did you force him to eat when he didn't want to?
I can't believe this!
Before that, did he have a poor appetite?
I don't think we've seen him eat a meal ever since he came to live with us, right?
Intestinal problems can occur if he ate something new after self-starvation.
Eun Chil is exhausted from the vomiting, so he's in a bad condition right now.
First, we'll hook him to an IV and get some fluids inside of him.
Afterward, feed him his favorite foods and get his nutrition back up quickly.
We have no idea what kinds of food he normally ate.
Hey.
Since you're the main culprit, call Cha Ki Young and ask her.
There's no need for that!
- Get started on the IV!
- Yes, Sir.
Today is Cha Dan's first birthday.
Dan!
Dan, what are you going to pick?
Dan, pick the gavel!
No, pick the pencil... the thread?
Good job.
Dan, shall we pick the thread so you can live a long and healthy life?
Dan.
What is my sweet Dan going to pick?
Dan is very sick.
Where?
I don't know the exact cause of it.
But he hasn't been able to eat anything.
All he does is throw up.
What foods does Dan normally eat well?
Come inside, I'll make it for you.
Dan, grab the judge's gavel.
No, the charger.
No, a long life is better than wealth and honor.
Grab the thread instead.
Dan!
Wow!
You grabbed the microphone!
You'll probably become a singer or celebrity someday.
- Since you're handsome like your father...
- When was this?
It's his first birthday celebration.
Why aren't there any people?
I had to cut off all ties with my mom back then.
So, it was just me and Dan.
Don't make any porridge just yet.
Is it okay if I bring Dan here for a moment?
If you don't want me to, then just forget it.
Why wouldn't I want that?
Of course I want you to.
What do we do?
Our poor Eun Chil.
Where did Tae Yun go?
I'm going to take him to the hospital.
Move.
We have the doctor on hand.
Don't take him, he's sick!
Are you going to leave him to die like this?
The company doctor couldn't do anything for him!
Let's go.
- Hey...
- Tae Yun.
Don't follow us!
He's my child, so I'll make sure that he gets better.
I bought sandfish while I was campaigning at the market today.
It came straight from Seokcho this morning.
It's really fresh.
Let's boil it down and eat it.
- Was there anyone outside?
- Why?
Are you expecting someone?
No.
- Now is not a good...
- Come upstairs.
There's nothing here, so bring what you need to make the porridge.
Don't lift a finger and just relax!
I'm far better at cooking these family meals than Park Tae Yun.
I've been living alone for ten years.
I'm the king of home-cooked meals.
Eun Cha, I have to go somewhere.
I'll see you later.
Dan.
Mom.
Dan, where are you hurting?
Mom, is this a dream?
It's not a dream.
Dan, are you hurting a lot?
Where does it hurt?
Mom, my stomach hurts.
I want to eat porridge.
Okay, Dan.
I'll make it real quick.
Wait just a little bit, okay?
Come here.
[Jo Eun Cha]
Dan, wake up.
Let's eat some porridge.
Let's eat some porridge.
Mom, more.
You'll get sick if you eat it too fast, so let's take it slow.
- Slowly.
Okay, Dan?
- Okay.
How is he?
He fell asleep after taking his medicine.
Which hospital is he in?
Don't wait up for us.
Just go to sleep.
I'll bring him home after he gets better.
Dinner is almost ready!
Where did you go?
And why aren't you answering the phone?
You're supposed to eat this dish while it's hot.
Is he sleeping?
He's sleeping.
I'll feed him two more times after he wakes up and then he should be fine.
Just feed Dan plain rice porridge whenever he gets sick.
He can't eat porridge that has fat or oil in it.
I'll...
leave him here with you.
My father, mother, and Myung Yi don't know about any of that.
The biological father is going to kidnap the child now?
I'm trying to save my son.
Why would that be called kidnapping?
Bringing Dan here without letting your family know...
To Chairman Park and Myung Yi, it is kidnapping.
At present, getting him adjusted to a new environment is priority.
Do you think that's possible?
The only people who thought it was possible were you and your family.
Whenever Dan gets sick... or when he misses you...
If you don't mind...
I'd like to bring him here.
For that to happen...
You'll have to move back into this studio again.
You can think of it as alimony, if you want.
I didn't do anything to you that warrants alimony.
But if that's what you really want, then let's sign a lease contract.
Stop!
Whatever you suspect right now is true.
You're right... but just what are you going to do when you go inside?
I'm going to kill them all, and I'll kill myself, too.
Drink with me before you die.
They say even the dead look good if they have a good meal before they die.
I have a delicious pot of spicy sandfish waiting to be devoured.
Let go!
I said let go!
I'll have no choice but to cover your mouth if you continue to scream.
Then the lipstick on your pretty lips will be smudged from my hand.
Do you want to get lipstick on the hands of the most despicable man in Korea?
Let's go.
To all the broken-hearted losers in the world.
Cheers.
One more glass.
Eat some of these plump fish eggs first.
It's rude to only drink when there's delicious food placed in front of you.
Go ahead and eat this.
I'll give you another glass if you eat this.
'Ah.'
Just like that.
Is he the only one that didn't get to eat?
In addition to my mother-in-law's demands, I starved just as much as he did.
That rotten bastard.
He even lied about taking Dan to the hospital.
Everyone knew he would come here.
He turned me into a complete fool.
You should've never kidnapped Dan in first place.
What were you thinking?
While I was helping his family prepare their ancestor's memorial banquet...
I miscarried my baby.
That rotten bastard.
Instead of thinking about trying to have another baby with me...
All he did was wander around.
I totally understand how you feel.
Because I want to kidnap Cha Ki Young's son and return him to her.
Here, drink this.
Just guzzle it down.
I'm sorry.
I... didn't want to hurt you to this extent.
You... probably didn't know this.
But before I went to trial with you...
My dream... was for you, me, and Dan... to live happily ever after.
But... the result of my reality... was the total opposite of that.
You're too late.
Because that was my dream, too.
Dan is the spitting image of you, and while I was taking care of him...
I was waiting for you.
When I voluntarily chose to be a single mother...
And when I said I didn't need a man...
That was just foolish pride talking.
I always felt uneasy raising Dan on my own.
There wasn't a single day when I felt comfortable.
What if I something bad happened and I died?
What will happen to my Dan?
What if he gets hurt?
I've been living with those fears every day.
You should leave now.
And pick up Dan tomorrow.
Okay.
Go inside.
Bye.
Wait.
Come to my place and take your wife with you.
You can ask your wife why she was sleeping here after she wakes up.
Hey, wake up.
Wake up.
A drunk person is the same as a little baby.
You have to gently coax her and carry her home.
Wake up, sweetie.
It's time to go home now.
Good girl.
Get on.
There you go, just like that.
Good girl.
Park Tae Yun, you need to treat Hyun Myung Yi better.
Do you think she's going to let you and Dan visit if you continue to provoke her?
She seems to want a baby so badly.
Just get her pregnant.
You just take care of yourself.
Why you little...
- Hi, Dan.
- Mom, I want some more porridge, please.
Goodness, it seems my son is feeling all better now because the first thing you want to do is eat.
Yes.
Dan, do you remember coming here with your dad?
Yes.
Your dad made a promise with me yesterday.
He promised to bring you here whenever you miss me.
So, don't worry about anything and go back home with your dad.
Okay?
Do I have to go?
I want to stay here and live with you.
Then you won't be able to see me even if you wanted to.
Dan.
This is the best for now.
I'm going to work really hard to get custody of you again.
Let's live together when that time comes, okay?
Okay.
Let's return the child to Cha Ki Young!
'Cha Ah Dol!
' 'Cha Ah Dol!
'
- You're here.
- I got my studio back.
How?
Did Park Tae Yun give it back to you?
Not exactly, but I signed a lease contract.
First it was your child, now you've decided to throw your pride out the window?
That punk needs to be punished!
Why did you sign a lease with him?
I don't want Dan to get hurt by this situation any longer.
My Dan will get hurt if I hate Park Tae Yun.
Don't you want the parental and custodial rights back?
Of course I want them back.
I'm going to get them back by making the 'Cha Ki Young Law.'
That's why I came out here.
Let's return the child to Cha Ki Young!
Please welcome the star of 'Cha Ah Dol' and former Channel Korea anchorwoman, Ms. Cha Ki Young!
And with much gratitude, she will give a speech in support of my campaign!
Ms. Cha Ki Young, please come up.
'Cha Ah Dol!
'
Hello, I'm Cha Ki Young.
Everyone has misunderstood a certain aspect about me.
But I'm not in the position to reject the patriarchal family system of Korea.
Nowadays, there are many people in their 30s and 40s living together out of wedlock.
And many children have been born from those relationships.
If this is reality, then don't you think we should accept it for what it is?
People were born first before the law and the law was created by the people.
I carried my son for nine months before I gave birth to him.
But our country's law states that he doesn't belong to me.
This kind of custody law needs to be fixed immediately.
Candidate Jo Eun Cha has promised to take care of that.
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask that you give your full support to Mr. Jo Eun Cha.
'Cha Ah Dol!
'
Thank you everyone!
Thank you so much!
Ms. Cha Ki Young, thank you.
I will make it my duty to return Ms. Cha Ki Young's son to her!
Everyone, I am candidate number five and my name is Jo Eun Cha!
'Cha Ah Dol!
'
'Cha Ah Dol!
'
Eun Cha.
What are you disloyal bastards doing here?
- Eun Cha, sit down.
- Please have a seat.
Please sit down.
Eun Cha, this is a poll analysis of your campaign.
You're no match against the ruling party's candidate, Assemblyman Kim.
But you've crushed all the other opposing candidates.
You blood-sucking bastards, what is this?
During the day it's Park Tae Yun and at night you come to me?
Is that it?
I guess you can say we're making a strategic move before you win the election.
We learned all this from you.
Playing two sides at once.
You bastard.
Eun Cha, Kim Pal Soon and Chairman Park have total control over the ruling party.
Should I take a picture that will incriminate both of them at the same time?
Be quiet!
I'm not going to win the election by playing dirty like that.
I'm going to take my chances by only using the 'Cha Ki Young Law' strategy.
- Unbelievable.
- What are you doing?
I'm checking to see if we've been bugged.
I found this beneath the bed in the master bedroom.
And I found this behind the desk in my study room.
Did you find another one?
There's another one here.
Wow.
Take a look.
Seriously, I am completely stunned.
Thank you.
I went to the police station today, and everything we discussed was in the lawsuit.
My car was bugged, too.
What did the police say?
Can they still charge us with adultery?
That woman is so meticulous and careful.
She has about three boxes' worth of evidence of us living together.
She even recorded everything I talked about when we first met seven years ago.
The motel...
She has old ticket stubs to the the movies, popcorn receipts, just everything!
So what is it that Nurse Jung wants?
She wants me to give her...
the whole hospital.
That's the only way she'll settle.
If she wants it, then give it to her.
Just give it to her and end it once and for all.
What?
There's nothing left from the hospital with the debt we acquired.
If she's willing to take on the debt, then tell her she can have everything.
I'm sorry.
Il Jong.
We started with nothing when we first met.
If we're going to get back together again...
It doesn't matter to me if we become poor again.
But how is it going on your end?
You still haven't been served yet?
No, not yet.
That's why it's driving me even crazier.
I'm so nervous.
- Pose for the camera please.
- Ki Young, over here.
Sure, sure.
- You guys look great together.
- Yes, thank you.
Jo Eun Cha, number five!
Next, are the ballots from Seongbuk Gu, Seoul.
Currently, Jo Eun Cha has 57 percent of the votes and is slightly ahead of the powerhouse politician, Assemblyman Kim.
You can win this!
Be strong, you can win!
Honey, come upstairs for now.
Joon Young is in the kitchen, so let's meet here and we can go see him together.
Okay.
Sun Nyeo, what brings you here?
And what's with the maternity clothes?
Why do you think I'm wearing maternity clothes?
Is it the new fashion trend for next year?
I'm getting married.
There's my fiancé.
Pedro!
- Hello.
- Ah yes, hello.
I've seen you around before.
My name is Pedro.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I'm so dizzy.
My morning sickness is kicking in all of a sudden.
- Sun Nyeo, are you pregnant?
- Yeah.
This is my husband-to-be.
He's 15 years younger than me.
He's a model, 195 cm tall, and his face is as small as my hand.
I'm actually 189 cm.
Are you walking around without any shoes on?
If he has shoes on, he's about 190... 192 cm.
Sun Nyeo, that's awesome!
Just a moment please.
You just went straight to the kitchen?
Okay, I'll be right there.
Sun Nyeo, I'm truly happy for you!
Congratulations!
- I'm going to head out first.
- Okay.
What do you two want?
If you came as customers, then act like it.
Why did you come inside the kitchen?
Joon Young, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry for?
That you committed adultery with my lover?
Joon Young, you didn't sue us for adultery, right?
Joon Young, I truly treasure this wine and I would like for you to have it.
Please enjoy this, and don't be mad anymore.
Please?
- Isn't this a Chauteau...
- Margaux.
- This was named after Hemingway's...
- Daughter.
That is correct.
Wow.
It is a true vintage.
Please take a look.
This... this is really, really rare.
Be careful.
The color...
- Hey.
- Do you like it?
Really?
Okay, congratulations.
I'm a little busy right now, so I'll call you later.
Okay.
You're the best.
Hey, Ara!
What?
Really?
- Why...
- Wow!
But you're only 11 years old.
Isn't that too early to get your first period?
Ah, that's the norm these days?
Sure, let's celebrate when you come to Korea for vacation.
In the meantime, I'll sing you a congratulation song.
Yeah.
But how do I sing this?
Okay, okay.
Happy period to you!
Happy period to you!
Happy period to Ara!
Happy period to you!
Congratulations, my daughter!
Yeah, okay!
Wait a minute.
Why... why isn't she calling me?
Why?
You haven't been a good dad to her.
You saw that?
You saw that, right?
Ara is whose daughter?
She's my daughter.
Seriously, I was really touched.
Now, let's celebrate Ara's first period.
All right, let's open this baby up!
Sure, let's celebrate.
Next, the ballots from Seoul.
- As expected...
- Okay, let's see what's going on.
Jo Eun Cha is currently in the lead by several hundred votes.
Just what is going on with Kim Pal Soon?
Huh?
I thought you were supposed to win the general election by a landslide!
What is going on here?
Hey!
Hey... just go.
I said just go.
We'll do it, so just leave.
You're so clueless.
The parties concerned predict voting will slow down once it goes over 70 percent.
And in case of Seongbuk Gu, depending upon the situation...
Hello?
Mom?
Mom, where are you?
Canada?
Why didn't you answer my calls at all?
Were you afraid of getting traced by the debt collectors?
What about Dad?
Dad is right next to you?
You guys are driving a trailer right now?
So you guys are just driving around and living in the trailer?
You're taking turns with Dad?
Mom, what do we do?
Dad was always in a position of power...
I can't believe he's a truck driver now.
Poor daddy!
Mom, what do we do?
- What do we do?
- Mom, don't cry.
Don't cry.
Dan.
Do you want to follow me?
Yes.
I bet no one in this house would notice if we just left like this.
The race is still tight between candidates Jo Eun Cha and Kim Pal Soon.
Despite the close race, everyone is quite surprised by the results so far.
This election has captured everyone's attention.
What?
Tae Yun, Eun Chil and I are about to cross the Han river bridge.
Do you think we should just cross the Han River?
Or do you think we should get out of the taxi and jump into the Han River?
Tae Yun, Eun Chil and I are about to cross the Han river bridge.
Do you think we should just cross the Han River?
Or do you think we should get out of the taxi and jump into the Han River?
Hey... hey!
I'm going crazy.
Mom, go to my room and see if Dan is in there.
Eun Chil!
Where is he?
Eun Chil!
We're back to the Seongbuk Gu polls again.
Candidate Jo Eun Cha has turned the tide to his favor against Candidate Kim Pal Soon.
Jo Eun Cha!
Hey.
Myung Yi took Dan with her and they disappeared.
- What?
- I don't feel good about this.
Go home right now.
I'll be right there.
Ki Young, where are you going?
I feel like I'm going to die!
Hold my hand!
I'll be back.
- Dan...
Dan!
- Mom!
Dan.
Dan.
You!
I guess blood is thicker than water.
Just one phone call, and you all came in a matter of seconds.
Are you okay?
He's fine.
I went to the courthouse to find out what the divorce procedures were.
It's pretty simple.
Since it's so easy, you should have no problems doing it on your own.
I married you for your money.
But all of this happened because I fell in love with you.
I'm sorry for loving you.
I'm sorry.
I'm not sure about the parental rights.
But you should be able to get custody of Dan right away once I'm out of the picture.
Dan.
Will you give your step-mom a kiss?
That way I can remember you forever.
Bye, Mom.
See you later.
Dan!
Looking at your expression, you must have won the election.
I did!
I had 97 percent of the votes!
Congratulations, Assemblyman Jo.
Make sure you pass the 'Cha Ki Young Law' to reclaim the parental rights...
I hope you end up marrying Cha Ki Young.
Dan!
- Dad's been elected to National Assembly!
- Wow!
My dad is the best!
Hurray!
Subtitles by DramaFever
Dan, let's go!
- Dan, come to Daddy!
- I'm his dad, okay?
Dan, come here!
- Dan, which dad do you like the most?
- You like Mommy the best, right?
The Labor Party in Korea has reported that the Korean youth given up three things.
Dating, love, and having children.
The marriage rate is increasingly dropping and the number of those who believe that they do not need to get married is increasing.
Marriages in the past was considered an given and one's fate.
But marriages in the present are considered a calculated decision and a business.
What would you consider as the marriage of your dreams?
What's important is that the basis of marriage should be happiness.
Thank you for watching 'Formidable Enemies' with Cha Ki Young.
Previously on "Hellcats"...
Lewis and Nasty Kathy, I just don't get it.
Clearly, Lewis is slumming.
Yeah.
He does that.
Look at all those months he spent with you.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
They've accused him of wire fraud, bribery, and violation of the public trust.
It all started when I refinanced the mortgage, and I was able to stay afloat till last January, when they started cutting back my hours at work.
I just wanted to say thank you.
- You could have emailed.
- I could have emailed.
Then I wouldn't be able to do this.
You want to ask me out?
Yeah, I do.

And cocky.
Oh, cocky?
That's ok, I like cocky.
- You like cocky?
- Mm-hmm.
-You like it?
Mmm.
Hey, Lewis, you've got some...
Schmutz on your face there.
Oh, it's just Kathy.
My bad.
- What do you want?
- Lots of things.
You know, peace in the Middle East, members of the Mem-Chris Cyclones out of my workout room.
But mostly, I just want to see you succeed, Lewis.
Really?
How's that?
Darwin says that you asked Nasty Kathy here to be your partner for the Push-FM dance marathon.
Trying to win that new car?
Makes sense, doesn't it?
A dance marathon is all about endurance, athleticism and dance.
It's tailor-made for a couple of collegiate cheerleaders.
For the right couple of cheerleaders.
Nice knee brace.
I'll call you later, Lewis.
You want to take care of that knee with Nationals in 2 weeks, hmm?
Why you got to be like this?
Genetics.
But the million-dollar question is why are you entering a dance marathon two weeks before Nationals?
I want the car.
Bad enough to risk injury?
Anyhow, won't you have to share it with Kathy?
Nope.
She doesn't want it.
She's doing it to help me out.
I don't know what you're not telling me, but if you're serious about winning, you need a serious partner.
What, you?
I am a winner.
'Cause I don't give up.
Ever.
Uh, I have a dance partner.
Look at this.
It reads like they already decided that he's guilty.
I mean, aren't reporters supposed to be unbiased?
Look, if it's any consolation, print is a dying medium.
Your dad make bail yet?
No.
We're having trouble getting a straight answer from this public defender we've got.
My mom thinks he's an idiot.
Your dad's using a public defender?
Yeah.
The FBI froze our assets.
We're having trouble finding a lawyer.
Anyway, let's get moving.
It'll be nice to see your dad.
You know, I was thinking it'd be nice to have dinner alone.
You know, date night.
Well, I thought we were going to do something big with your family.
Well, it's just, you know...
Dan, what aren't you telling me?
Look, my dad's a teacher in Millington.
- So?
- So his pension plan was gutted.
Now he can't retire in a year like he wanted to.
He's got to keep working.
Your dad is blaming my dad?
He'll get over it, but my brothers and I, we talked.
There's just... there's no point waving a red flag in front of a bull.
This happened because of the bad economy!
My dad didn't know this was going to happen.
He was charged with 18 counts of bribery, fraud, and violation of the public trust.
That's mean.
That's not mean.
That's the truth.
I know my dad has a good explanation.
Well, when you find out what it is, just let me know.
My whole family would love to hear it.
You know what?
I think I'll pass on dinner.
- You going to be like that?
- Oh, yeah.
Ok, then.
Suit yourself.
What's wrong with him?
He's acting like an ass.
He does that.
Ok.
What do you think?
I've got a dinner date with Julian.
Oh, my gosh.
What?
Too low-cut?
No, no.
It's fine.
I need to ask you a giant favor.
Yeah.
What?
Can you ask Julian to defend my dad, for no money?
At least not up front?
White-collar crimes aren't really his specialty.
Please.
My family is desperate.
Ok, yeah.
I'll talk to him.
Maybe he can at least give you a referral.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Smush the dress.
Smushing the dress.
Sorry.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
I didn't order this.
It's compliments of the gentleman across the way.
Marti's little law friend?
Oh.
You shouldn't try to drive a Maserati when you've only got a learner's permit.
I don't think your mom and I are going to make Nationals.
Oh, that's ok, dad.
You'll be there in spirit, hmm?
Must be a mix-up at your bank.
Your card didn't go through.
Oh, um, I think I got another one...
No, no, ok.
I got it.
I got this.
You got a good boy there.
That junker truck of mine been costing me more in repairs than it's worth.
Dad, I told you not to put any more money into that thing!
Ah.
No.
Now, that new retail job is clear up in Jonesboro.
I don't drive, I don't work.
See you later, son.
Bye, dad.
The car's for your dad, isn't it?
That's why you're doing the dance marathon.
Yeah, but that's not something you have to worry about.
You.
Any dance experience?
Seven years Ballet, Three years Capoeira, and glowing notices as the rum tum tugger in my magnet school's production of "Cats."
Look who just hit the jackpot.
Ohh.
Ahh.
Here you go.
Oh.
You're saving my life.
Nothing I had matched this dress, mom.
All right.
Try these.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm
Men are big on packaging.
Julian's going to love 'em on you.
Thanks.
Perfect.
Now, go have fun, but don't get too attached.
Well, it's just dinner.
Oh, it's never just dinner.
Not at your age.
Remember, I was you once, not all that long ago.
How much older is he than you?
I'm pre-law, not math.
Mm.
Yeah.
With age comes responsibilities.
His priorities are different than yours.
Have fun.
But manage your expectations.
What's wrong?
He just canceled.
His loss.
I'm going to go put on something scandalous, because we are going out dancing.
You are too damn pretty to waste.
I'll be back in five.
- Hey, mom?
- Yes?
I love you.
♪ I wanna dance... ♪
Oh, wow.
There are a lot of people from Lancer here.
Yeah, Mem-Chris, too.
Seems like everyone in town wants to win that car.
Ahh.
All right, victims, this is The Madman welcoming y'all to the Eleventh Annual
Push-FM "Dance Till You Drop" Marathon!
That's right, that's right!
After 24 hours, we going to see who remains standing!
All right?
On your mark, get set...
Dance!
All right.
All right.
The rules are simple.
You get a 5-minute break once every hour.
At all other times, you must remain moving, or you get disqualified, all right?
Now, partner-swapping is allowed and a life preference for myself personally, all right?
It ain't where you start, y'all, it's where you finish!
The panel of judges are here to award points for style.
After 24 hours, the highest score amongst the couples still standing will win the big prize... a brand-new Toyota RAV4!
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, hey, does the music seem a little slow to you?
Seems a little slow to me.
All right, y'all, let's get it together for recording artist, dancer, and RB Pop sensation Ciara!

- Hi.
- Marti.
What are you doing here?
I needed to talk to you.
You got my text, right?
Yeah.
I did.
That's not why I'm here.
Listen, I want to explain.
But I can't right now.
I'm kind of busy.
Today's contestants are...
You're with someone, ok.
- I got it loud and clear.
- Come on, I'm waiting!
Hi.
Uh, hi yourself.
You have pretty hair.
This is Nikki.
It's my daughter.
Oh.
Uh...
How did I not know this?
How did I not know you're married?
I'm legally separated.
The divorce is pending.
Don't lawyer me.
My ex had an emergency last night, and she had to drop Nikki off.
You could have told me this before we, you know, started...
Yeah, well, I tried, but your tongue was in my mouth.
I bet you crack 'em up in the courtroom, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Anyhow, now that I know, maybe the three of us grab brunch?
Not advisable, sorry.
- My therapist suggests...
- Your therapist?
My therapist suggests a six-month waiting period before introducing Nikki to any sort of girlfriend or potential girlfriend.
If this doesn't work out, you leave or we split up,
Nikki's going to be that much less emotionally open to the next woman that I bring into my life.
Already onto the next woman, are we?
Yeah, I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
It's ok.
You're looking out for your kid.
I get that.
It's attractive.
Dad?
We need more cereal.
Ok.
One second, honey.
Let me make it up to you by cooking you dinner tonight.
How does that sound?
It sounds fantastic.
Um...
I also have a favor to ask.
Again.
What's the favor?
You remember my roomie Savannah?
Her dad's in big trouble, and he needs a lawyer.
But they can't exactly pay you.
Well, if this gets me out of trouble for
- not mentioning my wife or my kid...
- absolutely.
- Then I'm in.
- Mm-hmm.
How soon can they meet?
Your husband was skimming the interest from the bonds that were intended for infrastructure projects.
The banks made so much money off the sky-high interest from the synthetic rate swap scheme, that they bribed city officials into rubber stamping all the deals.
And that, along with related crimes, is what Parker's being charged with.
Do you have any questions?
Can you get our dad out of jail?
Parker was arraigned this morning, and the judge granted bail in the amount of $50,000.
Great.
We can handle that, right?
Our accounts have been frozen, sweetheart.
They have?
Yes, Charlotte!
Haven't you been listening?
Are you thick?
For the record, that nasty comment about your mommy was made by Aunt Savannah.
- Oh, knock it off.
- Aunt Savannah!
Girls, please.
I have a severe headache.
Now, Mr. Parrish, what other options do we have?
Well, I will be working on getting you an allowance from the court.
And I will also make a motion to get the bail reduced, but there's a very good chance that the judge will not allow that.
So you're going to have to get a loan or work something out with a bail bondsman.
Well, I have tried that, but without collateral, they will not lend us a penny.
Mom, you could ask the Church.
Don't be ridiculous.
Yeah, the Angel Fund!
- Angel Fund?
- They use it to help members of the Church in trouble, you know, if someone's in danger of losing their house.
That fund is not for people like us.
We are not having mortgage trouble.
You happen to have a father who is an accused felon.
- Wrongly accused!
- Yeah.
You don't really believe that dad really took bribes.
Do you?
Of course not, honey.
Mom, you have to talk to Pastor George.
Ok?
Dad has given his life to that church.
You're on the Board of Directors.
Yeah, it's just a bail.
They'll get it back eventually.
What other moves do we have, Mr. Parrish?
Well, just let me say if you can convince your church to give you the bail money, you should jump at it.
That is, assuming you want Parker home.
Well, of course I do.
I will talk to Pastor George.

Oh, hey, hey.

All right, boys and girls, that's a five-minute break.
Just enough time to change them diapers, all right?
All right.
Ooh.
How's that knee holding up?
It's fine.
Hmm.
Now, maybe.
You've still got 19 hours to go.
I'm not going to bail on Lewis.
He wants that car for his dad, and I'm going to help him win it.
Yeah.
It'd be a damn shame if you had to drop out with a ruined knee.
You'd have to sit out Nationals.
Wait.
Wait.
Who's sitting out Nationals?
Her knee.
It's not so good.
Let me see.
Oh, no.
No, we... we can't push this.
We're dropping out.
- We're just dropping out.
- What about the car?
I'll just figure something else out.
Heh.
I'm...
I'm actually without a partner.
What?
!
Yeah.
Morgan punked out on me.
I was going to go home and cut my losses, but...
I'd like to help your dad.
If you'll have me, that is.
You want it.
You want to dance with her.
I just want to help out my dad.
Screw your dad.
Screw my dad?
I'm sorry, but seriously, what are you, Alice's lap dog?
- Ohh!
- No.
Look, Kathy, you...
You do not want to be talking to me like that.
If you dance with Alice, you've have maybe a 2% chance of winning that car?
And 100% chance of losing me.
You understand me?
If I want to dance with Alice, I'll dance with her.
Do you understand me?
I hope you break something.
That was mean.
Don't be over here playing innocent.
Ok?
when I was over there getting ice, you were over here working on her, winding her up.
You see me denying it?
The Madman:
Dancers back on the floor!
Look, the way I see it, you've got two options.
You can go running after Nasty Kathy.
With her gimpy knee, I'm sure she'll be easy to catch.
Or...
You can take my hand.
Now, which option do you think puts your dad behind the wheel of that RAV4?
Ugh.
You are a piece of work.
A piece of work that's going to tear up the dance floor.
Come on.
Go tell them about the partner change.
Don't want to get disqualified.
See you out there.
Oh, God.
You!
- You're fired.
- What?
Ooh.
Thank you.
So?
Have you talked to Pastor George?
Is the angel fund going to give us the bail money?
I haven't asked.
Well...
When are you going to?
Our church members read the paper, like everybody else.
How exactly am I supposed to convince them your father isn't a lying cheat?
It's a church.
I'd hope they'd take it on faith.
Why should they?
I don't.
Mom, no.
Look.
Life did not turn out for your father the way he had planned.
He always thought he was entitled to more money, better job, bigger house.
Now, don't get me wrong, sweetie.
I do love him.
But he has never been satisfied with his lot in life.
If he thought others were opening doors for him, leading him to the life he deserved, well,
I have to wonder.
What you're saying is disgusting and disloyal.
Don't you lash out at me.
I am simply trying to be honest.
We have to get dad out of jail, no matter what.
We can't give up on him.
He'd be there for us.
Wouldn't he?
Be there for us?
Give me the stupid phone.
I raised you right.
And, quite honestly, it's a real pain.
Sally, how are you?
Layne Monroe here.
Yes, I was hoping to have a few words with Pastor George.
Oh!
One minute!
Y'all got one minute to get back to the dance floor, or you are o-u-t, out!
Hey, you ready to get back out there, huh?
Yeah.
Just sitting here, scoping out the competition.
Ohh.
You ok?
Yeah.
Just should've worn more comfortable shoes.
Come on, come on, come on!

What?
You smell that?
Something burning?
Oh!
Where's the fire extinguisher?
In the closet!
Well, my kitchen looks and smells like burnt toast.
Yes, I am making a list for the insurance claim right now.
No, I was alone.
I just got distracted, that's all.
Look, I got to go.
I'll call you back.
Bye.
Insurance Company?
Mm-hmm.
You really think your agent care that you had a girl over?
I just thought it would be simpler.
Ohh, you chose poorly.
Why is that?
See, insurance is a personal aphrodisiac of mine.
Oh, it is now.
It's a little-known quirk.
Wanda overflowed our bathtub, and this nice claims adjuster replaced her whole shoe collection.
Mmm.
It drove me absolutely crazy.
Are we still talking about insurance?
I never stop talking about insurance.
Ohh.
Duty calls.
Damn it.
Nope.
That's all you get.
Girls.
Dad.
Ohh.
Thank God.
Thank God you got me out of there.
Thank the Angel Fund.
The baby missed you.
Here, he's kicking.
I felt it.
I felt him kick.
Come on, dad.
Let's you get home.
The sooner, the better.
The Madman:
Come on, now.
Come on, now.
What you got?
What y'all got?
Come on.
Oh, snap!
Bye-bye, sugar pie!
Too bad.
Y'all have to go.
3 couples left, 3 minutes!
Come on!
Hey, Raggedy Ann, Andy, hey!
Y'all got to go with that.
Come on, now.
You got to pick it up.
We so got this now.
Ok.
Ok.
Two couples, one car!
We got to do something different.
Come on, Miss Ciara.
What you think we should do, girl?
You know what?
I think we see this thing all the way out.
I think so.
Come on.
- Yeah.
- Yes!

Good job, brother.
Good job.
Good job, man.
Good job, y'all.
Oh, my God!
It's not as bad as it looks.
I'll be fine by Nationals...
You should have said something.
No sense in complaining if you're not planning on quitting.
Ok.
We got to get these feet taken care of.
No.
I need some time.
Got it.
I got it.
Come on.
Still dealing with insurance stuff?
Actually, just started.
What will they think of next?
Insurance agent in your pocket?
Actually, it's like having 2 agents in your pocket.
You must have big pockets.
You have no idea.
So here's the thing, counselor.
If you just started the process, who were you on the phone with this morning?
My ex.
Correction...
My soon-to-be-ex.
Ok.
You lied to me.
Why?
Self-conscious.
A little embarrassed.
You really know how to make a girl feel special.
Come on, Marti.
Take a look at yourself.
You're like an advertisement for a male's mid-life crisis.
When we walk down the street together, onlookers probably think I've just purchased a Porsche.
You're not dating onlookers.
You're dating me.
What's important is how you see me.
So tell me.
- Tell you what exactly?
- How do you see me?
What is it you like about me?
Why are you in this?
Is this a challenge?
You are a fascinating, occasionally maddening woman.
You have a quicksilver mind and a gigantic heart.
You love your friends to a fault and despise injustice with a white-hot intensity.
You resist authority, not because you're an anarchist, but because you're a leader by nature.
And you refuse to be bullied, and will not allow me to win an argument if you know you're right.
And you're not afraid to laugh at yourself.
And you're a slightly, slightly better guitar player than I am.
And that, Marti Perkins, is but a small sampling of the things I like about you.
Oh.
Ok.
I heard your dad's out on bail.
I'm glad to hear it.
- I bet.
- I am.
Look, I'm sorry about the other day.
I was upset, and I shot my mouth off in a bad way.
That's ok.
Look, I'm propping up my whole family right now.
I need to know I can depend on you.
Understood.
Go ahead, depend.
It's my dad.
Hey, daddy.
Everything ok at home?
I couldn't leave without saying good-bye.
Good-bye?
What are you talking about?
Sweetheart, I have made some mistakes, and I cannot make them right in prison.
And I can't...
I can't go back there.
Oh, God.
I am so sorry for letting you down.
But I am going to win back your trust someday.
Now, look.
You have to take care of your mother, and you have to take care of your sister.
They are going to need your strength right now.
You can't.
You're going to ruin us.
Please, daddy, don't.
I love you, sweet...
I love you, sweetheart.

Lewis and Nasty Kathy, I just don't get it.
Clearly, Lewis is slumming.
Yeah.
He does that.
Look at all those months he spent with you.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
They've accused him of wire fraud, bribery, and violation of the public trust.
It all started when I refinanced the mortgage, and I was able to stay afloat till last January, when they started cutting back my hours at work.
I just wanted to say thank you.
- You could have emailed.
- I could have emailed.
Then I wouldn't be able to do this.
You want to ask me out?
Yeah, I do.

- You like cocky?
- Mm-hmm.
-You like it?
Mmm.
Hey, Lewis, you've got some...
Schmutz on your face there.
Oh, it's just Kathy.
My bad.
- What do you want?
- Lots of things.
You know, peace in the Middle East, members of the Mem-Chris Cyclones out of my workout room.
But mostly, I just want to see you succeed, Lewis.
Really?
How's that?
Darwin says that you asked Nasty Kathy here to be your partner for the Push-FM dance marathon.
Trying to win that new car?
Makes sense, doesn't it?
A dance marathon is all about endurance, athleticism and dance.
It's tailor-made for a couple of collegiate cheerleaders.
For the right couple of cheerleaders.
Nice knee brace.
I'll call you later, Lewis.
You want to take care of that knee with Nationals in 2 weeks, hmm?
Why you got to be like this?
Genetics.
But the million-dollar question is why are you entering a dance marathon two weeks before Nationals?
I want the car.
Bad enough to risk injury?
Anyhow, won't you have to share it with Kathy?
Nope.
She doesn't want it.
She's doing it to help me out.
I don't know what you're not telling me, but if you're serious about winning, you need a serious partner.
What, you?
I am a winner.
'Cause I don't give up.
Ever.
Uh, I have a dance partner.
Look at this.
It reads like they already decided that he's guilty.
I mean, aren't reporters supposed to be unbiased?
Look, if it's any consolation, print is a dying medium.
Your dad make bail yet?
No.
We're having trouble getting a straight answer from this public defender we've got.
My mom thinks he's an idiot.
Your dad's using a public defender?
Yeah.
The FBI froze our assets.
We're having trouble finding a lawyer.
Anyway, let's get moving.
It'll be nice to see your dad.
You know, I was thinking it'd be nice to have dinner alone.
You know, date night.
Well, I thought we were going to do something big with your family.
Well, it's just, you know...
Dan, what aren't you telling me?
Look, my dad's a teacher in Millington.
- So?
- So his pension plan was gutted.
Now he can't retire in a year like he wanted to.
He's got to keep working.
Your dad is blaming my dad?
He'll get over it, but my brothers and I, we talked.
There's just... there's no point waving a red flag in front of a bull.
This happened because of the bad economy!
My dad didn't know this was going to happen.
He was charged with 18 counts of bribery, fraud, and violation of the public trust.
That's mean.
That's not mean.
That's the truth.
I know my dad has a good explanation.
Well, when you find out what it is, just let me know.
My whole family would love to hear it.
You know what?
I think I'll pass on dinner.
- You going to be like that?
- Oh, yeah.
Ok, then.
Suit yourself.
What's wrong with him?
He's acting like an ass.
He does that.
Ok.
What do you think?
I've got a dinner date with Julian.
Oh, my gosh.
What?
Too low-cut?
No, no.
It's fine.
I need to ask you a giant favor.
Yeah.
What?
Can you ask Julian to defend my dad, for no money?
At least not up front?
White-collar crimes aren't really his specialty.
Please.
My family is desperate.
Ok, yeah.
I'll talk to him.
Maybe he can at least give you a referral.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Smush the dress.
Smushing the dress.
Sorry.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
I didn't order this.
It's compliments of the gentleman across the way.
Marti's little law friend?
Oh.
You shouldn't try to drive a Maserati when you've only got a learner's permit.
I don't think your mom and I are going to make Nationals.
Oh, that's ok, dad.
You'll be there in spirit, hmm?
Must be a mix-up at your bank.
Your card didn't go through.
Oh, um, I think I got another one...
No, no, ok.
I got it.
I got this.
You got a good boy there.
That junker truck of mine been costing me more in repairs than it's worth.
Dad, I told you not to put any more money into that thing!
Ah.
No.
Now, that new retail job is clear up in Jonesboro.
I don't drive, I don't work.
See you later, son.
Bye, dad.
The car's for your dad, isn't it?
That's why you're doing the dance marathon.
Yeah, but that's not something you have to worry about.
You.
Any dance experience?
Seven years Ballet, Three years Capoeira, and glowing notices as the rum tum tugger in my magnet school's production of "Cats."
Look who just hit the jackpot.
Ohh.
Ahh.
Here you go.
Oh.
You're saving my life.
Nothing I had matched this dress, mom.
All right.
Try these.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm
Men are big on packaging.
Julian's going to love 'em on you.
Thanks.
Perfect.
Now, go have fun, but don't get too attached.
Well, it's just dinner.
Oh, it's never just dinner.
Not at your age.
Remember, I was you once, not all that long ago.
How much older is he than you?
I'm pre-law, not math.
Mm.
Yeah.
With age comes responsibilities.
His priorities are different than yours.
Have fun.
But manage your expectations.
What's wrong?
He just canceled.
His loss.
I'm going to go put on something scandalous, because we are going out dancing.
You are too damn pretty to waste.
I'll be back in five.
- Hey, mom?
- Yes?
I love you.

You get a 5-minute break once every hour.
At all other times, you must remain moving, or you get disqualified, all right?
Now, partner-swapping is allowed and a life preference for myself personally, all right?
It ain't where you start, y'all, it's where you finish!
The panel of judges are here to award points for style.
After 24 hours, the highest score amongst the couples still standing will win the big prize... a brand-new Toyota RAV4!
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, hey, does the music seem a little slow to you?
Seems a little slow to me.

- Hi.
- Marti.
What are you doing here?
I needed to talk to you.
You got my text, right?
Yeah.
I did.
That's not why I'm here.
Listen, I want to explain.
But I can't right now.
I'm kind of busy.
Today's contestants are...
You're with someone, ok.
- I got it loud and clear.
- Come on, I'm waiting!
Hi.
Uh, hi yourself.
You have pretty hair.
This is Nikki.
It's my daughter.
Oh.
Uh...
How did I not know this?
How did I not know you're married?
I'm legally separated.
The divorce is pending.
Don't lawyer me.
My ex had an emergency last night, and she had to drop Nikki off.
You could have told me this before we, you know, started...
Yeah, well, I tried, but your tongue was in my mouth.
I bet you crack 'em up in the courtroom, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Anyhow, now that I know, maybe the three of us grab brunch?
Not advisable, sorry.
- My therapist suggests...
- Your therapist?
My therapist suggests a six-month waiting period before introducing Nikki to any sort of girlfriend or potential girlfriend.
If this doesn't work out, you leave or we split up,
Nikki's going to be that much less emotionally open to the next woman that I bring into my life.
Already onto the next woman, are we?
Yeah, I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
It's ok.
You're looking out for your kid.
I get that.
It's attractive.
Dad?
We need more cereal.
Ok.
One second, honey.
Let me make it up to you by cooking you dinner tonight.
How does that sound?
It sounds fantastic.
Um...
I also have a favor to ask.
Again.
What's the favor?
You remember my roomie Savannah?
Her dad's in big trouble, and he needs a lawyer.
But they can't exactly pay you.
Well, if this gets me out of trouble for
- not mentioning my wife or my kid...
- absolutely.
- Then I'm in.
- Mm-hmm.
How soon can they meet?
Your husband was skimming the interest from the bonds that were intended for infrastructure projects.
The banks made so much money off the sky-high interest from the synthetic rate swap scheme, that they bribed city officials into rubber stamping all the deals.
And that, along with related crimes, is what Parker's being charged with.
Do you have any questions?
Can you get our dad out of jail?
Parker was arraigned this morning, and the judge granted bail in the amount of $50,000.
Great.
We can handle that, right?
Our accounts have been frozen, sweetheart.
They have?
Yes, Charlotte!
Haven't you been listening?
Are you thick?
For the record, that nasty comment about your mommy was made by Aunt Savannah.
- Oh, knock it off.
- Aunt Savannah!
Girls, please.
I have a severe headache.
Now, Mr. Parrish, what other options do we have?
Well, I will be working on getting you an allowance from the court.
And I will also make a motion to get the bail reduced, but there's a very good chance that the judge will not allow that.
So you're going to have to get a loan or work something out with a bail bondsman.
Well, I have tried that, but without collateral, they will not lend us a penny.
Mom, you could ask the Church.
Don't be ridiculous.
Yeah, the Angel Fund!
- Angel Fund?
- They use it to help members of the Church in trouble, you know, if someone's in danger of losing their house.
That fund is not for people like us.
We are not having mortgage trouble.
You happen to have a father who is an accused felon.
- Wrongly accused!
- Yeah.
You don't really believe that dad really took bribes.
Do you?
Of course not, honey.
Mom, you have to talk to Pastor George.
Ok?
Dad has given his life to that church.
You're on the Board of Directors.
Yeah, it's just a bail.
They'll get it back eventually.
What other moves do we have, Mr. Parrish?
Well, just let me say if you can convince your church to give you the bail money, you should jump at it.
That is, assuming you want Parker home.
Well, of course I do.
I will talk to Pastor George.

Oh, hey, hey.

All right, boys and girls, that's a five-minute break.
Just enough time to change them diapers, all right?
All right.
Ooh.
How's that knee holding up?
It's fine.
Hmm.
Now, maybe.
You've still got 19 hours to go.
I'm not going to bail on Lewis.
He wants that car for his dad, and I'm going to help him win it.
Yeah.
It'd be a damn shame if you had to drop out with a ruined knee.
You'd have to sit out Nationals.
Wait.
Wait.
Who's sitting out Nationals?
Her knee.
It's not so good.
Let me see.
Oh, no.
No, we... we can't push this.
We're dropping out.
- We're just dropping out.
- What about the car?
I'll just figure something else out.
Heh.
I'm...
I'm actually without a partner.
What?
!
Yeah.
Morgan punked out on me.
I was going to go home and cut my losses, but...
I'd like to help your dad.
If you'll have me, that is.
You want it.
You want to dance with her.
I just want to help out my dad.
Screw your dad.
Screw my dad?
I'm sorry, but seriously, what are you, Alice's lap dog?
- Ohh!
- No.
Look, Kathy, you...
You do not want to be talking to me like that.
If you dance with Alice, you've have maybe a 2% chance of winning that car?
And 100% chance of losing me.
You understand me?
If I want to dance with Alice, I'll dance with her.
Do you understand me?
I hope you break something.
That was mean.
Don't be over here playing innocent.
Ok?
when I was over there getting ice, you were over here working on her, winding her up.
You see me denying it?
The Madman:
Dancers back on the floor!
Look, the way I see it, you've got two options.
You can go running after Nasty Kathy.
With her gimpy knee, I'm sure she'll be easy to catch.
Or...
You can take my hand.
Now, which option do you think puts your dad behind the wheel of that RAV4?
Ugh.
You are a piece of work.
A piece of work that's going to tear up the dance floor.
Come on.
Go tell them about the partner change.
Don't want to get disqualified.
See you out there.
Oh, God.
You!
- You're fired.
- What?
Ooh.
Thank you.
So?
Have you talked to Pastor George?
Is the angel fund going to give us the bail money?
I haven't asked.
Well...
When are you going to?
Our church members read the paper, like everybody else.
How exactly am I supposed to convince them your father isn't a lying cheat?
It's a church.
I'd hope they'd take it on faith.
Why should they?
I don't.
Mom, no.
Look.
Life did not turn out for your father the way he had planned.
He always thought he was entitled to more money, better job, bigger house.
Now, don't get me wrong, sweetie.
I do love him.
But he has never been satisfied with his lot in life.
If he thought others were opening doors for him, leading him to the life he deserved, well,
I have to wonder.
What you're saying is disgusting and disloyal.
Don't you lash out at me.
I am simply trying to be honest.
We have to get dad out of jail, no matter what.
We can't give up on him.
He'd be there for us.
Wouldn't he?
Be there for us?
Give me the stupid phone.
I raised you right.
And, quite honestly, it's a real pain.
Sally, how are you?
Layne Monroe here.
Yes, I was hoping to have a few words with Pastor George.
Oh!
One minute!
Y'all got one minute to get back to the dance floor, or you are o-u-t, out!
Hey, you ready to get back out there, huh?
Yeah.
Just sitting here, scoping out the competition.
Ohh.
You ok?
Yeah.
Just should've worn more comfortable shoes.

What?
You smell that?
Something burning?
Oh!
Where's the fire extinguisher?
In the closet!
Well, my kitchen looks and smells like burnt toast.
Yes, I am making a list for the insurance claim right now.
No, I was alone.
I just got distracted, that's all.
Look, I got to go.
I'll call you back.
Bye.
Insurance Company?
Mm-hmm.
You really think your agent care that you had a girl over?
I just thought it would be simpler.
Ohh, you chose poorly.
Why is that?
See, insurance is a personal aphrodisiac of mine.
Oh, it is now.
It's a little-known quirk.
Wanda overflowed our bathtub, and this nice claims adjuster replaced her whole shoe collection.
Mmm.
It drove me absolutely crazy.
Are we still talking about insurance?
I never stop talking about insurance.
Ohh.
Duty calls.
Damn it.
Nope.
That's all you get.
Girls.
Dad.
Ohh.
Thank God.
Thank God you got me out of there.
Thank the Angel Fund.
The baby missed you.
Here, he's kicking.
I felt it.
I felt him kick.
Come on, dad.
Let's you get home.
The sooner, the better.
The Madman:
Come on, now.
Come on, now.
What you got?
What y'all got?
Come on.
Oh, snap!
Bye-bye, sugar pie!
Too bad.
Y'all have to go.
3 couples left, 3 minutes!
Come on!
Hey, Raggedy Ann, Andy, hey!
Y'all got to go with that.
Come on, now.
You got to pick it up.
We so got this now.
Ok.
Ok.
Two couples, one car!
We got to do something different.
Come on, Miss Ciara.
What you think we should do, girl?
You know what?
I think we see this thing all the way out.
I think so.
Come on.
- Yeah.
- Yes!

Good job, brother.
Good job.
Good job, man.
Good job, y'all.
Oh, my God!
It's not as bad as it looks.
I'll be fine by Nationals...
You should have said something.
No sense in complaining if you're not planning on quitting.
Ok.
We got to get these feet taken care of.
No.
I need some time.
Got it.
I got it.
Come on.
Still dealing with insurance stuff?
Actually, just started.
What will they think of next?
Insurance agent in your pocket?
Actually, it's like having 2 agents in your pocket.
You must have big pockets.
You have no idea.
So here's the thing, counselor.
If you just started the process, who were you on the phone with this morning?
My ex.
Correction...
My soon-to-be-ex.
Ok.
You lied to me.
Why?
Self-conscious.
A little embarrassed.
You really know how to make a girl feel special.
Come on, Marti.
Take a look at yourself.
You're like an advertisement for a male's mid-life crisis.
When we walk down the street together, onlookers probably think I've just purchased a Porsche.
You're not dating onlookers.
You're dating me.
What's important is how you see me.
So tell me.
- Tell you what exactly?
- How do you see me?
What is it you like about me?
Why are you in this?
Is this a challenge?
You are a fascinating, occasionally maddening woman.
You have a quicksilver mind and a gigantic heart.
You love your friends to a fault and despise injustice with a white-hot intensity.
You resist authority, not because you're an anarchist, but because you're a leader by nature.
And you refuse to be bullied, and will not allow me to win an argument if you know you're right.
And you're not afraid to laugh at yourself.
And you're a slightly, slightly better guitar player than I am.
And that, Marti Perkins, is but a small sampling of the things I like about you.
Oh.
Ok.
I heard your dad's out on bail.
I'm glad to hear it.
- I bet.
- I am.
Look, I'm sorry about the other day.
I was upset, and I shot my mouth off in a bad way.
That's ok.
Look, I'm propping up my whole family right now.
I need to know I can depend on you.
Understood.
Go ahead, depend.
It's my dad.
Hey, daddy.
Everything ok at home?
I couldn't leave without saying good-bye.
Good-bye?
What are you talking about?
Sweetheart, I have made some mistakes, and I cannot make them right in prison.
And I can't...
I can't go back there.
Oh, God.
I am so sorry for letting you down.
But I am going to win back your trust someday.
Now, look.
You have to take care of your mother, and you have to take care of your sister.
They are going to need your strength right now.
You can't.
You're going to ruin us.
Please, daddy, don't.
I love you, sweet...
I love you, sweetheart.

Lewis and Nasty Kathy, I just don't get it.
Clearly, Lewis is slumming.
Yeah.
He does that.
Look at all those months he spent with you.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
They've accused him of wire fraud, bribery, and violation of the public trust.
It all started when I refinanced the mortgage, and I was able to stay afloat till last January, when they started cutting back my hours at work.
I just wanted to say thank you.
- You could have emailed.
- I could have emailed.
Then I wouldn't be able to do this.
You want to ask me out?
Yeah, I do.

- You like cocky?
- Mm-hmm.
-You like it?
Mmm.
Hey, Lewis, you've got some...
Schmutz on your face there.
Oh, it's just Kathy.
My bad.
- What do you want?
- Lots of things.
You know, peace in the Middle East, members of the Mem-Chris Cyclones out of my workout room.
But mostly, I just want to see you succeed, Lewis.
Really?
How's that?
Darwin says that you asked Nasty Kathy here to be your partner for the Push-FM dance marathon.
Trying to win that new car?
Makes sense, doesn't it?
A dance marathon is all about endurance, athleticism and dance.
It's tailor-made for a couple of collegiate cheerleaders.
For the right couple of cheerleaders.
Nice knee brace.
I'll call you later, Lewis.
You want to take care of that knee with Nationals in 2 weeks, hmm?
Why you got to be like this?
Genetics.
But the million-dollar question is why are you entering a dance marathon two weeks before Nationals?
I want the car.
Bad enough to risk injury?
Anyhow, won't you have to share it with Kathy?
Nope.
She doesn't want it.
She's doing it to help me out.
I don't know what you're not telling me, but if you're serious about winning, you need a serious partner.
What, you?
I am a winner.
'Cause I don't give up.
Ever.
Uh, I have a dance partner.
Look at this.
It reads like they already decided that he's guilty.
I mean, aren't reporters supposed to be unbiased?
Look, if it's any consolation, print is a dying medium.
Your dad make bail yet?
No.
We're having trouble getting a straight answer from this public defender we've got.
My mom thinks he's an idiot.
Your dad's using a public defender?
Yeah.
The FBI froze our assets.
We're having trouble finding a lawyer.
Anyway, let's get moving.
It'll be nice to see your dad.
You know, I was thinking it'd be nice to have dinner alone.
You know, date night.
Well, I thought we were going to do something big with your family.
Well, it's just, you know...
Dan, what aren't you telling me?
Look, my dad's a teacher in Millington.
- So?
- So his pension plan was gutted.
Now he can't retire in a year like he wanted to.
He's got to keep working.
Your dad is blaming my dad?
He'll get over it, but my brothers and I, we talked.
There's just... there's no point waving a red flag in front of a bull.
This happened because of the bad economy!
My dad didn't know this was going to happen.
He was charged with 18 counts of bribery, fraud, and violation of the public trust.
That's mean.
That's not mean.
That's the truth.
I know my dad has a good explanation.
Well, when you find out what it is, just let me know.
My whole family would love to hear it.
You know what?
I think I'll pass on dinner.
- You going to be like that?
- Oh, yeah.
Ok, then.
Suit yourself.
What's wrong with him?
He's acting like an ass.
He does that.
Ok.
What do you think?
I've got a dinner date with Julian.
Oh, my gosh.
What?
Too low-cut?
No, no.
It's fine.
I need to ask you a giant favor.
Yeah.
What?
Can you ask Julian to defend my dad, for no money?
At least not up front?
White-collar crimes aren't really his specialty.
Please.
My family is desperate.
Ok, yeah.
I'll talk to him.
Maybe he can at least give you a referral.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Smush the dress.
Smushing the dress.
Sorry.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
I didn't order this.
It's compliments of the gentleman across the way.
Marti's little law friend?
Oh.
You shouldn't try to drive a Maserati when you've only got a learner's permit.
I don't think your mom and I are going to make Nationals.
Oh, that's ok, dad.
You'll be there in spirit, hmm?
Must be a mix-up at your bank.
Your card didn't go through.
Oh, um, I think I got another one...
No, no, ok.
I got it.
I got this.
You got a good boy there.
That junker truck of mine been costing me more in repairs than it's worth.
Dad, I told you not to put any more money into that thing!
Ah.
No.
Now, that new retail job is clear up in Jonesboro.
I don't drive, I don't work.
See you later, son.
Bye, dad.
The car's for your dad, isn't it?
That's why you're doing the dance marathon.
Yeah, but that's not something you have to worry about.
You.
Any dance experience?
Seven years Ballet, Three years Capoeira, and glowing notices as the rum tum tugger in my magnet school's production of "Cats."
Look who just hit the jackpot.
Ohh.
Ahh.
Here you go.
Oh.
You're saving my life.
Nothing I had matched this dress, mom.
All right.
Try these.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm
Men are big on packaging.
Julian's going to love 'em on you.
Thanks.
Perfect.
Now, go have fun, but don't get too attached.
Well, it's just dinner.
Oh, it's never just dinner.
Not at your age.
Remember, I was you once, not all that long ago.
How much older is he than you?
I'm pre-law, not math.
Mm.
Yeah.
With age comes responsibilities.
His priorities are different than yours.
Have fun.
But manage your expectations.
What's wrong?
He just canceled.
His loss.
I'm going to go put on something scandalous, because we are going out dancing.
You are too damn pretty to waste.
I'll be back in five.
- Hey, mom?
- Yes?
I love you.

Oh, wow.
There are a lot of people from Lancer here.
Yeah, Mem-Chris, too.

Push-FM "Dance Till You Drop" Marathon!
That's right, that's right!
After 24 hours, we going to see who remains standing!
All right?
On your mark, get set...
Dance!
All right.
All right.
The rules are simple.
You get a 5-minute break once every hour.
At all other times, you must remain moving, or you get disqualified, all right?
Now, partner-swapping is allowed and a life preference for myself personally, all right?
It ain't where you start, y'all, it's where you finish!
The panel of judges are here to award points for style.
After 24 hours, the highest score amongst the couples still standing will win the big prize... a brand-new Toyota RAV4!
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, hey, does the music seem a little slow to you?
Seems a little slow to me.
All right, y'all, let's get it together for recording artist, dancer, and RB Pop sensation Ciara!

Hi.
Uh, hi yourself.
You have pretty hair.
This is Nikki.
It's my daughter.
Oh.

How did I not know you're married?
I'm legally separated.
The divorce is pending.
Don't lawyer me.
My ex had an emergency last night, and she had to drop Nikki off.
You could have told me this before we, you know, started...
Yeah, well, I tried, but your tongue was in my mouth.
I bet you crack 'em up in the courtroom, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Anyhow, now that I know, maybe the three of us grab brunch?
Not advisable, sorry.
- My therapist suggests...
- Your therapist?
My therapist suggests a six-month waiting period before introducing Nikki to any sort of girlfriend or potential girlfriend.
If this doesn't work out, you leave or we split up,
Nikki's going to be that much less emotionally open to the next woman that I bring into my life.
Already onto the next woman, are we?
Yeah, I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
It's ok.
You're looking out for your kid.
I get that.
It's attractive.
Dad?
We need more cereal.
Ok.
One second, honey.
Let me make it up to you by cooking you dinner tonight.
How does that sound?
It sounds fantastic.
Um...
I also have a favor to ask.
Again.
What's the favor?
You remember my roomie Savannah?
Her dad's in big trouble, and he needs a lawyer.
But they can't exactly pay you.
Well, if this gets me out of trouble for
- not mentioning my wife or my kid...
- absolutely.
- Then I'm in.
- Mm-hmm.
How soon can they meet?
Your husband was skimming the interest from the bonds that were intended for infrastructure projects.
The banks made so much money off the sky-high interest from the synthetic rate swap scheme, that they bribed city officials into rubber stamping all the deals.
And that, along with related crimes, is what Parker's being charged with.
Do you have any questions?
Can you get our dad out of jail?
Parker was arraigned this morning, and the judge granted bail in the amount of $50,000.
Great.
We can handle that, right?
Our accounts have been frozen, sweetheart.
They have?
Yes, Charlotte!
Haven't you been listening?
Are you thick?
For the record, that nasty comment about your mommy was made by Aunt Savannah.
- Oh, knock it off.
- Aunt Savannah!
Girls, please.
I have a severe headache.
Now, Mr. Parrish, what other options do we have?
Well, I will be working on getting you an allowance from the court.
And I will also make a motion to get the bail reduced, but there's a very good chance that the judge will not allow that.
So you're going to have to get a loan or work something out with a bail bondsman.
Well, I have tried that, but without collateral, they will not lend us a penny.
Mom, you could ask the Church.
Don't be ridiculous.
Yeah, the Angel Fund!
- Angel Fund?
- They use it to help members of the Church in trouble, you know, if someone's in danger of losing their house.
That fund is not for people like us.
We are not having mortgage trouble.
You happen to have a father who is an accused felon.
- Wrongly accused!
- Yeah.
You don't really believe that dad really took bribes.
Do you?
Of course not, honey.
Mom, you have to talk to Pastor George.
Ok?
Dad has given his life to that church.
You're on the Board of Directors.
Yeah, it's just a bail.
They'll get it back eventually.
What other moves do we have, Mr. Parrish?
Well, just let me say if you can convince your church to give you the bail money, you should jump at it.
That is, assuming you want Parker home.
Well, of course I do.
I will talk to Pastor George.

Just enough time to change them diapers, all right?
All right.
Ooh.
How's that knee holding up?
It's fine.
Hmm.
Now, maybe.
You've still got 19 hours to go.
I'm not going to bail on Lewis.
He wants that car for his dad, and I'm going to help him win it.
Yeah.
It'd be a damn shame if you had to drop out with a ruined knee.
You'd have to sit out Nationals.
Wait.
Wait.
Who's sitting out Nationals?
Her knee.
It's not so good.
Let me see.
Oh, no.
No, we... we can't push this.
We're dropping out.
- We're just dropping out.
- What about the car?
I'll just figure something else out.
Heh.
I'm...
I'm actually without a partner.
What?
!
Yeah.
Morgan punked out on me.
I was going to go home and cut my losses, but...
I'd like to help your dad.
If you'll have me, that is.
You want it.
You want to dance with her.
I just want to help out my dad.
Screw your dad.
Screw my dad?
I'm sorry, but seriously, what are you, Alice's lap dog?
- Ohh!
- No.
Look, Kathy, you...
You do not want to be talking to me like that.
If you dance with Alice, you've have maybe a 2% chance of winning that car?
And 100% chance of losing me.
You understand me?
If I want to dance with Alice, I'll dance with her.
Do you understand me?
I hope you break something.
That was mean.
Don't be over here playing innocent.
Ok?
when I was over there getting ice, you were over here working on her, winding her up.
You see me denying it?
The Madman:
Dancers back on the floor!
Look, the way I see it, you've got two options.
You can go running after Nasty Kathy.
With her gimpy knee, I'm sure she'll be easy to catch.
Or...
You can take my hand.
Now, which option do you think puts your dad behind the wheel of that RAV4?
Ugh.
You are a piece of work.
A piece of work that's going to tear up the dance floor.
Come on.
Go tell them about the partner change.
Don't want to get disqualified.
See you out there.
Oh, God.
You!
- You're fired.
- What?
Ooh.
Thank you.
So?
Have you talked to Pastor George?
Is the angel fund going to give us the bail money?
I haven't asked.
Well...
When are you going to?
Our church members read the paper, like everybody else.
How exactly am I supposed to convince them your father isn't a lying cheat?
It's a church.
I'd hope they'd take it on faith.
Why should they?
I don't.
Mom, no.
Look.
Life did not turn out for your father the way he had planned.
He always thought he was entitled to more money, better job, bigger house.
Now, don't get me wrong, sweetie.
I do love him.
But he has never been satisfied with his lot in life.
If he thought others were opening doors for him, leading him to the life he deserved, well,
I have to wonder.
What you're saying is disgusting and disloyal.
Don't you lash out at me.
I am simply trying to be honest.
We have to get dad out of jail, no matter what.
We can't give up on him.
He'd be there for us.
Wouldn't he?
Be there for us?
Give me the stupid phone.
I raised you right.
And, quite honestly, it's a real pain.
Sally, how are you?
Layne Monroe here.
Yes, I was hoping to have a few words with Pastor George.
Oh!
One minute!
Y'all got one minute to get back to the dance floor, or you are o-u-t, out!
Hey, you ready to get back out there, huh?
Yeah.
Just sitting here, scoping out the competition.
Ohh.
You ok?
Yeah.
Just should've worn more comfortable shoes.

Oh!

In the closet!
Well, my kitchen looks and smells like burnt toast.
Yes, I am making a list for the insurance claim right now.
No, I was alone.
I just got distracted, that's all.
Look, I got to go.
I'll call you back.
Bye.
Insurance Company?
Mm-hmm.
You really think your agent care that you had a girl over?
I just thought it would be simpler.
Ohh, you chose poorly.
Why is that?
See, insurance is a personal aphrodisiac of mine.
Oh, it is now.
It's a little-known quirk.
Wanda overflowed our bathtub, and this nice claims adjuster replaced her whole shoe collection.
Mmm.
It drove me absolutely crazy.
Are we still talking about insurance?
I never stop talking about insurance.
Ohh.
Duty calls.
Damn it.
Nope.
That's all you get.
Girls.
Dad.
Ohh.
Thank God.
Thank God you got me out of there.
Thank the Angel Fund.
The baby missed you.
Here, he's kicking.
I felt it.
I felt him kick.
Come on, dad.
Let's you get home.
The sooner, the better.
The Madman:
Come on, now.
Come on, now.

Oh, snap!
Bye-bye, sugar pie!

You should have said something.
No sense in complaining if you're not planning on quitting.
Ok.
We got to get these feet taken care of.
No.
I need some time.
Got it.
I got it.
Come on.
Still dealing with insurance stuff?
Actually, just started.
What will they think of next?
Insurance agent in your pocket?
Actually, it's like having 2 agents in your pocket.
You must have big pockets.
You have no idea.
So here's the thing, counselor.
If you just started the process, who were you on the phone with this morning?
My ex.
Correction...
My soon-to-be-ex.
Ok.
You lied to me.
Why?
Self-conscious.
A little embarrassed.
You really know how to make a girl feel special.
Come on, Marti.
Take a look at yourself.
You're like an advertisement for a male's mid-life crisis.
When we walk down the street together, onlookers probably think I've just purchased a Porsche.
You're not dating onlookers.
You're dating me.
What's important is how you see me.
So tell me.
- Tell you what exactly?
- How do you see me?
What is it you like about me?
Why are you in this?
Is this a challenge?
You are a fascinating, occasionally maddening woman.
You have a quicksilver mind and a gigantic heart.
You love your friends to a fault and despise injustice with a white-hot intensity.
You resist authority, not because you're an anarchist, but because you're a leader by nature.
And you refuse to be bullied, and will not allow me to win an argument if you know you're right.
And you're not afraid to laugh at yourself.
And you're a slightly, slightly better guitar player than I am.
And that, Marti Perkins, is but a small sampling of the things I like about you.
Oh.
Ok.
I heard your dad's out on bail.
I'm glad to hear it.
- I bet.
- I am.
Look, I'm sorry about the other day.
I was upset, and I shot my mouth off in a bad way.
That's ok.
Look, I'm propping up my whole family right now.
I need to know I can depend on you.
Understood.
Go ahead, depend.
It's my dad.
Hey, daddy.
Everything ok at home?
I couldn't leave without saying good-bye.
Good-bye?
What are you talking about?
Sweetheart, I have made some mistakes, and I cannot make them right in prison.
And I can't...
I can't go back there.
Oh, God.
I am so sorry for letting you down.
But I am going to win back your trust someday.
Now, look.
You have to take care of your mother, and you have to take care of your sister.
They are going to need your strength right now.
You can't.
You're going to ruin us.
Please, daddy, don't.
I love you, sweet...
I love you, sweetheart.

Lewis and Nasty Kathy, I just don't get it.
Clearly, Lewis is slumming.
Yeah.
He does that.
Look at all those months he spent with you.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
They've accused him of wire fraud, bribery, and violation of the public trust.
It all started when I refinanced the mortgage, and I was able to stay afloat till last January, when they started cutting back my hours at work.
I just wanted to say thank you.
- You could have emailed.
- I could have emailed.
Then I wouldn't be able to do this.
You want to ask me out?
Yeah, I do.

[Both grunt]
Hey, Lewis, you've got some...
Schmutz on your face there.
Oh, it's just Kathy.
[Sniffs] My bad.
- What do you want?
- Lots of things.
You know, peace in the Middle East, members of the Mem-Chris Cyclones out of my workout room.
But mostly, I just want to see you succeed, Lewis.
Really?
How's that?
Darwin says that you asked Nasty Kathy here to be your partner for the Push-FM dance marathon.
Trying to win that new car?
Makes sense, doesn't it?
A dance marathon is all about endurance, athleticism and dance.
It's tailor-made for a couple of collegiate cheerleaders.
For the right couple of cheerleaders.
Nice knee brace.
I'll call you later, Lewis.
You want to take care of that knee with Nationals in 2 weeks, hmm?
[Chuckles]
[Sighs]
Why you got to be like this?
Genetics.
But the million-dollar question is why are you entering a dance marathon two weeks before Nationals?
I want the car.
Bad enough to risk injury?
Anyhow, won't you have to share it with Kathy?
Nope.
She doesn't want it.
She's doing it to help me out.
I don't know what you're not telling me, but if you're serious about winning, you need a serious partner.
What, you?
I am a winner.
[Chuckles]
'Cause I don't give up.
Ever.
Uh, I have a dance partner.
Look at this.
It reads like they already decided that he's guilty.
I mean, aren't reporters supposed to be unbiased?
Look, if it's any consolation, print is a dying medium.
[Sighs]
Your dad make bail yet?
No.
We're having trouble getting a straight answer from this public defender we've got.
My mom thinks he's an idiot.
Your dad's using a public defender?
Yeah.
The FBI froze our assets.
We're having trouble finding a lawyer.
Anyway, let's get moving.
It'll be nice to see your dad.
You know, I was thinking it'd be nice to have dinner alone.
You know, date night.
Well, I thought we were going to do something big with your family.
Well, it's just, you know...
Dan, what aren't you telling me?
Look, my dad's a teacher in Millington.
- So?
- So his pension plan was gutted.
Now he can't retire in a year like he wanted to.
He's got to keep working.
Your dad is blaming my dad?
He'll get over it, but my brothers and I, we talked.
There's just... there's no point waving a red flag in front of a bull.
This happened because of the bad economy!
My dad didn't know this was going to happen.
He was charged with 18 counts of bribery, fraud, and violation of the public trust.
That's mean.
That's not mean.
That's the truth.
I know my dad has a good explanation.
Well, when you find out what it is, just let me know.
My whole family would love to hear it.
You know what?
I think I'll pass on dinner.
- You going to be like that?
- Oh, yeah.
Ok, then.
Suit yourself.
What's wrong with him?
He's acting like an ass.
He does that.
Ok.
What do you think?
I've got a dinner date with Julian.
Oh, my gosh.
What?
Too low-cut?
No, no.
It's fine.
I need to ask you a giant favor.
Yeah.
What?
Can you ask Julian to defend my dad, for no money?
At least not up front?
White-collar crimes aren't really his specialty.
Please.
My family is desperate.
Ok, yeah.
I'll talk to him.
Maybe he can at least give you a referral.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Smush the dress.
Smushing the dress.
Sorry. [Laughs]
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
[Indistinct chatter]
I didn't order this.
It's compliments of the gentleman across the way.
[Laughs]
Marti's little law friend?
Oh.
You shouldn't try to drive a Maserati when you've only got a learner's permit.
I don't think your mom and I are going to make Nationals.
Oh, that's ok, dad.
You'll be there in spirit, hmm?
Must be a mix-up at your bank.
Your card didn't go through.
Oh, um, I think I got another one...
No, no, ok.
I got it.
I got this.
You got a good boy there.
That junker truck of mine been costing me more in repairs than it's worth.
Dad, I told you not to put any more money into that thing!
Ah.
No.
Now, that new retail job is clear up in Jonesboro.
I don't drive, I don't work.
See you later, son.
Bye, dad.
The car's for your dad, isn't it?
That's why you're doing the dance marathon.
Yeah, but that's not something you have to worry about.
You.
Any dance experience?
Seven years Ballet, Three years Capoeira, and glowing notices as the rum tum tugger in my magnet school's production of "Cats."
[Laughs]
Look who just hit the jackpot.
Ohh.
Ahh.
Here you go.
Oh. [Chuckles] You're saving my life.
Nothing I had matched this dress, mom.
All right.
Try these.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm
Men are big on packaging.
Julian's going to love 'em on you.
Thanks.
Perfect.
Now, go have fun, but don't get too attached.
Well, it's just dinner.
Oh, it's never just dinner.
Not at your age.
Remember, I was you once, not all that long ago.
How much older is he than you?
I'm pre-law, not math.
Mm.
Yeah.
With age comes responsibilities.
His priorities are different than yours.
Have fun.
[Cell phone chimes]
But manage your expectations.
What's wrong?
He just canceled.
[Scoffs]
His loss.
I'm going to go put on something scandalous, because we are going out dancing.
You are too damn pretty to waste.
I'll be back in five.
- Hey, mom?
- Yes?

[Knock on door]
[Distant horn]
- Hi.
- Marti.
What are you doing here?
I needed to talk to you.
You got my text, right?
Yeah.
I did.
That's not why I'm here.
Listen, I want to explain.
But I can't right now.
I'm kind of busy.
[Music plays]
Man:
Today's contestants are...
You're with someone, ok.
- I got it loud and clear.
- Come on, I'm waiting!
Hi.
Uh, hi yourself.
You have pretty hair.
[Laughs]
This is Nikki.
It's my daughter.
Oh.
Uh...
How did I not know this?
How did I not know you're married?
[Scoffs]
I'm legally separated.
The divorce is pending.
[Chuckles] Don't lawyer me.
My ex had an emergency last night, and she had to drop Nikki off.
You could have told me this before we, you know, started...
Yeah, well, I tried, but your tongue was in my mouth.
[Chuckles]
I bet you crack 'em up in the courtroom, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Anyhow, now that I know, maybe the three of us grab brunch?
Not advisable, sorry.
- My therapist suggests...
- Your therapist?
My therapist suggests a six-month waiting period before introducing Nikki to any sort of girlfriend or potential girlfriend.
If this doesn't work out, you leave or we split up,
Nikki's going to be that much less emotionally open to the next woman that I bring into my life.
Already onto the next woman, are we?
Yeah, I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
It's ok.
You're looking out for your kid.
I get that.
It's attractive.
Dad?
We need more cereal.
Ok.
One second, honey.
Let me make it up to you by cooking you dinner tonight.
How does that sound?
It sounds fantastic.
Um...
I also have a favor to ask.
Again.
What's the favor?
You remember my roomie Savannah?
Her dad's in big trouble, and he needs a lawyer.
But they can't exactly pay you.
Well, if this gets me out of trouble for
- not mentioning my wife or my kid...
- absolutely.
- Then I'm in.
- Mm-hmm.
How soon can they meet?
Your husband was skimming the interest from the bonds that were intended for infrastructure projects.
The banks made so much money off the sky-high interest from the synthetic rate swap scheme, that they bribed city officials into rubber stamping all the deals.
And that, along with related crimes, is what Parker's being charged with.
Do you have any questions?
Can you get our dad out of jail?
Parker was arraigned this morning, and the judge granted bail in the amount of $50,000.
Great.
We can handle that, right?
Our accounts have been frozen, sweetheart.
They have?
Yes, Charlotte!
Haven't you been listening?
Are you thick?
[Scoffs]
For the record, that nasty comment about your mommy was made by Aunt Savannah.
- Oh, knock it off.
- Aunt Savannah!
Girls, please.
I have a severe headache.
[Sighs]
Now, Mr. Parrish, what other options do we have?
Well, I will be working on getting you an allowance from the court.
And I will also make a motion to get the bail reduced, but there's a very good chance that the judge will not allow that.
So you're going to have to get a loan or work something out with a bail bondsman.
Well, I have tried that, but without collateral, they will not lend us a penny.
Mom, you could ask the Church.
- Don't be ridiculous.
Yeah, the Angel Fund!
- Angel Fund?
- They use it to help members of the Church in trouble, you know, if someone's in danger of losing their house.
That fund is not for people like us.
We are not having mortgage trouble.
You happen to have a father who is an accused felon.
- Wrongly accused!
- Yeah.
You don't really believe that dad really took bribes.
Do you?
Of course not, honey.
Mom, you have to talk to Pastor George.
Ok?
Dad has given his life to that church.
You're on the Board of Directors.
Yeah, it's just a bail.
They'll get it back eventually.
What other moves do we have, Mr. Parrish?
Well, just let me say if you can convince your church to give you the bail money, you should jump at it.
That is, assuming you want Parker home.
Well, of course I do.
I will talk to Pastor George.

[Exhales]
Ooh.
How's that knee holding up?
It's fine.
Hmm.
Now, maybe.
You've still got 19 hours to go.
[Scoffs]
I'm not going to bail on Lewis.
He wants that car for his dad, and I'm going to help him win it.
Yeah.
It'd be a damn shame if you had to drop out with a ruined knee.
You'd have to sit out Nationals.
Wait.
Wait.
Who's sitting out Nationals?
Her knee.
It's not so good.
Let me see.
Oh, no.
No, we... we can't push this.
We're dropping out.
- We're just dropping out.
- What about the car?
I'll just figure something else out.
Heh.
I'm...
I'm actually without a partner.
What?
!
Yeah.
Morgan punked out on me.
I was going to go home and cut my losses, but...
I'd like to help your dad.
If you'll have me, that is.
You want it.
You want to dance with her.
I just want to help out my dad.
Screw your dad.
Screw my dad?
I'm sorry, but seriously, what are you, Alice's lap dog?
- Ohh!
- No.
Look, Kathy, you...
You do not want to be talking to me like that.
If you dance with Alice, you've have maybe a 2% chance of winning that car?
And 100% chance of losing me.
You understand me?
If I want to dance with Alice, I'll dance with her.
Do you understand me?
I hope you break something.
[Scoffs]
That was mean.
Don't be over here playing innocent.
Ok?
when I was over there getting ice, you were over here working on her, winding her up.
You see me denying it?
The Madman:
Dancers back on the floor!
[Laughs] Look, the way I see it, you've got two options.
You can go running after Nasty Kathy.
With her gimpy knee, I'm sure she'll be easy to catch.
Or...
You can take my hand.
Now, which option do you think puts your dad behind the wheel of that RAV4?
Ugh.
You are a piece of work.
A piece of work that's going to tear up the dance floor.
Come on.
Go tell them about the partner change.
Don't want to get disqualified.
See you out there.
[Groans]
Oh, God.
You!
- You're fired.
- What?
Ooh.
Thank you.
So?
Have you talked to Pastor George?
Is the angel fund going to give us the bail money?
I haven't asked.
Well...
When are you going to?
Our church members read the paper, like everybody else.
How exactly am I supposed to convince them your father isn't a lying cheat?
It's a church.
I'd hope they'd take it on faith.
Why should they?
I don't.
Mom, no.
Look.
Life did not turn out for your father the way he had planned.
[Scoffs]
He always thought he was entitled to more money, better job, bigger house.
Now, don't get me wrong, sweetie.
I do love him.
But he has never been satisfied with his lot in life.
If he thought others were opening doors for him, leading him to the life he deserved, well,
I have to wonder.
What you're saying is disgusting and disloyal.
Don't you lash out at me.
I am simply trying to be honest.
We have to get dad out of jail, no matter what.
We can't give up on him.
He'd be there for us.
Wouldn't he?
Be there for us?
Give me the stupid phone.
[Sighs]
I raised you right.
And, quite honestly, it's a real pain.
[Sighs]
Sally, how are you?
Layne Monroe here.
Yes, I was hoping to have a few words with Pastor George.
Oh!
[Laughs]
One minute!
Y'all got one minute to get back to the dance floor, or you are o-u-t, out!
Hey, you ready to get back out there, huh?
[Laughs] Yeah.

Yeah.

Yes, I am making a list for the insurance claim right now.
No, I was alone.
I just got distracted, that's all.
Look, I got to go.
I'll call you back.
Bye.
Insurance Company?
Mm-hmm.
[Chuckles]
You really think your agent care that you had a girl over?
I just thought it would be simpler.
Ohh, you chose poorly.
Why is that?
See, insurance is a personal aphrodisiac of mine.
Oh, it is now.
It's a little-known quirk.
Wanda overflowed our bathtub, and this nice claims adjuster replaced her whole shoe collection.
Mmm.
It drove me absolutely crazy.
Are we still talking about insurance?

You should have said something.
No sense in complaining if you're not planning on quitting.
Ok.
We got to get these feet taken care of.
No.

[Sigh]
Got it.
I got it.

So here's the thing, counselor.
If you just started the process, who were you on the phone with this morning?
My ex.
Correction...
My soon-to-be-ex.
Ok.
You lied to me.
Why?
Self-conscious.
A little embarrassed.
You really know how to make a girl feel special.
Come on, Marti.
Take a look at yourself.
You're like an advertisement for a male's mid-life crisis.
When we walk down the street together, onlookers probably think I've just purchased a Porsche.
You're not dating onlookers.
You're dating me.
What's important is how you see me.
So tell me.
- Tell you what exactly?
- How do you see me?
What is it you like about me?
Why are you in this?
Is this a challenge?
[Sighs]
You are a fascinating, occasionally maddening woman.
You have a quicksilver mind and a gigantic heart.
You love your friends to a fault and despise injustice with a white-hot intensity.
You resist authority, not because you're an anarchist, but because you're a leader by nature.
And you refuse to be bullied, and will not allow me to win an argument if you know you're right.
And you're not afraid to laugh at yourself.
And you're a slightly, slightly better guitar player than I am.
And that, Marti Perkins, is but a small sampling of the things I like about you.
Oh.
Ok.
I heard your dad's out on bail.
I'm glad to hear it.
- I bet.
- I am.
Look, I'm sorry about the other day.
I was upset, and I shot my mouth off in a bad way.
That's ok.
Look, I'm propping up my whole family right now.
I need to know I can depend on you.
Understood.
Go ahead, depend.
[Cell phone rings]
It's my dad.
Hey, daddy.
Everything ok at home?
I couldn't leave without saying good-bye.
Good-bye?
What are you talking about?
Sweetheart, I have made some mistakes, and I cannot make them right in prison.
And I can't...
I can't go back there.
Oh, God.
I am so sorry for letting you down.
But I am going to win back your trust someday.
Now, look.
You have to take care of your mother, and you have to take care of your sister.
They are going to need your strength right now.
You can't.
You're going to ruin us.
Please, daddy, don't.
I love you, sweet...
I love you, sweetheart.

Lewis and Nasty Kathy, I just don't get it.

He does that.
Look at all those months he spent with you.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
They've accused him of wire fraud, bribery, and violation of the public trust.
It all started when I refinanced the mortgage, and I was able to stay afloat till last January, when they started cutting back my hours at work.
I just wanted to say thank you.
- You could have emailed.
- I could have emailed.

- You like cocky?
- Mm-hmm.
-You like it?
Mmm.
Hey, Lewis, you've got some...
Schmutz on your face there.
Oh, it's just Kathy.
My bad.
- What do you want?
- Lots of things.
You know, peace in the Middle East, members of the Mem-Chris Cyclones out of my workout room.
But mostly, I just want to see you succeed, Lewis.
Really?
How's that?
Darwin says that you asked Nasty Kathy here to be your partner for the Push-FM dance marathon.
Trying to win that new car?
Makes sense, doesn't it?
A dance marathon is all about endurance, athleticism and dance.
It's tailor-made for a couple of collegiate cheerleaders.
For the right couple of cheerleaders.
Nice knee brace.
I'll call you later, Lewis.
You want to take care of that knee with Nationals in 2 weeks, hmm?
Why you got to be like this?
Genetics.
But the million-dollar question is why are you entering a dance marathon two weeks before Nationals?
I want the car.
Bad enough to risk injury?
Anyhow, won't you have to share it with Kathy?
Nope.
She doesn't want it.
She's doing it to help me out.
I don't know what you're not telling me, but if you're serious about winning, you need a serious partner.
What, you?
I am a winner.
'Cause I don't give up.
Ever.
Uh, I have a dance partner.
Look at this.
It reads like they already decided that he's guilty.
I mean, aren't reporters supposed to be unbiased?
Look, if it's any consolation, print is a dying medium.
Your dad make bail yet?
No.
We're having trouble getting a straight answer from this public defender we've got.
My mom thinks he's an idiot.
Your dad's using a public defender?
Yeah.
The FBI froze our assets.
We're having trouble finding a lawyer.
Anyway, let's get moving.
It'll be nice to see your dad.
You know, I was thinking it'd be nice to have dinner alone.
You know, date night.
Well, I thought we were going to do something big with your family.
Well, it's just, you know...
Dan, what aren't you telling me?
Look, my dad's a teacher in Millington.
- So?
- So his pension plan was gutted.
Now he can't retire in a year like he wanted to.
He's got to keep working.
Your dad is blaming my dad?
He'll get over it, but my brothers and I, we talked.
There's just... there's no point waving a red flag in front of a bull.
This happened because of the bad economy!
My dad didn't know this was going to happen.
He was charged with 18 counts of bribery, fraud, and violation of the public trust.
That's mean.
That's not mean.
That's the truth.
I know my dad has a good explanation.
Well, when you find out what it is, just let me know.
My whole family would love to hear it.
You know what?
I think I'll pass on dinner.
- You going to be like that?
- Oh, yeah.
Ok, then.
Suit yourself.
What's wrong with him?
He's acting like an ass.
He does that.
Ok.
What do you think?
I've got a dinner date with Julian.
Oh, my gosh.
What?
Too low-cut?
No, no.
It's fine.
I need to ask you a giant favor.
Yeah.
What?
Can you ask Julian to defend my dad, for no money?
At least not up front?
White-collar crimes aren't really his specialty.
Please.
My family is desperate.
Ok, yeah.
I'll talk to him.
Maybe he can at least give you a referral.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Smush the dress.
Smushing the dress.
Sorry.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
I didn't order this.
It's compliments of the gentleman across the way.
Marti's little law friend?
Oh.
You shouldn't try to drive a Maserati when you've only got a learner's permit.
I don't think your mom and I are going to make Nationals.
Oh, that's ok, dad.
You'll be there in spirit, hmm?
Must be a mix-up at your bank.
Your card didn't go through.
Oh, um, I think I got another one...
No, no, ok.
I got it.
I got this.
You got a good boy there.
That junker truck of mine been costing me more in repairs than it's worth.
Dad, I told you not to put any more money into that thing!
Ah.
No.
Now, that new retail job is clear up in Jonesboro.
I don't drive, I don't work.
See you later, son.
Bye, dad.
The car's for your dad, isn't it?
That's why you're doing the dance marathon.
Yeah, but that's not something you have to worry about.
You.
Any dance experience?
Seven years Ballet, Three years Capoeira, and glowing notices as the rum tum tugger in my magnet school's production of "Cats."
Look who just hit the jackpot.
Ohh.
Ahh.
Here you go.
Oh.
You're saving my life.
Nothing I had matched this dress, mom.
All right.
Try these.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm
Men are big on packaging.
Julian's going to love 'em on you.
Thanks.
Perfect.
Now, go have fun, but don't get too attached.
Well, it's just dinner.
Oh, it's never just dinner.
Not at your age.
Remember, I was you once, not all that long ago.
How much older is he than you?
I'm pre-law, not math.
Mm.
Yeah.
With age comes responsibilities.
His priorities are different than yours.
Have fun.
But manage your expectations.
What's wrong?
He just canceled.
His loss.
I'm going to go put on something scandalous, because we are going out dancing.
You are too damn pretty to waste.
I'll be back in five.
- Hey, mom?
- Yes?
I love you.
d I wanna dance... d
Oh, wow.
There are a lot of people from Lancer here.
Yeah, Mem-Chris, too.
Seems like everyone in town wants to win that car.
Ahh.
All right, victims, this is The Madman welcoming y'all to the Eleventh Annual
Push-FM "Dance Till You Drop" Marathon!
That's right, that's right!
After 24 hours, we going to see who remains standing!
All right?
On your mark, get set...
Dance!
All right.
All right.
The rules are simple.
You get a 5-minute break once every hour.
At all other times, you must remain moving, or you get disqualified, all right?
Now, partner-swapping is allowed and a life preference for myself personally, all right?
It ain't where you start, y'all, it's where you finish!
The panel of judges are here to award points for style.
After 24 hours, the highest score amongst the couples still standing will win the big prize... a brand-new Toyota RAV4!
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, hey, does the music seem a little slow to you?
Seems a little slow to me.

- Hi.
- Marti.
What are you doing here?
I needed to talk to you.
You got my text, right?
Yeah.
I did.
That's not why I'm here.
Listen, I want to explain.
But I can't right now.
I'm kind of busy.
Today's contestants are...
You're with someone, ok.
- I got it loud and clear.
- Come on, I'm waiting!
Hi.
Uh, hi yourself.
You have pretty hair.
This is Nikki.
It's my daughter.
Oh.
Uh...
How did I not know this?
How did I not know you're married?
I'm legally separated.
The divorce is pending.
Don't lawyer me.
My ex had an emergency last night, and she had to drop Nikki off.
You could have told me this before we, you know, started...
Yeah, well, I tried, but your tongue was in my mouth.
I bet you crack 'em up in the courtroom, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Anyhow, now that I know, maybe the three of us grab brunch?
Not advisable, sorry.
- My therapist suggests...
- Your therapist?
My therapist suggests a six-month waiting period before introducing Nikki to any sort of girlfriend or potential girlfriend.
If this doesn't work out, you leave or we split up,
Nikki's going to be that much less emotionally open to the next woman that I bring into my life.
Already onto the next woman, are we?
Yeah, I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
It's ok.
You're looking out for your kid.
I get that.
It's attractive.
Dad?
We need more cereal.
Ok.
One second, honey.
Let me make it up to you by cooking you dinner tonight.
How does that sound?
It sounds fantastic.
Um...
I also have a favor to ask.
Again.
What's the favor?
You remember my roomie Savannah?
Her dad's in big trouble, and he needs a lawyer.
But they can't exactly pay you.
Well, if this gets me out of trouble for
- not mentioning my wife or my kid...
- absolutely.
- Then I'm in.
- Mm-hmm.
How soon can they meet?
Your husband was skimming the interest from the bonds that were intended for infrastructure projects.
The banks made so much money off the sky-high interest from the synthetic rate swap scheme, that they bribed city officials into rubber stamping all the deals.
And that, along with related crimes, is what Parker's being charged with.
Do you have any questions?
Can you get our dad out of jail?
Parker was arraigned this morning, and the judge granted bail in the amount of $50,000.
Great.
We can handle that, right?
Our accounts have been frozen, sweetheart.
They have?
Yes, Charlotte!
Haven't you been listening?
Are you thick?
For the record, that nasty comment about your mommy was made by Aunt Savannah.
- Oh, knock it off.
- Aunt Savannah!
Girls, please.
I have a severe headache.
Now, Mr. Parrish, what other options do we have?
Well, I will be working on getting you an allowance from the court.
And I will also make a motion to get the bail reduced, but there's a very good chance that the judge will not allow that.
So you're going to have to get a loan or work something out with a bail bondsman.
Well, I have tried that, but without collateral, they will not lend us a penny.
Mom, you could ask the Church.
Don't be ridiculous.
Yeah, the Angel Fund!
- Angel Fund?
- They use it to help members of the Church in trouble, you know, if someone's in danger of losing their house.
That fund is not for people like us.
We are not having mortgage trouble.
You happen to have a father who is an accused felon.
- Wrongly accused!
- Yeah.
You don't really believe that dad really took bribes.
Do you?
Of course not, honey.
Mom, you have to talk to Pastor George.
Ok?
Dad has given his life to that church.
You're on the Board of Directors.
Yeah, it's just a bail.
They'll get it back eventually.
What other moves do we have, Mr. Parrish?
Well, just let me say if you can convince your church to give you the bail money, you should jump at it.
That is, assuming you want Parker home.
Well, of course I do.
I will talk to Pastor George.
d Crank it up d d crank it up now d d hey, hey, hey d d crank it up d d crank it up now d d crank it up d d my mama didn't raise no quitter, son d
d we ain't leavin' until we're done d d yeah, yeah d d crank it up d d crank it up now d d crank it up d d crank it up now d d now, now, now d
d all right d d crank it up!
d
Oh, hey, hey.
I'll get some ice.
All right, boys and girls, that's a five-minute break.
Just enough time to change them diapers, all right?
All right.
Ooh.
How's that knee holding up?
It's fine.
Hmm.
Now, maybe.
You've still got 19 hours to go.
I'm not going to bail on Lewis.
He wants that car for his dad, and I'm going to help him win it.
Yeah.
It'd be a damn shame if you had to drop out with a ruined knee.
You'd have to sit out Nationals.
Wait.
Wait.
Who's sitting out Nationals?
Her knee.
It's not so good.
Let me see.
Oh, no.
No, we... we can't push this.
We're dropping out.
- We're just dropping out.
- What about the car?
I'll just figure something else out.
Heh.
I'm...
I'm actually without a partner.
What?
!
Yeah.
Morgan punked out on me.
I was going to go home and cut my losses, but...
I'd like to help your dad.
If you'll have me, that is.
You want it.
You want to dance with her.
I just want to help out my dad.
Screw your dad.
Screw my dad?
I'm sorry, but seriously, what are you, Alice's lap dog?
- Ohh!
- No.
Look, Kathy, you...
You do not want to be talking to me like that.
If you dance with Alice, you've have maybe a 2% chance of winning that car?
And 100% chance of losing me.
You understand me?
If I want to dance with Alice, I'll dance with her.
Do you understand me?
I hope you break something.
That was mean.
Don't be over here playing innocent.
Ok?
when I was over there getting ice, you were over here working on her, winding her up.
You see me denying it?
The Madman:
Dancers back on the floor!
Look, the way I see it, you've got two options.
You can go running after Nasty Kathy.
With her gimpy knee, I'm sure she'll be easy to catch.
Or...
You can take my hand.
Now, which option do you think puts your dad behind the wheel of that RAV4?
Ugh.
You are a piece of work.
A piece of work that's going to tear up the dance floor.
Come on.
Go tell them about the partner change.
Don't want to get disqualified.
See you out there.
Oh, God.
You!
- You're fired.
- What?
Ooh.
Thank you.
So?
Have you talked to Pastor George?
Is the angel fund going to give us the bail money?
I haven't asked.
Well...
When are you going to?
Our church members read the paper, like everybody else.
How exactly am I supposed to convince them your father isn't a lying cheat?
It's a church.
I'd hope they'd take it on faith.
Why should they?
I don't.
Mom, no.
Look.
Life did not turn out for your father the way he had planned.
He always thought he was entitled to more money, better job, bigger house.
Now, don't get me wrong, sweetie.
I do love him.
But he has never been satisfied with his lot in life.
If he thought others were opening doors for him, leading him to the life he deserved, well,
I have to wonder.
What you're saying is disgusting and disloyal.
Don't you lash out at me.
I am simply trying to be honest.
We have to get dad out of jail, no matter what.
We can't give up on him.
He'd be there for us.
Wouldn't he?
Be there for us?
Give me the stupid phone.
I raised you right.
And, quite honestly, it's a real pain.
Sally, how are you?
Layne Monroe here.
Yes, I was hoping to have a few words with Pastor George.
Oh!
One minute!
Y'all got one minute to get back to the dance floor, or you are o-u-t, out!
Hey, you ready to get back out there, huh?
Yeah.
Just sitting here, scoping out the competition.
Ohh.
You ok?
Yeah.
Just should've worn more comfortable shoes.
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's go, let's go, let's go, people!
Ain't no rest in this particular circle of hell!

What?
You smell that?
Something burning?
Oh!
Where's the fire extinguisher?
In the closet!
Well, my kitchen looks and smells like burnt toast.
Yes, I am making a list for the insurance claim right now.
No, I was alone.
I just got distracted, that's all.
Look, I got to go.
I'll call you back.
Bye.
Insurance Company?
Mm-hmm.
You really think your agent care that you had a girl over?
I just thought it would be simpler.
Ohh, you chose poorly.
Why is that?
See, insurance is a personal aphrodisiac of mine.
Oh, it is now.
It's a little-known quirk.
Wanda overflowed our bathtub, and this nice claims adjuster replaced her whole shoe collection.
Mmm.
It drove me absolutely crazy.
Are we still talking about insurance?
I never stop talking about insurance.
Ohh.
Duty calls.
Damn it.
Nope.
That's all you get.
Girls.
Dad.
Ohh.
Thank God.
Thank God you got me out of there.
Thank the Angel Fund.
The baby missed you.
Here, he's kicking.
I felt it.
I felt him kick.
Come on, dad.
Let's you get home.
The sooner, the better.
The Madman:
Come on, now.
Come on, now.
What you got?
What y'all got?
Come on.
Oh, snap!
Bye-bye, sugar pie!
Too bad.
Y'all have to go.
3 couples left, 3 minutes!
Come on!
Hey, Raggedy Ann, Andy, hey!
Y'all got to go with that.
Come on, now.
You got to pick it up.
We so got this now.
Ok.
Ok.
Two couples, one car!
We got to do something different.
Come on, Miss Ciara.
What you think we should do, girl?
You know what?
I think we see this thing all the way out.
I think so.
Come on.
- Yeah.
- Yes!
One minute warning!
C'mon now!
d Ohh d d sing, sing, sing, sing d d everybody start to sing d d swing, swing, swing, swing d d everybody start to swing d
d Now you're singing while you swing d
- Give me a boost.
- Are you crazy?
Just do it!
Whoo!
Unh!
So, looks like we have a winner,
Couple number 273!
Come get your keys!
Oh, thank you!
Yay!
Good job, brother.
Good job.
Good job, man.
Good job, y'all.
Oh, my God!
It's not as bad as it looks.
I'll be fine by Nationals...
You should have said something.
No sense in complaining if you're not planning on quitting.
Ok.
We got to get these feet taken care of.
No.
I need some time.
Got it.
I got it.
Come on.
Still dealing with insurance stuff?
Actually, just started.
What will they think of next?
Insurance agent in your pocket?
Actually, it's like having 2 agents in your pocket.
You must have big pockets.
You have no idea.
So here's the thing, counselor.
If you just started the process, who were you on the phone with this morning?
My ex.
Correction...
My soon-to-be-ex.
Ok.
You lied to me.
Why?
Self-conscious.
A little embarrassed.
You really know how to make a girl feel special.
Come on, Marti.
Take a look at yourself.
You're like an advertisement for a male's mid-life crisis.
When we walk down the street together, onlookers probably think I've just purchased a Porsche.
You're not dating onlookers.
You're dating me.
What's important is how you see me.
So tell me.
- Tell you what exactly?
- How do you see me?
What is it you like about me?
Why are you in this?
Is this a challenge?
You are a fascinating, occasionally maddening woman.
You have a quicksilver mind and a gigantic heart.
You love your friends to a fault and despise injustice with a white-hot intensity.
You resist authority, not because you're an anarchist, but because you're a leader by nature.
And you refuse to be bullied, and will not allow me to win an argument if you know you're right.
And you're not afraid to laugh at yourself.
And you're a slightly, slightly better guitar player than I am.
And that, Marti Perkins, is but a small sampling of the things I like about you.
Oh.
Ok.
I heard your dad's out on bail.
I'm glad to hear it.
- I bet.
- I am.
Look, I'm sorry about the other day.
I was upset, and I shot my mouth off in a bad way.
That's ok.
Look, I'm propping up my whole family right now.
I need to know I can depend on you.
Understood.
Go ahead, depend.
It's my dad.
Hey, daddy.
Everything ok at home?
I couldn't leave without saying good-bye.
Good-bye?
What are you talking about?
Sweetheart, I have made some mistakes, and I cannot make them right in prison.
And I can't...
I can't go back there.
Oh, God.
I am so sorry for letting you down.
But I am going to win back your trust someday.
Now, look.
You have to take care of your mother, and you have to take care of your sister.
They are going to need your strength right now.
You can't.
You're going to ruin us.
Please, daddy, don't.
I love you, sweet...
I love you, sweetheart.
Hey, what's going on?
What happened?
d Let's dance d d put on your red shoes d d and dance the blues d
d let's dance d d to a song they're d d playin' on the radio d
d let's sway d d while color lights up your face d

Previously on "Hellcats"...
Lewis and Nasty Kathy, I just don't get it.
Clearly, Lewis is slumming.
Yeah.
He does that.
Look at all those months he spent with you.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
They've accused him of wire fraud, bribery, and violation of the public trust.
It all started when I refinanced the mortgage, and I was able to stay afloat till last January, when they started cutting back my hours at work.
I just wanted to say thank you.
- You could have emailed.
- I could have emailed.
Then I wouldn't be able to do this.
You want to ask me out?
Yeah, I do.

And cocky.
Oh, cocky?
That's ok, I like cocky.
- You like cocky?
- Mm-hmm.
-You like it?
Mmm.
Hey, Lewis, you've got some...
Schmutz on your face there.
Oh, it's just Kathy.
My bad.
- What do you want?
- Lots of things.
You know, peace in the Middle East, members of the Mem-Chris Cyclones out of my workout room.
But mostly, I just want to see you succeed, Lewis.
Really?
How's that?
Darwin says that you asked Nasty Kathy here to be your partner for the Push-FM dance marathon.
Trying to win that new car?
Makes sense, doesn't it?
A dance marathon is all about endurance, athleticism and dance.
It's tailor-made for a couple of collegiate cheerleaders.
For the right couple of cheerleaders.
Nice knee brace.
I'll call you later, Lewis.
You want to take care of that knee with Nationals in 2 weeks, hmm?
Why you got to be like this?
Genetics.
But the million-dollar question is why are you entering a dance marathon two weeks before Nationals?
I want the car.
Bad enough to risk injury?
Anyhow, won't you have to share it with Kathy?
Nope.
She doesn't want it.
She's doing it to help me out.
I don't know what you're not telling me, but if you're serious about winning, you need a serious partner.
What, you?
I am a winner.
'Cause I don't give up.
Ever.
Uh, I have a dance partner.
Look at this.
It reads like they already decided that he's guilty.
I mean, aren't reporters supposed to be unbiased?
Look, if it's any consolation, print is a dying medium.
Your dad make bail yet?
No.
We're having trouble getting a straight answer from this public defender we've got.
My mom thinks he's an idiot.
Your dad's using a public defender?
Yeah.
The FBI froze our assets.
We're having trouble finding a lawyer.
Anyway, let's get moving.
It'll be nice to see your dad.
You know, I was thinking it'd be nice to have dinner alone.
You know, date night.
Well, I thought we were going to do something big with your family.
Well, it's just, you know...
Dan, what aren't you telling me?
Look, my dad's a teacher in Millington.
- So?
- So his pension plan was gutted.
Now he can't retire in a year like he wanted to.
He's got to keep working.
Your dad is blaming my dad?
He'll get over it, but my brothers and I, we talked.
There's just... there's no point waving a red flag in front of a bull.
This happened because of the bad economy!
My dad didn't know this was going to happen.
He was charged with 18 counts of bribery, fraud, and violation of the public trust.
That's mean.
That's not mean.
That's the truth.
I know my dad has a good explanation.
Well, when you find out what it is, just let me know.
My whole family would love to hear it.
You know what?
I think I'll pass on dinner.
- You going to be like that?
- Oh, yeah.
Ok, then.
Suit yourself.
What's wrong with him?
He's acting like an ass.
He does that.
Ok.
What do you think?
I've got a dinner date with Julian.
Oh, my gosh.
What?
Too low-cut?
No, no.
It's fine.
I need to ask you a giant favor.
Yeah.
What?
Can you ask Julian to defend my dad, for no money?
At least not up front?
White-collar crimes aren't really his specialty.
Please.
My family is desperate.
Ok, yeah.
I'll talk to him.
Maybe he can at least give you a referral.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Smush the dress.
Smushing the dress.
Sorry.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
I didn't order this.
It's compliments of the gentleman across the way.
Marti's little law friend?
Oh.
You shouldn't try to drive a Maserati when you've only got a learner's permit.
I don't think your mom and I are going to make Nationals.
Oh, that's ok, dad.
You'll be there in spirit, hmm?
Must be a mix-up at your bank.
Your card didn't go through.
Oh, um, I think I got another one...
No, no, ok.
I got it.
I got this.
You got a good boy there.
That junker truck of mine been costing me more in repairs than it's worth.
Dad, I told you not to put any more money into that thing!
Ah.
No.
Now, that new retail job is clear up in Jonesboro.
I don't drive, I don't work.
See you later, son.
Bye, dad.
The car's for your dad, isn't it?
That's why you're doing the dance marathon.
Yeah, but that's not something you have to worry about.
You.
Any dance experience?
Seven years Ballet, Three years Capoeira, and glowing notices as the rum tum tugger in my magnet school's production of "Cats."
Look who just hit the jackpot.
Ohh.
Ahh.
Here you go.
Oh.
You're saving my life.
Nothing I had matched this dress, mom.
All right.
Try these.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm
Men are big on packaging.
Julian's going to love 'em on you.
Thanks.
Perfect.
Now, go have fun, but don't get too attached.
Well, it's just dinner.
Oh, it's never just dinner.
Not at your age.
Remember, I was you once, not all that long ago.
How much older is he than you?
I'm pre-law, not math.
Mm.
Yeah.
With age comes responsibilities.
His priorities are different than yours.
Have fun.
But manage your expectations.
What's wrong?
He just canceled.
His loss.
I'm going to go put on something scandalous, because we are going out dancing.
You are too damn pretty to waste.
I'll be back in five.
- Hey, mom?
- Yes?
I love you.
♪ I wanna dance... ♪
Oh, wow.
There are a lot of people from Lancer here.
Yeah, Mem-Chris, too.
Seems like everyone in town wants to win that car.
Ahh.
All right, victims, this is The Madman welcoming y'all to the Eleventh Annual
Push-FM "Dance Till You Drop" Marathon!
That's right, that's right!
After 24 hours, we going to see who remains standing!
All right?
On your mark, get set...
Dance!
All right.
All right.
The rules are simple.
You get a 5-minute break once every hour.
At all other times, you must remain moving, or you get disqualified, all right?
Now, partner-swapping is allowed and a life preference for myself personally, all right?
It ain't where you start, y'all, it's where you finish!
The panel of judges are here to award points for style.
After 24 hours, the highest score amongst the couples still standing will win the big prize... a brand-new Toyota RAV4!
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, hey, does the music seem a little slow to you?
Seems a little slow to me.
All right, y'all, let's get it together for recording artist, dancer, and RB Pop sensation Ciara!

- Hi.
- Marti.
What are you doing here?
I needed to talk to you.
You got my text, right?
Yeah.
I did.
That's not why I'm here.
Listen, I want to explain.
But I can't right now.
I'm kind of busy.
Today's contestants are...
You're with someone, ok.
- I got it loud and clear.
- Come on, I'm waiting!
Hi.
Uh, hi yourself.
You have pretty hair.
This is Nikki.
It's my daughter.
Oh.
Uh...
How did I not know this?
How did I not know you're married?
I'm legally separated.
The divorce is pending.
Don't lawyer me.
My ex had an emergency last night, and she had to drop Nikki off.
You could have told me this before we, you know, started...
Yeah, well, I tried, but your tongue was in my mouth.
I bet you crack 'em up in the courtroom, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Anyhow, now that I know, maybe the three of us grab brunch?
Not advisable, sorry.
- My therapist suggests...
- Your therapist?
My therapist suggests a six-month waiting period before introducing Nikki to any sort of girlfriend or potential girlfriend.
If this doesn't work out, you leave or we split up,
Nikki's going to be that much less emotionally open to the next woman that I bring into my life.
Already onto the next woman, are we?
Yeah, I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
It's ok.
You're looking out for your kid.
I get that.
It's attractive.
Dad?
We need more cereal.
Ok.
One second, honey.
Let me make it up to you by cooking you dinner tonight.
How does that sound?
It sounds fantastic.
Um...
I also have a favor to ask.
Again.
What's the favor?
You remember my roomie Savannah?
Her dad's in big trouble, and he needs a lawyer.
But they can't exactly pay you.
Well, if this gets me out of trouble for
- not mentioning my wife or my kid...
- absolutely.
- Then I'm in.
- Mm-hmm.
How soon can they meet?
Your husband was skimming the interest from the bonds that were intended for infrastructure projects.
The banks made so much money off the sky-high interest from the synthetic rate swap scheme, that they bribed city officials into rubber stamping all the deals.
And that, along with related crimes, is what Parker's being charged with.
Do you have any questions?
Can you get our dad out of jail?
Parker was arraigned this morning, and the judge granted bail in the amount of $50,000.
Great.
We can handle that, right?
Our accounts have been frozen, sweetheart.
They have?
Yes, Charlotte!
Haven't you been listening?
Are you thick?
For the record, that nasty comment about your mommy was made by Aunt Savannah.
- Oh, knock it off.
- Aunt Savannah!
Girls, please.
I have a severe headache.
Now, Mr. Parrish, what other options do we have?
Well, I will be working on getting you an allowance from the court.
And I will also make a motion to get the bail reduced, but there's a very good chance that the judge will not allow that.
So you're going to have to get a loan or work something out with a bail bondsman.
Well, I have tried that, but without collateral, they will not lend us a penny.
Mom, you could ask the Church.
- Don't be ridiculous.
Yeah, the Angel Fund!
- Angel Fund?
- They use it to help members of the Church in trouble, you know, if someone's in danger of losing their house.
That fund is not for people like us.
We are not having mortgage trouble.
You happen to have a father who is an accused felon.
- Wrongly accused!
- Yeah.
You don't really believe that dad really took bribes.
Do you?
Of course not, honey.
Mom, you have to talk to Pastor George.
Ok?
Dad has given his life to that church.
You're on the Board of Directors.
Yeah, it's just a bail.
They'll get it back eventually.
What other moves do we have, Mr. Parrish?
Well, just let me say if you can convince your church to give you the bail money, you should jump at it.
That is, assuming you want Parker home.
Well, of course I do.
I will talk to Pastor George.

Oh, hey, hey.
I'll get some ice.
All right, boys and girls, that's a five-minute break.
Just enough time to change them diapers, all right?
All right.
Ooh.
How's that knee holding up?
It's fine.
Hmm.
Now, maybe.
You've still got 19 hours to go.
I'm not going to bail on Lewis.
He wants that car for his dad, and I'm going to help him win it.
Yeah.
It'd be a damn shame if you had to drop out with a ruined knee.
You'd have to sit out Nationals.
Wait.
Wait.
Who's sitting out Nationals?
Her knee.
It's not so good.
Let me see.
Oh, no.
No, we... we can't push this.
We're dropping out.
- We're just dropping out.
- What about the car?
I'll just figure something else out.
Heh.
I'm...
I'm actually without a partner.
What?
!
Yeah.
Morgan punked out on me.
I was going to go home and cut my losses, but...
I'd like to help your dad.
If you'll have me, that is.
You want it.
You want to dance with her.
I just want to help out my dad.
Screw your dad.
Screw my dad?
I'm sorry, but seriously, what are you, Alice's lap dog?
- Ohh!
- No.
Look, Kathy, you...
You do not want to be talking to me like that.
If you dance with Alice, you've have maybe a 2% chance of winning that car?
And 100% chance of losing me.
You understand me?
If I want to dance with Alice, I'll dance with her.
Do you understand me?
I hope you break something.
That was mean.
Don't be over here playing innocent.
Ok?
when I was over there getting ice, you were over here working on her, winding her up.
You see me denying it?
Dancers back on the floor!
Look, the way I see it, you've got two options.
You can go running after Nasty Kathy.
With her gimpy knee, I'm sure she'll be easy to catch.
Or...
You can take my hand.
Now, which option do you think puts your dad behind the wheel of that RAV4?
Ugh.
You are a piece of work.
A piece of work that's going to tear up the dance floor.
Come on.
Go tell them about the partner change.
Don't want to get disqualified.
See you out there.
Oh, God.
You!
- You're fired.
- What?
Ooh.
Thank you.
So?
Have you talked to Pastor George?
Is the angel fund going to give us the bail money?
I haven't asked.
Well...
When are you going to?
Our church members read the paper, like everybody else.
How exactly am I supposed to convince them your father isn't a lying cheat?
It's a church.
I'd hope they'd take it on faith.
Why should they?
I don't.
Mom, no.
Look.
Life did not turn out for your father the way he had planned.
He always thought he was entitled to more money, better job, bigger house.
Now, don't get me wrong, sweetie.
I do love him.
But he has never been satisfied with his lot in life.
If he thought others were opening doors for him, leading him to the life he deserved, well,
I have to wonder.
What you're saying is disgusting and disloyal.
Don't you lash out at me.
I am simply trying to be honest.
We have to get dad out of jail, no matter what.
We can't give up on him.
He'd be there for us.
Wouldn't he?
Be there for us?
Give me the stupid phone.
I raised you right.
And, quite honestly, it's a real pain.
Sally, how are you?
Layne Monroe here.
Yes, I was hoping to have a few words with Pastor George.
Oh!
One minute!
Y'all got one minute to get back to the dance floor, or you are o-u-t, out!
Hey, you ready to get back out there, huh?
Yeah.
Just sitting here, scoping out the competition.
Ohh.
You ok?
Yeah.
Just should've worn more comfortable shoes.
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's go, let's go, let's go, people!
Ain't no rest in this particular circle of hell!

What?

Something burning?
Oh!
Where's the fire extinguisher?
In the closet!
Well, my kitchen looks and smells like burnt toast.
Yes, I am making a list for the insurance claim right now.
No, I was alone.
I just got distracted, that's all.
Look, I got to go.
I'll call you back.
Bye.
Insurance Company?
Mm-hmm.
You really think your agent care that you had a girl over?
I just thought it would be simpler.
Ohh, you chose poorly.
Why is that?
See, insurance is a personal aphrodisiac of mine.
Oh, it is now.
It's a little-known quirk.
Wanda overflowed our bathtub, and this nice claims adjuster replaced her whole shoe collection.
Mmm.
It drove me absolutely crazy.
Are we still talking about insurance?
I never stop talking about insurance.
Ohh.
Duty calls.
Damn it.
Nope.
That's all you get.
Girls.
Dad.
Ohh.
Thank God.
Thank God you got me out of there.
Thank the Angel Fund.
The baby missed you.
Here, he's kicking.
I felt it.
I felt him kick.
Come on, dad.
Let's you get home.
The sooner, the better.
Come on, now.
Come on, now.
What you got?
What y'all got?
Come on.
Oh, snap!
Bye-bye, sugar pie!
Too bad.
Y'all have to go.
3 couples left, 3 minutes!
Come on!
Hey, Raggedy Ann, Andy, hey!
Y'all got to go with that.
Come on, now.
You got to pick it up.
We so got this now.
Ok.
Ok.
Two couples, one car!
We got to do something different.
Come on, Miss Ciara.
What you think we should do, girl?
You know what?
I think we see this thing all the way out.
I think so.
Come on.
- Yeah.
- Yes!

No sense in complaining if you're not planning on quitting.
Ok.
We got to get these feet taken care of.
No.
I need some time.
Got it.
I got it.
Come on.
Still dealing with insurance stuff?
Actually, just started.
What will they think of next?
Insurance agent in your pocket?
Actually, it's like having 2 agents in your pocket.
You must have big pockets.
You have no idea.
So here's the thing, counselor.
If you just started the process, who were you on the phone with this morning?
My ex.
Correction...
My soon-to-be-ex.
Ok.
You lied to me.
Why?
Self-conscious.
A little embarrassed.
You really know how to make a girl feel special.
Come on, Marti.
Take a look at yourself.
You're like an advertisement for a male's mid-life crisis.
When we walk down the street together, onlookers probably think I've just purchased a Porsche.
You're not dating onlookers.
You're dating me.
What's important is how you see me.
So tell me.
- Tell you what exactly?
- How do you see me?
What is it you like about me?
Why are you in this?
Is this a challenge?
You are a fascinating, occasionally maddening woman.
You have a quicksilver mind and a gigantic heart.
You love your friends to a fault and despise injustice with a white-hot intensity.
You resist authority, not because you're an anarchist, but because you're a leader by nature.
And you refuse to be bullied, and will not allow me to win an argument if you know you're right.
And you're not afraid to laugh at yourself.
And you're a slightly, slightly better guitar player than I am.
And that, Marti Perkins, is but a small sampling of the things I like about you.
Oh.
Ok.
I heard your dad's out on bail.
I'm glad to hear it.
- I bet.
- I am.
Look, I'm sorry about the other day.
I was upset, and I shot my mouth off in a bad way.
That's ok.
Look, I'm propping up my whole family right now.
I need to know I can depend on you.
Understood.
Go ahead, depend.
It's my dad.
Hey, daddy.
Everything ok at home?
I couldn't leave without saying good-bye.
Good-bye?
What are you talking about?
Sweetheart, I have made some mistakes, and I cannot make them right in prison.
And I can't...
I can't go back there.
Oh, God.
I am so sorry for letting you down.
But I am going to win back your trust someday.
Now, look.
You have to take care of your mother, and you have to take care of your sister.
They are going to need your strength right now.
You can't.
You're going to ruin us.
Please, daddy, don't.
I love you, sweet...
I love you, sweetheart.

There's a moment when you realize that something's changed
And all the bits and pieces start to fit
It's so fab!
When nothing that you know will ever be the same
Ring the bell
That's my cue
Gotta try something new
Gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
Yeah
Listen up, fellas.
Now there's nothing in this universe to hold me back
Bye, Gab.
No endless night can keep me in the dark
And I just might give my dear old dad a heart attack
- But he'll live
- He'll live
- And he'll see
- He'll see
What his girl is meant to be
Gonna shine
And leave the past behind
Gonna try to fly so high
Gonna climb and make the prize all mine
Then I'll write my name in letters across the sky
I'm gonna shine
And if my present luminescent state is second rate
I'll turn it up a notch past nine
And watch the world go blind
Got a diva dazzle that you just can't touch
Like an angel in Armani I'm too fabulous
They'll be lining up for blocks Once I bop to the top
With a poochie in my Gucci I just can't be stopped
I'm gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
There she is.
Wonderful!
Hi!
- I know, I know.
- I loved it.
Excuse us.
There's our little superstar!
Princess, you had better watch out for law enforcement.
They are gonna come after you for stealing the show!
Honey, on a scale of one to 10, you were an entirely different scale.
And you know my aversion to scales.
Sharpay!
Yes, I know.
And thank you.
We'd like to introduce you to Jerry Taylor.
He's a good friend of our family, visiting for the week.
May I just say how wonderful you were?
As many times as you'd like!
I really see a unique talent here.
I mean, a true gift.
And your kind, true words are a gift as well.
It was so nice to meet you.
But if you'll excuse me, my friends have been waiting.
I'm a casting agent from New York.
And will keep waiting until I tell you how much I love your suit.
I'm about to start casting for a new musical on Broadway.
Broadway?
As in "Broadway?"
Yeah.
And I think that there is a perfect part.
I would be more than happy to arrange an audition if you happen to find yourself in the Big Apple any time soon.
That would be...
I would be...
It would be, like...
The show is gonna star Amber Lee Adams.
- No.
- Yeah.
Stop.
Seriously, stop.
Who's Amber Lee Adams?
She's only the most amazing performer ever!
We have so much in common.
I won't keep you.
It was so nice to meet you, Sharpay.
Congratulations again.
And, who knows, maybe we'll see you in New York.
Okay?
- Congrats!
- Bye.
Toodles!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
- No!
- No?
I don't understand!
What language is that?
No, I don't think going to New York is a good idea.
See, there you go, believing everything you think.
Do you really believe you're ready for such a monumental step?
Daddy, the main reason I buy such expensive shoes is to take monumental steps.
Sweetheart, when you graduated from high school almost a year ago, do you remember what you said to me?
"How come no one makes a cap and gown in hot pink?"
No.
"How come you get a car and driver and I don't?"
- No.
- "Good luck finding anyone
"to fill the talent-less void of boring and unattractive
"that will exist in these hallways
- "once I graduate"?
- No.
Yes, but you also said that you needed a year to find yourself, to figure out what came next in your life.
That year's almost up, and you haven't found anything.
It's a small town.
I mean, there's only so many places to look.
Besides, I did find something.
A show I wanna be in.
This is more than just a show.
You're talking about going it alone in the big city.
Right!
To star on Broadway with Amber Lee Adams.
Could you really deny the world that opportunity?
I'm sorry, princess.
But nothing you've shown me convinces me you're ready for something like this.
Okay, ladies.
Team Sharpay.
New York.
Daddy says I'm not ready for this.
So, what does that mean?
You pout, throw a tantrum, and he buys you a new Burberry bag to make you feel better?
That's good, but no.
It means we show him I'm determined.
And when I make up my mind...
And no one is better with make-up.
...my mind looks amazing.
Okay, here's your assignments.
I texted Bridget, who e-mailed Constance, who tweeted Bethany, who IM'ed Jenn, who Facebooked Kara, who has an ex-friend who she caught with her boyfriend, who she then dumped, so now Kara's her friend again,
who knows of a New York apartment available in a luxury townhouse.
That is, like, the best house you can get in terms of towns.
- Sounds perfect.
- It gets better.
- It can't.
- But it does.
It is equal distance from both Chanel and wicked.
Okay.
Now, on to travel plans.
That's right.
Albuquerque to New York.
One adult and one dog.
Excuse me?
Coach?
Hi, I'm calling for Sharpay Evans.
Mr. Taylor wanted to set up an audition with her for a new musical.
Two weeks from today is perfect.
Now, new outfits.
And this would be for opening night.
The beading actually doubles the reflection of paparazzi flashbulbs!
You can wear anything.
You should have your own reality show called I Can Wear Anything.
Where you wear anything.
All right.
I'm ready to show Daddy what we've accomplished.
Ladies, and people I don't know,
New York is calling.
And this is one call that is not going to voice-mail.
So, by way of review, this is my shoe closet, that is my bedroom, these are my new clothes and where I'll wear them, and then I'm a star!
See?
I'm just not totally convinced.
Daddy, you said I haven't shown you anything to let you know I'm ready for this.
But, look, I took matters into my own hands, and without even chipping my manicure.
Sweetheart, it's not as easy as putting pictures on boards.
But I've worked everything out!
And used this pointer.
- I don't know...
- Please, Daddy.
Alone, in New York?
My dear college friend, Michelle, has a son that goes to NYU.
I've met him.
He's a very nice boy.
I could ask her to make sure that he keeps his eye on you.
Are you sure you're ready to take this on?
I know I can do this.
I know it like I know purple washes me out and that my eyes are the exact same distance apart to be a supermodel.
What I don't know is whether you believe in me.
Mom seems to.
Okay, you have my blessing.
Thank you, Daddy!
I'll call my friend Michelle and have her talk to her son.
Thanks, Mom.
There's just one condition.
Fine.
I love a good conditioner.
You have one month.
I'll fly you to New York, I'll pay for your penthouse, but you have to get yourself in that show and prove to me you can take care of yourself.
One month.
- Deal?
- So deal!
But if it doesn't work out, you come back here and work for me.
At the country club.
- Work?
- A job.
That's the deal.
Prove yourself, or come back in a month and work for me.
Fine.
Prove myself it is!
Look!
Look, Boi, look!
- Sharpay?
- In the flesh and pastels!
- We've been awaiting your arrival.
- Then the wait's over!
We spoke on the phone.
I'm Marjorie Grande, the manager for the building.
My pleasure.
Please, follow me to the penthouse.
Ooh!
I hope this is to your liking.
No.
It's to my loving!
Boi, you've gotta see this.
- That's a dog.
- Try to get him to believe that.
I'm sorry.
There are no dogs in the building.
Sure there are.
See?
The members of the co-op board have a strict no-dog policy.
Well...
My father heads our country club board, so I'm sure that gives me some kind of board immunity.
Miss Sharpay, this building is pleased to have you.
This dog...
Not so pleased.
Miss Grande, Ma'am.
If he goes, I go.
What are you doing?
Filming you.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
Do you always just film totally stunning people on the street that you don't know?
Only when I think the subject is interesting.
And you look baffled and scared and really pink.
So, yeah, interesting.
Are you paparazzi?
I'm a film student at NYU, working on a short film.
The assignment is to capture one unique New York story.
Maybe you're it.
So, you decided to film me without my permission, just for a school assignment?
- Yep.
- How dare you!
And my left side is better for close-ups.
I'm Peyton.
Sharpay Evans.
Actress, heiress, soon to be Broadway legend.
- Wait!
- About 105,
- but it's really not polite to ask.
- No...
I should know my own weight, okay?
No, I'm Peyton Leverett.
Our moms went to college together.
This is crazy!
I was on my way up to your apartment to make sure you were okay.
And here you are.
Right, they told me to expect you.
Well, glad we could finally meet.
- Oh, and this is Boi.
- Well, nice to meet you, Boi.
So, why are you out here?
Is everything okay?
Not really.
When I rented this apartment online, it never said they don't allow dogs.
And now they won't let us live here.
Yeah, well, it's their loss!
- Do you have someplace else to go?
- Okay, it's my loss and their loss!
Actually, the only place I have to go is home.
And trust me, that is not an option!
Listen, there's an empty studio in my building, if you're interested.
I'm friends with the building manager.
I'm sure I can make a call.
And...
Well, I'm sure I can make a call and arrange something.
Maybe get you to see it.
Well, since I don't seem to have any other options.
Bellman!
Oh, yeah, right.
Seriously?
Careful with those!
This is all I have to get by on until the truck arrives with the bulk of my things.
Oh!
That's good.
Okay, now, go outside, and then come back in and give me even more of that it's-the-end-of-the-world look.
Okay?
- Hey, Peyton.
- Hey, Peyton!
- What's up?
- Off to acting class.
"Maggie, the cat is alive.
I'm alive!"
Singing lesson.
Cool, guys.
Okay.
Hey, this is Sharpay and Boi.
Hi, Sharpay.
Hi, Boi!
Anyways, gotta go.
See ya, Peyton.
- Nice meeting you, Sharpay.
- Later, guys.
Okay.
Really, you're going to love this place.
Okay?
Up you go.
Sorry.
It's a pre-war building.
And during the war, they didn't fight for an elevator?
Listen, the building has two things going for it.
It's got something available, and I live here.
Fine.
But if I break a heel, or a sweat, you're responsible.
Get my bags.
See?
That wasn't so bad.
Yeah.
Down the hall.
The one with the police tape and chalk outline.
Really?
Kidding.
- You said this was a studio.
- It is.
No way!
MGM was a studio!
This?
This is a roach motel with no room service.
Yeah, a studio apartment.
Sure, from certain angles, it's a bit small.
A two-karat engagement ring is a bit small!
This is a doll house!
- So what do you think?
- Forget it!
I'd need an entirely separate apartment just for my lipsticks.
And where am I supposed to sleep?
- What is that?
- It's your bed.
That is not a bed.
It's a closet with a tongue.
You can't be serious!
- There is one really good thing about it.
- Yeah, sure.
See?
This is my place!
Looking better, huh?
Am I missing something?
Oh, right.
Space!
Luxury!
Maid service!
Let me guess.
You're used to being spoiled.
I'm not used to it.
I just expect it.
You know, half this building is filled with performers who came here with the same ambitions you did.
What makes you so much better than them?
Money, breeding, talent, great hair, perfect jaw line, chic taste.
How much time do you have?
All right, fine.
I tried to help you out like my mom asked, but whatever.
I'll find someone else to film.
The only problem is if I call my father and tell him how I messed up on the other apartment and how I have nowhere to go but here, and I ask for his help, he'll make me come home and...
Work!
- So?
- So?
Then I'll never get my big break.
Oh, and promise you won't call your mother and tell her about this, because then she'll call my mom who will tell my dad, and I don't think he really believes I can make this happen.
He only gave me one month to prove it.
Well, then you've got one month to prove him wrong.
Why did I do this?
I want my canopy bed and my housekeeper.
And a shower that doesn't share a room with a kitchen.
- Come on.
- Where to?
- Do you trust me?
- You suggested this place.
Yeah.
Point taken.
Come anyway.
Come on.
I hope you're taking me to a better apartment than what you just showed me.
Because let me tell you, if that's it?
No way!
Absolutely no!
Just come on.
Just don't ask any questions.
I need luxury!
Are you kidding me?
That was like a green, dark hole that I never wanna be in ever again.
All right, here you go.
Butchy!
- Come on...
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.
Come on.
- Why are we here?
All right, all right.
Now, you're gonna have to close your eyes.
- Close my eyes?
- Yeah, just close your eyes.
- Why?
- Because!
Just do it.
All right, now.
Keep them closed.
- Well, what if I hit into something?
- You won't.
I got you.
All right, all right.
Keep them closed.
All right.
- All right, you got them closed?
- Yes, I do.
All right, all right.
Perfect.
All right.
Now, stay here, keep them closed.
Keep them closed.
All righty.
Keep them closed.
All right.
Open them.
Hit it, Butchy!
Wow.
I know.
When I left Indiana to go to school here, I didn't know a soul either, and I was just as overwhelmed as you.
But I had two things, my dream and my camera.
And look at me now.
You still only have your dream and your camera.
Yes, but I met you, didn't I?
So, something's working out.
Well, whenever people meet me, things get better.
Look, you just have to adapt to your surroundings.
And remember that for now this is all just temporary.
Right.
Like prom dresses and first boyfriends.
Look, anything you have to do will be worth it to get your dream.
Okay.
I'm gonna meet with that casting director, get the part,
- be a star and have a palace!
- There you go.
That's the self-indulgent, self-entitled, optimistic pink hurricane
I've been seeing through my lens.
And I like how perceptive you are.
Okay, New York.
Bring it on.
I used to think maybe you loved me
Now, baby, I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day When you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox Gotta hold myself down
"Cause I just can't wait till you write me You're coming around
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
- And don't it feel good!
- Hey!
All right now And don't it feel good!
Hey!
All right now, yeah
Hi!
Turn it off.
Turn it off!
Just waiting foryou
Just waiting for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day
No, no, no
What?
I want you to stay
I'm walking on sunshine
- And don't it feel good!
- Hey!
All right now And don't it feel good!
Oh, yeah!
Looking good.
So pink.
You're good.
- Do you wanna try some?
- No, I don't want any!
Lay down.
Lay down.
Night, Boi!
Boi?
Get help!
- Knock, knock.
- Come in!
Wow!
And wow.
Hey, are you on your way to meet with the casting director?
No, I'm on my way to change theater history.
You think this is a good outfit for changing history?
Perfect!
Mind if I tag along and film?
Not that you could ever mind me, right?
I think you should.
After all, not many people can say they were there to film the creation of a legend.
Sharpay!
You made it after all!
Destiny called, and I get great reception!
Well, your timing is perfect.
What's tomorrow like for you?
The first day of the rest of my fame.
Well, all right.
I'll set up your audition for 3:00.
I'll e-mail you the musical number that we'd like you to prepare.
And could you make sure that he's well-groomed and, you know, takes care of any business beforehand.
- What?
- What?
- He?
- Yes.
- Him?
- Him.
- He?
- Yes!
Wait, what?
It's your dog that we want to audition.
He was amazing!
Oh.
What?
I mean...
I sent you all the information in response to your e-mail.
I mean, didn't the title of the musical give you any indication?
A Girl's Best Friend?
A Girl's Best Friend!
And I'm here for the girl!
You're here for the girl?
Well, I'm never the best friend!
Oh, no.
No, no.
We wanted Boi.
As the girl?
No, as the best friend.
Wait, wait.
You wanted Boi as the best friend of the girl?
Not me as the girl with the best friend?
Exactly.
Oh, Sharpay, I am so sorry for the confusion.
If you don't want Boi to audition, I would totally understand.
Sharpay.
Sharpay!
Hey, stop.
Hey, don't touch the car!
Look, slow down.
Even New Yorkers can't keep up with you.
It's not even me they wanted!
Well, to be fair, the role is for a dog.
If they wanted you, I could understand you being upset.
Why did I come all this way?
Leave my friends, family, a dry, self-hydrating climate?
To follow your dream!
Or at least that's what I thought.
Nothing is turning out the way I planned it!
Plan A. Live in a penthouse and star on Broadway.
Plan B...
Don't have a plan B!
What do I tell my father now?
That you came to a very special city determined to be someone very special, which you are.
Oh, I'm not so special.
I'm just like everyone else.
Maybe a little better.
Look at it this way.
Boi is your dog, and he has an opportunity, so be happy for him.
You're right.
I'm being, you know, what's the word?
When you do something for yourself even though it's not so good for other people?
- Selfish?
- No!
Oh, yeah.
Look, Sharpay, you can't give up.
Okay?
And, anyway, you're officially the star of my film.
I am?
Yeah, you are.
Oh.
So now it's all about you?
Only because I need you here.
Fine.
I'll star in your movie.
Okay.
Good, good!
Okay, change of strategy.
I didn't know you had a strategy, but I like the way you think.
If Boi becomes a success, everyone will see me as well.
After all, I am his entourage.
I am the one who's holding his leash.
His fame will ultimately lead to my fame.
That's what I came here for, right?
Still a little selfish, but heading in the right direction.
We're gonna do this.
It's like I tell the housekeepers.
If you can't see the bright side, polish the dull side.
Yeah, not quite what I was talking...
They want Boi to audition?
It's Boi they will get!
when a sign ofthe times is the times are extremely tough
When you look at the world and the world that you see is
Yes, rough
When you feel like a long lost pup
And you need some cheering up
Sit back, relax and watch us do our stuff
Two, three, four
We're gonna sit and shake your hand That's how it starts
We're gonna nose our nosy way into your hearts
We'll sing and bark In two-part harmony
You're gonna love us That's our guarantee
We'll bow together on the count of three
Me and my Boi My Boi and me
We make the perfect pair
We've got that savoir-faire
Me and my Boi
Me and my Boi
My Boi and me
Wait!
That's the best audition I've ever seen!
I'm Gill Samms, the director.
Neal Roberts, writer.
That was amazing!
Chills.
Feel my hand...
I won't feel your hand, but I believe you.
I won't feel your hand either, but I believe you, too.
That is one special dog.
We've done special here.
Special has been done, people!
Boi was meant for Broadway.
We both were.
So, when do we start?
Well, there's one more waiting.
One more!
One more, people!
Could you take a seat in the front row, please?
There.
Now.
Roger Elliston
the third.
And his dog, Countess.
FYI, I'm Roger.
As you can see by our extensive resume, hand-printed on carbonless, environmental-friendly rice paper,
Countess has numerous major Broadway credits under her paws, including The Collar Purple Three Puppy Opera, and the original Broadway cast production of A Wagging Tail of Two Cities, a musical opera in German.
Major pedigree.
I'm impressed.
This is us impressed.
Plus, she can bark a high C with sustained vibrato.
Sure, but only dogs can hear it.
All right.
Let's see what Countess can do.

That's the best audition I've ever seen!
- Amazing!
I weeped!
- Wept.
I wept!
- I wept!
- And not just regular weeping.
Theater weeping!
Amber Lee, what do you think?
Yes.
Amber Lee, thoughts?
Wow...
We are so meant to be BFFs!
Wow! "Wow" is a word, right?
Right.
Wow!
I just hope that the palpable chemistry surging between you and I right now like nuclear fusion won't in any way influence your decision towards our clearly superior audition.
How old are you?
Twelve.
I think I'm good.
And you, also!
Your dog...
Wow!
Wow.
I know, right?
He's just saying hi.
Sharpay Evans of the New Mexico Evans.
I'm a mega fan.
Oh, you are not!
So am!
I am gonna tweet about you right now.
Shut up!
I follow your tweets.
She did!
She tweeted!
Okay, I don't know how we're gonna decide.
You're amazing!
All this and a grade school diploma.
And you, amazing!
Wow.
I would be excited to work with either one of you and your dogs.
And can I just say, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Because Broadway...
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, real people are watching.
- Wow.
- Me, too.
I am just so excited to be performing on the Great White Way!
Not that I don't love all colors.
Well, I know both these talented dogs want to work with you.
But only one can be in the show.
- How are we gonna decide?
- Wait.
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals?
Wait!
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals!
That way I could see which one I work best with.
- That sounds like a solution.
- We have a solution, people!
Can I just say how totally great I think you are?
You do, and I'll never wash my ears again.
You know what I think?
Well, of course you don't because I just thought of it, but I think they loved you!
I like the way you think!
And you're such a good singer.
And I would know.
- My album went triple platinum.
- Well, I've done quite a bit of theater.
It totally shows.
Listen, I'm gonna have my assistant give you my phone number.
If there's anything that you need, you just let me know, okay?
We girls gotta stick together, right?
- Here.
- Wow.
I mean, this is actually your number!
It looks like any ordinary number, but it's not.
It's yours!
- Oh, and, hey, may the best dog win!
- Thanks!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Can you believe it?
You were great!
Boi was great.
This new strategy just might work.
- Amber Lee really likes you, too.
- Is she awesome or what?
She inspires me.
There.
I said it.
Quelle inspired.
We are so gonna get that part.
- How do you know?
- Easy.
I don't do rejection.
Sharpay!
I just wanted to wish you both luck.
Oh!
That's so nice of you.
And suggest that you give up now, while you still have your dignity.
Distant though it already might be.
Sorry, which Smurf are you again?
True, you have talent.
But you lack both the experience and the finesse to ever achieve the Holy Grail of possibility.
- Yeah, but Boi is cuter.
- Countess is a theatrical ninja.
I'm sorry.
For a minute there you just bored me to death.
I have a foolproof strategy of getting what I want.
See it, want it, have a fit, get it.
- Yeah, well, this playdate's over.
- I hope you enjoy rejection.
- We're gonna get that part.
- We're gonna destroy you.
- Bring it on.
- Oh, it's brought.
All right, Boi.
This foot.
That foot.
Good boy!
Yeah!
Okay, let's try our next one.
Stay.
Catch your tail.
Catch your tail!
Good!
Yeah, good.
Sit.
Stay.
We are so going to take them on.
I'm not gonna let some hobbit get in my way.
And, look.
All Boi can do is think about how horrible that other little mangy dog was.
If you want success so badly, then you will get it.
All you need is one shot to make it happen.
Yeah, and this is my shot.
It's like my grandmother says.
"God only got one book published,
"and look how well it did for him."
Doing this is all I've ever dreamed about, especially since I already have everything else.
Well, there's still humility.
What's wrong with being confident?
Confidence is when you know you're good.
Arrogance is when you think others know you're good.
Well, I want everyone to know I'm as good as I think everyone thinks I am without them knowing I know they think it.
- And do you have to film everything?
- Yep, 'cause this is my shot.
If my professor loves my film, he talks about it.
Then there's a buzz, then it gets in a festival, then it gets distribution, then I'm signing a studio deal, then I'm getting an Oscar.
I always knew I wanted to be an actress the first time I produced and performed the entire production of Snow white.
Full dance, musical numbers, handmade costumes.
I made my brother play all the dwarfs.
Everyone in that pre-school worshipped me.
I just want to wake up every morning and be onstage.
Good morning!
Good morning, everyone.
- And welcome to the first rehearsal...
- Of the new Broadway musical.
A Girl's Best Friend!
And you are all amazing.
- No, you are!
- Him or me?
- You!
- No, you!
Me?
Okay!
And heading our superb cast, we are thrilled to welcome one of the biggest stars around,
Amber Lee Adams!
Oh, stop!
- Yes!
- Guys, come on.
Can I just say that this, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, people can see if you write your lines on your hands!
All right.
Let's rehearse.
I want everybody downstairs with piano, rehearsing the music for the opening number.
Amber Lee and Judith,
I want you onstage so we can block that first scene.
- Let's go!
- Let's go, people!
All right.
Let's start with Boi.
Let's go!
What a perfect goodbye party.
Thank you, Mom!
I can't believe my little girl is going out into the world on her own for the first time.
I have to, Mom.
And who knows, maybe I'll find fame and fortune!
Actually, reverse that.
- Why is that funny?
- Well...
Because you'd rather have the...
I'll explain later.
Just keep going.
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Pick it up!
Go, go!
A star is about to be born!
Shelby!
Oh!
What's in this envelope?
This very wet envelope.
- Again, I don't get that.
- Keep going.
Gasp!
Actually, that's a stage direction.
You gasp, you don't say "gasp."
Simple mistake.
Keep going.
Shelby!
Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
Oh, Shelby.
This is the first time we'll be apart.
I wish I could just pack you up in a widdle doggie bag.
Okay.
Let's get Countess in there and continue.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Shelby and I will both be here when you get back.
You're killing me.
Oh!
That is adorable!
You're right, Shelby!
Why not go with me?
Any place that doesn't want you, I don't wanna be.
Let's see what New York has in store for us together!
Good.
Let's talk about the scene a bit, and we'll do it again.
And both dogs, great work!
Shelby!
Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
What's going on?
The dog.
What is this?
Somebody, please.
The dog is licking me.
All right, all right.
Get me the other dog!
Sorry.
What can you do?
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go, go!
- Why is she twirling?
- What is she doing?
- Gill?
- Roger!
Figure out what's going on with the dog.
It's not helping me.
- Not helping, people!
- Meanwhile, get the other dog!
Sorry.
What can you do?
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go!
Oh, hey!
How is this helping?
Really.
Am I the only one bothered by this?
Gill?
Okay, everybody, that's 10!
I'll admit you're good.
But we're better.
Give up!
Give up?
Not until there's a Broadway marquee with a picture of my dog so big you can walk by and smell his puppy breath!
I have to take the dogs for a nap.
Union rules.
Thank you.
- You break first.
- No, you break first.
Oh!
- Pretty cute, huh?
- Yeah!
Yes, they are!
I just wanted to tell you something.
This is my show.
I'm America's sweetheart.
They're paying to see me, not you two over-bred fur balls.
So, until I can figure out a way to get rid of you, you better watch your step, otherwise you'll find out the real meaning of going home in a doggie bag.
This film is cutting together really well.
Do I look amazing?
- The camera loves you.
- I know!
Oh, no!
My dad's video-chatting me.
He thinks I live in a penthouse.
I can't let him see that I live in a tiny studio in a filthy tenement.
With a boy in my room!
A boy, by the way, that has no money, and lives in a tinier studio, and who, apparently, has never heard of the word "maid-service"!
No offense.
What of that could possibly offend me?
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
I don't know.
Hyperventilating!
- What do I do?
What do I do?
- Come on.
Come on.
Hurry!
- All right, scoot over.
Okay, go, go.
- Okay, I gotta get this.
Stop!
Hi, Daddy!
Hey, princess!
How's my little girl?
Overpaying for everything and yelling at total strangers.
You're practically a native.
Hey, where are you?
That view is spectacular.
Well, there's hardly a penthouse in the city that doesn't have a spectacular view!
So, you the toast of Broadway?
Daddy, you know how I feel about carb references.
Just a little concerned, sweetie.
The last time no one's heard from you for this long was when you found out your gold card wasn't actually made of gold.
Well, I've been busy with rehearsals.
Outstanding!
You got into the show?
Well, it doesn't quite work like that.
It's complicated.
But I know it's gonna work out.
Sharpay, is there something you're not telling me?
You remember the deal, right?
If things aren't working out...
I know, I know.
I have one month to get in the show, and then...
Two weeks, sweetie.
You have two weeks left.
You're sure everything's okay?
It's fine, Daddy.
Well, okay.
We miss you, angel.
Miss you, too.
I love you!
Boi has to get that role.
I can't go home.
Not as a failure.
I need some sort of subtle, visibly crushing advantage over Roger.
Look, why not just trust Boi is talented, that you've trained him well,
- and let fate take it from there.
- Fate?
Fate gave a girl in my graduating class one long eyebrow.
I can't trust fate.
Some matters you just have to take into your own hands.
What do you mean you forgot my bottled water?
Well, I was going to get those magazines that you said you wanted from across town, and I got hit by a bike messenger.
So I went to the hospital for, like, just one second to get these stitches.
And meanwhile, I had no water!
I will get it for you right now.
Now I've had to drink tap!
- I am so sorry.
- "I am so sorry."
- I will do better.
- Forget it, okay?
Aside from catching some shade from the shadow cast by your madam's apple, you're of no use to me.
You're... fired!
God!
Amber Lee?
Oh, wow!
You look so cute, Sharpie!
- Sharpay.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
So, tell me, what's on your mind?
I just saw your assistant leave in tears.
She's not my assistant.
She quit.
No wonder she was crying.
Yeah, I don't think she even really cared.
Next time I should probably just hire a best friend instead.
Wait!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
What are you thinking that I should be thinking?
I could help you out until you replace her.
That is what I was thinking about thinking.
Of course this can't, in any way, affect your decision of which dog gets the starring role.
Oh, it won't.
I couldn't live with myself if I thought I did anything unfair.
You have my word.
Hey, I know!
How about dinner?
- That sounds awesome!
- Right?
Get me a reservation for two at someplace fantastic.
Then call my agent, have her meet me.
Right.
Sure.
Oh.
I won't forget this.
And I promise, it won't be because you're helping me if I happen to take a little extra liking to Girl.
- Boi.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
Oh, and can you take my mic down to the sound guy
- and tell him the wire hurts my scalp.
- Okay.
You're the best.
Amber Lee says the wire is hurting her scalp.
Personally, I think she's using the wrong shampoo, but she's the star, and you know, I don't wanna say anything.
You're hot.
Excuse me?
You're hot.
Okay.
Even though theater lighting highlights my natural skin tones, thank you for noticing, that's a little rude, don't you think?
No.
Your mic's hot.
It means it's on.
You see that little switch.
When it's flipped over like that, it means it's on and it's going through the entire theater.
Well, you could have led with that part, thank you.
Amber Lee's got a great scalp!
You're hot.
Then she asked me to help her out after her assistant quit.
And after I suggested it.
Are you sure this is wise?
I'm sorry.
Let me re-phrase that.
This isn't wise.
It's perfect.
Amber Lee will see that she and I are exactly alike, we'll become BFFs, she'll make sure Boi gets the role, then his fame becomes my fame!
I mean, this is the advantage I've been waiting for!
Isn't it more like taking advantage?
And my father thought I couldn't do this in a month.
It's turning out better than I imagined.
Hello?
Sure.
Be right over.
Hello?
Oh, thank goodness.
In here, quickly.
I just...
I can't reach that.
Can't reach it?
Okay, it was a little bit of a test.
Only a true friend would come all the way down here at this hour and help me with something like that.
- So, I passed?
- Yes.
- But, seriously, the purse.
- Okay.
Thank you.
All right, here's your bag.
Here's your other bag.
Oh, and don't forget your photo shoot.
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
You must be at that photo shoot to make sure I look as fabulous as you always do.
- Are you serious?
- Serious?
You're now also my stylist.
You have to tell me all your secrets.
Okay, gotta go.
"Life is so strange.
"Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune,
"and instead, we find love."
Hey!
How about dinner?
Split some egg rolls at Wok This Way?
Can't.
I have to highlight script changes for Amber Lee, then highlight her hair.
Highlight of my night!
Okay.
But I miss spending time with you.
And you did promise to shoot some more stuff for my film.
You know, what I'm doing is important, too.
Oh.
For a minute there, you sounded like Amber Lee.
"Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you."
Bad news.
My maid quit.
So, here's a list of chores.
Chores?
And I want to talk to you about Boi.
But you have to promise it'll stay between us.
Okay.
I think I'm going to ask the director to give Boi the part.
- Are you serious?
- Almost positive!
You won't be sorry.
Trust me.
I know.
Oh!
Oh, no.
There are some changes for the blocking in the dog scene, top of act two.
Countess can learn these in no time.
She's got a memory like a digital hard drive.
- No bark and all mega-bite.
- Funny.
I need to find Sharpay and make sure she gets them.
Boi is doing the first run-through tomorrow.
I'd be more than happy to deliver them to her.
- Great.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Sharpay?
That's unfortunate.
And I've been here ever since.
Life is so strange.
Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune, and instead, we find love.
Lenore, I have something to ask you.
We have something to ask you.
He's supposed to come from the other side of the stage with the ring box!
Yeah, sorry.
We changed that blocking.
What happened?
What is wrong with this dog?
And is he okay?
It's not his fault.
He's just a little dog!
He's just so sweet.
Okay, everybody.
Let's break for a few.
That's 10, people.
I'm aware.
I know.
I don't know what happened.
We sent out the script changes, but Boi didn't do them.
But I didn't get any new script change.
I looked everywhere last night to give them to you.
I guess working for Amber Lee has its drawbacks.
- You did this on purpose.
- That's a complete...
Yeah.
You're threatened because you know Amber Lee is gonna choose Boi.
Not after today she won't.
Okay.
Countess doesn't have half the personality that Boi has.
And Boi doesn't have half the talent that Countess has.
Isn't that right, girl?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Has anyone seen Boi?
- No, sorry.
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Anyone seen Countess?
- Nope.
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Hello?
- Boi and Countess are gone!
Gone!
What?
We have to find them!
Wait, where are you now?
Leaving the theater.
We're gonna look around here.
Can you look near the apartment in case they come back?
Yeah, yeah.
Of course.
Just keep me posted, and I'll call you if they show up.
Okay.
What if they were dog-napped?
Do you think we pushed them too hard?
- I don't know.
- Countess is über-sensitive.
She cries watching dog food commercials!
I just hope they're not huddled in a corner somewhere.
Afraid, lost, at each other's throats!
You knowyou love me I know you care
Just shout whenever And I'll be there
You are my love You are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item?
Girl, quit playin'
"We're just friends," What are you sayin'?
Said, "There's another" And looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine
I'm goin' down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around
And I'm like baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby...
What if we never see them again?
They're smart dogs.
Smarter than we are.
They'll be okay.
Oh, no.
It's my dad.
I just...
I can't deal with him right now.
- Countess!
- Boi!
Hi!
I missed you!
You're back!
It's amazing.
They came back to the apartment.
Thanks, Peyton.
Oh, and Sharpay, it's still on.
Bring it.
You're back!
Yeah!
You bad, bad boy, Boi.
I'm just glad you're okay.
He and Countess had an adventure.
She probably coaxed him into joining a doggy gang or something.
We'd better check him over for tattoos.
Are you so lost in what you're doing that you haven't noticed?
Noticed what?
Boi and Countess are in love.
- With what?
- Each other.
No way!
You're right.
He's dilated.
He's got puppy dog eyes.
How could I have not noticed puppy love?
Well, there's a lot you haven't noticed.
Like lately, you've had no time for me.
You know, I was counting on you to help me finish my film.
I said I would, and I will.
Things have become complicated.
It's not that complicated.
Amber Lee is using you, and you're letting her.
You don't know what you're talking about.
- I don't?
- No!
Where's the Sharpay that was determined not to go back home because she didn't want to work for anyone?
Why don't you tell me?
Working for someone, that's where.
- So at least be honest as to why.
- I know what I'm doing.
You've sold your soul to get Boi in that show, rather than trust in the dog that you raised.
Even worse, you've stopped trusting that your own talents would get you where you need to go.
And maybe you're jealous because I'm on my way up with a new famous friend, and you're just a student making a film about someone else's life instead of your own.
You don't have to be in my movie anymore.
I get it.
You have more important things to do.
Fine!
One question?
What happened to that hot pink whirlwind of confidence and ambition
I saw through my lens that first day you got here?
I mean, that girl knew she was special.
That girl knew she didn't have to do any of this to succeed.
What happened to her, huh?
Hello.
Oh, and Sharpay, can you remember to invite as many people from my fan club as possible to opening-night dress rehearsal?
I want the theater filled with people who love me as much as you do!
Sure.
You know what would be great after all this work?
A long, luxurious spa bath.
Sounds amazing!
Thank you.
Run one for me, will you?
And then you can finish these.
You're the best!
- This is a big change.
- Huge change!
I don't think you're hearing me!
New Jersey can hear you!
The name of the show is A Girl's Best Friend.
I didn't tell you to change the title.
But you want the best friend written out!
Oh.
Right.
Change the title!
How are we supposed to get rid of one of our main characters a day before our dress rehearsal in front of an audience?
The audience is coming to see me.
You change that dog's part to a bark and play dead, or I don't go on.
Let's be reasonable here.
I'm a star.
I don't have to be reasonable!
Look, those mangy mutts are bothering me almost as much as their disposable owners.
I actually had to have one of them clean my toilet just to keep her away.
She thinks she's an actress.
She acts all right.
She acts just like every other obsessed fan.
Wait.
Everything you said...
You were...
Right?
Yes.
Thank you.
You must think I'm a total fool.
No.
Not total.
Maybe my dad was right.
Maybe I'm not ready for this.
Maybe I should just go home and... work for him.
I mean, did I really think I was just gonna come to Broadway and be a star?
Yes.
Because that's exactly how you think.
It's perfect.
Perfect is so hard.
And it doesn't prepare you for disappointment.
Well, if it helps, you still look adorable, even when you're disappointed.
Yeah, that doesn't help.
Look, Sharpay.
There is not a marquee big enough or lights bright enough to contain the fame you're gonna have.
Yeah, but not the way I've been doing it.
Like you said, the Sharpay you know isn't the Sharpay that has become the Sharpay that is this Sharpay.
Did all the Sharpays follow that?
I sacrificed integrity for opportunity.
I let someone insecure distract me.
I cleaned a bathroom!
But worst of all, I disappointed someone I care about.
I forgot what was really important to me.
I lost track of what I want.
And other than maid service and a canopy bed, what is it that you want?
A fair fight.
A lifetime in the spotlight.
And maybe you'll still let me be in your movie.
I guess.
Okay, I can't say I approve of dating beneath your station in life, but fine.
Go.
Hey, I got your text.
What's C-Q-M-T-W-I-L-G-T mean?
"Come quick.
Major trouble.
Wow, I look great today." Duh.
I really should have gotten that.
Listen, Amber Lee Adams isn't what you think.
A self absorbed, two-faced panther who would eat her young alive on a reality show rather than allow anyone to steal her spotlight?
Okay, she's what you think.
Listen, I don't care if her parents had to tie beefjerky around her neck just to get the family dog to play with her, as long as Countess is at her side on that stage.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
She wants the part of the dog written out completely!
- That's not fair!
- Too far.
Well, I am 12, remember?
Roger, we've been fighting the wrong battle, each other.
We need to form an alliance and work against a common enemy.
- Zits?
- Amber Lee.
Trust me, the zit battle is one you won't win.
But what can we do?
Tonight is the dress rehearsal.
The audience will be filled with members of Amber Lee Adams' fan club.
I know, I saw the tweet.
Fine.
Yes, I follow her, too.
Okay, we need to show people exactly who Amber Lee really is.
It's time someone taught her how to behave in the theater.
I like the way you think.
It's manipulative, but for a good cause.
Tell me what you need me to do.
- Hey, Amber Lee, I...
- Where have you been?
I have been trying to reach you all day.
Oh.
Sorry, my phone must have been turned off.
Without asking me first?
I just wanted to say good luck.
You know, I know you chose Countess for this performance tonight, and I'm fine with that.
Well, it was nothing personal, but your phone was shut off, so I couldn't talk to you about it.
I guess that won't happen again, will it?
We're good.
Hug?
Okay.
Hello, everyone.
I'm Gill, the director.
And I'm Neal, the under-appreciated writer.
And we are thrilled that you're here for our first performance in front of an audience.
Does everyone here know how to applaud?
Okay, how about the balcony up there?
- Okay, now.
- Can you hear us?
You're good!
Will somebody please control these wannabe werewolves?
Hello?
People?
See, this is exactly why I didn't want to do a show with dogs!
I'm the star, not them!
Stage people?
Could somebody please put these rats with rabies out of my misery?
Anyone!
Finally, you idiot!
What took so long?
Now, hurry up and get these flea-bitten fur bags out of here!
- There are people waiting to see me!
- Okay, go now.
You think all those boring freaks with no lives came to worship two no-name mutts?
I don't think so!
I'm the one they love!
Me!
They came to see...
I knew I forgot to tell you something.
Careful, your mic's on.
You did this to me.
You ruined me!
News flash!
You ruined you!
Oh, what do you know?
You're a nobody!
The only reason you even wanted to be my friend is so I'd choose your dog!
No, no.
At first, I idolized you, even more than myself, which isn't easy.
But you're not at all what I thought you were.
You and I are exactly alike.
Except I don't enjoy letting people down.
I don't use people to feel better about myself.
And I definitely don't wear yellow and orange in the same week, let alone the same outfit, okay?
Maybe I did think you and I were alike, but not anymore.
In fact, I'd be embarrassed if someone thought I was like you.
Well, I quit!
And without me, there's no show.
Now neither one of your furry little friends will have their shot and neither will you.
Blame her!
I'm sorry.
Someone had to say it.
I'll go talk some sense into her.
You, out of this theater right now.
Wait, Sharpay.
If you go, then I'll go, too.
No.
You wanted this as badly as I did.
This mess was my idea.
You win.
That's not what it feels like.
- Hey.
Can I come in?
- Sure.
- So, you're really leaving, huh?
- Yeah.
I'm packing my carry-on stuff first.
- I wish you weren't going.
- Me, too.
Have you thought about what you're gonna do now?
Move home where there's enough room for my pores to open, spend months in the spa getting this layer of New York grime off my skin, and mostly miss you.
Look, I know exactly how to help that.
Don't go.
I already talked to my dad.
I guess I'm gonna start...
- You don't have to say it.
- Thank you.
What about your dream of being a star?
It's still there.
It's just a little bit more of a dream than a reality.
- You know what today is?
- What?
I got here exactly one month ago.
My time was up tonight anyway.
Well, so then you still have eight hours.
This isn't how my movie's supposed to end.
I guess it is.
This is Sharpay.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
No, no.
I'll be there.
That was the stage manager.
They want me to come to the theater and clear out Boi's things.
I can go with you if you want.
I want.
And, so, Amber Lee has quit.
- Gone.
- Kaput.
The producers feel, without a star, we can't open.
The time it would take to find someone who could learn the role and do it well might take weeks, and it would cost too much to keep the production going.
But we want you all to know, it was great almost working with you.
- I'm gonna meet you outside.
- All right.
Thank you for your hard work.
We are so, so sorry, people.
Wait!
Wait, it's not over.
It's not over.
Look, it doesn't have to be.
Look, there is someone who knows the part by heart and who is amazing.
All right, maybe she's not a star yet, but she will be.
This show will make her one.
Just watch.
Boi, keep your voice down.
Peyton, start shooting the rehearsal.
Boi, go mark.
Go mark.
Good!
Okay, stay.
Stay.
I love when you use that accent, but...
We're not supposed to be in here.
Okay, now let's do the scene where the character Lenore thinks she's lost everything and you come over to console her.
Come on.
Shelby, what is going on?
I feel invisible here.
Nothing is working out the way I planned it.
I got something inside ofme
Something that needs to be heard
Deep down a voice is guiding me
Hidden emotions have stirred
Why have I let others lead the way
When all along I know what it is I want to say
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
I thought I had a perfect plan
Where I would wind up on top
One day I'm thinking, "Yes I can"
Next thing you know, I'm a flop
Why did I ever play this silly game?
I got to shake up the rules
And stake my claim
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
What if I missed my window?
What if I blew my shot?
What if the only chance I was going to get
I already got?
I'm not ready to turn the page
Until I'm on stage in a show
No, nobody move I've got something to prove
Don't you know?
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
Well, did I tell you?
- Amazing!
- Amazing!
You're amahzing!
You have more depth, range and tone in one note than Amber Lee had in her entire surgically reshaped body.
We'll promote you as "The girl who we're promoting."
The producers will love it.
Wait, wait.
What are you saying?
We need you to save the show.
- Seriously?
- We know it's a risk.
- A gamble.
- A risk.
Did I do "risk" already?
You did.
And, true, we did fire you.
- He fired you.
- But now I'm un-firing you.
- Can we do that?
- Just did.
- Good for us!
- We need you.
What do you say?
Um...
I guess we could take the costumes in a few sizes and get everyone used to hearing the songs sung on key, but there's one condition.
Boi and Countess split the role of Shelby the dog equally.
Done!
We've a lot of work to do, people!
- Are we crazy?
- Crazy for theater!
- Let's rehearse!
- Let's rehearse, people!
Where are those wonderful dogs?
- Thank you.
- This is it.
The chance you've been waiting for.
- What if I'm not ready for this?
- Oh, you're ready.
"Ready" isn't as ready as you are.
- What if I'm horrible?
- Won't happen.
- What if I forget my lines?
- Impossible.
- What if I...
- Everything in your life so far has been leading you to this moment.
Your moment.
Embrace it.
I'm scared.
Finally.
Let's rehearse, people!
Over here!
Mr. Pinto, Mr. Pinto, over here.
Mr. Pinto, look this way.
I've got a feeling inside of me
Running all through my veins
It's like electrical energy
A world about to change
It's an open road
So here I go
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
I'm gonna go for it all out
I know there's no guarantee
But I've been given a chance and now
What's next is up to me
I'm gonna set my sights
So light those lights
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
If all the world's a stage
I'm here to take my place
I know I'll always find a way to shine
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
It starts with a dream
Of who I could be
Wherever it takes me I can't wait
So I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
I want fabulous That is my simple request
All things fabulous Bigger and better and best
I need something inspiring to help me get along
I need a little fabulous Is that so wrong?
Fetch me my Jimmy Choo flip-flops
Where is my pink Prada tote?
A summer like never before
I want more!
She wants fabulous That is her simple request
All things fabulous Bigger and better and best
She needs something inspiring to help her get along
She needs a little fabulous Is that so wrong?
Absolutely...
Not!

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
(SINGING) There's a moment when you realize that something's changed
(BARKS)
And all the bits and pieces start to fit
It's so fab!
When nothing that you know will ever be the same
Ring the bell
(RINGS)
That's my cue
Gotta try something new
Gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
Yeah
Listen up, fellas.
Now there's nothing in this universe to hold me back
Bye, Gab.
No endless night can keep me in the dark
And I just might give my dear old dad a heart attack
- But he'll live
- He'll live
- And he'll see
- He'll see
What his girl is meant to be
Gonna shine
And leave the past behind
Gonna try to fly so high
Gonna climb and make the prize all mine
Then I'll write my name in letters across the sky
I'm gonna shine
And if my present luminescent state is second rate
I'll turn it up a notch past nine
And watch the world go blind
Got a diva dazzle that you just can't touch
Like an angel in Armani I'm too fabulous
They'll be lining up for blocks Once I bop to the top
With a poochie in my Gucci I just can't be stopped
I'm gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
There she is.
Wonderful!
WOMAN 1:
Hi!
- I know, I know.
- WOMAN 2:
I loved it.
Excuse us.
There's our little superstar!
Princess, you had better watch out for law enforcement.
They are gonna come after you for stealing the show!
Honey, on a scale of one to 10, you were an entirely different scale.
And you know my aversion to scales.
Sharpay!
Yes, I know.
And thank you.
We'd like to introduce you to Jerry Taylor.
He's a good friend of our family, visiting for the week.
May I just say how wonderful you were?
As many times as you'd like!
(ALL LAUGHING)
I really see a unique talent here.
I mean, a true gift.
And your kind, true words are a gift as well.
It was so nice to meet you.
But if you'll excuse me, my friends have been waiting.
I'm a casting agent from New York.
And will keep waiting until I tell you how much I love your suit.
(ALL LAUGHING)
I'm about to start casting for a new musical on Broadway.
Broadway?
As in "Broadway?"
Yeah.
And I think that there is a perfect part.
I would be more than happy to arrange an audition if you happen to find yourself in the Big Apple any time soon.
That would be...
I would be...
It would be, like...
The show is gonna star Amber Lee Adams.
- No.
- Yeah.
Stop.
Seriously, stop.
Who's Amber Lee Adams?
She's only the most amazing performer ever!
We have so much in common.
I won't keep you.
It was so nice to meet you, Sharpay.
Congratulations again.
And, who knows, maybe we'll see you in New York.
Okay?
- Congrats!
- Bye.
Toodles!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
- No!
- No?
I don't understand!
What language is that?
No, I don't think going to New York is a good idea.
(EXHALING) See, there you go, believing everything you think.
Do you really believe you're ready for such a monumental step?
Daddy, the main reason I buy such expensive shoes is to take monumental steps.
Sweetheart, when you graduated from high school almost a year ago, do you remember what you said to me?
"How come no one makes a cap and gown in hot pink?"
No.
"How come you get a car and driver and I don't?"
- No.
- "Good luck finding anyone
"to fill the talent-less void of boring and unattractive
"that will exist in these hallways
- "once I graduate"?
- No.
Yes, but you also said that you needed a year to find yourself, to figure out what came next in your life.
That year's almost up, and you haven't found anything.
It's a small town.
I mean, there's only so many places to look.
Besides, I did find something.
A show I wanna be in.
This is more than just a show.
You're talking about going it alone in the big city.
Right!
To star on Broadway with Amber Lee Adams.
Could you really deny the world that opportunity?
I'm sorry, princess.
But nothing you've shown me convinces me you're ready for something like this.
Okay, ladies.
Team Sharpay.
Mission:
New York.
Daddy says I'm not ready for this.
So, what does that mean?
You pout, throw a tantrum, and he buys you a new Burberry bag to make you feel better?
That's good, but no.
It means we show him I'm determined.
And when I make up my mind...
And no one is better with make-up.
(GIGGLING) ...my mind looks amazing.
Okay, here's your assignments.
I texted Bridget, who e-mailed Constance, who tweeted Bethany, who IM'ed Jenn, who Facebooked Kara, who has an ex-friend who she caught with her boyfriend, who she then dumped, so now Kara's her friend again,
who knows of a New York apartment available in a luxury townhouse.
That is, like, the best house you can get in terms of towns.
- Sounds perfect.
- It gets better.
- It can't.
- But it does.
It is equal distance from both Chanel and wicked.
(SQUEALS)
Okay.
Now, on to travel plans.
That's right.
Albuquerque to New York.
One adult and one dog.
Excuse me?
Coach?
(GIGGLING)
LUPE:
Hi, I'm calling for Sharpay Evans.
Mr. Taylor wanted to set up an audition with her for a new musical.
Two weeks from today is perfect.
(BOTH SQUEALING)
Now, new outfits.
And this would be for opening night.
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
The beading actually doubles the reflection of paparazzi flashbulbs!
You can wear anything.
You should have your own reality show called I Can Wear Anything.
Where you wear anything.
All right.
I'm ready to show Daddy what we've accomplished.
Ladies, and people I don't know,
New York is calling.
And this is one call that is not going to voice-mail.
So, by way of review, this is my shoe closet, that is my bedroom, these are my new clothes and where I'll wear them, and then I'm a star!
See?
(SIGHING) I'm just not totally convinced.
Daddy, you said I haven't shown you anything to let you know I'm ready for this.
But, look, I took matters into my own hands, and without even chipping my manicure.
Sweetheart, it's not as easy as putting pictures on boards.
But I've worked everything out!
And used this pointer.
- I don't know...
- Please, Daddy.
Alone, in New York?
My dear college friend, Michelle, has a son that goes to NYU.
I've met him.
He's a very nice boy.
I could ask her to make sure that he keeps his eye on you.
Are you sure you're ready to take this on?
SHARPAY:
I know I can do this.
I know it like I know purple washes me out and that my eyes are the exact same distance apart to be a supermodel.
What I don't know is whether you believe in me.
Mom seems to.
(SIGHING HEAVILY)
Okay, you have my blessing.
(SQUEALING) Thank you, Daddy!
I'll call my friend Michelle and have her talk to her son.
Thanks, Mom.
There's just one condition.
Fine.
I love a good conditioner.
You have one month.
I'll fly you to New York, I'll pay for your penthouse, but you have to get yourself in that show and prove to me you can take care of yourself.
One month.
- Deal?
- So deal!
But if it doesn't work out, you come back here and work for me.
At the country club.
(STAMMERING)
- Work?
- A job.
That's the deal.
Prove yourself, or come back in a month and work for me.
Fine.
Prove myself it is!
- Look!
- (BOI BARKS)
Look, Boi, look!
- Sharpay?
- In the flesh and pastels!
- We've been awaiting your arrival.
- Then the wait's over!
We spoke on the phone.
I'm Marjorie Grande, the manager for the building.
My pleasure.
Please, follow me to the penthouse.
SHARPAY:
Ooh!
(SIGHS HAPPILY)
I hope this is to your liking.
No.
It's to my loving!
Boi, you've gotta see this.
- That's a dog.
- Try to get him to believe that.
I'm sorry.
There are no dogs in the building.
Sure there are.
See?
The members of the co-op board have a strict no-dog policy.
Well...
My father heads our country club board, so I'm sure that gives me some kind of board immunity.
Miss Sharpay, this building is pleased to have you.
This dog...
Not so pleased.
Miss Grande, Ma'am.
If he goes, I go.
What are you doing?
PEYTON:
Filming you.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
Do you always just film totally stunning people on the street that you don't know?
Only when I think the subject is interesting.
And you look baffled and scared and really pink.
So, yeah, interesting.
Are you paparazzi?
I'm a film student at NYU, working on a short film.
The assignment is to capture one unique New York story.
Maybe you're it.
So, you decided to film me without my permission, just for a school assignment?
- Yep.
- How dare you!
And my left side is better for close-ups.
(LAUGHS)
I'm Peyton.
Sharpay Evans.
Actress, heiress, soon to be Broadway legend.
- Wait!
- About 105,
- but it's really not polite to ask.
- No...
I should know my own weight, okay?
No, I'm Peyton Leverett.
Our moms went to college together.
This is crazy!
I was on my way up to your apartment to make sure you were okay.
And here you are.
Right, they told me to expect you.
Well, glad we could finally meet.
- Oh, and this is Boi.
- Well, nice to meet you, Boi.
(BARKS)
So, why are you out here?
Is everything okay?
Not really.
When I rented this apartment online, it never said they don't allow dogs.
And now they won't let us live here.
Yeah, well, it's their loss!
- Do you have someplace else to go?
- Okay, it's my loss and their loss!
(SIGHING) Actually, the only place I have to go is home.
And trust me, that is not an option!
Listen, there's an empty studio in my building, if you're interested.
I'm friends with the building manager.
I'm sure I can make a call.
And...
Well, I'm sure I can make a call and arrange something.
Maybe get you to see it.
(SIGHS)
Well, since I don't seem to have any other options.
Bellman!
Oh, yeah, right. (LAUGHS)
Seriously?
Careful with those!
This is all I have to get by on until the truck arrives with the bulk of my things.
(SCREAMING)
Oh!
That's good.
Okay, now, go outside, and then come back in and give me even more of that it's-the-end-of-the-world look.
Okay?
GIRL 1:
Hey, Peyton.
GIRL 2:
Hey, Peyton!
- What's up?
- Off to acting class.
(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT) "Maggie, the cat is alive.
I'm alive!"
Singing lesson.
(VOCALIZING IN HIGH VOICE)
Cool, guys.
Okay.
Hey, this is Sharpay and Boi.
Hi, Sharpay.
Hi, Boi!
Anyways, gotta go.
See ya, Peyton.
GIRL 2:
Nice meeting you, Sharpay.
PEYTON:
Later, guys.
Okay.
Really, you're going to love this place.
Okay?
Up you go.
Sorry.
It's a pre-war building.
And during the war, they didn't fight for an elevator?
Listen, the building has two things going for it.
It's got something available, and I live here.
(SCOFFS)
(SIGHING) Fine.
But if I break a heel, or a sweat, you're responsible.
Get my bags.
(PANTING)
See?
That wasn't so bad.
Yeah.
Down the hall.
The one with the police tape and chalk outline.
Really?
Kidding.
- You said this was a studio.
- It is.
No way!
MGM was a studio!
This?
This is a roach motel with no room service.
Yeah, a studio apartment.
Sure, from certain angles, it's a bit small.
A two-karat engagement ring is a bit small!
This is a doll house!
- So what do you think?
- Forget it!
I'd need an entirely separate apartment just for my lipsticks.
And where am I supposed to sleep?
- What is that?
- It's your bed.
That is not a bed.
It's a closet with a tongue.
You can't be serious!
- There is one really good thing about it.
- Yeah, sure.
See?
This is my place!
Looking better, huh?
Am I missing something?
Oh, right.
Space!
Luxury!
Maid service!
Let me guess.
You're used to being spoiled.
I'm not used to it.
I just expect it.
You know, half this building is filled with performers who came here with the same ambitions you did.
What makes you so much better than them?
Money, breeding, talent, great hair, perfect jaw line, chic taste.
How much time do you have?
All right, fine.
I tried to help you out like my mom asked, but whatever.
I'll find someone else to film.
The only problem is if I call my father and tell him how I messed up on the other apartment and how I have nowhere to go but here, and I ask for his help, he'll make me come home and...
(STAMMERING)
Work!
- So?
- So?
Then I'll never get my big break.
Oh, and promise you won't call your mother and tell her about this, because then she'll call my mom who will tell my dad, and I don't think he really believes I can make this happen.
He only gave me one month to prove it.
Well, then you've got one month to prove him wrong.
(GROANS)
Why did I do this?
I want my canopy bed and my housekeeper.
And a shower that doesn't share a room with a kitchen.
- Come on.
- Where to?
- Do you trust me?
- You suggested this place.
Yeah.
Point taken.
Come anyway.
Come on.
SHARPAY:
I hope you're taking me to a better apartment than what you just showed me.
Because let me tell you, if that's it?
No way!
Absolutely no!
Just come on.
Just don't ask any questions.
I need luxury!
Are you kidding me?
That was like a green, dark hole that I never wanna be in ever again.
All right, here you go.
Butchy!
- Come on...
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.
Come on.
- Why are we here?
All right, all right.
Now, you're gonna have to close your eyes.
- Close my eyes?
- Yeah, just close your eyes.
- Why?
- Because!
Just do it.
All right, now.
Keep them closed.
- Well, what if I hit into something?
- You won't.
I got you.
All right, all right.
Keep them closed.
All right.
- All right, you got them closed?
- Yes, I do.
All right, all right.
Perfect.
All right.
Now, stay here, keep them closed.
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
Keep them closed.
All righty.
Keep them closed.
All right.
Open them.
Hit it, Butchy!
Wow.
I know.
When I left Indiana to go to school here, I didn't know a soul either, and I was just as overwhelmed as you.
But I had two things, my dream and my camera.
And look at me now.
You still only have your dream and your camera.
Yes, but I met you, didn't I?
So, something's working out.
Well, whenever people meet me, things get better.
(LAUGHS)
Look, you just have to adapt to your surroundings.
And remember that for now this is all just temporary.
Right.
Like prom dresses and first boyfriends.
Look, anything you have to do will be worth it to get your dream.
Okay.
I'm gonna meet with that casting director, get the part,
- be a star and have a palace!
- There you go.
That's the self-indulgent, self-entitled, optimistic pink hurricane
I've been seeing through my lens.
And I like how perceptive you are.
Okay, New York.
Bring it on.
(UPBEAT POP SONG PLAYING)
(SINGING) I used to think maybe you loved me
Now, baby, I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day When you knock on my door
(SQUEALING)
Now every time I go for the mailbox Gotta hold myself down
"Cause I just can't wait till you write me You're coming around
I'm walking on sunshine
(BARKS)
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
(WHOOPS)
- And don't it feel good!
- Hey!
All right now And don't it feel good!
Hey!
All right now, yeah
Hi!
(SHRIEKING)
Turn it off.
Turn it off!
(SINGING) Just waiting foryou
CHORUS:
Just waiting for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day
No, no, no
(LAUGHING)
What?
I want you to stay
I'm walking on sunshine
- And don't it feel good!
- CHORUS:
Hey!
All right now And don't it feel good!
SHARPAY:
Oh, yeah!
PEYTON:
Looking good.
So pink.
You're good.
(BOTH CHATTERING)
- Do you wanna try some?
- No, I don't want any!
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Lay down.
Lay down.
(LAUGHS) Night, Boi!
(SHARPAY SQUEALING)
(MUFFLED) Boi?
Get help!
(BANGING ON DOOR)
(FAKING GASP)
- PEYTON:
Knock, knock.
- Come in!
Wow!
And wow.
Hey, are you on your way to meet with the casting director?
No, I'm on my way to change theater history.
You think this is a good outfit for changing history?
Perfect!
Mind if I tag along and film?
Not that you could ever mind me, right?
I think you should.
After all, not many people can say they were there to film the creation of a legend.
Sharpay!
You made it after all!
Destiny called, and I get great reception!
Well, your timing is perfect.
What's tomorrow like for you?
The first day of the rest of my fame.
Well, all right.
I'll set up your audition for 3:00.
I'll e-mail you the musical number that we'd like you to prepare.
And could you make sure that he's well-groomed and, you know, takes care of any business beforehand.
- What?
- What?
- He?
- Yes.
- Him?
- Him.
- He?
- Yes!
Wait, what?
It's your dog that we want to audition.
He was amazing!
Oh.
(LOUDLY) What?
I mean...
I sent you all the information in response to your e-mail.
I mean, didn't the title of the musical give you any indication?
A Girl's Best Friend?
A Girl's Best Friend!
And I'm here for the girl!
You're here for the girl?
Well, I'm never the best friend!
Oh, no.
No, no.
We wanted Boi.
As the girl?
No, as the best friend.
Wait, wait.
You wanted Boi as the best friend of the girl?
Not me as the girl with the best friend?
Exactly.
Oh, Sharpay, I am so sorry for the confusion.
If you don't want Boi to audition, I would totally understand.
Sharpay.
Sharpay!
Hey, stop.
MAN:
Hey, don't touch the car!
Look, slow down.
Even New Yorkers can't keep up with you.
It's not even me they wanted!
Well, to be fair, the role is for a dog.
If they wanted you, I could understand you being upset.
Why did I come all this way?
Leave my friends, family, a dry, self-hydrating climate?
To follow your dream!
Or at least that's what I thought.
Nothing is turning out the way I planned it!
Plan A. Live in a penthouse and star on Broadway.
Plan B...
Don't have a plan B!
What do I tell my father now?
That you came to a very special city determined to be someone very special, which you are.
Oh, I'm not so special.
I'm just like everyone else.
Maybe a little better.
Look at it this way.
Boi is your dog, and he has an opportunity, so be happy for him.
You're right.
I'm being, you know, what's the word?
When you do something for yourself even though it's not so good for other people?
- Selfish?
- No!
Oh, yeah.
Look, Sharpay, you can't give up.
Okay?
And, anyway, you're officially the star of my film.
I am?
Yeah, you are.
Oh.
So now it's all about you?
Only because I need you here.
Fine.
I'll star in your movie.
Okay.
Good, good!
Okay, change of strategy.
I didn't know you had a strategy, but I like the way you think.
If Boi becomes a success, everyone will see me as well.
After all, I am his entourage.
I am the one who's holding his leash.
His fame will ultimately lead to my fame.
That's what I came here for, right?
Still a little selfish, but heading in the right direction.
We're gonna do this.
It's like I tell the housekeepers.
If you can't see the bright side, polish the dull side.
Yeah, not quite what I was talking...
They want Boi to audition?
It's Boi they will get!
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING ON PIANO)
(SINGING) when a sign ofthe times is the times are extremely tough
- (WHIMPERING) - (SHUSHING)
When you look at the world and the world that you see is
(BARKS)
Yes, rough
When you feel like a long lost pup
And you need some cheering up
Sit back, relax and watch us do our stuff
Two, three, four
We're gonna sit and shake your hand That's how it starts
We're gonna nose our nosy way into your hearts
We'll sing and bark In two-part harmony
You're gonna love us That's our guarantee
We'll bow together on the count of three
Me and my Boi My Boi and me
We make the perfect pair
We've got that savoir-faire
(BARKING)
Me and my Boi
(BARKING)
Me and my Boi
My Boi and me
(LAUGHING)
Wait!
That's the best audition I've ever seen!
I'm Gill Samms, the director.
Neal Roberts, writer.
That was amazing!
Chills.
Feel my hand...
I won't feel your hand, but I believe you.
I won't feel your hand either, but I believe you, too.
That is one special dog.
We've done special here.
Special has been done, people!
Boi was meant for Broadway.
We both were.
(BARKS)
So, when do we start?
Well, there's one more waiting.
One more!
One more, people!
Could you take a seat in the front row, please?
There.
Now.
Roger Elliston
the third.
And his dog, Countess.
FYI, I'm Roger.
As you can see by our extensive resume, hand-printed on carbonless, environmental-friendly rice paper,
Countess has numerous major Broadway credits under her paws, including The Collar Purple Three Puppy Opera, and the original Broadway cast production of A Wagging Tail of Two Cities, a musical opera in German.
Major pedigree.
I'm impressed.
This is us impressed.
Plus, she can bark a high C with sustained vibrato.
Sure, but only dogs can hear it.
(LAUGHING)
All right.
Let's see what Countess can do.
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING ON PIANO)
(SINGING) when a sign ofthe times is the times are extremely tough
When you look at the world and the world that you see is rough
When you feel like a long lost pup
And you need some cheering up

(LAUGHING)
We're gonna nose our nosy way into your hearts

(LAUGHING)
That's the best audition I've ever seen!
- Amazing!
I weeped!
- Wept.
GILL:
I wept!
- I wept!
- And not just regular weeping.
Theater weeping!
Amber Lee, what do you think?
Yes.
Amber Lee, thoughts?
Wow...
We are so meant to be BFFs!
Wow! "Wow" is a word, right?
Right.
Wow!
I just hope that the palpable chemistry surging between you and I right now like nuclear fusion won't in any way influence your decision towards our clearly superior audition.
How old are you?
Twelve.
I think I'm good.
And you, also!
Your dog...
Wow!
Wow.
- I know, right?
- (BARKING)
He's just saying hi.
Sharpay Evans of the New Mexico Evans.
I'm a mega fan.
Oh, you are not!
So am!
I am gonna tweet about you right now.
Shut up!
I follow your tweets.
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)
She did!
She tweeted!
Okay, I don't know how we're gonna decide.
You're amazing!
All this and a grade school diploma.
And you, amazing!
Wow.
I would be excited to work with either one of you and your dogs.
And can I just say, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Because Broadway...
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, real people are watching.
- Wow.
- Me, too.
I am just so excited to be performing on the Great White Way!
Not that I don't love all colors.
Well, I know both these talented dogs want to work with you.
But only one can be in the show.
- How are we gonna decide?
- Wait.
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals?
Wait!
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals!
That way I could see which one I work best with.
- That sounds like a solution.
- We have a solution, people!
Can I just say how totally great I think you are?
You do, and I'll never wash my ears again.
You know what I think?
Well, of course you don't because I just thought of it, but I think they loved you!
I like the way you think!
And you're such a good singer.
And I would know.
- My album went triple platinum.
- Well, I've done quite a bit of theater.
It totally shows.
Listen, I'm gonna have my assistant give you my phone number.
If there's anything that you need, you just let me know, okay?
We girls gotta stick together, right?
- Here.
- Wow.
I mean, this is actually your number!
It looks like any ordinary number, but it's not.
It's yours!
- Oh, and, hey, may the best dog win!
- Thanks!
(SQUEALING SOFTLY)
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Can you believe it?
PEYTON:
You were great!
Boi was great.
This new strategy just might work.
- Amber Lee really likes you, too.
- Is she awesome or what?
She inspires me.
There.
I said it.
Quelle inspired.
We are so gonna get that part.
- How do you know?
- Easy.
I don't do rejection.
Sharpay!
I just wanted to wish you both luck.
Oh!
That's so nice of you.
And suggest that you give up now, while you still have your dignity.
Distant though it already might be.
Sorry, which Smurf are you again?
True, you have talent.
But you lack both the experience and the finesse to ever achieve the Holy Grail of possibility.
- Yeah, but Boi is cuter.
- Countess is a theatrical ninja.
(SNORING)
I'm sorry.
For a minute there you just bored me to death.
I have a foolproof strategy of getting what I want.
See it, want it, have a fit, get it.
- Yeah, well, this playdate's over.
- I hope you enjoy rejection.
- We're gonna get that part.
- We're gonna destroy you.
- Bring it on.
- Oh, it's brought.
All right, Boi.
This foot.
That foot.
Good boy!
Yeah!
Okay, let's try our next one.
Stay.
Catch your tail.
Catch your tail!
Good!
Yeah, good.
Sit.
Stay.
We are so going to take them on.
I'm not gonna let some hobbit get in my way.
And, look.
All Boi can do is think about how horrible that other little mangy dog was.
(WHIMPERING)
If you want success so badly, then you will get it.
All you need is one shot to make it happen.
Yeah, and this is my shot.
It's like my grandmother says.
"God only got one book published,
"and look how well it did for him."
Doing this is all I've ever dreamed about, especially since I already have everything else.
Well, there's still humility.
What's wrong with being confident?
Confidence is when you know you're good.
Arrogance is when you think others know you're good.
Well, I want everyone to know I'm as good as I think everyone thinks I am without them knowing I know they think it.
- And do you have to film everything?
- Yep, 'cause this is my shot.
If my professor loves my film, he talks about it.
Then there's a buzz, then it gets in a festival, then it gets distribution, then I'm signing a studio deal, then I'm getting an Oscar.
(SIGHS)
I always knew I wanted to be an actress the first time I produced and performed the entire production of Snow white.
Full dance, musical numbers, handmade costumes.
I made my brother play all the dwarfs.
Everyone in that pre-school worshipped me.
(LAUGHS)
I just want to wake up every morning and be onstage.
GILL:
Good morning!
Good morning, everyone.
- And welcome to the first rehearsal...
- Of the new Broadway musical.
A Girl's Best Friend!
And you are all amazing.
- No, you are!
- Him or me?
- You!
- No, you!
Me?
Okay!
And heading our superb cast, we are thrilled to welcome one of the biggest stars around,
Amber Lee Adams!
Oh, stop!
NEAL:
Yes!
AMBER LEE:
Guys, come on.
Can I just say that this, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, people can see if you write your lines on your hands!
(ALL LAUGHING)
All right.
Let's rehearse.
I want everybody downstairs with piano, rehearsing the music for the opening number.
Amber Lee and Judith,
I want you onstage so we can block that first scene.
- Let's go!
- Let's go, people!
All right.
Let's start with Boi.
Let's go!
AMBER LEE:
What a perfect goodbye party.
Thank you, Mom!
JUDITH:
I can't believe my little girl is going out into the world on her own for the first time.
I have to, Mom.
And who knows, maybe I'll find fame and fortune!
Actually, reverse that.
(LAUGHING)
- Why is that funny?
- Well...
Because you'd rather have the...
I'll explain later.
Just keep going.
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Pick it up!
Go, go!
A star is about to be born!
Shelby!
Oh!
What's in this envelope?
This very wet envelope.
(LAUGHING)
- Again, I don't get that.
- Keep going.
Gasp!
Actually, that's a stage direction.
You gasp, you don't say "gasp."
GILL:
Simple mistake.
Keep going.
(GASPS)
Shelby!
Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
(LAUGHS)
(BARKS)
Oh, Shelby.
This is the first time we'll be apart.
I wish I could just pack you up in a widdle doggie bag.
(CHUCKLING)
Okay.
Let's get Countess in there and continue.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Shelby and I will both be here when you get back.
You're killing me.
AMBER LEE:
Oh!
NEAL:
That is adorable!
AMBER LEE:
You're right, Shelby!
Why not go with me?
Any place that doesn't want you, I don't wanna be.
Let's see what New York has in store for us together!
Good.
Let's talk about the scene a bit, and we'll do it again.
And both dogs, great work!
Shelby!
Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
What's going on?
The dog.
What is this?
Somebody, please.
The dog is licking me.
All right, all right.
Get me the other dog!
(SIGHING)
Sorry.
What can you do?
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go, go!
(DOG WHISTLE BLOWING)
- GILL:
Why is she twirling?
- What is she doing?
(GROANING)
- Gill?
- Roger!
Figure out what's going on with the dog.
It's not helping me.
- Not helping, people!
- Meanwhile, get the other dog!
Sorry.
What can you do?
AMBER LEE:
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go!
Oh, hey!

How is this helping?
Really.
Am I the only one bothered by this?
Gill?
Okay, everybody, that's 10!
I'll admit you're good.
But we're better.
Give up!
Give up?
Not until there's a Broadway marquee with a picture of my dog so big you can walk by and smell his puppy breath!
I have to take the dogs for a nap.
Union rules.
Thank you.
- You break first.
- No, you break first.
AMBER LEE:
Oh!
- Pretty cute, huh?
- Yeah!
Yes, they are!
I just wanted to tell you something.
This is my show.
I'm America's sweetheart.
They're paying to see me, not you two over-bred fur balls.
So, until I can figure out a way to get rid of you, you better watch your step, otherwise you'll find out the real meaning of going home in a doggie bag.
(CHUCKLES EVILLY)
PEYTON:
This film is cutting together really well.
Do I look amazing?
- The camera loves you.
- I know!
(COMPUTER CHIMES)
Oh, no!
My dad's video-chatting me.
He thinks I live in a penthouse.
I can't let him see that I live in a tiny studio in a filthy tenement.
With a boy in my room!
A boy, by the way, that has no money, and lives in a tinier studio, and who, apparently, has never heard of the word "maid-service"!
No offense.
What of that could possibly offend me?
(PANTING) Oh, my!
Oh, my!
I don't know.
Hyperventilating!
- What do I do?
What do I do?
- Come on.
- Come on.
Hurry!
- (COMPUTER CHIMING)
- All right, scoot over.
Okay, go, go.
- Okay, I gotta get this.
Stop!
Hi, Daddy!
Hey, princess!
How's my little girl?
Overpaying for everything and yelling at total strangers.
(EXCLAIMS) You're practically a native.
Hey, where are you?
That view is spectacular.
Well, there's hardly a penthouse in the city that doesn't have a spectacular view!
So, you the toast of Broadway?
Daddy, you know how I feel about carb references.
Just a little concerned, sweetie.
The last time no one's heard from you for this long was when you found out your gold card wasn't actually made of gold.
Well, I've been busy with rehearsals.
Outstanding!
You got into the show?
Well, it doesn't quite work like that.
It's complicated.
But I know it's gonna work out.
Sharpay, is there something you're not telling me?
You remember the deal, right?
If things aren't working out...
I know, I know.
I have one month to get in the show, and then...
Two weeks, sweetie.
You have two weeks left.
You're sure everything's okay?
It's fine, Daddy.
Well, okay.
We miss you, angel.
Miss you, too.
I love you!
Boi has to get that role.
I can't go home.
Not as a failure.
I need some sort of subtle, visibly crushing advantage over Roger.
Look, why not just trust Boi is talented, that you've trained him well,
- and let fate take it from there.
- Fate?
Fate gave a girl in my graduating class one long eyebrow.
I can't trust fate.
Some matters you just have to take into your own hands.
What do you mean you forgot my bottled water?
Well, I was going to get those magazines that you said you wanted from across town, and I got hit by a bike messenger.
So I went to the hospital for, like, just one second to get these stitches.
And meanwhile, I had no water!
I will get it for you right now.
Now I've had to drink tap!
- I am so sorry.
- (MOCKING) "I am so sorry."
- I will do better.
- Forget it, okay?
Aside from catching some shade from the shadow cast by your madam's apple, you're of no use to me.
You're... (WHIMPERING) fired!
(CRYING) God!
Amber Lee?
Oh, wow!
You look so cute, Sharpie!
- Sharpay.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
So, tell me, what's on your mind?
I just saw your assistant leave in tears.
She's not my assistant.
She quit.
No wonder she was crying.
Yeah, I don't think she even really cared.
Next time I should probably just hire a best friend instead.
Wait!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
What are you thinking that I should be thinking?
I could help you out until you replace her.
That is what I was thinking about thinking.
Of course this can't, in any way, affect your decision of which dog gets the starring role.
Oh, it won't.
I couldn't live with myself if I thought I did anything unfair.
You have my word.
Hey, I know!
How about dinner?
- That sounds awesome!
- Right?
Get me a reservation for two at someplace fantastic.
Then call my agent, have her meet me.
Right.
Sure.
Oh.
I won't forget this.
And I promise, it won't be because you're helping me if I happen to take a little extra liking to Girl.
- Boi.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
Oh, and can you take my mic down to the sound guy
- and tell him the wire hurts my scalp.
- Okay.
You're the best.
Amber Lee says the wire is hurting her scalp.
Personally, I think she's using the wrong shampoo, but she's the star, and you know, I don't wanna say anything.
You're hot.
Excuse me?
You're hot.
Okay.
Even though theater lighting highlights my natural skin tones, thank you for noticing, that's a little rude, don't you think?
No.
Your mic's hot.
It means it's on.
You see that little switch.
When it's flipped over like that, it means it's on and it's going through the entire theater.
Well, you could have led with that part, thank you.
Amber Lee's got a great scalp!
(LAUGHS) You're hot.
Then she asked me to help her out after her assistant quit.
And after I suggested it.
Are you sure this is wise?
I'm sorry.
Let me re-phrase that.
This isn't wise.
It's perfect.
Amber Lee will see that she and I are exactly alike, we'll become BFFs, she'll make sure Boi gets the role, then his fame becomes my fame!
I mean, this is the advantage I've been waiting for!
Isn't it more like taking advantage?
And my father thought I couldn't do this in a month.
It's turning out better than I imagined.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Sure.
Be right over.
(SIGHING)
Hello?
Oh, thank goodness.
In here, quickly.
I just...
I can't reach that.
Can't reach it?
Okay, it was a little bit of a test.
Only a true friend would come all the way down here at this hour and help me with something like that.
- So, I passed?
- Yes.
(GIGGLING)
- But, seriously, the purse.
- Okay.
Thank you.
All right, here's your bag.
Here's your other bag.
Oh, and don't forget your photo shoot.
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
You must be at that photo shoot to make sure I look as fabulous as you always do.
- Are you serious?
- Serious?
You're now also my stylist.
You have to tell me all your secrets.
Okay, gotta go.
"Life is so strange.
"Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune,
"and instead, we find love."
Hey!
How about dinner?
Split some egg rolls at Wok This Way?
Can't.
I have to highlight script changes for Amber Lee, then highlight her hair.
Highlight of my night!
Okay.
But I miss spending time with you.
And you did promise to shoot some more stuff for my film.
You know, what I'm doing is important, too.
Oh.
For a minute there, you sounded like Amber Lee.
"Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you."
Bad news.
My maid quit.
So, here's a list of chores.
Chores?
And I want to talk to you about Boi.
But you have to promise it'll stay between us.
Okay.
I think I'm going to ask the director to give Boi the part.
- Are you serious?
- Almost positive!
You won't be sorry.
Trust me.
I know.
(RUMBLING)
Oh!
Oh, no.
There are some changes for the blocking in the dog scene, top of act two.
Countess can learn these in no time.
She's got a memory like a digital hard drive.
- No bark and all mega-bite.
- Funny.
I need to find Sharpay and make sure she gets them.
Boi is doing the first run-through tomorrow.
I'd be more than happy to deliver them to her.
- Great.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Sharpay?
(SIGHS)
That's unfortunate.
And I've been here ever since.
Life is so strange.
Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune, and instead, we find love.
Lenore, I have something to ask you.
We have something to ask you.
(BARKING)
He's supposed to come from the other side of the stage with the ring box!
Yeah, sorry.
We changed that blocking.
What happened?
What is wrong with this dog?
And is he okay?
It's not his fault.
He's just a little dog!
He's just so sweet.
GILL:
Okay, everybody.
Let's break for a few.
That's 10, people.
I'm aware.
I know.
SHARPAY:
I don't know what happened.
We sent out the script changes, but Boi didn't do them.
But I didn't get any new script change.
(SIGHS)
I looked everywhere last night to give them to you.
I guess working for Amber Lee has its drawbacks.
- You did this on purpose.
- That's a complete...
Yeah.
You're threatened because you know Amber Lee is gonna choose Boi.
Not after today she won't.
Okay.
Countess doesn't have half the personality that Boi has.
And Boi doesn't have half the talent that Countess has.
Isn't that right, girl?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Has anyone seen Boi?
- No, sorry.
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Anyone seen Countess?
- Nope.
- Countess?
- Boi?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
- Hello?
- Boi and Countess are gone!
Gone!
What?
We have to find them!
Wait, where are you now?
Leaving the theater.
We're gonna look around here.
Can you look near the apartment in case they come back?
Yeah, yeah.
Of course.
Just keep me posted, and I'll call you if they show up.
Okay.
What if they were dog-napped?
Do you think we pushed them too hard?
- I don't know.
- Countess is über-sensitive.
She cries watching dog food commercials!
I just hope they're not huddled in a corner somewhere.
Afraid, lost, at each other's throats!
(SINGING) You knowyou love me I know you care
Just shout whenever And I'll be there
You are my love You are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item?
Girl, quit playin'
"We're just friends," What are you sayin'?
Said, "There's another" And looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine
I'm goin' down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around
And I'm like baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby...
SHARPAY:
What if we never see them again?
They're smart dogs.
Smarter than we are.
They'll be okay.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Oh, no.
It's my dad.
I just...
I can't deal with him right now.
(BOI BARKING)
- Countess!
- Boi!
Hi!
I missed you!
You're back!
It's amazing.
They came back to the apartment.
Thanks, Peyton.
Oh, and Sharpay, it's still on.
Bring it.
You're back!
Yeah!
You bad, bad boy, Boi.
I'm just glad you're okay.
He and Countess had an adventure.
She probably coaxed him into joining a doggy gang or something.
We'd better check him over for tattoos.
Are you so lost in what you're doing that you haven't noticed?
Noticed what?
Boi and Countess are in love.
- With what?
- Each other.
No way!
You're right.
He's dilated.
He's got puppy dog eyes.
How could I have not noticed puppy love?
Well, there's a lot you haven't noticed.
Like lately, you've had no time for me.
You know, I was counting on you to help me finish my film.
I said I would, and I will.
Things have become complicated.
It's not that complicated.
Amber Lee is using you, and you're letting her.
You don't know what you're talking about.
- I don't?
- No!
Where's the Sharpay that was determined not to go back home because she didn't want to work for anyone?
Why don't you tell me?
Working for someone, that's where.
- So at least be honest as to why.
- I know what I'm doing.
You've sold your soul to get Boi in that show, rather than trust in the dog that you raised.
Even worse, you've stopped trusting that your own talents would get you where you need to go.
And maybe you're jealous because I'm on my way up with a new famous friend, and you're just a student making a film about someone else's life instead of your own.
You don't have to be in my movie anymore.
I get it.
You have more important things to do.
Fine!
One question?
What happened to that hot pink whirlwind of confidence and ambition
I saw through my lens that first day you got here?
I mean, that girl knew she was special.
That girl knew she didn't have to do any of this to succeed.
What happened to her, huh?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello.
Oh, and Sharpay, can you remember to invite as many people from my fan club as possible to opening-night dress rehearsal?
I want the theater filled with people who love me as much as you do!
Sure.
You know what would be great after all this work?
A long, luxurious spa bath.
(SIGHING) Sounds amazing!
Thank you.
Run one for me, will you?
And then you can finish these.
You're the best!
(SIGHING)
- This is a big change.
- Huge change!
I don't think you're hearing me!
GILL:
New Jersey can hear you!
The name of the show is A Girl's Best Friend.
I didn't tell you to change the title.
But you want the best friend written out!
Oh.
Right.
Change the title!
GILL:
How are we supposed to get rid of one of our main characters a day before our dress rehearsal in front of an audience?
The audience is coming to see me.
You change that dog's part to a bark and play dead, or I don't go on.
Let's be reasonable here.
I'm a star.
I don't have to be reasonable!
Look, those mangy mutts are bothering me almost as much as their disposable owners.
I actually had to have one of them clean my toilet just to keep her away.
She thinks she's an actress.
(AMBER LEE LAUGHS)
She acts all right.
She acts just like every other obsessed fan.
Wait.
Everything you said...
You were...
Right?
Yes.
Thank you.
You must think I'm a total fool.
No.
Not total.
Maybe my dad was right.
(CRYING) Maybe I'm not ready for this.
Maybe I should just go home and... (STAMMERING) work for him.
I mean, did I really think I was just gonna come to Broadway and be a star?
Yes.
Because that's exactly how you think.
It's perfect.
Perfect is so hard.
And it doesn't prepare you for disappointment.
Well, if it helps, you still look adorable, even when you're disappointed.
Yeah, that doesn't help.
Look, Sharpay.
There is not a marquee big enough or lights bright enough to contain the fame you're gonna have.
Yeah, but not the way I've been doing it.
(SNIFFLING)
Like you said, the Sharpay you know isn't the Sharpay that has become the Sharpay that is this Sharpay.
Did all the Sharpays follow that?
I sacrificed integrity for opportunity.
I let someone insecure distract me.
I cleaned a bathroom!
But worst of all, I disappointed someone I care about.
I forgot what was really important to me.
I lost track of what I want.
And other than maid service and a canopy bed, what is it that you want?
A fair fight.
A lifetime in the spotlight.
And maybe you'll still let me be in your movie.
I guess.
(CAR HORNS HONKING)
(SIGHS)
Okay, I can't say I approve of dating beneath your station in life, but fine.
Go.
(EXCLAIMS)
Hey, I got your text.
What's C-Q-M-T-W-I-L-G-T mean?
"Come quick.
Major trouble.
Wow, I look great today." Duh.
I really should have gotten that.
Listen, Amber Lee Adams isn't what you think.
A self absorbed, two-faced panther who would eat her young alive on a reality show rather than allow anyone to steal her spotlight?
Okay, she's what you think.
Listen, I don't care if her parents had to tie beefjerky around her neck just to get the family dog to play with her, as long as Countess is at her side on that stage.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
She wants the part of the dog written out completely!
- That's not fair!
- Too far.
Well, I am 12, remember?
Roger, we've been fighting the wrong battle, each other.
We need to form an alliance and work against a common enemy.
- Zits?
- Amber Lee.
Trust me, the zit battle is one you won't win.
But what can we do?
Tonight is the dress rehearsal.
The audience will be filled with members of Amber Lee Adams' fan club.
I know, I saw the tweet.
Fine.
Yes, I follow her, too.
Okay, we need to show people exactly who Amber Lee really is.
It's time someone taught her how to behave in the theater.
I like the way you think.
It's manipulative, but for a good cause.
Tell me what you need me to do.
- Hey, Amber Lee, I...
- Where have you been?
I have been trying to reach you all day.
Oh.
Sorry, my phone must have been turned off.
Without asking me first?
I just wanted to say good luck.
You know, I know you chose Countess for this performance tonight, and I'm fine with that.
Well, it was nothing personal, but your phone was shut off, so I couldn't talk to you about it.
I guess that won't happen again, will it?
We're good.
Hug?
Okay.
(ALL CHATTERING)
Hello, everyone.
I'm Gill, the director.
And I'm Neal, the under-appreciated writer.
(ALL LAUGHING)
And we are thrilled that you're here for our first performance in front of an audience.
Does everyone here know how to applaud?
Okay, how about the balcony up there?
SHARPAY:
Okay, now.
NEAL:
Can you hear us?
You're good!
(VOCALIZING)
- (BARKING) - (SCREAMS)
Will somebody please control these wannabe werewolves?
Hello?
People?
See, this is exactly why I didn't want to do a show with dogs!
I'm the star, not them!
Stage people?
Could somebody please put these rats with rabies out of my misery?
Anyone!
Finally, you idiot!
What took so long?
Now, hurry up and get these flea-bitten fur bags out of here!
- There are people waiting to see me!
- Okay, go now.
You think all those boring freaks with no lives came to worship two no-name mutts?
I don't think so!
I'm the one they love!
Me!
They came to see...
(ALL BOOING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I knew I forgot to tell you something.
Careful, your mic's on.
You did this to me.
You ruined me!
News flash!
You ruined you!
Oh, what do you know?
You're a nobody!
The only reason you even wanted to be my friend is so I'd choose your dog!
No, no.
At first, I idolized you, even more than myself, which isn't easy.
But you're not at all what I thought you were.
(SCOFFS)
You and I are exactly alike.
Except I don't enjoy letting people down.
I don't use people to feel better about myself.
And I definitely don't wear yellow and orange in the same week, let alone the same outfit, okay?
Maybe I did think you and I were alike, but not anymore.
In fact, I'd be embarrassed if someone thought I was like you.
Well, I quit!
And without me, there's no show.
Now neither one of your furry little friends will have their shot and neither will you.
Blame her!
I'm sorry.
Someone had to say it.
I'll go talk some sense into her.
You, out of this theater right now.
Wait, Sharpay.
If you go, then I'll go, too.
No.
You wanted this as badly as I did.
This mess was my idea.
You win.
That's not what it feels like.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
- Hey.
Can I come in?
- Sure.
- So, you're really leaving, huh?
- Yeah.
I'm packing my carry-on stuff first.
- I wish you weren't going.
- Me, too.
Have you thought about what you're gonna do now?
Move home where there's enough room for my pores to open, spend months in the spa getting this layer of New York grime off my skin, and mostly miss you.
Look, I know exactly how to help that.
Don't go.
I already talked to my dad.
I guess I'm gonna start...
(STAMMERING)
- You don't have to say it.
- Thank you.
What about your dream of being a star?
It's still there.
It's just a little bit more of a dream than a reality.
- You know what today is?
- What?
I got here exactly one month ago.
My time was up tonight anyway.
Well, so then you still have eight hours.
This isn't how my movie's supposed to end.
I guess it is.
(PHONE RINGING)
This is Sharpay.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
No, no.
I'll be there.
(SIGHS)
That was the stage manager.
They want me to come to the theater and clear out Boi's things.
I can go with you if you want.
I want.
GILL:
And, so, Amber Lee has quit.
- Gone.
- Kaput.
NEAL:
The producers feel, without a star, we can't open.
The time it would take to find someone who could learn the role and do it well might take weeks, and it would cost too much to keep the production going.
But we want you all to know, it was great almost working with you.
- I'm gonna meet you outside.
- All right.
GILL:
Thank you for your hard work.
We are so, so sorry, people.
Wait!
Wait, it's not over.
It's not over.
Look, it doesn't have to be.
Look, there is someone who knows the part by heart and who is amazing.
All right, maybe she's not a star yet, but she will be.
This show will make her one.
Just watch.
SHARPAY:
Boi, keep your voice down.
Peyton, start shooting the rehearsal.
Boi, go mark.
Go mark.
Good!
Okay, stay.
Stay.
I love when you use that accent, but...
(SHUSHING)
We're not supposed to be in here.
Okay, now let's do the scene where the character Lenore thinks she's lost everything and you come over to console her.
Come on.
Shelby, what is going on?
I feel invisible here.
Nothing is working out the way I planned it.
(SINGING) I got something inside ofme
Something that needs to be heard
Deep down a voice is guiding me
Hidden emotions have stirred
Why have I let others lead the way
When all along I know what it is I want to say
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
I thought I had a perfect plan
Where I would wind up on top
One day I'm thinking, "Yes I can"
Next thing you know, I'm a flop
Why did I ever play this silly game?
I got to shake up the rules
And stake my claim
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
What if I missed my window?
What if I blew my shot?
What if the only chance I was going to get
I already got?
I'm not ready to turn the page
Until I'm on stage in a show
No, nobody move I've got something to prove
Don't you know?
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
(HUMMING)
PEYTON:
Well, did I tell you?
(LAUGHING)
- Amazing!
- Amazing!
You're amahzing!
You have more depth, range and tone in one note than Amber Lee had in her entire surgically reshaped body.
We'll promote you as "The girl who we're promoting."
The producers will love it.
Wait, wait.
What are you saying?
We need you to save the show.
- Seriously?
- We know it's a risk.
- A gamble.
- A risk.
Did I do "risk" already?
You did.
And, true, we did fire you.
- He fired you.
- But now I'm un-firing you.
- Can we do that?
- Just did.
- Good for us!
- We need you.
What do you say?
Um... (STAMMERING) I guess we could take the costumes in a few sizes and get everyone used to hearing the songs sung on key,
but there's one condition.
Boi and Countess split the role of Shelby the dog equally.
Done!
NEAL:
We've a lot of work to do, people!
- GILL:
Are we crazy?
- Crazy for theater!
- Let's rehearse!
- Let's rehearse, people!
GILL:
Where are those wonderful dogs?
- Thank you.
- This is it.
The chance you've been waiting for.
(PEYTON SIGHING)
- What if I'm not ready for this?
- Oh, you're ready.
"Ready" isn't as ready as you are.
- What if I'm horrible?
- Won't happen.
- What if I forget my lines?
- Impossible.
- What if I...
- Everything in your life so far has been leading you to this moment.
Your moment.
Embrace it.
I'm scared.
Finally.
Let's rehearse, people!
(GIRLS SQUEALING)
GIRL:
Over here!
REPORTER:
Mr. Pinto, Mr. Pinto, over here.
Mr. Pinto, look this way.
(ALL CHATTERING)
(INAUDIBLE)
(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
(SINGING) I've got a feeling inside of me
Running all through my veins
It's like electrical energy
A world about to change
It's an open road
So here I go
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
I'm gonna go for it all out
I know there's no guarantee
But I've been given a chance and now
What's next is up to me
I'm gonna set my sights
So light those lights
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
If all the world's a stage
I'm here to take my place
I know I'll always find a way to shine
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
It starts with a dream
Of who I could be
Wherever it takes me I can't wait
So I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life

SHARPAY:
I want fabulous That is my simple request
All things fabulous Bigger and better and best
I need something inspiring to help me get along
I need a little fabulous Is that so wrong?
Fetch me my Jimmy Choo flip-flops
Where is my pink Prada tote?
ALL:
A summer like never before
SHARPAY:
I want more!

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
(SINGING) There's a moment when you realize that something's changed
(BARKS)
And all the bits and pieces start to fit
It's so fab!
When nothing that you know will ever be the same
Ring the bell
(RINGS)
That's my cue
Gotta try something new
Gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
Yeah
Listen up, fellas.
Now there's nothing in this universe to hold me back
Bye, Gab.
No endless night can keep me in the dark
And I just might give my dear old dad a heart attack
- But he'll live
- He'll live
- And he'll see
- He'll see
What his girl is meant to be
Gonna shine
And leave the past behind
Gonna try to fly so high
Gonna climb and make the prize all mine
Then I'll write my name in letters across the sky
I'm gonna shine
And if my present luminescent state is second rate
I'll turn it up a notch past nine
And watch the world go blind
Got a diva dazzle that you just can't touch
Like an angel in Armani I'm too fabulous
They'll be lining up for blocks Once I bop to the top
With a poochie in my Gucci I just can't be stopped
I'm gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
There she is.
Wonderful!
WOMAN 1:
Hi!
- I know, I know.
- WOMAN 2:
I loved it.
Excuse us.
There's our little superstar!
Princess, you had better watch out for law enforcement.
They are gonna come after you for stealing the show!
Honey, on a scale of one to 10, you were an entirely different scale.
And you know my aversion to scales.
Sharpay!
Yes, I know.
And thank you.
We'd like to introduce you to Jerry Taylor.
He's a good friend of our family, visiting for the week.
May I just say how wonderful you were?
As many times as you'd like!
(ALL LAUGHING)
I really see a unique talent here.
I mean, a true gift.
And your kind, true words are a gift as well.
It was so nice to meet you.
But if you'll excuse me, my friends have been waiting.
I'm a casting agent from New York.
And will keep waiting until I tell you how much I love your suit.
(ALL LAUGHING)
I'm about to start casting for a new musical on Broadway.
Broadway?
As in "Broadway?"
Yeah.
And I think that there is a perfect part.
I would be more than happy to arrange an audition if you happen to find yourself in the Big Apple any time soon.
That would be...
I would be...
It would be, like...
The show is gonna star Amber Lee Adams.
- No.
- Yeah.
Stop.
Seriously, stop.
Who's Amber Lee Adams?
She's only the most amazing performer ever!
We have so much in common.
I won't keep you.
It was so nice to meet you, Sharpay.
Congratulations again.
And, who knows, maybe we'll see you in New York.
Okay?
- Congrats!
- Bye.
Toodles!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
- No!
- No?
I don't understand!
What language is that?
No, I don't think going to New York is a good idea.
(EXHALING) See, there you go, believing everything you think.
Do you really believe you're ready for such a monumental step?
Daddy, the main reason I buy such expensive shoes is to take monumental steps.
Sweetheart, when you graduated from high school almost a year ago, do you remember what you said to me?
"How come no one makes a cap and gown in hot pink?"
No.
"How come you get a car and driver and I don't?"
- No.
- "Good luck finding anyone
"to fill the talent-less void of boring and unattractive
"that will exist in these hallways
- "once I graduate"?
- No.
Yes, but you also said that you needed a year to find yourself, to figure out what came next in your life.
That year's almost up, and you haven't found anything.
It's a small town.
I mean, there's only so many places to look.
Besides, I did find something.
A show I wanna be in.
This is more than just a show.
You're talking about going it alone in the big city.
Right!
To star on Broadway with Amber Lee Adams.
Could you really deny the world that opportunity?
I'm sorry, princess.
But nothing you've shown me convinces me you're ready for something like this.
Okay, ladies.
Team Sharpay.
Mission:
New York.
Daddy says I'm not ready for this.
So, what does that mean?
You pout, throw a tantrum, and he buys you a new Burberry bag to make you feel better?
That's good, but no.
It means we show him I'm determined.
And when I make up my mind...
And no one is better with make-up.
(GIGGLING) ...my mind looks amazing.
Okay, here's your assignments.
I texted Bridget, who e-mailed Constance, who tweeted Bethany, who IM'ed Jenn, who Facebooked Kara, who has an ex-friend who she caught with her boyfriend, who she then dumped, so now Kara's her friend again,
who knows of a New York apartment available in a luxury townhouse.
That is, like, the best house you can get in terms of towns.
- Sounds perfect.
- It gets better.
- It can't.
- But it does.
It is equal distance from both Chanel and wicked.
(SQUEALS)
Okay.
Now, on to travel plans.
That's right.
Albuquerque to New York.
One adult and one dog.
Excuse me?
Coach?
(GIGGLING)
LUPE:
Hi, I'm calling for Sharpay Evans.
Mr. Taylor wanted to set up an audition with her for a new musical.
Two weeks from today is perfect.
(BOTH SQUEALING)
Now, new outfits.
And this would be for opening night.
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
The beading actually doubles the reflection of paparazzi flashbulbs!
You can wear anything.
You should have your own reality show called I Can Wear Anything.
Where you wear anything.
All right.
I'm ready to show Daddy what we've accomplished.
Ladies, and people I don't know,
New York is calling.
And this is one call that is not going to voice-mail.
So, by way of review, this is my shoe closet, that is my bedroom, these are my new clothes and where I'll wear them, and then I'm a star!
See?
(SIGHING) I'm just not totally convinced.
Daddy, you said I haven't shown you anything to let you know I'm ready for this.
But, look, I took matters into my own hands, and without even chipping my manicure.
Sweetheart, it's not as easy as putting pictures on boards.
But I've worked everything out!
And used this pointer.
- I don't know...
- Please, Daddy.
Alone, in New York?
My dear college friend, Michelle, has a son that goes to NYU.
I've met him.
He's a very nice boy.
I could ask her to make sure that he keeps his eye on you.
Are you sure you're ready to take this on?
SHARPAY:
I know I can do this.
I know it like I know purple washes me out and that my eyes are the exact same distance apart to be a supermodel.
What I don't know is whether you believe in me.
Mom seems to.
(SIGHING HEAVILY)
Okay, you have my blessing.
(SQUEALING) Thank you, Daddy!
I'll call my friend Michelle and have her talk to her son.
Thanks, Mom.
There's just one condition.
Fine.
I love a good conditioner.
You have one month.
I'll fly you to New York, I'll pay for your penthouse, but you have to get yourself in that show and prove to me you can take care of yourself.
One month.
- Deal?
- So deal!
But if it doesn't work out, you come back here and work for me.
At the country club.
(STAMMERING)
- Work?
- A job.
That's the deal.
Prove yourself, or come back in a month and work for me.
Fine.
Prove myself it is!
- Look!
- (BOI BARKS)
Look, Boi, look!
- Sharpay?
- In the flesh and pastels!
- We've been awaiting your arrival.
- Then the wait's over!
We spoke on the phone.
I'm Marjorie Grande, the manager for the building.
My pleasure.
Please, follow me to the penthouse.
SHARPAY:
Ooh!
(SIGHS HAPPILY)
I hope this is to your liking.
No.
It's to my loving!
Boi, you've gotta see this.
- That's a dog.
- Try to get him to believe that.
I'm sorry.
There are no dogs in the building.
Sure there are.
See?
The members of the co-op board have a strict no-dog policy.
Well...
My father heads our country club board, so I'm sure that gives me some kind of board immunity.
Miss Sharpay, this building is pleased to have you.
This dog...
Not so pleased.
Miss Grande, Ma'am.
If he goes, I go.
What are you doing?
PEYTON:
Filming you.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
Do you always just film totally stunning people on the street that you don't know?
Only when I think the subject is interesting.
And you look baffled and scared and really pink.
So, yeah, interesting.
Are you paparazzi?
I'm a film student at NYU, working on a short film.
The assignment is to capture one unique New York story.
Maybe you're it.
So, you decided to film me without my permission, just for a school assignment?
- Yep.
- How dare you!
And my left side is better for close-ups.
(LAUGHS)
I'm Peyton.
Sharpay Evans.
Actress, heiress, soon to be Broadway legend.
- Wait!
- About 105,
- but it's really not polite to ask.
- No...
I should know my own weight, okay?
No, I'm Peyton Leverett.
Our moms went to college together.
This is crazy!
I was on my way up to your apartment to make sure you were okay.
And here you are.
Right, they told me to expect you.
Well, glad we could finally meet.
- Oh, and this is Boi.
- Well, nice to meet you, Boi.
(BARKS)
So, why are you out here?
Is everything okay?
Not really.
When I rented this apartment online, it never said they don't allow dogs.
And now they won't let us live here.
Yeah, well, it's their loss!
- Do you have someplace else to go?
- Okay, it's my loss and their loss!
(SIGHING) Actually, the only place I have to go is home.
And trust me, that is not an option!
Listen, there's an empty studio in my building, if you're interested.
I'm friends with the building manager.
I'm sure I can make a call.
And...
Well, I'm sure I can make a call and arrange something.
Maybe get you to see it.
(SIGHS)
Well, since I don't seem to have any other options.
Bellman!
Oh, yeah, right. (LAUGHS)
Seriously?
Careful with those!
This is all I have to get by on until the truck arrives with the bulk of my things.
(SCREAMING)
Oh!
That's good.
Okay, now, go outside, and then come back in and give me even more of that it's-the-end-of-the-world look.
Okay?
GIRL 1:
Hey, Peyton.
GIRL 2:
Hey, Peyton!
- What's up?
- Off to acting class.
(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT) "Maggie, the cat is alive.
I'm alive!"
Singing lesson.
(VOCALIZING IN HIGH VOICE)
Cool, guys.
Okay.
Hey, this is Sharpay and Boi.
Hi, Sharpay.
Hi, Boi!
Anyways, gotta go.
See ya, Peyton.
GIRL 2:
Nice meeting you, Sharpay.
PEYTON:
Later, guys.
Okay.
Really, you're going to love this place.
Okay?
Up you go.
Sorry.
It's a pre-war building.
And during the war, they didn't fight for an elevator?
Listen, the building has two things going for it.
It's got something available, and I live here.
(SCOFFS)
(SIGHING) Fine.
But if I break a heel, or a sweat, you're responsible.
Get my bags.
(PANTING)
See?
That wasn't so bad.
Yeah.
Down the hall.
The one with the police tape and chalk outline.
Really?
Kidding.
- You said this was a studio.
- It is.
No way!
MGM was a studio!
This?
This is a roach motel with no room service.
Yeah, a studio apartment.
Sure, from certain angles, it's a bit small.
A two-karat engagement ring is a bit small!
This is a doll house!
- So what do you think?
- Forget it!
I'd need an entirely separate apartment just for my lipsticks.
And where am I supposed to sleep?
- What is that?
- It's your bed.
That is not a bed.
It's a closet with a tongue.
You can't be serious!
- There is one really good thing about it.
- Yeah, sure.
See?
This is my place!
Looking better, huh?
Am I missing something?
Oh, right.
Space!
Luxury!
Maid service!
Let me guess.
You're used to being spoiled.
I'm not used to it.
I just expect it.
You know, half this building is filled with performers who came here with the same ambitions you did.
What makes you so much better than them?
Money, breeding, talent, great hair, perfect jaw line, chic taste.
How much time do you have?
All right, fine.
I tried to help you out like my mom asked, but whatever.
I'll find someone else to film.
The only problem is if I call my father and tell him how I messed up on the other apartment and how I have nowhere to go but here, and I ask for his help, he'll make me come home and...
(STAMMERING)
Work!
- So?
- So?
Then I'll never get my big break.
Oh, and promise you won't call your mother and tell her about this, because then she'll call my mom who will tell my dad, and I don't think he really believes I can make this happen.
He only gave me one month to prove it.
Well, then you've got one month to prove him wrong.
(GROANS)
Why did I do this?
I want my canopy bed and my housekeeper.
And a shower that doesn't share a room with a kitchen.
- Come on.
- Where to?
- Do you trust me?
- You suggested this place.
Yeah.
Point taken.
Come anyway.
Come on.
SHARPAY:
I hope you're taking me to a better apartment than what you just showed me.
Because let me tell you, if that's it?
No way!
Absolutely no!
Just come on.
Just don't ask any questions.
I need luxury!
Are you kidding me?
That was like a green, dark hole that I never wanna be in ever again.
All right, here you go.
Butchy!
- Come on...
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.
Come on.
- Why are we here?
All right, all right.
Now, you're gonna have to close your eyes.
- Close my eyes?
- Yeah, just close your eyes.
- Why?
- Because!
Just do it.
All right, now.
Keep them closed.
- Well, what if I hit into something?
- You won't.
I got you.
All right, all right.
Keep them closed.
All right.
- All right, you got them closed?
- Yes, I do.
All right, all right.
Perfect.
All right.
Now, stay here, keep them closed.
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
Keep them closed.
All righty.
Keep them closed.
All right.
Open them.
Hit it, Butchy!
Wow.
I know.
When I left Indiana to go to school here, I didn't know a soul either, and I was just as overwhelmed as you.
But I had two things, my dream and my camera.
And look at me now.
You still only have your dream and your camera.
Yes, but I met you, didn't I?
So, something's working out.
Well, whenever people meet me, things get better.
(LAUGHS)
Look, you just have to adapt to your surroundings.
And remember that for now this is all just temporary.
Right.
Like prom dresses and first boyfriends.
Look, anything you have to do will be worth it to get your dream.
Okay.
I'm gonna meet with that casting director, get the part,
- be a star and have a palace!
- There you go.
That's the self-indulgent, self-entitled, optimistic pink hurricane
I've been seeing through my lens.
And I like how perceptive you are.
Okay, New York.
Bring it on.
(UPBEAT POP SONG PLAYING)
(SINGING) I used to think maybe you loved me
Now, baby, I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day When you knock on my door
(SQUEALING)
Now every time I go for the mailbox Gotta hold myself down
"Cause I just can't wait till you write me You're coming around
I'm walking on sunshine
(BARKS)
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
(WHOOPS)
- And don't it feel good!
- Hey!
All right now And don't it feel good!
Hey!
All right now, yeah
Hi!
(SHRIEKING)
Turn it off.
Turn it off!
(SINGING) Just waiting foryou
CHORUS:
Just waiting for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day
No, no, no
(LAUGHING)
What?
I want you to stay
I'm walking on sunshine
- And don't it feel good!
- CHORUS:
Hey!
All right now And don't it feel good!
SHARPAY:
Oh, yeah!
PEYTON:
Looking good.
So pink.
You're good.
(BOTH CHATTERING)
- Do you wanna try some?
- No, I don't want any!
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Lay down.
Lay down.
(LAUGHS) Night, Boi!
(SHARPAY SQUEALING)
(MUFFLED) Boi?
Get help!
(BANGING ON DOOR)
(FAKING GASP)
- PEYTON:
Knock, knock.
- Come in!
Wow!
And wow.
Hey, are you on your way to meet with the casting director?
No, I'm on my way to change theater history.
You think this is a good outfit for changing history?
Perfect!
Mind if I tag along and film?
Not that you could ever mind me, right?
I think you should.
After all, not many people can say they were there to film the creation of a legend.
Sharpay!
You made it after all!
Destiny called, and I get great reception!
Well, your timing is perfect.
What's tomorrow like for you?
The first day of the rest of my fame.
Well, all right.
I'll set up your audition for 3:00.
I'll e-mail you the musical number that we'd like you to prepare.
And could you make sure that he's well-groomed and, you know, takes care of any business beforehand.
- What?
- What?
- He?
- Yes.
- Him?
- Him.
- He?
- Yes!
Wait, what?
It's your dog that we want to audition.
He was amazing!
Oh.
(LOUDLY) What?
I mean...
I sent you all the information in response to your e-mail.
I mean, didn't the title of the musical give you any indication?
A Girl's Best Friend?
A Girl's Best Friend!
And I'm here for the girl!
You're here for the girl?
Well, I'm never the best friend!
Oh, no.
No, no.
We wanted Boi.
As the girl?
No, as the best friend.
Wait, wait.
You wanted Boi as the best friend of the girl?
Not me as the girl with the best friend?
Exactly.
Oh, Sharpay, I am so sorry for the confusion.
If you don't want Boi to audition, I would totally understand.
Sharpay.
Sharpay!
Hey, stop.
MAN:
Hey, don't touch the car!
Look, slow down.
Even New Yorkers can't keep up with you.
It's not even me they wanted!
Well, to be fair, the role is for a dog.
If they wanted you, I could understand you being upset.
Why did I come all this way?
Leave my friends, family, a dry, self-hydrating climate?
To follow your dream!
Or at least that's what I thought.
Nothing is turning out the way I planned it!
Plan A. Live in a penthouse and star on Broadway.
Plan B...
Don't have a plan B!
What do I tell my father now?
That you came to a very special city determined to be someone very special, which you are.
Oh, I'm not so special.
I'm just like everyone else.
Maybe a little better.
Look at it this way.
Boi is your dog, and he has an opportunity, so be happy for him.
You're right.
I'm being, you know, what's the word?
When you do something for yourself even though it's not so good for other people?
- Selfish?
- No!
Oh, yeah.
Look, Sharpay, you can't give up.
Okay?
And, anyway, you're officially the star of my film.
I am?
Yeah, you are.
Oh.
So now it's all about you?
Only because I need you here.
Fine.
I'll star in your movie.
Okay.
Good, good!
Okay, change of strategy.
I didn't know you had a strategy, but I like the way you think.
If Boi becomes a success, everyone will see me as well.
After all, I am his entourage.
I am the one who's holding his leash.
His fame will ultimately lead to my fame.
That's what I came here for, right?
Still a little selfish, but heading in the right direction.
We're gonna do this.
It's like I tell the housekeepers.
If you can't see the bright side, polish the dull side.
Yeah, not quite what I was talking...
They want Boi to audition?
It's Boi they will get!

That's the best audition I've ever seen!
I'm Gill Samms, the director.
Neal Roberts, writer.
That was amazing!
Chills.
Feel my hand...
I won't feel your hand, but I believe you.
I won't feel your hand either, but I believe you, too.
That is one special dog.
We've done special here.
Special has been done, people!
Boi was meant for Broadway.
We both were.
(BARKS)
So, when do we start?
Well, there's one more waiting.
One more!
One more, people!
Could you take a seat in the front row, please?
There.
Now.
Roger Elliston
the third.
And his dog, Countess.
FYI, I'm Roger.
As you can see by our extensive resume, hand-printed on carbonless, environmental-friendly rice paper,
Countess has numerous major Broadway credits under her paws, including The Collar Purple Three Puppy Opera, and the original Broadway cast production of A Wagging Tail of Two Cities, a musical opera in German.
Major pedigree.
I'm impressed.
This is us impressed.
Plus, she can bark a high C with sustained vibrato.
Sure, but only dogs can hear it.
(LAUGHING)
All right.
Let's see what Countess can do.

- Amazing!
I weeped!
- Wept.
GILL:
I wept!
- I wept!
- And not just regular weeping.
Theater weeping!
Amber Lee, what do you think?
Yes.
Amber Lee, thoughts?
Wow...
We are so meant to be BFFs!
Wow! "Wow" is a word, right?
Right.
Wow!
I just hope that the palpable chemistry surging between you and I right now like nuclear fusion won't in any way influence your decision towards our clearly superior audition.
How old are you?
Twelve.
I think I'm good.
And you, also!
Your dog...
Wow!
Wow.
- I know, right?
- (BARKING)
He's just saying hi.
Sharpay Evans of the New Mexico Evans.
I'm a mega fan.
Oh, you are not!
So am!
I am gonna tweet about you right now.
Shut up!
I follow your tweets.
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)
She did!
She tweeted!
Okay, I don't know how we're gonna decide.
You're amazing!
All this and a grade school diploma.
And you, amazing!
Wow.
I would be excited to work with either one of you and your dogs.
And can I just say, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Because Broadway...
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, real people are watching.
- Wow.
- Me, too.
I am just so excited to be performing on the Great White Way!
Not that I don't love all colors.
Well, I know both these talented dogs want to work with you.
But only one can be in the show.
- How are we gonna decide?
- Wait.
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals?
Wait!
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals!
That way I could see which one I work best with.
- That sounds like a solution.
- We have a solution, people!
Can I just say how totally great I think you are?
You do, and I'll never wash my ears again.
You know what I think?
Well, of course you don't because I just thought of it, but I think they loved you!
I like the way you think!
And you're such a good singer.
And I would know.
- My album went triple platinum.
- Well, I've done quite a bit of theater.
It totally shows.
Listen, I'm gonna have my assistant give you my phone number.
If there's anything that you need, you just let me know, okay?
We girls gotta stick together, right?
- Here.
- Wow.
I mean, this is actually your number!
It looks like any ordinary number, but it's not.
It's yours!
- Oh, and, hey, may the best dog win!
- Thanks!
(SQUEALING SOFTLY)
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Can you believe it?
PEYTON:
You were great!
Boi was great.
This new strategy just might work.
- Amber Lee really likes you, too.
- Is she awesome or what?
She inspires me.
There.
I said it.
Quelle inspired.
We are so gonna get that part.
- How do you know?
- Easy.
I don't do rejection.
Sharpay!
I just wanted to wish you both luck.
Oh!
That's so nice of you.
And suggest that you give up now, while you still have your dignity.
Distant though it already might be.
Sorry, which Smurf are you again?
True, you have talent.
But you lack both the experience and the finesse to ever achieve the Holy Grail of possibility.
- Yeah, but Boi is cuter.
- Countess is a theatrical ninja.
(SNORING)
I'm sorry.
For a minute there you just bored me to death.
I have a foolproof strategy of getting what I want.
See it, want it, have a fit, get it.
- Yeah, well, this playdate's over.
- I hope you enjoy rejection.
- We're gonna get that part.
- We're gonna destroy you.
- Bring it on.
- Oh, it's brought.
All right, Boi.
This foot.
That foot.
Good boy!
Yeah!
Okay, let's try our next one.
Stay.
Catch your tail.
Catch your tail!
Good!
Yeah, good.
Sit.
Stay.
We are so going to take them on.
I'm not gonna let some hobbit get in my way.
And, look.
All Boi can do is think about how horrible that other little mangy dog was.
(WHIMPERING)
If you want success so badly, then you will get it.
All you need is one shot to make it happen.
Yeah, and this is my shot.
It's like my grandmother says.
"God only got one book published,
"and look how well it did for him."
Doing this is all I've ever dreamed about, especially since I already have everything else.
Well, there's still humility.
What's wrong with being confident?
Confidence is when you know you're good.
Arrogance is when you think others know you're good.
Well, I want everyone to know I'm as good as I think everyone thinks I am without them knowing I know they think it.
- And do you have to film everything?
- Yep, 'cause this is my shot.
If my professor loves my film, he talks about it.
Then there's a buzz, then it gets in a festival, then it gets distribution, then I'm signing a studio deal, then I'm getting an Oscar.
(SIGHS)
I always knew I wanted to be an actress the first time I produced and performed the entire production of Snow white.
Full dance, musical numbers, handmade costumes.
I made my brother play all the dwarfs.
Everyone in that pre-school worshipped me.
(LAUGHS)
I just want to wake up every morning and be onstage.
GILL:
Good morning!
Good morning, everyone.
- And welcome to the first rehearsal...
- Of the new Broadway musical.
A Girl's Best Friend!
And you are all amazing.
- No, you are!
- Him or me?
- You!
- No, you!
Me?
Okay!
And heading our superb cast, we are thrilled to welcome one of the biggest stars around,
Amber Lee Adams!
Oh, stop!
NEAL:
Yes!
AMBER LEE:
Guys, come on.
Can I just say that this, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, people can see if you write your lines on your hands!
(ALL LAUGHING)
All right.
Let's rehearse.
I want everybody downstairs with piano, rehearsing the music for the opening number.
Amber Lee and Judith,
I want you onstage so we can block that first scene.
- Let's go!
- Let's go, people!
All right.
Let's start with Boi.
Let's go!
AMBER LEE:
What a perfect goodbye party.
Thank you, Mom!
JUDITH:
I can't believe my little girl is going out into the world on her own for the first time.
I have to, Mom.
And who knows, maybe I'll find fame and fortune!
Actually, reverse that.
(LAUGHING)
- Why is that funny?
- Well...
Because you'd rather have the...
I'll explain later.
Just keep going.
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Pick it up!
Go, go!
A star is about to be born!
Shelby!
Oh!
What's in this envelope?
This very wet envelope.
(LAUGHING)
- Again, I don't get that.
- Keep going.
Gasp!
Actually, that's a stage direction.
You gasp, you don't say "gasp."
GILL:
Simple mistake.
Keep going.
(GASPS)
Shelby!
Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
(LAUGHS)
(BARKS)
Oh, Shelby.
This is the first time we'll be apart.
I wish I could just pack you up in a widdle doggie bag.
(CHUCKLING)
Okay.
Let's get Countess in there and continue.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Shelby and I will both be here when you get back.
You're killing me.
AMBER LEE:
Oh!
NEAL:
That is adorable!
AMBER LEE:
You're right, Shelby!
Why not go with me?
Any place that doesn't want you, I don't wanna be.
Let's see what New York has in store for us together!
Good.
Let's talk about the scene a bit, and we'll do it again.
And both dogs, great work!
Shelby!
Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
What's going on?
The dog.
What is this?
Somebody, please.
The dog is licking me.
All right, all right.
Get me the other dog!
(SIGHING)
Sorry.
What can you do?
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go, go!
(DOG WHISTLE BLOWING)
- GILL:
Why is she twirling?
- What is she doing?
(GROANING)
- Gill?
- Roger!
Figure out what's going on with the dog.
It's not helping me.
- Not helping, people!
- Meanwhile, get the other dog!
Sorry.
What can you do?
AMBER LEE:
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go!
Oh, hey!
(BARKS)
(CAT MEWING)
(CAT SCREECHING)
(CRASHING)
(EXCLAIMING)
How is this helping?
Really.
Am I the only one bothered by this?
Gill?
Okay, everybody, that's 10!
I'll admit you're good.
But we're better.
Give up!
Give up?
Not until there's a Broadway marquee with a picture of my dog so big you can walk by and smell his puppy breath!
I have to take the dogs for a nap.
Union rules.
Thank you.
- You break first.
- No, you break first.
AMBER LEE:
Oh!
- Pretty cute, huh?
- Yeah!
Yes, they are!
I just wanted to tell you something.
This is my show.
I'm America's sweetheart.
They're paying to see me, not you two over-bred fur balls.
So, until I can figure out a way to get rid of you, you better watch your step, otherwise you'll find out the real meaning of going home in a doggie bag.
(CHUCKLES EVILLY)
PEYTON:
This film is cutting together really well.
Do I look amazing?
- The camera loves you.
- I know!
(COMPUTER CHIMES)
Oh, no!
My dad's video-chatting me.
He thinks I live in a penthouse.
I can't let him see that I live in a tiny studio in a filthy tenement.
With a boy in my room!
A boy, by the way, that has no money, and lives in a tinier studio, and who, apparently, has never heard of the word "maid-service"!
No offense.
What of that could possibly offend me?
(PANTING) Oh, my!
Oh, my!
I don't know.
Hyperventilating!
- What do I do?
What do I do?
- Come on.
- Come on.
Hurry!
- (COMPUTER CHIMING)
- All right, scoot over.
Okay, go, go.
- Okay, I gotta get this.
Stop!
Hi, Daddy!
Hey, princess!
How's my little girl?
Overpaying for everything and yelling at total strangers.
(EXCLAIMS) You're practically a native.
Hey, where are you?
That view is spectacular.
Well, there's hardly a penthouse in the city that doesn't have a spectacular view!
So, you the toast of Broadway?
Daddy, you know how I feel about carb references.
Just a little concerned, sweetie.
The last time no one's heard from you for this long was when you found out your gold card wasn't actually made of gold.
Well, I've been busy with rehearsals.
Outstanding!
You got into the show?
Well, it doesn't quite work like that.
It's complicated.
But I know it's gonna work out.
Sharpay, is there something you're not telling me?
You remember the deal, right?
If things aren't working out...
I know, I know.
I have one month to get in the show, and then...
Two weeks, sweetie.
You have two weeks left.
You're sure everything's okay?
It's fine, Daddy.
Well, okay.
We miss you, angel.
Miss you, too.
I love you!
Boi has to get that role.
I can't go home.
Not as a failure.
I need some sort of subtle, visibly crushing advantage over Roger.
Look, why not just trust Boi is talented, that you've trained him well,
- and let fate take it from there.
- Fate?
Fate gave a girl in my graduating class one long eyebrow.
I can't trust fate.
Some matters you just have to take into your own hands.
What do you mean you forgot my bottled water?
Well, I was going to get those magazines that you said you wanted from across town, and I got hit by a bike messenger.
So I went to the hospital for, like, just one second to get these stitches.
And meanwhile, I had no water!
I will get it for you right now.
Now I've had to drink tap!
- I am so sorry.
- (MOCKING) "I am so sorry."
- I will do better.
- Forget it, okay?
Aside from catching some shade from the shadow cast by your madam's apple, you're of no use to me.
You're... (WHIMPERING) fired!
(CRYING) God!
Amber Lee?
Oh, wow!
You look so cute, Sharpie!
- Sharpay.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
So, tell me, what's on your mind?
I just saw your assistant leave in tears.
She's not my assistant.
She quit.
No wonder she was crying.
Yeah, I don't think she even really cared.
Next time I should probably just hire a best friend instead.
Wait!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
What are you thinking that I should be thinking?
I could help you out until you replace her.
That is what I was thinking about thinking.
Of course this can't, in any way, affect your decision of which dog gets the starring role.
Oh, it won't.
I couldn't live with myself if I thought I did anything unfair.
You have my word.
Hey, I know!
How about dinner?
- That sounds awesome!
- Right?
Get me a reservation for two at someplace fantastic.
Then call my agent, have her meet me.
Right.
Sure.
Oh.
I won't forget this.
And I promise, it won't be because you're helping me if I happen to take a little extra liking to Girl.
- Boi.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
Oh, and can you take my mic down to the sound guy
- and tell him the wire hurts my scalp.
- Okay.
You're the best.
Amber Lee says the wire is hurting her scalp.
Personally, I think she's using the wrong shampoo, but she's the star, and you know, I don't wanna say anything.
You're hot.
Excuse me?
You're hot.
Okay.
Even though theater lighting highlights my natural skin tones, thank you for noticing, that's a little rude, don't you think?
No.
Your mic's hot.
It means it's on.
You see that little switch.
When it's flipped over like that, it means it's on and it's going through the entire theater.
Well, you could have led with that part, thank you.
Amber Lee's got a great scalp!
(LAUGHS) You're hot.
Then she asked me to help her out after her assistant quit.
And after I suggested it.
Are you sure this is wise?
I'm sorry.
Let me re-phrase that.
This isn't wise.
It's perfect.
Amber Lee will see that she and I are exactly alike, we'll become BFFs, she'll make sure Boi gets the role, then his fame becomes my fame!
I mean, this is the advantage I've been waiting for!
Isn't it more like taking advantage?
And my father thought I couldn't do this in a month.
It's turning out better than I imagined.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Sure.
Be right over.
(SIGHING)
Hello?
Oh, thank goodness.
In here, quickly.
I just...
I can't reach that.
Can't reach it?
Okay, it was a little bit of a test.
Only a true friend would come all the way down here at this hour and help me with something like that.
- So, I passed?
- Yes.
(GIGGLING)
- But, seriously, the purse.
- Okay.
Thank you.
All right, here's your bag.
Here's your other bag.
Oh, and don't forget your photo shoot.
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
You must be at that photo shoot to make sure I look as fabulous as you always do.
- Are you serious?
- Serious?
You're now also my stylist.
You have to tell me all your secrets.
Okay, gotta go.
"Life is so strange.
"Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune,
"and instead, we find love."
Hey!
How about dinner?
Split some egg rolls at Wok This Way?
Can't.
I have to highlight script changes for Amber Lee, then highlight her hair.
Highlight of my night!
Okay.
But I miss spending time with you.
And you did promise to shoot some more stuff for my film.
You know, what I'm doing is important, too.
Oh.
For a minute there, you sounded like Amber Lee.
"Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you."
Bad news.
My maid quit.
So, here's a list of chores.
Chores?
And I want to talk to you about Boi.
But you have to promise it'll stay between us.
Okay.
I think I'm going to ask the director to give Boi the part.
- Are you serious?
- Almost positive!
You won't be sorry.
Trust me.
I know.
(RUMBLING)
Oh!
Oh, no.
There are some changes for the blocking in the dog scene, top of act two.
Countess can learn these in no time.
She's got a memory like a digital hard drive.
- No bark and all mega-bite.
- Funny.
I need to find Sharpay and make sure she gets them.
Boi is doing the first run-through tomorrow.
I'd be more than happy to deliver them to her.
- Great.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Sharpay?
(SIGHS)
That's unfortunate.
And I've been here ever since.
Life is so strange.
Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune, and instead, we find love.
Lenore, I have something to ask you.
We have something to ask you.
(BARKING)
He's supposed to come from the other side of the stage with the ring box!
Yeah, sorry.
We changed that blocking.
What happened?
What is wrong with this dog?
And is he okay?
It's not his fault.
He's just a little dog!
He's just so sweet.
GILL:
Okay, everybody.
Let's break for a few.
That's 10, people.
I'm aware.
I know.
SHARPAY:
I don't know what happened.
We sent out the script changes, but Boi didn't do them.
But I didn't get any new script change.
(SIGHS)
I looked everywhere last night to give them to you.
I guess working for Amber Lee has its drawbacks.
- You did this on purpose.
- That's a complete...
Yeah.
You're threatened because you know Amber Lee is gonna choose Boi.
Not after today she won't.
Okay.
Countess doesn't have half the personality that Boi has.
And Boi doesn't have half the talent that Countess has.
Isn't that right, girl?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Has anyone seen Boi?
- No, sorry.
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Anyone seen Countess?
- Nope.
- Countess?
- Boi?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
- Hello?
- Boi and Countess are gone!
Gone!
What?
We have to find them!
Wait, where are you now?
Leaving the theater.
We're gonna look around here.
Can you look near the apartment in case they come back?
Yeah, yeah.
Of course.
Just keep me posted, and I'll call you if they show up.
Okay.
What if they were dog-napped?
Do you think we pushed them too hard?
- I don't know.
- Countess is über-sensitive.
She cries watching dog food commercials!
I just hope they're not huddled in a corner somewhere.
Afraid, lost, at each other's throats!
(SINGING) You knowyou love me I know you care
Just shout whenever And I'll be there
You are my love You are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item?
Girl, quit playin'
"We're just friends," What are you sayin'?
Said, "There's another" And looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine
I'm goin' down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around
And I'm like baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby...
SHARPAY:
What if we never see them again?
They're smart dogs.
Smarter than we are.
They'll be okay.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Oh, no.
It's my dad.
I just...
I can't deal with him right now.
(BOI BARKING)
- Countess!
- Boi!
Hi!
I missed you!
You're back!
It's amazing.
They came back to the apartment.
Thanks, Peyton.
Oh, and Sharpay, it's still on.
Bring it.
You're back!
Yeah!
You bad, bad boy, Boi.
I'm just glad you're okay.
He and Countess had an adventure.
She probably coaxed him into joining a doggy gang or something.
We'd better check him over for tattoos.
Are you so lost in what you're doing that you haven't noticed?
Noticed what?
Boi and Countess are in love.
- With what?
- Each other.
No way!
You're right.
He's dilated.
He's got puppy dog eyes.
How could I have not noticed puppy love?
Well, there's a lot you haven't noticed.
Like lately, you've had no time for me.
You know, I was counting on you to help me finish my film.
I said I would, and I will.
Things have become complicated.
It's not that complicated.
Amber Lee is using you, and you're letting her.
You don't know what you're talking about.
- I don't?
- No!
Where's the Sharpay that was determined not to go back home because she didn't want to work for anyone?
Why don't you tell me?
Working for someone, that's where.
- So at least be honest as to why.
- I know what I'm doing.
You've sold your soul to get Boi in that show, rather than trust in the dog that you raised.
Even worse, you've stopped trusting that your own talents would get you where you need to go.
And maybe you're jealous because I'm on my way up with a new famous friend, and you're just a student making a film about someone else's life instead of your own.
You don't have to be in my movie anymore.
I get it.
You have more important things to do.
Fine!
One question?
What happened to that hot pink whirlwind of confidence and ambition
I saw through my lens that first day you got here?
I mean, that girl knew she was special.
That girl knew she didn't have to do any of this to succeed.
What happened to her, huh?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello.
Oh, and Sharpay, can you remember to invite as many people from my fan club as possible to opening-night dress rehearsal?
I want the theater filled with people who love me as much as you do!
Sure.
You know what would be great after all this work?
A long, luxurious spa bath.
(SIGHING) Sounds amazing!
Thank you.
Run one for me, will you?
And then you can finish these.
You're the best!
(SIGHING)
- This is a big change.
- Huge change!
I don't think you're hearing me!
GILL:
New Jersey can hear you!
The name of the show is A Girl's Best Friend.
I didn't tell you to change the title.
But you want the best friend written out!
Oh.
Right.
Change the title!
GILL:
How are we supposed to get rid of one of our main characters a day before our dress rehearsal in front of an audience?
The audience is coming to see me.
You change that dog's part to a bark and play dead, or I don't go on.
Let's be reasonable here.
I'm a star.
I don't have to be reasonable!
Look, those mangy mutts are bothering me almost as much as their disposable owners.
I actually had to have one of them clean my toilet just to keep her away.
She thinks she's an actress.
(AMBER LEE LAUGHS)
She acts all right.
She acts just like every other obsessed fan.
Wait.
Everything you said...
You were...
Right?
Yes.
Thank you.
You must think I'm a total fool.
No.
Not total.
Maybe my dad was right.
(CRYING) Maybe I'm not ready for this.
Maybe I should just go home and... (STAMMERING) work for him.
I mean, did I really think I was just gonna come to Broadway and be a star?
Yes.
Because that's exactly how you think.
It's perfect.
Perfect is so hard.
And it doesn't prepare you for disappointment.
Well, if it helps, you still look adorable, even when you're disappointed.
Yeah, that doesn't help.
Look, Sharpay.
There is not a marquee big enough or lights bright enough to contain the fame you're gonna have.
Yeah, but not the way I've been doing it.
(SNIFFLING)
Like you said, the Sharpay you know isn't the Sharpay that has become the Sharpay that is this Sharpay.
Did all the Sharpays follow that?
I sacrificed integrity for opportunity.
I let someone insecure distract me.
I cleaned a bathroom!
But worst of all, I disappointed someone I care about.
I forgot what was really important to me.
I lost track of what I want.
And other than maid service and a canopy bed, what is it that you want?
A fair fight.
A lifetime in the spotlight.
And maybe you'll still let me be in your movie.
I guess.
(CAR HORNS HONKING)
(SIGHS)
Okay, I can't say I approve of dating beneath your station in life, but fine.
Go.
(EXCLAIMS)
Hey, I got your text.
What's C-Q-M-T-W-I-L-G-T mean?
"Come quick.
Major trouble.
Wow, I look great today." Duh.
I really should have gotten that.
Listen, Amber Lee Adams isn't what you think.
A self absorbed, two-faced panther who would eat her young alive on a reality show rather than allow anyone to steal her spotlight?
Okay, she's what you think.
Listen, I don't care if her parents had to tie beefjerky around her neck just to get the family dog to play with her, as long as Countess is at her side on that stage.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
She wants the part of the dog written out completely!
- That's not fair!
- Too far.
Well, I am 12, remember?
Roger, we've been fighting the wrong battle, each other.
We need to form an alliance and work against a common enemy.
- Zits?
- Amber Lee.
Trust me, the zit battle is one you won't win.
But what can we do?
Tonight is the dress rehearsal.
The audience will be filled with members of Amber Lee Adams' fan club.
I know, I saw the tweet.
Fine.
Yes, I follow her, too.
Okay, we need to show people exactly who Amber Lee really is.
It's time someone taught her how to behave in the theater.
I like the way you think.
It's manipulative, but for a good cause.
Tell me what you need me to do.
- Hey, Amber Lee, I...
- Where have you been?
I have been trying to reach you all day.
Oh.
Sorry, my phone must have been turned off.
Without asking me first?
I just wanted to say good luck.
You know, I know you chose Countess for this performance tonight, and I'm fine with that.
Well, it was nothing personal, but your phone was shut off, so I couldn't talk to you about it.
I guess that won't happen again, will it?
We're good.
Hug?
Okay.
(ALL CHATTERING)
Hello, everyone.
I'm Gill, the director.
And I'm Neal, the under-appreciated writer.
(ALL LAUGHING)
And we are thrilled that you're here for our first performance in front of an audience.
Does everyone here know how to applaud?
Okay, how about the balcony up there?
SHARPAY:
Okay, now.
NEAL:
Can you hear us?
You're good!
(VOCALIZING)
- (BARKING) - (SCREAMS)
Will somebody please control these wannabe werewolves?
Hello?
People?
See, this is exactly why I didn't want to do a show with dogs!
I'm the star, not them!
Stage people?
Could somebody please put these rats with rabies out of my misery?
Anyone!
Finally, you idiot!
What took so long?
Now, hurry up and get these flea-bitten fur bags out of here!
- There are people waiting to see me!
- Okay, go now.
You think all those boring freaks with no lives came to worship two no-name mutts?
I don't think so!
I'm the one they love!
Me!
They came to see...
(ALL BOOING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I knew I forgot to tell you something.
Careful, your mic's on.
You did this to me.
You ruined me!
News flash!
You ruined you!
Oh, what do you know?
You're a nobody!
The only reason you even wanted to be my friend is so I'd choose your dog!
No, no.
At first, I idolized you, even more than myself, which isn't easy.
But you're not at all what I thought you were.
(SCOFFS)
You and I are exactly alike.
Except I don't enjoy letting people down.
I don't use people to feel better about myself.
And I definitely don't wear yellow and orange in the same week, let alone the same outfit, okay?
Maybe I did think you and I were alike, but not anymore.
In fact, I'd be embarrassed if someone thought I was like you.
Well, I quit!
And without me, there's no show.
Now neither one of your furry little friends will have their shot and neither will you.
Blame her!
I'm sorry.
Someone had to say it.
I'll go talk some sense into her.
You, out of this theater right now.
Wait, Sharpay.
If you go, then I'll go, too.
No.
You wanted this as badly as I did.
This mess was my idea.
You win.
That's not what it feels like.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
- Hey.
Can I come in?
- Sure.
- So, you're really leaving, huh?
- Yeah.
I'm packing my carry-on stuff first.
- I wish you weren't going.
- Me, too.
Have you thought about what you're gonna do now?
Move home where there's enough room for my pores to open, spend months in the spa getting this layer of New York grime off my skin, and mostly miss you.
Look, I know exactly how to help that.
Don't go.
I already talked to my dad.
I guess I'm gonna start...
(STAMMERING)
- You don't have to say it.
- Thank you.
What about your dream of being a star?
It's still there.
It's just a little bit more of a dream than a reality.
- You know what today is?
- What?
I got here exactly one month ago.
My time was up tonight anyway.
Well, so then you still have eight hours.
This isn't how my movie's supposed to end.
I guess it is.
(PHONE RINGING)
This is Sharpay.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
No, no.
I'll be there.
(SIGHS)
That was the stage manager.
They want me to come to the theater and clear out Boi's things.
I can go with you if you want.
I want.
GILL:
And, so, Amber Lee has quit.
- Gone.
- Kaput.
NEAL:
The producers feel, without a star, we can't open.
The time it would take to find someone who could learn the role and do it well might take weeks, and it would cost too much to keep the production going.
But we want you all to know, it was great almost working with you.
- I'm gonna meet you outside.
- All right.
GILL:
Thank you for your hard work.
We are so, so sorry, people.
Wait!
Wait, it's not over.
It's not over.
Look, it doesn't have to be.
Look, there is someone who knows the part by heart and who is amazing.
All right, maybe she's not a star yet, but she will be.
This show will make her one.
Just watch.
SHARPAY:
Boi, keep your voice down.
Peyton, start shooting the rehearsal.
Boi, go mark.
Go mark.
Good!
Okay, stay.
Stay.
I love when you use that accent, but...
(SHUSHING)
We're not supposed to be in here.
Okay, now let's do the scene where the character Lenore thinks she's lost everything and you come over to console her.
Come on.
Shelby, what is going on?
I feel invisible here.
Nothing is working out the way I planned it.
(SINGING) I got something inside ofme
Something that needs to be heard
Deep down a voice is guiding me
Hidden emotions have stirred
Why have I let others lead the way
When all along I know what it is I want to say
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
I thought I had a perfect plan
Where I would wind up on top
One day I'm thinking, "Yes I can"
Next thing you know, I'm a flop
Why did I ever play this silly game?
I got to shake up the rules
And stake my claim
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
What if I missed my window?
What if I blew my shot?
What if the only chance I was going to get
I already got?
I'm not ready to turn the page
Until I'm on stage in a show
No, nobody move I've got something to prove
Don't you know?
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
(HUMMING)
PEYTON:
Well, did I tell you?
(LAUGHING)
- Amazing!
- Amazing!
You're amahzing!
You have more depth, range and tone in one note than Amber Lee had in her entire surgically reshaped body.
We'll promote you as "The girl who we're promoting."
The producers will love it.
Wait, wait.
What are you saying?
We need you to save the show.
- Seriously?
- We know it's a risk.
- A gamble.
- A risk.
Did I do "risk" already?
You did.
And, true, we did fire you.
- He fired you.
- But now I'm un-firing you.
- Can we do that?
- Just did.
- Good for us!
- We need you.
What do you say?
Um... (STAMMERING) I guess we could take the costumes in a few sizes and get everyone used to hearing the songs sung on key,
but there's one condition.
Boi and Countess split the role of Shelby the dog equally.
Done!
NEAL:
We've a lot of work to do, people!
- GILL:
Are we crazy?
- Crazy for theater!
- Let's rehearse!
- Let's rehearse, people!
GILL:
Where are those wonderful dogs?
- Thank you.
- This is it.
The chance you've been waiting for.
(PEYTON SIGHING)
- What if I'm not ready for this?
- Oh, you're ready.
"Ready" isn't as ready as you are.
- What if I'm horrible?
- Won't happen.
- What if I forget my lines?
- Impossible.
- What if I...
- Everything in your life so far has been leading you to this moment.
Your moment.
Embrace it.
I'm scared.
Finally.
Let's rehearse, people!
(GIRLS SQUEALING)
GIRL:
Over here!
REPORTER:
Mr. Pinto, Mr. Pinto, over here.
Mr. Pinto, look this way.
(ALL CHATTERING)
(INAUDIBLE)
(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
(SINGING) I've got a feeling inside of me
Running all through my veins
It's like electrical energy
A world about to change
It's an open road
So here I go
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
I'm gonna go for it all out
I know there's no guarantee
But I've been given a chance and now
What's next is up to me
I'm gonna set my sights
So light those lights
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
If all the world's a stage
I'm here to take my place
I know I'll always find a way to shine
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
It starts with a dream
Of who I could be
Wherever it takes me I can't wait
So I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
(ALL APPLAUDING)
SHARPAY:
I want fabulous That is my simple request
All things fabulous Bigger and better and best
I need something inspiring to help me get along
I need a little fabulous Is that so wrong?
Fetch me my Jimmy Choo flip-flops
Where is my pink Prada tote?
ALL:
A summer like never before
SHARPAY:
I want more!
ALL:
She wants fabulous That is her simple request
All things fabulous Bigger and better and best
She needs something inspiring to help her get along
She needs a little fabulous Is that so wrong?
SHARPAY:
Absolutely...
Not!
English
- US
- SDH
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
(SINGING) There's a moment when you realize that something's changed
(BARKS)
And all the bits and pieces start to fit
It's so fab!
When nothing that you know will ever be the same
Ring the bell
(RINGS)
That's my cue
Gotta try something new
Gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
Yeah
Listen up, fellas.
Now there's nothing in this universe to hold me back
Bye, Gab.
No endless night can keep me in the dark
And I just might give my dear old dad a heart attack
- But he'll live
- He'll live
- And he'll see
- He'll see
What his girl is meant to be
Gonna shine
And leave the past behind
Gonna try to fly so high
Gonna climb and make the prize all mine
Then I'll write my name in letters across the sky
I'm gonna shine
And if my present luminescent state is second rate
I'll turn it up a notch past nine
And watch the world go blind
Got a diva dazzle that you just can't touch
Like an angel in Armani I'm too fabulous
They'll be lining up for blocks Once I bop to the top
With a poochie in my Gucci I just can't be stopped
I'm gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
There she is.
Wonderful!
WOMAN 1:
Hi!
- I know, I know.
- WOMAN 2:
I loved it.
Excuse us.
There's our little superstar!
Princess, you had better watch out for law enforcement.
They are gonna come after you for stealing the show!
Honey, on a scale of one to 10, you were an entirely different scale.
And you know my aversion to scales.
Sharpay!
Yes, I know.
And thank you.
We'd like to introduce you to Jerry Taylor.
He's a good friend of our family, visiting for the week.
May I just say how wonderful you were?
As many times as you'd like!
(ALL LAUGHING)
I really see a unique talent here.
I mean, a true gift.
And your kind, true words are a gift as well.
It was so nice to meet you.
But if you'll excuse me, my friends have been waiting.
I'm a casting agent from New York.
And will keep waiting until I tell you how much I love your suit.
(ALL LAUGHING)
I'm about to start casting for a new musical on Broadway.
Broadway?
As in "Broadway?"
Yeah.
And I think that there is a perfect part.
I would be more than happy to arrange an audition if you happen to find yourself in the Big Apple any time soon.
That would be...
I would be...
It would be, like...
The show is gonna star Amber Lee Adams.
- No.
- Yeah.
Stop.
Seriously, stop.
Who's Amber Lee Adams?
She's only the most amazing performer ever!
We have so much in common.
I won't keep you.
It was so nice to meet you, Sharpay.
Congratulations again.
And, who knows, maybe we'll see you in New York.
Okay?
- Congrats!
- Bye.
Toodles!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
- No!
- No?
I don't understand!
What language is that?
No, I don't think going to New York is a good idea.
(EXHALING) See, there you go, believing everything you think.
Do you really believe you're ready for such a monumental step?
Daddy, the main reason I buy such expensive shoes is to take monumental steps.
Sweetheart, when you graduated from high school almost a year ago, do you remember what you said to me?
"How come no one makes a cap and gown in hot pink?"
No.
"How come you get a car and driver and I don't?"
- No.
- "Good luck finding anyone
"to fill the talent-less void of boring and unattractive
"that will exist in these hallways
- "once I graduate"?
- No.
Yes, but you also said that you needed a year to find yourself, to figure out what came next in your life.
That year's almost up, and you haven't found anything.
It's a small town.
I mean, there's only so many places to look.
Besides, I did find something.
A show I wanna be in.
This is more than just a show.
You're talking about going it alone in the big city.
Right!
To star on Broadway with Amber Lee Adams.
Could you really deny the world that opportunity?
I'm sorry, princess.
But nothing you've shown me convinces me you're ready for something like this.
Okay, ladies.
Team Sharpay.
Mission:
New York.
Daddy says I'm not ready for this.
So, what does that mean?
You pout, throw a tantrum, and he buys you a new Burberry bag to make you feel better?
That's good, but no.
It means we show him I'm determined.
And when I make up my mind...
And no one is better with make-up.
(GIGGLING) ...my mind looks amazing.
Okay, here's your assignments.
I texted Bridget, who e-mailed Constance, who tweeted Bethany, who IM'ed Jenn, who Facebooked Kara, who has an ex-friend who she caught with her boyfriend, who she then dumped, so now Kara's her friend again,
who knows of a New York apartment available in a luxury townhouse.
That is, like, the best house you can get in terms of towns.
- Sounds perfect.
- It gets better.
- It can't.
- But it does.
It is equal distance from both Chanel and wicked.
(SQUEALS)
Okay.
Now, on to travel plans.
That's right.
Albuquerque to New York.
One adult and one dog.
Excuse me?
Coach?
(GIGGLING)
LUPE:
Hi, I'm calling for Sharpay Evans.
Mr. Taylor wanted to set up an audition with her for a new musical.
Two weeks from today is perfect.
(BOTH SQUEALING)
Now, new outfits.
And this would be for opening night.
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
The beading actually doubles the reflection of paparazzi flashbulbs!
You can wear anything.
You should have your own reality show called I Can Wear Anything.
Where you wear anything.
All right.
I'm ready to show Daddy what we've accomplished.
Ladies, and people I don't know,
New York is calling.
And this is one call that is not going to voice-mail.
So, by way of review, this is my shoe closet, that is my bedroom, these are my new clothes and where I'll wear them, and then I'm a star!
See?
(SIGHING) I'm just not totally convinced.
Daddy, you said I haven't shown you anything to let you know I'm ready for this.
But, look, I took matters into my own hands, and without even chipping my manicure.
Sweetheart, it's not as easy as putting pictures on boards.
But I've worked everything out!
And used this pointer.
- I don't know...
- Please, Daddy.
Alone, in New York?
My dear college friend, Michelle, has a son that goes to NYU.
I've met him.
He's a very nice boy.
I could ask her to make sure that he keeps his eye on you.
Are you sure you're ready to take this on?
SHARPAY:
I know I can do this.
I know it like I know purple washes me out and that my eyes are the exact same distance apart to be a supermodel.
What I don't know is whether you believe in me.
Mom seems to.
(SIGHING HEAVILY)
Okay, you have my blessing.
(SQUEALING) Thank you, Daddy!
I'll call my friend Michelle and have her talk to her son.
Thanks, Mom.
There's just one condition.
Fine.
I love a good conditioner.
You have one month.
I'll fly you to New York, I'll pay for your penthouse, but you have to get yourself in that show and prove to me you can take care of yourself.
One month.
- Deal?
- So deal!
But if it doesn't work out, you come back here and work for me.
At the country club.
(STAMMERING)
- Work?
- A job.
That's the deal.
Prove yourself, or come back in a month and work for me.
Fine.
Prove myself it is!
- Look!
- (BOI BARKS)
Look, Boi, look!
- Sharpay?
- In the flesh and pastels!
- We've been awaiting your arrival.
- Then the wait's over!
We spoke on the phone.
I'm Marjorie Grande, the manager for the building.
My pleasure.
Please, follow me to the penthouse.
SHARPAY:
Ooh!
(SIGHS HAPPILY)
I hope this is to your liking.
No.
It's to my loving!
Boi, you've gotta see this.
- That's a dog.
- Try to get him to believe that.
I'm sorry.
There are no dogs in the building.
Sure there are.
See?
The members of the co-op board have a strict no-dog policy.
Well...
My father heads our country club board, so I'm sure that gives me some kind of board immunity.
Miss Sharpay, this building is pleased to have you.
This dog...
Not so pleased.
Miss Grande, Ma'am.
If he goes, I go.
What are you doing?
PEYTON:
Filming you.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
Do you always just film totally stunning people on the street that you don't know?
Only when I think the subject is interesting.
And you look baffled and scared and really pink.
So, yeah, interesting.
Are you paparazzi?
I'm a film student at NYU, working on a short film.
The assignment is to capture one unique New York story.
Maybe you're it.
So, you decided to film me without my permission, just for a school assignment?
- Yep.
- How dare you!
And my left side is better for close-ups.
(LAUGHS)
I'm Peyton.
Sharpay Evans.
Actress, heiress, soon to be Broadway legend.
- Wait!
- About 105,
- but it's really not polite to ask.
- No...
I should know my own weight, okay?
No, I'm Peyton Leverett.
Our moms went to college together.
This is crazy!
I was on my way up to your apartment to make sure you were okay.
And here you are.
Right, they told me to expect you.
Well, glad we could finally meet.
- Oh, and this is Boi.
- Well, nice to meet you, Boi.
(BARKS)
So, why are you out here?
Is everything okay?
Not really.
When I rented this apartment online, it never said they don't allow dogs.
And now they won't let us live here.
Yeah, well, it's their loss!
- Do you have someplace else to go?
- Okay, it's my loss and their loss!
(SIGHING) Actually, the only place I have to go is home.
And trust me, that is not an option!
Listen, there's an empty studio in my building, if you're interested.
I'm friends with the building manager.
I'm sure I can make a call.
And...
Well, I'm sure I can make a call and arrange something.
Maybe get you to see it.
(SIGHS)
Well, since I don't seem to have any other options.
Bellman!
Oh, yeah, right. (LAUGHS)
Seriously?
Careful with those!
This is all I have to get by on until the truck arrives with the bulk of my things.
(SCREAMING)
Oh!
That's good.
Okay, now, go outside, and then come back in and give me even more of that it's-the-end-of-the-world look.
Okay?
GIRL 1:
Hey, Peyton.
GIRL 2:
Hey, Peyton!
- What's up?
- Off to acting class.
(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT) "Maggie, the cat is alive.
I'm alive!"
Singing lesson.
(VOCALIZING IN HIGH VOICE)
Cool, guys.
Okay.
Hey, this is Sharpay and Boi.
Hi, Sharpay.
Hi, Boi!
Anyways, gotta go.
See ya, Peyton.
GIRL 2:
Nice meeting you, Sharpay.
PEYTON:
Later, guys.
Okay.
Really, you're going to love this place.
Okay?
Up you go.
Sorry.
It's a pre-war building.
And during the war, they didn't fight for an elevator?
Listen, the building has two things going for it.
It's got something available, and I live here.
(SCOFFS)
(SIGHING) Fine.
But if I break a heel, or a sweat, you're responsible.
Get my bags.
(PANTING)
See?
That wasn't so bad.
Yeah.
Down the hall.
The one with the police tape and chalk outline.
Really?
Kidding.
- You said this was a studio.
- It is.
No way!
MGM was a studio!
This?
This is a roach motel with no room service.
Yeah, a studio apartment.
Sure, from certain angles, it's a bit small.
A two-karat engagement ring is a bit small!
This is a doll house!
- So what do you think?
- Forget it!
I'd need an entirely separate apartment just for my lipsticks.
And where am I supposed to sleep?
- What is that?
- It's your bed.
That is not a bed.
It's a closet with a tongue.
You can't be serious!
- There is one really good thing about it.
- Yeah, sure.
See?
This is my place!
Looking better, huh?
Am I missing something?
Oh, right.
Space!
Luxury!
Maid service!
Let me guess.
You're used to being spoiled.
I'm not used to it.
I just expect it.
You know, half this building is filled with performers who came here with the same ambitions you did.
What makes you so much better than them?
Money, breeding, talent, great hair, perfect jaw line, chic taste.
How much time do you have?
All right, fine.
I tried to help you out like my mom asked, but whatever.
I'll find someone else to film.
The only problem is if I call my father and tell him how I messed up on the other apartment and how I have nowhere to go but here, and I ask for his help, he'll make me come home and...
(STAMMERING)
Work!
- So?
- So?
Then I'll never get my big break.
Oh, and promise you won't call your mother and tell her about this, because then she'll call my mom who will tell my dad, and I don't think he really believes I can make this happen.
He only gave me one month to prove it.
Well, then you've got one month to prove him wrong.
(GROANS)
Why did I do this?
I want my canopy bed and my housekeeper.
And a shower that doesn't share a room with a kitchen.
- Come on.
- Where to?
- Do you trust me?
- You suggested this place.
Yeah.
Point taken.
Come anyway.
Come on.
SHARPAY:
I hope you're taking me to a better apartment than what you just showed me.
Because let me tell you, if that's it?
No way!
Absolutely no!
Just come on.
Just don't ask any questions.
I need luxury!
Are you kidding me?
That was like a green, dark hole that I never wanna be in ever again.
All right, here you go.
Butchy!
- Come on...
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.
Come on.
- Why are we here?
All right, all right.
Now, you're gonna have to close your eyes.
- Close my eyes?
- Yeah, just close your eyes.
- Why?
- Because!
Just do it.
All right, now.
Keep them closed.
- Well, what if I hit into something?
- You won't.
I got you.
All right, all right.
Keep them closed.
All right.
- All right, you got them closed?
- Yes, I do.
All right, all right.
Perfect.
All right.
Now, stay here, keep them closed.
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
Keep them closed.
All righty.
Keep them closed.
All right.
Open them.
Hit it, Butchy!
Wow.
I know.
When I left Indiana to go to school here, I didn't know a soul either, and I was just as overwhelmed as you.
But I had two things, my dream and my camera.
And look at me now.
You still only have your dream and your camera.
Yes, but I met you, didn't I?
So, something's working out.
Well, whenever people meet me, things get better.
(LAUGHS)
Look, you just have to adapt to your surroundings.
And remember that for now this is all just temporary.
Right.
Like prom dresses and first boyfriends.
Look, anything you have to do will be worth it to get your dream.
Okay.
I'm gonna meet with that casting director, get the part,
- be a star and have a palace!
- There you go.
That's the self-indulgent, self-entitled, optimistic pink hurricane
I've been seeing through my lens.
And I like how perceptive you are.
Okay, New York.
Bring it on.
(UPBEAT POP SONG PLAYING)
(SINGING) I used to think maybe you loved me
Now, baby, I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day When you knock on my door
(SQUEALING)
Now every time I go for the mailbox Gotta hold myself down
"Cause I just can't wait till you write me You're coming around
I'm walking on sunshine
(BARKS)
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
(WHOOPS)
- And don't it feel good!
- Hey!
All right now And don't it feel good!
Hey!
All right now, yeah
Hi!
(SHRIEKING)
Turn it off.
Turn it off!
(SINGING) Just waiting foryou
CHORUS:
Just waiting for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day
No, no, no
(LAUGHING)
What?
I want you to stay
I'm walking on sunshine
- And don't it feel good!
- CHORUS:
Hey!
All right now And don't it feel good!
SHARPAY:
Oh, yeah!
PEYTON:
Looking good.
So pink.
You're good.
(BOTH CHATTERING)
- Do you wanna try some?
- No, I don't want any!
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Lay down.
Lay down.
(LAUGHS) Night, Boi!
(SHARPAY SQUEALING)
(MUFFLED) Boi?
Get help!
(BANGING ON DOOR)
(FAKING GASP)
- PEYTON:
Knock, knock.
- Come in!
Wow!
And wow.
Hey, are you on your way to meet with the casting director?
No, I'm on my way to change theater history.
You think this is a good outfit for changing history?
Perfect!
Mind if I tag along and film?
Not that you could ever mind me, right?
I think you should.
After all, not many people can say they were there to film the creation of a legend.
Sharpay!
You made it after all!
Destiny called, and I get great reception!
Well, your timing is perfect.
What's tomorrow like for you?
The first day of the rest of my fame.
Well, all right.
I'll set up your audition for 3:00.
I'll e-mail you the musical number that we'd like you to prepare.
And could you make sure that he's well-groomed and, you know, takes care of any business beforehand.
- What?
- What?
- He?
- Yes.
- Him?
- Him.
- He?
- Yes!
Wait, what?
It's your dog that we want to audition.
He was amazing!
Oh.
(LOUDLY) What?
I mean...
I sent you all the information in response to your e-mail.
I mean, didn't the title of the musical give you any indication?
A Girl's Best Friend?
A Girl's Best Friend!
And I'm here for the girl!
You're here for the girl?
Well, I'm never the best friend!
Oh, no.
No, no.
We wanted Boi.
As the girl?
No, as the best friend.
Wait, wait.
You wanted Boi as the best friend of the girl?
Not me as the girl with the best friend?
Exactly.
Oh, Sharpay, I am so sorry for the confusion.
If you don't want Boi to audition, I would totally understand.
Sharpay.
Sharpay!
Hey, stop.
MAN:
Hey, don't touch the car!
Look, slow down.
Even New Yorkers can't keep up with you.
It's not even me they wanted!
Well, to be fair, the role is for a dog.
If they wanted you, I could understand you being upset.
Why did I come all this way?
Leave my friends, family, a dry, self-hydrating climate?
To follow your dream!
Or at least that's what I thought.
Nothing is turning out the way I planned it!
Plan A. Live in a penthouse and star on Broadway.
Plan B...
Don't have a plan B!
What do I tell my father now?
That you came to a very special city determined to be someone very special, which you are.
Oh, I'm not so special.
I'm just like everyone else.
Maybe a little better.
Look at it this way.
Boi is your dog, and he has an opportunity, so be happy for him.
You're right.
I'm being, you know, what's the word?
When you do something for yourself even though it's not so good for other people?
- Selfish?
- No!
Oh, yeah.
Look, Sharpay, you can't give up.
Okay?
And, anyway, you're officially the star of my film.
I am?
Yeah, you are.
Oh.
So now it's all about you?
Only because I need you here.
Fine.
I'll star in your movie.
Okay.
Good, good!
Okay, change of strategy.
I didn't know you had a strategy, but I like the way you think.
If Boi becomes a success, everyone will see me as well.
After all, I am his entourage.
I am the one who's holding his leash.
His fame will ultimately lead to my fame.
That's what I came here for, right?
Still a little selfish, but heading in the right direction.
We're gonna do this.
It's like I tell the housekeepers.
If you can't see the bright side, polish the dull side.
Yeah, not quite what I was talking...
They want Boi to audition?
It's Boi they will get!
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING ON PIANO)
(SINGING) when a sign ofthe times is the times are extremely tough

Yes, rough

And you need some cheering up
Sit back, relax and watch us do our stuff

Me and my Boi
My Boi and me
(LAUGHING)
Wait!
That's the best audition I've ever seen!
I'm Gill Samms, the director.
Neal Roberts, writer.
That was amazing!
Chills.
Feel my hand...
I won't feel your hand, but I believe you.
I won't feel your hand either, but I believe you, too.
That is one special dog.
We've done special here.
Special has been done, people!
Boi was meant for Broadway.
We both were.
(BARKS)
So, when do we start?
Well, there's one more waiting.
One more!
One more, people!
Could you take a seat in the front row, please?
There.
Now.
Roger Elliston
the third.
And his dog, Countess.
FYI, I'm Roger.
As you can see by our extensive resume, hand-printed on carbonless, environmental-friendly rice paper,
Countess has numerous major Broadway credits under her paws, including The Collar Purple Three Puppy Opera, and the original Broadway cast production of A Wagging Tail of Two Cities, a musical opera in German.
Major pedigree.
I'm impressed.
This is us impressed.
Plus, she can bark a high C with sustained vibrato.
Sure, but only dogs can hear it.
(LAUGHING)
All right.
Let's see what Countess can do.

(LAUGHING)
That's the best audition I've ever seen!
- Amazing!
I weeped!
- Wept.
GILL:
I wept!
- I wept!
- And not just regular weeping.
Theater weeping!
Amber Lee, what do you think?
Yes.
Amber Lee, thoughts?
Wow...
We are so meant to be BFFs!
Wow! "Wow" is a word, right?
Right.
Wow!
I just hope that the palpable chemistry surging between you and I right now like nuclear fusion won't in any way influence your decision towards our clearly superior audition.
How old are you?
Twelve.
I think I'm good.
And you, also!
Your dog...
Wow!
Wow.
- I know, right?
- (BARKING)
He's just saying hi.
Sharpay Evans of the New Mexico Evans.
I'm a mega fan.
Oh, you are not!
So am!
I am gonna tweet about you right now.
Shut up!
I follow your tweets.
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)
She did!
She tweeted!
Okay, I don't know how we're gonna decide.
You're amazing!
All this and a grade school diploma.
And you, amazing!
Wow.
I would be excited to work with either one of you and your dogs.
And can I just say, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Because Broadway...
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, real people are watching.
- Wow.
- Me, too.
I am just so excited to be performing on the Great White Way!
Not that I don't love all colors.
Well, I know both these talented dogs want to work with you.
But only one can be in the show.
- How are we gonna decide?
- Wait.
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals?
Wait!
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals!
That way I could see which one I work best with.
- That sounds like a solution.
- We have a solution, people!
Can I just say how totally great I think you are?
You do, and I'll never wash my ears again.
You know what I think?
Well, of course you don't because I just thought of it, but I think they loved you!
I like the way you think!
And you're such a good singer.
And I would know.
- My album went triple platinum.
- Well, I've done quite a bit of theater.
It totally shows.
Listen, I'm gonna have my assistant give you my phone number.
If there's anything that you need, you just let me know, okay?
We girls gotta stick together, right?
- Here.
- Wow.
I mean, this is actually your number!
It looks like any ordinary number, but it's not.
It's yours!
- Oh, and, hey, may the best dog win!
- Thanks!
(SQUEALING SOFTLY)
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Can you believe it?
PEYTON:
You were great!
Boi was great.
This new strategy just might work.
- Amber Lee really likes you, too.
- Is she awesome or what?
She inspires me.
There.
I said it.
Quelle inspired.
We are so gonna get that part.
- How do you know?
- Easy.
I don't do rejection.
Sharpay!
I just wanted to wish you both luck.
Oh!
That's so nice of you.
And suggest that you give up now, while you still have your dignity.
Distant though it already might be.
Sorry, which Smurf are you again?
True, you have talent.
But you lack both the experience and the finesse to ever achieve the Holy Grail of possibility.
- Yeah, but Boi is cuter.
- Countess is a theatrical ninja.
(SNORING)
I'm sorry.
For a minute there you just bored me to death.
I have a foolproof strategy of getting what I want.
See it, want it, have a fit, get it.
- Yeah, well, this playdate's over.
- I hope you enjoy rejection.
- We're gonna get that part.
- We're gonna destroy you.
- Bring it on.
- Oh, it's brought.
All right, Boi.
This foot.
That foot.
Good boy!
Yeah!
Okay, let's try our next one.
Stay.
Catch your tail.
Catch your tail!
Good!
Yeah, good.
Sit.
Stay.
We are so going to take them on.
I'm not gonna let some hobbit get in my way.
And, look.
All Boi can do is think about how horrible that other little mangy dog was.
(WHIMPERING)
If you want success so badly, then you will get it.
All you need is one shot to make it happen.
Yeah, and this is my shot.
It's like my grandmother says.
"God only got one book published,
"and look how well it did for him."
Doing this is all I've ever dreamed about, especially since I already have everything else.
Well, there's still humility.
What's wrong with being confident?
Confidence is when you know you're good.
Arrogance is when you think others know you're good.
Well, I want everyone to know I'm as good as I think everyone thinks I am without them knowing I know they think it.
- And do you have to film everything?
- Yep, 'cause this is my shot.
If my professor loves my film, he talks about it.
Then there's a buzz, then it gets in a festival, then it gets distribution, then I'm signing a studio deal, then I'm getting an Oscar.
(SIGHS)
I always knew I wanted to be an actress the first time I produced and performed the entire production of Snow white.
Full dance, musical numbers, handmade costumes.
I made my brother play all the dwarfs.
Everyone in that pre-school worshipped me.
(LAUGHS)
I just want to wake up every morning and be onstage.
GILL:
Good morning!
Good morning, everyone.
- And welcome to the first rehearsal...
- Of the new Broadway musical.
A Girl's Best Friend!
And you are all amazing.
- No, you are!
- Him or me?
- You!
- No, you!
Me?
Okay!
And heading our superb cast, we are thrilled to welcome one of the biggest stars around,
Amber Lee Adams!
Oh, stop!
NEAL:
Yes!
AMBER LEE:
Guys, come on.
Can I just say that this, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, people can see if you write your lines on your hands!
(ALL LAUGHING)
All right.
Let's rehearse.
I want everybody downstairs with piano, rehearsing the music for the opening number.
Amber Lee and Judith,
I want you onstage so we can block that first scene.
- Let's go!
- Let's go, people!
All right.
Let's start with Boi.
Let's go!
AMBER LEE:
What a perfect goodbye party.
Thank you, Mom!
JUDITH:
I can't believe my little girl is going out into the world on her own for the first time.
I have to, Mom.
And who knows, maybe I'll find fame and fortune!
Actually, reverse that.
(LAUGHING)
- Why is that funny?
- Well...
Because you'd rather have the...
I'll explain later.
Just keep going.
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Pick it up!
Go, go!
A star is about to be born!
Shelby!
Oh!
What's in this envelope?
This very wet envelope.
(LAUGHING)
- Again, I don't get that.
- Keep going.
Gasp!
Actually, that's a stage direction.
You gasp, you don't say "gasp."
GILL:
Simple mistake.
Keep going.
(GASPS)
Shelby!
Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
(LAUGHS)
(BARKS)
Oh, Shelby.
This is the first time we'll be apart.
I wish I could just pack you up in a widdle doggie bag.
(CHUCKLING)
Okay.
Let's get Countess in there and continue.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Shelby and I will both be here when you get back.
You're killing me.
AMBER LEE:
Oh!
NEAL:
That is adorable!
AMBER LEE:
You're right, Shelby!
Why not go with me?
Any place that doesn't want you, I don't wanna be.
Let's see what New York has in store for us together!
Good.
Let's talk about the scene a bit, and we'll do it again.
And both dogs, great work!
Shelby!
Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
What's going on?
The dog.
What is this?
Somebody, please.
The dog is licking me.
All right, all right.
Get me the other dog!
(SIGHING)
Sorry.
What can you do?
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go, go!
(DOG WHISTLE BLOWING)
- GILL:
Why is she twirling?
- What is she doing?
(GROANING)
- Gill?
- Roger!
Figure out what's going on with the dog.
It's not helping me.
- Not helping, people!
- Meanwhile, get the other dog!
Sorry.
What can you do?
AMBER LEE:
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go!
Oh, hey!
(BARKS)
(CAT MEWING)
(CAT SCREECHING)
(CRASHING)
(EXCLAIMING)
How is this helping?
Really.
Am I the only one bothered by this?
Gill?
Okay, everybody, that's 10!
I'll admit you're good.
But we're better.
Give up!
Give up?
Not until there's a Broadway marquee with a picture of my dog so big you can walk by and smell his puppy breath!
I have to take the dogs for a nap.
Union rules.
Thank you.
- You break first.
- No, you break first.
AMBER LEE:
Oh!
- Pretty cute, huh?
- Yeah!
Yes, they are!
I just wanted to tell you something.
This is my show.
I'm America's sweetheart.
They're paying to see me, not you two over-bred fur balls.
So, until I can figure out a way to get rid of you, you better watch your step, otherwise you'll find out the real meaning of going home in a doggie bag.
(CHUCKLES EVILLY)
PEYTON:
This film is cutting together really well.
Do I look amazing?
- The camera loves you.
- I know!
(COMPUTER CHIMES)
Oh, no!
My dad's video-chatting me.
He thinks I live in a penthouse.
I can't let him see that I live in a tiny studio in a filthy tenement.
With a boy in my room!
A boy, by the way, that has no money, and lives in a tinier studio, and who, apparently, has never heard of the word "maid-service"!
No offense.
What of that could possibly offend me?
(PANTING) Oh, my!
Oh, my!
I don't know.
Hyperventilating!
- What do I do?
What do I do?
- Come on.
- Come on.
Hurry!
- (COMPUTER CHIMING)
- All right, scoot over.
Okay, go, go.
- Okay, I gotta get this.
Stop!
Hi, Daddy!
Hey, princess!
How's my little girl?
Overpaying for everything and yelling at total strangers.
(EXCLAIMS) You're practically a native.
Hey, where are you?
That view is spectacular.
Well, there's hardly a penthouse in the city that doesn't have a spectacular view!
So, you the toast of Broadway?
Daddy, you know how I feel about carb references.
Just a little concerned, sweetie.
The last time no one's heard from you for this long was when you found out your gold card wasn't actually made of gold.
Well, I've been busy with rehearsals.
Outstanding!
You got into the show?
Well, it doesn't quite work like that.
It's complicated.
But I know it's gonna work out.
Sharpay, is there something you're not telling me?
You remember the deal, right?
If things aren't working out...
I know, I know.
I have one month to get in the show, and then...
Two weeks, sweetie.
You have two weeks left.
You're sure everything's okay?
It's fine, Daddy.
Well, okay.
We miss you, angel.
Miss you, too.
I love you!
Boi has to get that role.
I can't go home.
Not as a failure.
I need some sort of subtle, visibly crushing advantage over Roger.
Look, why not just trust Boi is talented, that you've trained him well,
- and let fate take it from there.
- Fate?
Fate gave a girl in my graduating class one long eyebrow.
I can't trust fate.
Some matters you just have to take into your own hands.
What do you mean you forgot my bottled water?
Well, I was going to get those magazines that you said you wanted from across town, and I got hit by a bike messenger.
So I went to the hospital for, like, just one second to get these stitches.
And meanwhile, I had no water!
I will get it for you right now.
Now I've had to drink tap!
- I am so sorry.
- (MOCKING) "I am so sorry."
- I will do better.
- Forget it, okay?
Aside from catching some shade from the shadow cast by your madam's apple, you're of no use to me.
You're... (WHIMPERING) fired!
(CRYING) God!
Amber Lee?
Oh, wow!
You look so cute, Sharpie!
- Sharpay.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
So, tell me, what's on your mind?
I just saw your assistant leave in tears.
She's not my assistant.
She quit.
No wonder she was crying.
Yeah, I don't think she even really cared.
Next time I should probably just hire a best friend instead.
Wait!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
What are you thinking that I should be thinking?
I could help you out until you replace her.
That is what I was thinking about thinking.
Of course this can't, in any way, affect your decision of which dog gets the starring role.
Oh, it won't.
I couldn't live with myself if I thought I did anything unfair.
You have my word.
Hey, I know!
How about dinner?
- That sounds awesome!
- Right?
Get me a reservation for two at someplace fantastic.
Then call my agent, have her meet me.
Right.
Sure.
Oh.
I won't forget this.
And I promise, it won't be because you're helping me if I happen to take a little extra liking to Girl.
- Boi.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
Oh, and can you take my mic down to the sound guy
- and tell him the wire hurts my scalp.
- Okay.
You're the best.
Amber Lee says the wire is hurting her scalp.
Personally, I think she's using the wrong shampoo, but she's the star, and you know, I don't wanna say anything.
You're hot.
Excuse me?
You're hot.
Okay.
Even though theater lighting highlights my natural skin tones, thank you for noticing, that's a little rude, don't you think?
No.
Your mic's hot.
It means it's on.
You see that little switch.
When it's flipped over like that, it means it's on and it's going through the entire theater.
Well, you could have led with that part, thank you.
Amber Lee's got a great scalp!
(LAUGHS) You're hot.
Then she asked me to help her out after her assistant quit.
And after I suggested it.
Are you sure this is wise?
I'm sorry.
Let me re-phrase that.
This isn't wise.
It's perfect.
Amber Lee will see that she and I are exactly alike, we'll become BFFs, she'll make sure Boi gets the role, then his fame becomes my fame!
I mean, this is the advantage I've been waiting for!
Isn't it more like taking advantage?
And my father thought I couldn't do this in a month.
It's turning out better than I imagined.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Sure.
Be right over.
(SIGHING)
Hello?
Oh, thank goodness.
In here, quickly.
I just...
I can't reach that.
Can't reach it?
Okay, it was a little bit of a test.
Only a true friend would come all the way down here at this hour and help me with something like that.
- So, I passed?
- Yes.
(GIGGLING)
- But, seriously, the purse.
- Okay.
Thank you.
All right, here's your bag.
Here's your other bag.
Oh, and don't forget your photo shoot.
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
You must be at that photo shoot to make sure I look as fabulous as you always do.
- Are you serious?
- Serious?
You're now also my stylist.
You have to tell me all your secrets.
Okay, gotta go.
"Life is so strange.
"Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune,
"and instead, we find love."
Hey!
How about dinner?
Split some egg rolls at Wok This Way?
Can't.
I have to highlight script changes for Amber Lee, then highlight her hair.
Highlight of my night!
Okay.
But I miss spending time with you.
And you did promise to shoot some more stuff for my film.
You know, what I'm doing is important, too.
Oh.
For a minute there, you sounded like Amber Lee.
"Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you."
Bad news.
My maid quit.
So, here's a list of chores.
Chores?
And I want to talk to you about Boi.
But you have to promise it'll stay between us.
Okay.
I think I'm going to ask the director to give Boi the part.
- Are you serious?
- Almost positive!
You won't be sorry.
Trust me.
I know.
(RUMBLING)
Oh!
Oh, no.
There are some changes for the blocking in the dog scene, top of act two.
Countess can learn these in no time.
She's got a memory like a digital hard drive.
- No bark and all mega-bite.
- Funny.
I need to find Sharpay and make sure she gets them.
Boi is doing the first run-through tomorrow.
I'd be more than happy to deliver them to her.
- Great.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Sharpay?
(SIGHS)
That's unfortunate.
And I've been here ever since.
Life is so strange.
Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune, and instead, we find love.
Lenore, I have something to ask you.
We have something to ask you.
(BARKING)
He's supposed to come from the other side of the stage with the ring box!
Yeah, sorry.
We changed that blocking.
What happened?
What is wrong with this dog?
And is he okay?
It's not his fault.
He's just a little dog!
He's just so sweet.
GILL:
Okay, everybody.
Let's break for a few.
That's 10, people.
I'm aware.
I know.
SHARPAY:
I don't know what happened.
We sent out the script changes, but Boi didn't do them.
But I didn't get any new script change.
(SIGHS)
I looked everywhere last night to give them to you.
I guess working for Amber Lee has its drawbacks.
- You did this on purpose.
- That's a complete...
Yeah.
You're threatened because you know Amber Lee is gonna choose Boi.
Not after today she won't.
Okay.
Countess doesn't have half the personality that Boi has.
And Boi doesn't have half the talent that Countess has.
Isn't that right, girl?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Has anyone seen Boi?
- No, sorry.
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Anyone seen Countess?
- Nope.
- Countess?
- Boi?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
- Hello?
- Boi and Countess are gone!
Gone!
What?
We have to find them!
Wait, where are you now?
Leaving the theater.
We're gonna look around here.
Can you look near the apartment in case they come back?
Yeah, yeah.
Of course.
Just keep me posted, and I'll call you if they show up.
Okay.
What if they were dog-napped?
Do you think we pushed them too hard?
- I don't know.
- Countess is über-sensitive.
She cries watching dog food commercials!
I just hope they're not huddled in a corner somewhere.
Afraid, lost, at each other's throats!
(SINGING) You knowyou love me I know you care
Just shout whenever And I'll be there
You are my love You are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item?
Girl, quit playin'
"We're just friends," What are you sayin'?
Said, "There's another" And looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine
I'm goin' down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around
And I'm like baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby...
SHARPAY:
What if we never see them again?
They're smart dogs.
Smarter than we are.
They'll be okay.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Oh, no.
It's my dad.
I just...
I can't deal with him right now.
(BOI BARKING)
- Countess!
- Boi!
Hi!
I missed you!
You're back!
It's amazing.
They came back to the apartment.
Thanks, Peyton.
Oh, and Sharpay, it's still on.
Bring it.
You're back!
Yeah!
You bad, bad boy, Boi.
I'm just glad you're okay.
He and Countess had an adventure.
She probably coaxed him into joining a doggy gang or something.
We'd better check him over for tattoos.
Are you so lost in what you're doing that you haven't noticed?
Noticed what?
Boi and Countess are in love.
- With what?
- Each other.
No way!
You're right.
He's dilated.
He's got puppy dog eyes.
How could I have not noticed puppy love?
Well, there's a lot you haven't noticed.
Like lately, you've had no time for me.
You know, I was counting on you to help me finish my film.
I said I would, and I will.
Things have become complicated.
It's not that complicated.
Amber Lee is using you, and you're letting her.
You don't know what you're talking about.
- I don't?
- No!
Where's the Sharpay that was determined not to go back home because she didn't want to work for anyone?
Why don't you tell me?
Working for someone, that's where.
- So at least be honest as to why.
- I know what I'm doing.
You've sold your soul to get Boi in that show, rather than trust in the dog that you raised.
Even worse, you've stopped trusting that your own talents would get you where you need to go.
And maybe you're jealous because I'm on my way up with a new famous friend, and you're just a student making a film about someone else's life instead of your own.
You don't have to be in my movie anymore.
I get it.
You have more important things to do.
Fine!
One question?
What happened to that hot pink whirlwind of confidence and ambition
I saw through my lens that first day you got here?
I mean, that girl knew she was special.
That girl knew she didn't have to do any of this to succeed.
What happened to her, huh?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello.
Oh, and Sharpay, can you remember to invite as many people from my fan club as possible to opening-night dress rehearsal?
I want the theater filled with people who love me as much as you do!
Sure.
You know what would be great after all this work?
A long, luxurious spa bath.
(SIGHING) Sounds amazing!
Thank you.
Run one for me, will you?
And then you can finish these.
You're the best!
(SIGHING)
- This is a big change.
- Huge change!
I don't think you're hearing me!
GILL:
New Jersey can hear you!
The name of the show is A Girl's Best Friend.
I didn't tell you to change the title.
But you want the best friend written out!
Oh.
Right.
Change the title!
GILL:
How are we supposed to get rid of one of our main characters a day before our dress rehearsal in front of an audience?
The audience is coming to see me.
You change that dog's part to a bark and play dead, or I don't go on.
Let's be reasonable here.
I'm a star.
I don't have to be reasonable!
Look, those mangy mutts are bothering me almost as much as their disposable owners.
I actually had to have one of them clean my toilet just to keep her away.
She thinks she's an actress.
(AMBER LEE LAUGHS)
She acts all right.
She acts just like every other obsessed fan.
Wait.
Everything you said...
You were...
Right?
Yes.
Thank you.
You must think I'm a total fool.
No.
Not total.
Maybe my dad was right.
(CRYING) Maybe I'm not ready for this.
Maybe I should just go home and... (STAMMERING) work for him.
I mean, did I really think I was just gonna come to Broadway and be a star?
Yes.
Because that's exactly how you think.
It's perfect.
Perfect is so hard.
And it doesn't prepare you for disappointment.
Well, if it helps, you still look adorable, even when you're disappointed.
Yeah, that doesn't help.
Look, Sharpay.
There is not a marquee big enough or lights bright enough to contain the fame you're gonna have.
Yeah, but not the way I've been doing it.
(SNIFFLING)
Like you said, the Sharpay you know isn't the Sharpay that has become the Sharpay that is this Sharpay.
Did all the Sharpays follow that?
I sacrificed integrity for opportunity.
I let someone insecure distract me.
I cleaned a bathroom!
But worst of all, I disappointed someone I care about.
I forgot what was really important to me.
I lost track of what I want.
And other than maid service and a canopy bed, what is it that you want?
A fair fight.
A lifetime in the spotlight.
And maybe you'll still let me be in your movie.
I guess.
(CAR HORNS HONKING)
(SIGHS)
Okay, I can't say I approve of dating beneath your station in life, but fine.
Go.
(EXCLAIMS)
Hey, I got your text.
What's C-Q-M-T-W-I-L-G-T mean?
"Come quick.
Major trouble.
Wow, I look great today." Duh.
I really should have gotten that.
Listen, Amber Lee Adams isn't what you think.
A self absorbed, two-faced panther who would eat her young alive on a reality show rather than allow anyone to steal her spotlight?
Okay, she's what you think.
Listen, I don't care if her parents had to tie beefjerky around her neck just to get the family dog to play with her, as long as Countess is at her side on that stage.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
She wants the part of the dog written out completely!
- That's not fair!
- Too far.
Well, I am 12, remember?
Roger, we've been fighting the wrong battle, each other.
We need to form an alliance and work against a common enemy.
- Zits?
- Amber Lee.
Trust me, the zit battle is one you won't win.
But what can we do?
Tonight is the dress rehearsal.
The audience will be filled with members of Amber Lee Adams' fan club.
I know, I saw the tweet.
Fine.
Yes, I follow her, too.
Okay, we need to show people exactly who Amber Lee really is.
It's time someone taught her how to behave in the theater.
I like the way you think.
It's manipulative, but for a good cause.
Tell me what you need me to do.
- Hey, Amber Lee, I...
- Where have you been?
I have been trying to reach you all day.
Oh.
Sorry, my phone must have been turned off.
Without asking me first?
I just wanted to say good luck.
You know, I know you chose Countess for this performance tonight, and I'm fine with that.
Well, it was nothing personal, but your phone was shut off, so I couldn't talk to you about it.
I guess that won't happen again, will it?
We're good.
Hug?
Okay.
(ALL CHATTERING)
Hello, everyone.
I'm Gill, the director.
And I'm Neal, the under-appreciated writer.
(ALL LAUGHING)
And we are thrilled that you're here for our first performance in front of an audience.
Does everyone here know how to applaud?
Okay, how about the balcony up there?
SHARPAY:
Okay, now.
NEAL:
Can you hear us?
You're good!
(VOCALIZING)
- (BARKING) - (SCREAMS)
Will somebody please control these wannabe werewolves?
Hello?
People?
See, this is exactly why I didn't want to do a show with dogs!
I'm the star, not them!
Stage people?
Could somebody please put these rats with rabies out of my misery?
Anyone!
Finally, you idiot!
What took so long?
Now, hurry up and get these flea-bitten fur bags out of here!
- There are people waiting to see me!
- Okay, go now.
You think all those boring freaks with no lives came to worship two no-name mutts?
I don't think so!
I'm the one they love!
Me!
They came to see...
(ALL BOOING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I knew I forgot to tell you something.
Careful, your mic's on.
You did this to me.
You ruined me!
News flash!
You ruined you!
Oh, what do you know?
You're a nobody!
The only reason you even wanted to be my friend is so I'd choose your dog!
No, no.
At first, I idolized you, even more than myself, which isn't easy.
But you're not at all what I thought you were.
(SCOFFS)
You and I are exactly alike.
Except I don't enjoy letting people down.
I don't use people to feel better about myself.
And I definitely don't wear yellow and orange in the same week, let alone the same outfit, okay?
Maybe I did think you and I were alike, but not anymore.
In fact, I'd be embarrassed if someone thought I was like you.
Well, I quit!
And without me, there's no show.
Now neither one of your furry little friends will have their shot and neither will you.
Blame her!
I'm sorry.
Someone had to say it.
I'll go talk some sense into her.
You, out of this theater right now.
Wait, Sharpay.
If you go, then I'll go, too.
No.
You wanted this as badly as I did.
This mess was my idea.
You win.
That's not what it feels like.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
- Hey.
Can I come in?
- Sure.
- So, you're really leaving, huh?
- Yeah.
I'm packing my carry-on stuff first.
- I wish you weren't going.
- Me, too.
Have you thought about what you're gonna do now?
Move home where there's enough room for my pores to open, spend months in the spa getting this layer of New York grime off my skin, and mostly miss you.
Look, I know exactly how to help that.
Don't go.
I already talked to my dad.
I guess I'm gonna start...
(STAMMERING)
- You don't have to say it.
- Thank you.
What about your dream of being a star?
It's still there.
It's just a little bit more of a dream than a reality.
- You know what today is?
- What?
I got here exactly one month ago.
My time was up tonight anyway.
Well, so then you still have eight hours.
This isn't how my movie's supposed to end.
I guess it is.
(PHONE RINGING)
This is Sharpay.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
No, no.
I'll be there.
(SIGHS)
That was the stage manager.
They want me to come to the theater and clear out Boi's things.
I can go with you if you want.
I want.
GILL:
And, so, Amber Lee has quit.
- Gone.
- Kaput.
NEAL:
The producers feel, without a star, we can't open.
The time it would take to find someone who could learn the role and do it well might take weeks, and it would cost too much to keep the production going.
But we want you all to know, it was great almost working with you.
- I'm gonna meet you outside.
- All right.
GILL:
Thank you for your hard work.
We are so, so sorry, people.
Wait!
Wait, it's not over.
It's not over.
Look, it doesn't have to be.
Look, there is someone who knows the part by heart and who is amazing.
All right, maybe she's not a star yet, but she will be.
This show will make her one.
Just watch.
SHARPAY:
Boi, keep your voice down.
Peyton, start shooting the rehearsal.
Boi, go mark.
Go mark.
Good!
Okay, stay.
Stay.
I love when you use that accent, but...
(SHUSHING)
We're not supposed to be in here.
Okay, now let's do the scene where the character Lenore thinks she's lost everything and you come over to console her.
Come on.
Shelby, what is going on?
I feel invisible here.
Nothing is working out the way I planned it.
(SINGING) I got something inside ofme
Something that needs to be heard
Deep down a voice is guiding me
Hidden emotions have stirred
Why have I let others lead the way
When all along I know what it is I want to say
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
I thought I had a perfect plan
Where I would wind up on top
One day I'm thinking, "Yes I can"
Next thing you know, I'm a flop
Why did I ever play this silly game?
I got to shake up the rules
And stake my claim
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
What if I missed my window?
What if I blew my shot?
What if the only chance I was going to get
I already got?
I'm not ready to turn the page
Until I'm on stage in a show
No, nobody move I've got something to prove
Don't you know?
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
(HUMMING)
PEYTON:
Well, did I tell you?
(LAUGHING)
- Amazing!
- Amazing!
You're amahzing!
You have more depth, range and tone in one note than Amber Lee had in her entire surgically reshaped body.
We'll promote you as "The girl who we're promoting."
The producers will love it.
Wait, wait.
What are you saying?
We need you to save the show.
- Seriously?
- We know it's a risk.
- A gamble.
- A risk.
Did I do "risk" already?
You did.
And, true, we did fire you.
- He fired you.
- But now I'm un-firing you.
- Can we do that?
- Just did.
- Good for us!
- We need you.
What do you say?
Um... (STAMMERING) I guess we could take the costumes in a few sizes and get everyone used to hearing the songs sung on key,
but there's one condition.
Boi and Countess split the role of Shelby the dog equally.
Done!
NEAL:
We've a lot of work to do, people!
- GILL:
Are we crazy?
- Crazy for theater!
- Let's rehearse!
- Let's rehearse, people!
GILL:
Where are those wonderful dogs?
- Thank you.
- This is it.
The chance you've been waiting for.
(PEYTON SIGHING)
- What if I'm not ready for this?
- Oh, you're ready.
"Ready" isn't as ready as you are.
- What if I'm horrible?
- Won't happen.
- What if I forget my lines?
- Impossible.
- What if I...
- Everything in your life so far has been leading you to this moment.
Your moment.
Embrace it.
I'm scared.
Finally.
Let's rehearse, people!
(GIRLS SQUEALING)
GIRL:
Over here!
REPORTER:
Mr. Pinto, Mr. Pinto, over here.
Mr. Pinto, look this way.
(ALL CHATTERING)
(INAUDIBLE)
(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
(SINGING) I've got a feeling inside of me
Running all through my veins
It's like electrical energy
A world about to change
It's an open road
So here I go
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
I'm gonna go for it all out
I know there's no guarantee
But I've been given a chance and now
What's next is up to me
I'm gonna set my sights
So light those lights
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
If all the world's a stage
I'm here to take my place
I know I'll always find a way to shine
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
It starts with a dream
Of who I could be
Wherever it takes me I can't wait
So I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life

Where is my pink Prada tote?

A summer like never before
SHARPAY:
I want more!

She needs something inspiring to help her get along
She needs a little fabulous Is that so wrong?

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
(SINGING) There's a moment when you realize that something's changed
(BARKS)
And all the bits and pieces start to fit
It's so fab!
When nothing that you know will ever be the same
Ring the bell
(RINGS)
That's my cue
Gotta try something new
Gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
Yeah
Listen up, fellas.
Now there's nothing in this universe to hold me back
Bye, Gab.
No endless night can keep me in the dark
And I just might give my dear old dad a heart attack
- But he'll live
- He'll live
- And he'll see
- He'll see
What his girl is meant to be
Gonna shine
And leave the past behind
Gonna try to fly so high
Gonna climb and make the prize all mine
Then I'll write my name in letters across the sky
I'm gonna shine
And if my present luminescent state is second rate
I'll turn it up a notch past nine
And watch the world go blind
Got a diva dazzle that you just can't touch
Like an angel in Armani I'm too fabulous
They'll be lining up for blocks Once I bop to the top
With a poochie in my Gucci I just can't be stopped
I'm gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
There she is.
Wonderful!
WOMAN 1:
Hi!
- I know, I know.
- WOMAN 2:
I loved it.
Excuse us.
There's our little superstar!
Princess, you had better watch out for law enforcement.
They are gonna come after you for stealing the show!
Honey, on a scale of one to 10, you were an entirely different scale.
And you know my aversion to scales.
Sharpay!
Yes, I know.
And thank you.
We'd like to introduce you to Jerry Taylor.
He's a good friend of our family, visiting for the week.
May I just say how wonderful you were?
As many times as you'd like!
(ALL LAUGHING)
I really see a unique talent here.
I mean, a true gift.
And your kind, true words are a gift as well.
It was so nice to meet you.
But if you'll excuse me, my friends have been waiting.
I'm a casting agent from New York.
And will keep waiting until I tell you how much I love your suit.
(ALL LAUGHING)
I'm about to start casting for a new musical on Broadway.
Broadway?
As in "Broadway?"
Yeah.
And I think that there is a perfect part.
I would be more than happy to arrange an audition if you happen to find yourself in the Big Apple any time soon.
That would be...
I would be...
It would be, like...
The show is gonna star Amber Lee Adams.
- No.
- Yeah.
Stop.
Seriously, stop.
Who's Amber Lee Adams?
She's only the most amazing performer ever!
We have so much in common.
I won't keep you.
It was so nice to meet you, Sharpay.
Congratulations again.
And, who knows, maybe we'll see you in New York.
Okay?
- Congrats!
- Bye.
Toodles!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
- No!
- No?
I don't understand!
What language is that?
No, I don't think going to New York is a good idea.
(EXHALING) See, there you go, believing everything you think.
Do you really believe you're ready for such a monumental step?
Daddy, the main reason I buy such expensive shoes is to take monumental steps.
Sweetheart, when you graduated from high school almost a year ago, do you remember what you said to me?
"How come no one makes a cap and gown in hot pink?"
No.
"How come you get a car and driver and I don't?"
- No.
- "Good luck finding anyone
"to fill the talent-less void of boring and unattractive
"that will exist in these hallways
- "once I graduate"?
- No.
Yes, but you also said that you needed a year to find yourself, to figure out what came next in your life.
That year's almost up, and you haven't found anything.
It's a small town.
I mean, there's only so many places to look.
Besides, I did find something.
A show I wanna be in.
This is more than just a show.
You're talking about going it alone in the big city.
Right!
To star on Broadway with Amber Lee Adams.
Could you really deny the world that opportunity?
I'm sorry, princess.
But nothing you've shown me convinces me you're ready for something like this.
Okay, ladies.
Team Sharpay.
Mission:
New York.
Daddy says I'm not ready for this.
So, what does that mean?
You pout, throw a tantrum, and he buys you a new Burberry bag to make you feel better?
That's good, but no.
It means we show him I'm determined.
And when I make up my mind...
And no one is better with make-up.
(GIGGLING) ...my mind looks amazing.
Okay, here's your assignments.
I texted Bridget, who e-mailed Constance, who tweeted Bethany, who IM'ed Jenn, who Facebooked Kara, who has an ex-friend who she caught with her boyfriend, who she then dumped, so now Kara's her friend again,
who knows of a New York apartment available in a luxury townhouse.
That is, like, the best house you can get in terms of towns.
- Sounds perfect.
- It gets better.
- It can't.
- But it does.
It is equal distance from both Chanel and wicked.
(SQUEALS)
Okay.
Now, on to travel plans.
That's right.
Albuquerque to New York.
One adult and one dog.
Excuse me?
Coach?
(GIGGLING)
LUPE:
Hi, I'm calling for Sharpay Evans.
Mr. Taylor wanted to set up an audition with her for a new musical.
Two weeks from today is perfect.
(BOTH SQUEALING)
Now, new outfits.
And this would be for opening night.
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
The beading actually doubles the reflection of paparazzi flashbulbs!
You can wear anything.
You should have your own reality show called I Can Wear Anything.
Where you wear anything.
All right.
I'm ready to show Daddy what we've accomplished.
Ladies, and people I don't know,
New York is calling.
And this is one call that is not going to voice-mail.
So, by way of review, this is my shoe closet, that is my bedroom, these are my new clothes and where I'll wear them, and then I'm a star!
See?
(SIGHING) I'm just not totally convinced.
Daddy, you said I haven't shown you anything to let you know I'm ready for this.
But, look, I took matters into my own hands, and without even chipping my manicure.
Sweetheart, it's not as easy as putting pictures on boards.
But I've worked everything out!
And used this pointer.
- I don't know...
- Please, Daddy.
Alone, in New York?
My dear college friend, Michelle, has a son that goes to NYU.
I've met him.
He's a very nice boy.
I could ask her to make sure that he keeps his eye on you.
Are you sure you're ready to take this on?
SHARPAY:
I know I can do this.
I know it like I know purple washes me out and that my eyes are the exact same distance apart to be a supermodel.
What I don't know is whether you believe in me.
Mom seems to.
(SIGHING HEAVILY)
Okay, you have my blessing.
(SQUEALING) Thank you, Daddy!
I'll call my friend Michelle and have her talk to her son.
Thanks, Mom.
There's just one condition.
Fine.
I love a good conditioner.
You have one month.
I'll fly you to New York, I'll pay for your penthouse, but you have to get yourself in that show and prove to me you can take care of yourself.
One month.
- Deal?
- So deal!
But if it doesn't work out, you come back here and work for me.
At the country club.
(STAMMERING)
- Work?
- A job.
That's the deal.
Prove yourself, or come back in a month and work for me.
Fine.
Prove myself it is!
- Look!
- (BOI BARKS)
Look, Boi, look!
- Sharpay?
- In the flesh and pastels!
- We've been awaiting your arrival.
- Then the wait's over!
We spoke on the phone.
I'm Marjorie Grande, the manager for the building.
My pleasure.
Please, follow me to the penthouse.
SHARPAY:
Ooh!
(SIGHS HAPPILY)
I hope this is to your liking.
No.
It's to my loving!
Boi, you've gotta see this.
- That's a dog.
- Try to get him to believe that.
I'm sorry.
There are no dogs in the building.
Sure there are.
See?
The members of the co-op board have a strict no-dog policy.
Well...
My father heads our country club board, so I'm sure that gives me some kind of board immunity.
Miss Sharpay, this building is pleased to have you.
This dog...
Not so pleased.
Miss Grande, Ma'am.
If he goes, I go.
What are you doing?
PEYTON:
Filming you.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
Do you always just film totally stunning people on the street that you don't know?
Only when I think the subject is interesting.
And you look baffled and scared and really pink.
So, yeah, interesting.
Are you paparazzi?
I'm a film student at NYU, working on a short film.
The assignment is to capture one unique New York story.
Maybe you're it.
So, you decided to film me without my permission, just for a school assignment?
- Yep.
- How dare you!
And my left side is better for close-ups.
(LAUGHS)
I'm Peyton.
Sharpay Evans.
Actress, heiress, soon to be Broadway legend.
- Wait!
- About 105,
- but it's really not polite to ask.
- No...
I should know my own weight, okay?
No, I'm Peyton Leverett.
Our moms went to college together.
This is crazy!
I was on my way up to your apartment to make sure you were okay.
And here you are.
Right, they told me to expect you.
Well, glad we could finally meet.
- Oh, and this is Boi.
- Well, nice to meet you, Boi.
(BARKS)
So, why are you out here?
Is everything okay?
Not really.
When I rented this apartment online, it never said they don't allow dogs.
And now they won't let us live here.
Yeah, well, it's their loss!
- Do you have someplace else to go?
- Okay, it's my loss and their loss!
(SIGHING) Actually, the only place I have to go is home.
And trust me, that is not an option!
Listen, there's an empty studio in my building, if you're interested.
I'm friends with the building manager.
I'm sure I can make a call.
And...
Well, I'm sure I can make a call and arrange something.
Maybe get you to see it.
(SIGHS)
Well, since I don't seem to have any other options.
Bellman!
Oh, yeah, right. (LAUGHS)
Seriously?
Careful with those!
This is all I have to get by on until the truck arrives with the bulk of my things.
(SCREAMING)
Oh!
That's good.
Okay, now, go outside, and then come back in and give me even more of that it's-the-end-of-the-world look.
Okay?
GIRL 1:
Hey, Peyton.
GIRL 2:
Hey, Peyton!
- What's up?
- Off to acting class.
(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT) "Maggie, the cat is alive.
I'm alive!"
Singing lesson.
(VOCALIZING IN HIGH VOICE)
Cool, guys.
Okay.
Hey, this is Sharpay and Boi.
Hi, Sharpay.
Hi, Boi!
Anyways, gotta go.
See ya, Peyton.
GIRL 2:
Nice meeting you, Sharpay.
PEYTON:
Later, guys.
Okay.
Really, you're going to love this place.
Okay?
Up you go.
Sorry.
It's a pre-war building.
And during the war, they didn't fight for an elevator?
Listen, the building has two things going for it.
It's got something available, and I live here.
(SCOFFS)
(SIGHING) Fine.
But if I break a heel, or a sweat, you're responsible.
Get my bags.
(PANTING)
See?
That wasn't so bad.
Yeah.
Down the hall.
The one with the police tape and chalk outline.
Really?
Kidding.
- You said this was a studio.
- It is.
No way!
MGM was a studio!
This?
This is a roach motel with no room service.
Yeah, a studio apartment.
Sure, from certain angles, it's a bit small.
A two-karat engagement ring is a bit small!
This is a doll house!
- So what do you think?
- Forget it!
I'd need an entirely separate apartment just for my lipsticks.
And where am I supposed to sleep?
- What is that?
- It's your bed.
That is not a bed.
It's a closet with a tongue.
You can't be serious!
- There is one really good thing about it.
- Yeah, sure.
See?
This is my place!
Looking better, huh?
Am I missing something?
Oh, right.
Space!
Luxury!
Maid service!
Let me guess.
You're used to being spoiled.
I'm not used to it.
I just expect it.
You know, half this building is filled with performers who came here with the same ambitions you did.
What makes you so much better than them?
Money, breeding, talent, great hair, perfect jaw line, chic taste.
How much time do you have?
All right, fine.
I tried to help you out like my mom asked, but whatever.
I'll find someone else to film.
The only problem is if I call my father and tell him how I messed up on the other apartment and how I have nowhere to go but here, and I ask for his help, he'll make me come home and...
(STAMMERING)
Work!
- So?
- So?
Then I'll never get my big break.
Oh, and promise you won't call your mother and tell her about this, because then she'll call my mom who will tell my dad, and I don't think he really believes I can make this happen.
He only gave me one month to prove it.
Well, then you've got one month to prove him wrong.
(GROANS)
Why did I do this?
I want my canopy bed and my housekeeper.
And a shower that doesn't share a room with a kitchen.
- Come on.
- Where to?
- Do you trust me?
- You suggested this place.
Yeah.
Point taken.
Come anyway.
Come on.
SHARPAY:
I hope you're taking me to a better apartment than what you just showed me.
Because let me tell you, if that's it?
No way!
Absolutely no!
Just come on.
Just don't ask any questions.
I need luxury!
Are you kidding me?
That was like a green, dark hole that I never wanna be in ever again.
All right, here you go.
Butchy!
- Come on...
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.
Come on.
- Why are we here?
All right, all right.
Now, you're gonna have to close your eyes.
- Close my eyes?
- Yeah, just close your eyes.
- Why?
- Because!
Just do it.
All right, now.
Keep them closed.
- Well, what if I hit into something?
- You won't.
I got you.
All right, all right.
Keep them closed.
All right.
- All right, you got them closed?
- Yes, I do.
All right, all right.
Perfect.
All right.
Now, stay here, keep them closed.
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
Keep them closed.
All righty.
Keep them closed.
All right.
Open them.
Hit it, Butchy!
Wow.
I know.
When I left Indiana to go to school here, I didn't know a soul either, and I was just as overwhelmed as you.
But I had two things, my dream and my camera.
And look at me now.
You still only have your dream and your camera.
Yes, but I met you, didn't I?
So, something's working out.
Well, whenever people meet me, things get better.
(LAUGHS)
Look, you just have to adapt to your surroundings.
And remember that for now this is all just temporary.
Right.
Like prom dresses and first boyfriends.
Look, anything you have to do will be worth it to get your dream.
Okay.
I'm gonna meet with that casting director, get the part,
- be a star and have a palace!
- There you go.
That's the self-indulgent, self-entitled, optimistic pink hurricane
I've been seeing through my lens.
And I like how perceptive you are.
Okay, New York.
Bring it on.
(UPBEAT POP SONG PLAYING)
(SINGING) I used to think maybe you loved me
Now, baby, I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day When you knock on my door
(SQUEALING)
Now every time I go for the mailbox Gotta hold myself down
"Cause I just can't wait till you write me You're coming around
I'm walking on sunshine
(BARKS)
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
(WHOOPS)
- And don't it feel good!
- Hey!
All right now And don't it feel good!
Hey!
All right now, yeah
Hi!
(SHRIEKING)
Turn it off.
Turn it off!
(SINGING) Just waiting foryou
CHORUS:
Just waiting for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day
No, no, no
(LAUGHING)
What?
I want you to stay
I'm walking on sunshine
- And don't it feel good!
- CHORUS:
Hey!
All right now And don't it feel good!
SHARPAY:
Oh, yeah!
PEYTON:
Looking good.
So pink.
You're good.
(BOTH CHATTERING)
- Do you wanna try some?
- No, I don't want any!
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Lay down.
Lay down.
(LAUGHS) Night, Boi!
(SHARPAY SQUEALING)
(MUFFLED) Boi?
Get help!
(BANGING ON DOOR)
(FAKING GASP)
- PEYTON:
Knock, knock.
- Come in!
Wow!
And wow.
Hey, are you on your way to meet with the casting director?
No, I'm on my way to change theater history.
You think this is a good outfit for changing history?
Perfect!
Mind if I tag along and film?
Not that you could ever mind me, right?
I think you should.
After all, not many people can say they were there to film the creation of a legend.
Sharpay!
You made it after all!
Destiny called, and I get great reception!
Well, your timing is perfect.
What's tomorrow like for you?
The first day of the rest of my fame.
Well, all right.
I'll set up your audition for 3:00.
I'll e-mail you the musical number that we'd like you to prepare.
And could you make sure that he's well-groomed and, you know, takes care of any business beforehand.
- What?
- What?
- He?
- Yes.
- Him?
- Him.
- He?
- Yes!
Wait, what?
It's your dog that we want to audition.
He was amazing!
Oh.
(LOUDLY) What?
I mean...
I sent you all the information in response to your e-mail.
I mean, didn't the title of the musical give you any indication?
A Girl's Best Friend?
A Girl's Best Friend!
And I'm here for the girl!
You're here for the girl?
Well, I'm never the best friend!
Oh, no.
No, no.
We wanted Boi.
As the girl?
No, as the best friend.
Wait, wait.
You wanted Boi as the best friend of the girl?
Not me as the girl with the best friend?
Exactly.
Oh, Sharpay, I am so sorry for the confusion.
If you don't want Boi to audition, I would totally understand.
Sharpay.
Sharpay!
Hey, stop.
MAN:
Hey, don't touch the car!
Look, slow down.
Even New Yorkers can't keep up with you.
It's not even me they wanted!
Well, to be fair, the role is for a dog.
If they wanted you, I could understand you being upset.
Why did I come all this way?
Leave my friends, family, a dry, self-hydrating climate?
To follow your dream!
Or at least that's what I thought.
Nothing is turning out the way I planned it!
Plan A. Live in a penthouse and star on Broadway.
Plan B...
Don't have a plan B!
What do I tell my father now?
That you came to a very special city determined to be someone very special, which you are.
Oh, I'm not so special.
I'm just like everyone else.
Maybe a little better.
Look at it this way.
Boi is your dog, and he has an opportunity, so be happy for him.
You're right.
I'm being, you know, what's the word?
When you do something for yourself even though it's not so good for other people?
- Selfish?
- No!
Oh, yeah.
Look, Sharpay, you can't give up.
Okay?
And, anyway, you're officially the star of my film.
I am?
Yeah, you are.
Oh.
So now it's all about you?
Only because I need you here.
Fine.
I'll star in your movie.
Okay.
Good, good!
Okay, change of strategy.
I didn't know you had a strategy, but I like the way you think.
If Boi becomes a success, everyone will see me as well.
After all, I am his entourage.
I am the one who's holding his leash.
His fame will ultimately lead to my fame.
That's what I came here for, right?
Still a little selfish, but heading in the right direction.
We're gonna do this.
It's like I tell the housekeepers.
If you can't see the bright side, polish the dull side.
Yeah, not quite what I was talking...
They want Boi to audition?
It's Boi they will get!
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING ON PIANO)
(SINGING) when a sign ofthe times is the times are extremely tough
- (WHIMPERING) - (SHUSHING)
When you look at the world and the world that you see is
(BARKS)
Yes, rough
When you feel like a long lost pup
And you need some cheering up
Sit back, relax and watch us do our stuff
Two, three, four
We're gonna sit and shake your hand That's how it starts
We're gonna nose our nosy way into your hearts
We'll sing and bark In two-part harmony
You're gonna love us That's our guarantee
We'll bow together on the count of three
Me and my Boi My Boi and me
We make the perfect pair
We've got that savoir-faire
(BARKING)
Me and my Boi
(BARKING)
Me and my Boi
My Boi and me
(LAUGHING)
Wait!
That's the best audition I've ever seen!
I'm Gill Samms, the director.
Neal Roberts, writer.
That was amazing!
Chills.
Feel my hand...
I won't feel your hand, but I believe you.
I won't feel your hand either, but I believe you, too.
That is one special dog.
We've done special here.
Special has been done, people!
Boi was meant for Broadway.
We both were.
(BARKS)
So, when do we start?
Well, there's one more waiting.
One more!
One more, people!
Could you take a seat in the front row, please?
There.
Now.
Roger Elliston
the third.
And his dog, Countess.
FYI, I'm Roger.
As you can see by our extensive resume, hand-printed on carbonless, environmental-friendly rice paper,
Countess has numerous major Broadway credits under her paws, including The Collar Purple Three Puppy Opera, and the original Broadway cast production of A Wagging Tail of Two Cities, a musical opera in German.
Major pedigree.
I'm impressed.
This is us impressed.
Plus, she can bark a high C with sustained vibrato.
Sure, but only dogs can hear it.
(LAUGHING)
All right.
Let's see what Countess can do.
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING ON PIANO)
(SINGING) when a sign ofthe times is the times are extremely tough
When you look at the world and the world that you see is rough
When you feel like a long lost pup
And you need some cheering up

(LAUGHING)
That's the best audition I've ever seen!
- Amazing!
I weeped!
- Wept.
GILL:
I wept!
- I wept!
- And not just regular weeping.
Theater weeping!
Amber Lee, what do you think?
Yes.
Amber Lee, thoughts?
Wow...
We are so meant to be BFFs!
Wow! "Wow" is a word, right?
Right.
Wow!
I just hope that the palpable chemistry surging between you and I right now like nuclear fusion won't in any way influence your decision towards our clearly superior audition.
How old are you?
Twelve.
I think I'm good.
And you, also!
Your dog...
Wow!
Wow.
- I know, right?
- (BARKING)
He's just saying hi.
Sharpay Evans of the New Mexico Evans.
I'm a mega fan.
Oh, you are not!
So am!
I am gonna tweet about you right now.
Shut up!
I follow your tweets.
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)
She did!
She tweeted!
Okay, I don't know how we're gonna decide.
You're amazing!
All this and a grade school diploma.
And you, amazing!
Wow.
I would be excited to work with either one of you and your dogs.
And can I just say, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Because Broadway...
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, real people are watching.
- Wow.
- Me, too.
I am just so excited to be performing on the Great White Way!
Not that I don't love all colors.
Well, I know both these talented dogs want to work with you.
But only one can be in the show.
- How are we gonna decide?
- Wait.
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals?
Wait!
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals!
That way I could see which one I work best with.
- That sounds like a solution.
- We have a solution, people!
Can I just say how totally great I think you are?
You do, and I'll never wash my ears again.
You know what I think?
Well, of course you don't because I just thought of it, but I think they loved you!
I like the way you think!
And you're such a good singer.
And I would know.
- My album went triple platinum.
- Well, I've done quite a bit of theater.
It totally shows.
Listen, I'm gonna have my assistant give you my phone number.
If there's anything that you need, you just let me know, okay?
We girls gotta stick together, right?
- Here.
- Wow.
I mean, this is actually your number!
It looks like any ordinary number, but it's not.
It's yours!
- Oh, and, hey, may the best dog win!
- Thanks!
(SQUEALING SOFTLY)
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Can you believe it?
PEYTON:
You were great!
Boi was great.
This new strategy just might work.
- Amber Lee really likes you, too.
- Is she awesome or what?
She inspires me.
There.
I said it.
Quelle inspired.
We are so gonna get that part.
- How do you know?
- Easy.
I don't do rejection.
Sharpay!
I just wanted to wish you both luck.
Oh!
That's so nice of you.
And suggest that you give up now, while you still have your dignity.
Distant though it already might be.
Sorry, which Smurf are you again?
True, you have talent.
But you lack both the experience and the finesse to ever achieve the Holy Grail of possibility.
- Yeah, but Boi is cuter.
- Countess is a theatrical ninja.
(SNORING)
I'm sorry.
For a minute there you just bored me to death.
I have a foolproof strategy of getting what I want.
See it, want it, have a fit, get it.
- Yeah, well, this playdate's over.
- I hope you enjoy rejection.
- We're gonna get that part.
- We're gonna destroy you.
- Bring it on.
- Oh, it's brought.
All right, Boi.
This foot.
That foot.
Good boy!
Yeah!
Okay, let's try our next one.
Stay.
Catch your tail.
Catch your tail!
Good!
Yeah, good.
Sit.
Stay.
We are so going to take them on.
I'm not gonna let some hobbit get in my way.
And, look.
All Boi can do is think about how horrible that other little mangy dog was.
(WHIMPERING)
If you want success so badly, then you will get it.
All you need is one shot to make it happen.
Yeah, and this is my shot.
It's like my grandmother says.
"God only got one book published,
"and look how well it did for him."
Doing this is all I've ever dreamed about, especially since I already have everything else.
Well, there's still humility.
What's wrong with being confident?
Confidence is when you know you're good.
Arrogance is when you think others know you're good.
Well, I want everyone to know I'm as good as I think everyone thinks I am without them knowing I know they think it.
- And do you have to film everything?
- Yep, 'cause this is my shot.
If my professor loves my film, he talks about it.
Then there's a buzz, then it gets in a festival, then it gets distribution, then I'm signing a studio deal, then I'm getting an Oscar.
(SIGHS)
I always knew I wanted to be an actress the first time I produced and performed the entire production of Snow white.
Full dance, musical numbers, handmade costumes.
I made my brother play all the dwarfs.
Everyone in that pre-school worshipped me.
(LAUGHS)
I just want to wake up every morning and be onstage.
GILL:
Good morning!
Good morning, everyone.
- And welcome to the first rehearsal...
- Of the new Broadway musical.
A Girl's Best Friend!
And you are all amazing.
- No, you are!
- Him or me?
- You!
- No, you!
Me?
Okay!
And heading our superb cast, we are thrilled to welcome one of the biggest stars around,
Amber Lee Adams!
Oh, stop!
NEAL:
Yes!
AMBER LEE:
Guys, come on.
Can I just say that this, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, people can see if you write your lines on your hands!
(ALL LAUGHING)
All right.
Let's rehearse.
I want everybody downstairs with piano, rehearsing the music for the opening number.
Amber Lee and Judith,
I want you onstage so we can block that first scene.
- Let's go!
- Let's go, people!
All right.
Let's start with Boi.
Let's go!
AMBER LEE:
What a perfect goodbye party.
Thank you, Mom!
JUDITH:
I can't believe my little girl is going out into the world on her own for the first time.
I have to, Mom.
And who knows, maybe I'll find fame and fortune!
Actually, reverse that.
(LAUGHING)
- Why is that funny?
- Well...
Because you'd rather have the...
I'll explain later.
Just keep going.
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Pick it up!
Go, go!
A star is about to be born!
Shelby!
Oh!
What's in this envelope?
This very wet envelope.
(LAUGHING)
- Again, I don't get that.
- Keep going.
Gasp!
Actually, that's a stage direction.
You gasp, you don't say "gasp."
GILL:
Simple mistake.
Keep going.
(GASPS)
Shelby!
Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
(LAUGHS)
(BARKS)
Oh, Shelby.
This is the first time we'll be apart.
I wish I could just pack you up in a widdle doggie bag.
(CHUCKLING)
Okay.
Let's get Countess in there and continue.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Shelby and I will both be here when you get back.
You're killing me.
AMBER LEE:
Oh!
NEAL:
That is adorable!
AMBER LEE:
You're right, Shelby!
Why not go with me?
Any place that doesn't want you, I don't wanna be.
Let's see what New York has in store for us together!
Good.
Let's talk about the scene a bit, and we'll do it again.
And both dogs, great work!
Shelby!
Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
What's going on?
The dog.
What is this?
Somebody, please.
The dog is licking me.
All right, all right.
Get me the other dog!
(SIGHING)
Sorry.
What can you do?
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go, go!
(DOG WHISTLE BLOWING)
- GILL:
Why is she twirling?
- What is she doing?
(GROANING)
- Gill?
- Roger!
Figure out what's going on with the dog.
It's not helping me.
- Not helping, people!
- Meanwhile, get the other dog!
Sorry.
What can you do?
AMBER LEE:
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go!
Oh, hey!
(BARKS)
(CAT MEWING)
(CAT SCREECHING)
(CRASHING)
(EXCLAIMING)
How is this helping?
Really.
Am I the only one bothered by this?
Gill?
Okay, everybody, that's 10!
I'll admit you're good.
But we're better.
Give up!
Give up?
Not until there's a Broadway marquee with a picture of my dog so big you can walk by and smell his puppy breath!
I have to take the dogs for a nap.
Union rules.
Thank you.
- You break first.
- No, you break first.
AMBER LEE:
Oh!
- Pretty cute, huh?
- Yeah!
Yes, they are!
I just wanted to tell you something.
This is my show.
I'm America's sweetheart.
They're paying to see me, not you two over-bred fur balls.
So, until I can figure out a way to get rid of you, you better watch your step, otherwise you'll find out the real meaning of going home in a doggie bag.
(CHUCKLES EVILLY)
PEYTON:
This film is cutting together really well.
Do I look amazing?
- The camera loves you.
- I know!
(COMPUTER CHIMES)
Oh, no!
My dad's video-chatting me.
He thinks I live in a penthouse.
I can't let him see that I live in a tiny studio in a filthy tenement.
With a boy in my room!
A boy, by the way, that has no money, and lives in a tinier studio, and who, apparently, has never heard of the word "maid-service"!
No offense.
What of that could possibly offend me?
(PANTING) Oh, my!
Oh, my!
I don't know.
Hyperventilating!
- What do I do?
What do I do?
- Come on.
- Come on.
Hurry!
- (COMPUTER CHIMING)
- All right, scoot over.
Okay, go, go.
- Okay, I gotta get this.
Stop!
Hi, Daddy!
Hey, princess!
How's my little girl?
Overpaying for everything and yelling at total strangers.
(EXCLAIMS) You're practically a native.
Hey, where are you?
That view is spectacular.
Well, there's hardly a penthouse in the city that doesn't have a spectacular view!
So, you the toast of Broadway?
Daddy, you know how I feel about carb references.
Just a little concerned, sweetie.
The last time no one's heard from you for this long was when you found out your gold card wasn't actually made of gold.
Well, I've been busy with rehearsals.
Outstanding!
You got into the show?
Well, it doesn't quite work like that.
It's complicated.
But I know it's gonna work out.
Sharpay, is there something you're not telling me?
You remember the deal, right?
If things aren't working out...
I know, I know.
I have one month to get in the show, and then...
Two weeks, sweetie.
You have two weeks left.
You're sure everything's okay?
It's fine, Daddy.
Well, okay.
We miss you, angel.
Miss you, too.
I love you!
Boi has to get that role.
I can't go home.
Not as a failure.
I need some sort of subtle, visibly crushing advantage over Roger.
Look, why not just trust Boi is talented, that you've trained him well,
- and let fate take it from there.
- Fate?
Fate gave a girl in my graduating class one long eyebrow.
I can't trust fate.
Some matters you just have to take into your own hands.
What do you mean you forgot my bottled water?
Well, I was going to get those magazines that you said you wanted from across town, and I got hit by a bike messenger.
So I went to the hospital for, like, just one second to get these stitches.
And meanwhile, I had no water!
I will get it for you right now.
Now I've had to drink tap!
- I am so sorry.
- (MOCKING) "I am so sorry."
- I will do better.
- Forget it, okay?
Aside from catching some shade from the shadow cast by your madam's apple, you're of no use to me.
You're... (WHIMPERING) fired!
(CRYING) God!
Amber Lee?
Oh, wow!
You look so cute, Sharpie!
- Sharpay.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
So, tell me, what's on your mind?
I just saw your assistant leave in tears.
She's not my assistant.
She quit.
No wonder she was crying.
Yeah, I don't think she even really cared.
Next time I should probably just hire a best friend instead.
Wait!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
What are you thinking that I should be thinking?
I could help you out until you replace her.
That is what I was thinking about thinking.
Of course this can't, in any way, affect your decision of which dog gets the starring role.
Oh, it won't.
I couldn't live with myself if I thought I did anything unfair.
You have my word.
Hey, I know!
How about dinner?
- That sounds awesome!
- Right?
Get me a reservation for two at someplace fantastic.
Then call my agent, have her meet me.
Right.
Sure.
Oh.
I won't forget this.
And I promise, it won't be because you're helping me if I happen to take a little extra liking to Girl.
- Boi.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
Oh, and can you take my mic down to the sound guy
- and tell him the wire hurts my scalp.
- Okay.
You're the best.
Amber Lee says the wire is hurting her scalp.
Personally, I think she's using the wrong shampoo, but she's the star, and you know, I don't wanna say anything.
You're hot.
Excuse me?
You're hot.
Okay.
Even though theater lighting highlights my natural skin tones, thank you for noticing, that's a little rude, don't you think?
No.
Your mic's hot.
It means it's on.
You see that little switch.
When it's flipped over like that, it means it's on and it's going through the entire theater.
Well, you could have led with that part, thank you.
Amber Lee's got a great scalp!
(LAUGHS) You're hot.
Then she asked me to help her out after her assistant quit.
And after I suggested it.
Are you sure this is wise?
I'm sorry.
Let me re-phrase that.
This isn't wise.
It's perfect.
Amber Lee will see that she and I are exactly alike, we'll become BFFs, she'll make sure Boi gets the role, then his fame becomes my fame!
I mean, this is the advantage I've been waiting for!
Isn't it more like taking advantage?
And my father thought I couldn't do this in a month.
It's turning out better than I imagined.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Sure.
Be right over.
(SIGHING)
Hello?
Oh, thank goodness.
In here, quickly.
I just...
I can't reach that.
Can't reach it?
Okay, it was a little bit of a test.
Only a true friend would come all the way down here at this hour and help me with something like that.
- So, I passed?
- Yes.
(GIGGLING)
- But, seriously, the purse.
- Okay.
Thank you.
All right, here's your bag.
Here's your other bag.
Oh, and don't forget your photo shoot.
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
You must be at that photo shoot to make sure I look as fabulous as you always do.
- Are you serious?
- Serious?
You're now also my stylist.
You have to tell me all your secrets.
Okay, gotta go.
"Life is so strange.
"Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune,
"and instead, we find love."
Hey!
How about dinner?
Split some egg rolls at Wok This Way?
Can't.
I have to highlight script changes for Amber Lee, then highlight her hair.
Highlight of my night!
Okay.
But I miss spending time with you.
And you did promise to shoot some more stuff for my film.
You know, what I'm doing is important, too.
Oh.
For a minute there, you sounded like Amber Lee.
"Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you."
Bad news.
My maid quit.
So, here's a list of chores.
Chores?
And I want to talk to you about Boi.
But you have to promise it'll stay between us.
Okay.
I think I'm going to ask the director to give Boi the part.
- Are you serious?
- Almost positive!
You won't be sorry.
Trust me.
I know.
(RUMBLING)
Oh!
Oh, no.
There are some changes for the blocking in the dog scene, top of act two.
Countess can learn these in no time.
She's got a memory like a digital hard drive.
- No bark and all mega-bite.
- Funny.
I need to find Sharpay and make sure she gets them.
Boi is doing the first run-through tomorrow.
I'd be more than happy to deliver them to her.
- Great.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Sharpay?
(SIGHS)
That's unfortunate.
And I've been here ever since.
Life is so strange.
Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune, and instead, we find love.
Lenore, I have something to ask you.
We have something to ask you.
(BARKING)
He's supposed to come from the other side of the stage with the ring box!
Yeah, sorry.
We changed that blocking.
What happened?
What is wrong with this dog?
And is he okay?
It's not his fault.
He's just a little dog!
He's just so sweet.
GILL:
Okay, everybody.
Let's break for a few.
That's 10, people.
I'm aware.
I know.
SHARPAY:
I don't know what happened.
We sent out the script changes, but Boi didn't do them.
But I didn't get any new script change.
(SIGHS)
I looked everywhere last night to give them to you.
I guess working for Amber Lee has its drawbacks.
- You did this on purpose.
- That's a complete...
Yeah.
You're threatened because you know Amber Lee is gonna choose Boi.
Not after today she won't.
Okay.
Countess doesn't have half the personality that Boi has.
And Boi doesn't have half the talent that Countess has.
Isn't that right, girl?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Has anyone seen Boi?
- No, sorry.
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Anyone seen Countess?
- Nope.
- Countess?
- Boi?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
- Hello?
- Boi and Countess are gone!
Gone!
What?
We have to find them!
Wait, where are you now?
Leaving the theater.
We're gonna look around here.
Can you look near the apartment in case they come back?
Yeah, yeah.
Of course.
Just keep me posted, and I'll call you if they show up.
Okay.
What if they were dog-napped?
Do you think we pushed them too hard?
- I don't know.
- Countess is über-sensitive.
She cries watching dog food commercials!
I just hope they're not huddled in a corner somewhere.
Afraid, lost, at each other's throats!
(SINGING) You knowyou love me I know you care
Just shout whenever And I'll be there
You are my love You are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item?
Girl, quit playin'
"We're just friends," What are you sayin'?
Said, "There's another" And looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine
I'm goin' down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around
And I'm like baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby...
SHARPAY:
What if we never see them again?
They're smart dogs.
Smarter than we are.
They'll be okay.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Oh, no.
It's my dad.
I just...
I can't deal with him right now.
(BOI BARKING)
- Countess!
- Boi!
Hi!
I missed you!
You're back!
It's amazing.
They came back to the apartment.
Thanks, Peyton.
Oh, and Sharpay, it's still on.
Bring it.
You're back!
Yeah!
You bad, bad boy, Boi.
I'm just glad you're okay.
He and Countess had an adventure.
She probably coaxed him into joining a doggy gang or something.
We'd better check him over for tattoos.
Are you so lost in what you're doing that you haven't noticed?
Noticed what?
Boi and Countess are in love.
- With what?
- Each other.
No way!
You're right.
He's dilated.
He's got puppy dog eyes.
How could I have not noticed puppy love?
Well, there's a lot you haven't noticed.
Like lately, you've had no time for me.
You know, I was counting on you to help me finish my film.
I said I would, and I will.
Things have become complicated.
It's not that complicated.
Amber Lee is using you, and you're letting her.
You don't know what you're talking about.
- I don't?
- No!
Where's the Sharpay that was determined not to go back home because she didn't want to work for anyone?
Why don't you tell me?
Working for someone, that's where.
- So at least be honest as to why.
- I know what I'm doing.
You've sold your soul to get Boi in that show, rather than trust in the dog that you raised.
Even worse, you've stopped trusting that your own talents would get you where you need to go.
And maybe you're jealous because I'm on my way up with a new famous friend, and you're just a student making a film about someone else's life instead of your own.
You don't have to be in my movie anymore.
I get it.
You have more important things to do.
Fine!
One question?
What happened to that hot pink whirlwind of confidence and ambition
I saw through my lens that first day you got here?
I mean, that girl knew she was special.
That girl knew she didn't have to do any of this to succeed.
What happened to her, huh?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello.
Oh, and Sharpay, can you remember to invite as many people from my fan club as possible to opening-night dress rehearsal?
I want the theater filled with people who love me as much as you do!
Sure.
You know what would be great after all this work?
A long, luxurious spa bath.
(SIGHING) Sounds amazing!
Thank you.
Run one for me, will you?
And then you can finish these.
You're the best!
(SIGHING)
- This is a big change.
- Huge change!
I don't think you're hearing me!
GILL:
New Jersey can hear you!
The name of the show is A Girl's Best Friend.
I didn't tell you to change the title.
But you want the best friend written out!
Oh.
Right.
Change the title!
GILL:
How are we supposed to get rid of one of our main characters a day before our dress rehearsal in front of an audience?
The audience is coming to see me.
You change that dog's part to a bark and play dead, or I don't go on.
Let's be reasonable here.
I'm a star.
I don't have to be reasonable!
Look, those mangy mutts are bothering me almost as much as their disposable owners.
I actually had to have one of them clean my toilet just to keep her away.
She thinks she's an actress.
(AMBER LEE LAUGHS)
She acts all right.
She acts just like every other obsessed fan.
Wait.
Everything you said...
You were...
Right?
Yes.
Thank you.
You must think I'm a total fool.
No.
Not total.
Maybe my dad was right.
(CRYING) Maybe I'm not ready for this.
Maybe I should just go home and... (STAMMERING) work for him.
I mean, did I really think I was just gonna come to Broadway and be a star?
Yes.
Because that's exactly how you think.
It's perfect.
Perfect is so hard.
And it doesn't prepare you for disappointment.
Well, if it helps, you still look adorable, even when you're disappointed.
Yeah, that doesn't help.
Look, Sharpay.
There is not a marquee big enough or lights bright enough to contain the fame you're gonna have.
Yeah, but not the way I've been doing it.
(SNIFFLING)
Like you said, the Sharpay you know isn't the Sharpay that has become the Sharpay that is this Sharpay.
Did all the Sharpays follow that?
I sacrificed integrity for opportunity.
I let someone insecure distract me.
I cleaned a bathroom!
But worst of all, I disappointed someone I care about.
I forgot what was really important to me.
I lost track of what I want.
And other than maid service and a canopy bed, what is it that you want?
A fair fight.
A lifetime in the spotlight.
And maybe you'll still let me be in your movie.
I guess.
(CAR HORNS HONKING)
(SIGHS)
Okay, I can't say I approve of dating beneath your station in life, but fine.
Go.
(EXCLAIMS)
Hey, I got your text.
What's C-Q-M-T-W-I-L-G-T mean?
"Come quick.
Major trouble.
Wow, I look great today." Duh.
I really should have gotten that.
Listen, Amber Lee Adams isn't what you think.
A self absorbed, two-faced panther who would eat her young alive on a reality show rather than allow anyone to steal her spotlight?
Okay, she's what you think.
Listen, I don't care if her parents had to tie beefjerky around her neck just to get the family dog to play with her, as long as Countess is at her side on that stage.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
She wants the part of the dog written out completely!
- That's not fair!
- Too far.
Well, I am 12, remember?
Roger, we've been fighting the wrong battle, each other.
We need to form an alliance and work against a common enemy.
- Zits?
- Amber Lee.
Trust me, the zit battle is one you won't win.
But what can we do?
Tonight is the dress rehearsal.
The audience will be filled with members of Amber Lee Adams' fan club.
I know, I saw the tweet.
Fine.
Yes, I follow her, too.
Okay, we need to show people exactly who Amber Lee really is.
It's time someone taught her how to behave in the theater.
I like the way you think.
It's manipulative, but for a good cause.
Tell me what you need me to do.
- Hey, Amber Lee, I...
- Where have you been?
I have been trying to reach you all day.
Oh.
Sorry, my phone must have been turned off.
Without asking me first?
I just wanted to say good luck.
You know, I know you chose Countess for this performance tonight, and I'm fine with that.
Well, it was nothing personal, but your phone was shut off, so I couldn't talk to you about it.
I guess that won't happen again, will it?
We're good.
Hug?
Okay.
(ALL CHATTERING)
Hello, everyone.
I'm Gill, the director.
And I'm Neal, the under-appreciated writer.
(ALL LAUGHING)
And we are thrilled that you're here for our first performance in front of an audience.
Does everyone here know how to applaud?
Okay, how about the balcony up there?
SHARPAY:
Okay, now.
NEAL:
Can you hear us?
You're good!
(VOCALIZING)
- (BARKING) - (SCREAMS)
Will somebody please control these wannabe werewolves?
Hello?
People?
See, this is exactly why I didn't want to do a show with dogs!
I'm the star, not them!
Stage people?
Could somebody please put these rats with rabies out of my misery?
Anyone!
Finally, you idiot!
What took so long?
Now, hurry up and get these flea-bitten fur bags out of here!
- There are people waiting to see me!
- Okay, go now.
You think all those boring freaks with no lives came to worship two no-name mutts?
I don't think so!
I'm the one they love!
Me!
They came to see...
(ALL BOOING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I knew I forgot to tell you something.
Careful, your mic's on.
You did this to me.
You ruined me!
News flash!
You ruined you!
Oh, what do you know?
You're a nobody!
The only reason you even wanted to be my friend is so I'd choose your dog!
No, no.
At first, I idolized you, even more than myself, which isn't easy.
But you're not at all what I thought you were.
(SCOFFS)
You and I are exactly alike.
Except I don't enjoy letting people down.
I don't use people to feel better about myself.
And I definitely don't wear yellow and orange in the same week, let alone the same outfit, okay?
Maybe I did think you and I were alike, but not anymore.
In fact, I'd be embarrassed if someone thought I was like you.
Well, I quit!
And without me, there's no show.
Now neither one of your furry little friends will have their shot and neither will you.
Blame her!
I'm sorry.
Someone had to say it.
I'll go talk some sense into her.
You, out of this theater right now.
Wait, Sharpay.
If you go, then I'll go, too.
No.
You wanted this as badly as I did.
This mess was my idea.
You win.
That's not what it feels like.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
- Hey.
Can I come in?
- Sure.
- So, you're really leaving, huh?
- Yeah.
I'm packing my carry-on stuff first.
- I wish you weren't going.
- Me, too.
Have you thought about what you're gonna do now?
Move home where there's enough room for my pores to open, spend months in the spa getting this layer of New York grime off my skin, and mostly miss you.
Look, I know exactly how to help that.
Don't go.
I already talked to my dad.
I guess I'm gonna start...
(STAMMERING)
- You don't have to say it.
- Thank you.
What about your dream of being a star?
It's still there.
It's just a little bit more of a dream than a reality.
- You know what today is?
- What?
I got here exactly one month ago.
My time was up tonight anyway.
Well, so then you still have eight hours.
This isn't how my movie's supposed to end.
I guess it is.
(PHONE RINGING)
This is Sharpay.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
No, no.
I'll be there.
(SIGHS)
That was the stage manager.
They want me to come to the theater and clear out Boi's things.
I can go with you if you want.
I want.
GILL:
And, so, Amber Lee has quit.
- Gone.
- Kaput.
NEAL:
The producers feel, without a star, we can't open.
The time it would take to find someone who could learn the role and do it well might take weeks, and it would cost too much to keep the production going.
But we want you all to know, it was great almost working with you.
- I'm gonna meet you outside.
- All right.
GILL:
Thank you for your hard work.
We are so, so sorry, people.
Wait!
Wait, it's not over.
It's not over.
Look, it doesn't have to be.
Look, there is someone who knows the part by heart and who is amazing.
All right, maybe she's not a star yet, but she will be.
This show will make her one.
Just watch.
SHARPAY:
Boi, keep your voice down.
Peyton, start shooting the rehearsal.
Boi, go mark.
Go mark.
Good!
Okay, stay.
Stay.
I love when you use that accent, but...
(SHUSHING)
We're not supposed to be in here.
Okay, now let's do the scene where the character Lenore thinks she's lost everything and you come over to console her.
Come on.
Shelby, what is going on?
I feel invisible here.
Nothing is working out the way I planned it.
(SINGING) I got something inside ofme
Something that needs to be heard
Deep down a voice is guiding me
Hidden emotions have stirred
Why have I let others lead the way
When all along I know what it is I want to say
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
I thought I had a perfect plan
Where I would wind up on top
One day I'm thinking, "Yes I can"
Next thing you know, I'm a flop
Why did I ever play this silly game?
I got to shake up the rules
And stake my claim
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
What if I missed my window?
What if I blew my shot?
What if the only chance I was going to get
I already got?
I'm not ready to turn the page
Until I'm on stage in a show
No, nobody move I've got something to prove
Don't you know?
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
(HUMMING)
PEYTON:
Well, did I tell you?
(LAUGHING)
- Amazing!
- Amazing!
You're amahzing!
You have more depth, range and tone in one note than Amber Lee had in her entire surgically reshaped body.
We'll promote you as "The girl who we're promoting."
The producers will love it.
Wait, wait.
What are you saying?
We need you to save the show.
- Seriously?
- We know it's a risk.
- A gamble.
- A risk.
Did I do "risk" already?
You did.
And, true, we did fire you.
- He fired you.
- But now I'm un-firing you.
- Can we do that?
- Just did.
- Good for us!
- We need you.
What do you say?
Um... (STAMMERING) I guess we could take the costumes in a few sizes and get everyone used to hearing the songs sung on key,
but there's one condition.
Boi and Countess split the role of Shelby the dog equally.
Done!
NEAL:
We've a lot of work to do, people!
- GILL:
Are we crazy?
- Crazy for theater!
- Let's rehearse!
- Let's rehearse, people!
GILL:
Where are those wonderful dogs?
- Thank you.
- This is it.
The chance you've been waiting for.
(PEYTON SIGHING)
- What if I'm not ready for this?
- Oh, you're ready.
"Ready" isn't as ready as you are.
- What if I'm horrible?
- Won't happen.
- What if I forget my lines?
- Impossible.
- What if I...
- Everything in your life so far has been leading you to this moment.
Your moment.
Embrace it.
I'm scared.
Finally.
Let's rehearse, people!
(GIRLS SQUEALING)
GIRL:
Over here!
REPORTER:
Mr. Pinto, Mr. Pinto, over here.
Mr. Pinto, look this way.
(ALL CHATTERING)
(INAUDIBLE)
(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
(SINGING) I've got a feeling inside of me
Running all through my veins
It's like electrical energy
A world about to change
It's an open road
So here I go
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
I'm gonna go for it all out
I know there's no guarantee
But I've been given a chance and now
What's next is up to me
I'm gonna set my sights
So light those lights
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
If all the world's a stage
I'm here to take my place
I know I'll always find a way to shine
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
It starts with a dream
Of who I could be
Wherever it takes me I can't wait
So I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
(SINGING) There's a moment when you realize that something's changed
(BARKS)
And all the bits and pieces start to fit
It's so fab!
When nothing that you know will ever be the same
Ring the bell
(RINGS)
That's my cue
Gotta try something new
Gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
Yeah
Listen up, fellas.
Now there's nothing in this universe to hold me back
Bye, Gab.
No endless night can keep me in the dark
And I just might give my dear old dad a heart attack
- But he'll live
- He'll live
- And he'll see
- He'll see
What his girl is meant to be
Gonna shine
And leave the past behind
Gonna try to fly so high
Gonna climb and make the prize all mine
Then I'll write my name in letters across the sky
I'm gonna shine
And if my present luminescent state is second rate
I'll turn it up a notch past nine
And watch the world go blind
Got a diva dazzle that you just can't touch
Like an angel in Armani I'm too fabulous
They'll be lining up for blocks Once I bop to the top
With a poochie in my Gucci I just can't be stopped
I'm gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
There she is.
Wonderful!
WOMAN 1:
Hi!
- I know, I know.
- WOMAN 2:
I loved it.
Excuse us.
There's our little superstar!
Princess, you had better watch out for law enforcement.
They are gonna come after you for stealing the show!
Honey, on a scale of one to 10, you were an entirely different scale.
And you know my aversion to scales.
Sharpay!
Yes, I know.
And thank you.
We'd like to introduce you to Jerry Taylor.
He's a good friend of our family, visiting for the week.
May I just say how wonderful you were?
As many times as you'd like!
(ALL LAUGHING)
I really see a unique talent here.
I mean, a true gift.
And your kind, true words are a gift as well.
It was so nice to meet you.
But if you'll excuse me, my friends have been waiting.
I'm a casting agent from New York.
And will keep waiting until I tell you how much I love your suit.
(ALL LAUGHING)
I'm about to start casting for a new musical on Broadway.
Broadway?
As in "Broadway?"
Yeah.
And I think that there is a perfect part.
I would be more than happy to arrange an audition if you happen to find yourself in the Big Apple any time soon.
That would be...
I would be...
It would be, like...
The show is gonna star Amber Lee Adams.
- No.
- Yeah.
Stop.
Seriously, stop.
Who's Amber Lee Adams?
She's only the most amazing performer ever!
We have so much in common.
I won't keep you.
It was so nice to meet you, Sharpay.
Congratulations again.
And, who knows, maybe we'll see you in New York.
Okay?
- Congrats!
- Bye.
Toodles!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
- No!
- No?
- No!
- No?
I don't understand!
What language is that?
No, I don't think going to New York is a good idea.
(EXHALING) See, there you go, believing everything you think.
Do you really believe you're ready for such a monumental step?
Daddy, the main reason I buy such expensive shoes is to take monumental steps.
Sweetheart, when you graduated from high school almost a year ago, do you remember what you said to me?
"How come no one makes a cap and gown in hot pink?"
No.
"How come you get a car and driver and I don't?"
- No.
- "Good luck finding anyone
"to fill the talent-less void of boring and unattractive
"that will exist in these hallways
- "once I graduate"?
- No.
Yes, but you also said that you needed a year to find yourself, to figure out what came next in your life.
That year's almost up, and you haven't found anything.
It's a small town.
I mean, there's only so many places to look.
Besides, I did find something.
A show I wanna be in.
This is more than just a show.
You're talking about going it alone in the big city.
Right!
To star on Broadway with Amber Lee Adams.
Could you really deny the world that opportunity?
I'm sorry, princess.
But nothing you've shown me convinces me you're ready for something like this.
Okay, ladies.
Team Sharpay.
Mission:
New York.
Daddy says I'm not ready for this.
So, what does that mean?
You pout, throw a tantrum, and he buys you a new Burberry bag to make you feel better?
That's good, but no.
It means we show him I'm determined.
And when I make up my mind...
And no one is better with make-up.
(GIGGLING) ...my mind looks amazing.
Okay, here's your assignments.
I texted Bridget, who e-mailed Constance, who tweeted Bethany, who IM'ed Jenn, who Facebooked Kara, who has an ex-friend who she caught with her boyfriend, who she then dumped, so now Kara's her friend again,
who knows of a New York apartment available in a luxury townhouse.
That is, like, the best house you can get in terms of towns.
- Sounds perfect.
- It gets better.
- It can't.
- But it does.
It is equal distance from both Chanel and Wicked.
(SQUEALS)
Okay.
Now, on to travel plans.
That's right.
Albuquerque to New York.
One adult and one dog.
Excuse me?
Coach?
(GIGGLING)
LUPE:
Hi, I'm calling for Sharpay Evans.
Mr. Taylor wanted to set up an audition with her for a new musical.
Two weeks from today is perfect.
(BOTH SQUEALING)
Now, new outfits.
And this would be for opening night.
(ALL EX CLAIMING)
The beading actually doubles the reflection of paparazzi flashbulbs!
You can wear anything.
You should have your own reality show called I Can Wear Anything.
Where you wear anything.
All right.
I'm ready to show Daddy what we've accomplished.
Ladies, and people I don't know,
New York is calling.
And this is one call that is not going to voice-mail.
So, by way of review, this is my shoe closet, that is my bedroom, these are my new clothes and where I'll wear them, and then I'm a star!
See?
(SIGHING) I'm just not totally convinced.
Daddy, you said I haven't shown you anything to let you know I'm ready for this.
But, look, I took matters into my own hands, and without even chipping my manicure.
Sweetheart, it's not as easy as putting pictures on boards.
But I've worked everything out!
And used this pointer.
- I don't know...
- Please, Daddy.
Alone, in New York?
My dear college friend, Michelle, has a son that goes to NYU.
I've met him.
He's a very nice boy.
I could ask her to make sure that he keeps his eye on you.
Are you sure you're ready to take this on?
SHARPAY:
I know I can do this.
I know it like I know purple washes me out and that my eyes are the exact same distance apart to be a supermodel.
What I don't know is whether you believe in me.
Mom seems to.
(SIGHING HEAVILY)
Okay, you have my blessing.
(SQUEALING) Thank you, Daddy!
I'll call my friend Michelle and have her talk to her son.
Thanks, Mom.
There's just one condition.
Fine.
I love a good conditioner.
You have one month.
I'll fly you to New York, I'll pay for your penthouse, but you have to get yourself in that show and prove to me you can take care of yourself.
One month.
- Deal?
- So deal!
But if it doesn't work out, you come back here and work for me.
At the country club.
(STAMMERING)
- Work?
- A job.
That's the deal.
Prove yourself, or come back in a month and work for me.
Fine.
Prove myself it is!
- Look!
- (BOI BARKS)
Look, Boi, look!
- Sharpay?
- In the flesh and pastels!
- We've been awaiting your arrival.
- Then the wait's over!
We spoke on the phone.
I'm Marjorie Grande, the manager for the building.
My pleasure.
Please, follow me to the penthouse.
SHARPAY:
Ooh!
(SIGHS HAPPILY)
I hope this is to your liking.
No.
It's to my loving!
Boi, you've gotta see this.
- That's a dog.
- Try to get him to believe that.
I'm sorry.
There are no dogs in the building.
Sure there are.
See?
The members of the co-op board have a strict no-dog policy.
Well...
My father heads our country club board, so I'm sure that gives me some kind of board immunity.
Miss Sharpay, this building is pleased to have you.
This dog...
Not so pleased.
Miss Grande, Ma'am.
If he goes, I go.
What are you doing?
PE YTON:
Filming you.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
Do you always just film totally stunning people on the street that you don't know?
Only when I think the subject is interesting.
And you look baffled and scared and really pink.
So, yeah, interesting.
Are you paparazzi?
I'm a film student at NYU, working on a short film.
The assignment is to capture one unique New York story.
Maybe you're it.
So, you decided to film me without my permission, just for a school assignment?
- Yep.
- How dare you!
And my left side is better for close-ups.
(LAUGHS)
I'm Peyton.
Sharpay Evans.
Actress, heiress, soon to be Broadway legend.
- Wait!
- About 105,
- but it's really not polite to ask.
- No...
I should know my own weight, okay?
No, I'm Peyton Leverett.
Our moms went to college together.
This is crazy!
I was on my way up to your apartment to make sure you were okay.
And here you are.
Right, they told me to expect you.
Well, glad we could finally meet.
- Oh, and this is Boi.
- Well, nice to meet you, Boi.
(BARKS)
So, why are you out here?
Is everything okay?
Not really.
When I rented this apartment online, it never said they don't allow dogs.
And now they won't let us live here.
Yeah, well, it's their loss!
- Do you have someplace else to go?
- Okay, it's my loss and their loss!
(SIGHING) Actually, the only place I have to go is home.
And trust me, that is not an option!
Listen, there's an empty studio in my building, if you're interested.
I'm friends with the building manager.
I'm sure I can make a call.
And...
Well, I'm sure I can make a call and arrange something.
Maybe get you to see it.
(SIGHS)
Well, since I don't seem to have any other options.
Bellman!
Oh, yeah, right. (LAUGHS)
Seriously?
Careful with those!
This is all I have to get by on until the truck arrives with the bulk of my things.
(SCREAMING)
Oh!
That's good.
Okay, now, go outside, and then come back in and give me even more of that it's-the-end-of-the-world look.
Okay?
GIRL 1:
Hey, Peyton.
GIRL 2:
Hey, Peyton!
- What's up?
- Off to acting class.
(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT) "Maggie, the cat is alive.
I'm alive!"
Singing lesson.
(VOCALIZING IN HIGH VOICE)
Cool, guys.
Okay.
Hey, this is Sharpay and Boi.
Hi, Sharpay.
Hi, Boi!
Anyways, gotta go.
See ya, Peyton.
GIRL 2:
Nice meeting you, Sharpay.
PE YTON:
Later, guys.
Okay.
Really, you're going to love this place.
Okay?
Up you go.
Sorry.
It's a pre-war building.
And during the war, they didn't fight for an elevator?
Listen, the building has two things going for it.
It's got something available, and I live here.
(SCOFFS)
(SIGHING) Fine.
But if I break a heel, or a sweat, you're responsible.
Get my bags.
(PANTING)
See?
That wasn't so bad.
Yeah.
Down the hall.
The one with the police tape and chalk outline.
Really?
Kidding.
- You said this was a studio.
- It is.
No way!
MGM was a studio!
This?
This is a roach motel with no room service.
Yeah, a studio apartment.
Sure, from certain angles, it's a bit small.
A two-karat engagement ring is a bit small!
This is a doll house!
- So what do you think?
- Forget it!
I'd need an entirely separate apartment just for my lipsticks.
And where am I supposed to sleep?
- What is that?
- It's your bed.
That is not a bed.
It's a closet with a tongue.
You can't be serious!
- There is one really good thing about it.
- Yeah, sure.
See?
This is my place!
Looking better, huh?
Am I missing something?
Oh, right.
Space!
Luxury!
Maid service!
Let me guess.
You're used to being spoiled.
I'm not used to it.
I just expect it.
You know, half this building is filled with performers who came here with the same ambitions you did.
What makes you so much better than them?
Money, breeding, talent, great hair, perfect jaw line, chic taste.
How much time do you have?
All right, fine.
I tried to help you out like my mom asked, but whatever.
I'll find someone else to film.
The only problem is if I call my father and tell him how I messed up on the other apartment and how I have nowhere to go but here, and I ask for his help, he'll make me come home and...
(STAMMERING)
Work!
- So?
- So?
Then I'll never get my big break.
Oh, and promise you won't call your mother and tell her about this, because then she'll call my mom who will tell my dad, and I don't think he really believes I can make this happen.
He only gave me one month to prove it.
Well, then you've got one month to prove him wrong.
(GROANS)
Why did I do this?
I want my canopy bed and my housekeeper.
And a shower that doesn't share a room with a kitchen.
- Come on.
- Where to?
- Do you trust me?
- You suggested this place.
Yeah.
Point taken.
Come anyway.
Come on.
SHARPAY:
I hope you're taking me to a better apartment than what you just showed me.
Because let me tell you, if that's it?
No way!
Absolutely no!
Just come on.
Just don't ask any questions.
I need luxury!
Are you kidding me?
That was like a green, dark hole that I never wanna be in ever again.
All right, here you go.
Butchy!
- Come on...
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.
Come on.
- Why are we here?
All right, all right.
Now, you're gonna have to close your eyes.
- Close my eyes?
- Yeah, just close your eyes.
- Why?
- Because!
Just do it.
All right, now.
Keep them closed.
- Well, what if I hit into something?
- You won't.
I got you.
All right, all right.
Keep them closed.
All right.
- All right, you got them closed?
- Yes, I do.
All right, all right.
Perfect.
All right.
Now, stay here, keep them closed.
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
Keep them closed.
All righty.
Keep them closed.
All right.
Open them.
Hit it, Butchy!
Wow.
I know.
When I left Indiana to go to school here, I didn't know a soul either, and I was just as overwhelmed as you.
But I had two things, my dream and my camera.
And look at me now.
You still only have your dream and your camera.
Yes, but I met you, didn't I?
So, something's working out.
Well, whenever people meet me, things get better.
(LAUGHS)
Look, you just have to adapt to your surroundings.
And remember that for now this is all just temporary.
Right.
Like prom dresses and first boyfriends.
Look, anything you have to do will be worth it to get your dream.
Okay.
I'm gonna meet with that casting director, get the part,
- be a star and have a palace!
- There you go.
That's the self-indulgent, self-entitled, optimistic pink hurricane
I've been seeing through my lens.
And I like how perceptive you are.
Okay, New York.
Bring it on.
(UPBEAT POP SONG PLAYING)
(SINGING) I used to think maybe you loved me
Now, baby, I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day When you knock on my door
(SQUEALING)
Now every time I go for the mailbox Gotta hold myself down
'Cause I just can't wait till you write me You're coming around
I'm walking on sunshine
(BARKS)
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
(WHOOPS)
- And don't it feel good!
- Hey!
All right now And don't it feel good!
Hey!
All right now, yeah
Hi!
(SHRIEKING)
Turn it off.
Turn it off!
(SINGING) Just waiting for you
CHORUS:
Just waiting for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day
No, no, no
(LAUGHING)
What?
I want you to stay
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
- And don't it feel good!
- CHORUS:
Hey!
All right now And don't it feel good!
SHARPAY:
Oh, yeah!
PE YTON:
Looking good.
So pink.
You're good.
(BOTH CHATTERING)
- Do you wanna try some?
- No, I don't want any!
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Lay down.
Lay down.
(LAUGHS) Night, Boi!
(SHARPAY SQUEALING)
(MUFFLED) Boi?
Get help!
(BANGING ON DOOR)
(FAKING GASP)
- PE YTON:
Knock, knock.
- Come in!
Wow!
And wow.
Hey, are you on your way to meet with the casting director?
No, I'm on my way to change theater history.
You think this is a good outfit for changing history?
Perfect!
Mind if I tag along and film?
Not that you could ever mind me, right?
I think you should.
After all, not many people can say they were there to film the creation of a legend.
Sharpay!
You made it after all!
Destiny called, and I get great reception!
Well, your timing is perfect.
What's tomorrow like for you?
The first day of the rest of my fame.
Well, all right.
I'll set up your audition for 3:00.
I'll e-mail you the musical number that we'd like you to prepare.
And could you make sure that he's well-groomed and, you know, takes care of any business beforehand.
- What?
- What?
- He?
- Yes.
- Him?
- Him.
- He?
- Yes!
Wait, what?
It's your dog that we want to audition.
He was amazing!
Oh.
(LOUDLY) What?
I mean...
I sent you all the information in response to your e-mail.
I mean, didn't the title of the musical give you any indication?
A Girl's Best Friend?
A Girl's Best Friend!
And I'm here for the girl!
You're here for the girl?
Well, I'm never the best friend!
Oh, no.
No, no.
We wanted Boi.
As the girl?
No, as the best friend.
Wait, wait.
You wanted Boi as the best friend of the girl?
Not me as the girl with the best friend?
Exactly.
Oh, Sharpay, I am so sorry for the confusion.
If you don't want Boi to audition, I would totally understand.
Sharpay.
Sharpay!
Hey, stop.
MAN:
Hey, don't touch the car!
Look, slow down.
Even New Yorkers can't keep up with you.
It's not even me they wanted!
Well, to be fair, the role is for a dog.
If they wanted you, I could understand you being upset.
Why did I come all this way?
Leave my friends, family, a dry, self-hydrating climate?
To follow your dream!
Or at least that's what I thought.
Nothing is turning out the way I planned it!
Plan A. Live in a penthouse and star on Broadway.
Plan B...
Don't have a plan B!
What do I tell my father now?
That you came to a very special city determined to be someone very special, which you are.
Oh, I'm not so special.
I'm just like everyone else.
Maybe a little better.
Look at it this way.
Boi is your dog, and he has an opportunity, so be happy for him.
You're right.
I'm being, you know, what's the word?
When you do something for yourself even though it's not so good for other people?
- Selfish?
- No!
Oh, yeah.
Look, Sharpay, you can't give up.
Okay?
And, anyway, you're officially the star of my film.
I am?
Yeah, you are.
Oh.
So now it's all about you?
Only because I need you here.
Fine.
I'll star in your movie.
Okay.
Good, good!
Okay, change of strategy.
I didn't know you had a strategy, but I like the way you think.
If Boi becomes a success, everyone will see me as well.
After all, I am his entourage.
I am the one who's holding his leash.
His fame will ultimately lead to my fame.
That's what I came here for, right?
Still a little selfish, but heading in the right direction.
We're gonna do this.
It's like I tell the housekeepers.
If you can't see the bright side, polish the dull side.
Yeah, not quite what I was talking...
They want Boi to audition?
It's Boi they will get!
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING ON PIANO)
(SINGING) When a sign of the times is the times are extremely tough
- (WHIMPERING) - (SHUSHING)
When you look at the world and the world that you see is
(BARKS)
Yes, rough
When you feel like a long lost pup
And you need some cheering up
Sit back, relax and watch us do our stuff
Two, three, four
We're gonna sit and shake your hand That's how it starts
We're gonna nose our nosy way into your hearts
We'll sing and bark In two-part harmony
You're gonna love us That's our guarantee
We'll bow together on the count of three
Me and my Boi My Boi and me
We make the perfect pair
We've got that savoir-faire
(BARKING)
Me and my Boi
Me and my Boi
(BARKING)
Me and my Boi
My Boi and me
(LAUGHING)
Wait!
That's the best audition I've ever seen!
I'm Gill Samms, the director.
Neal Roberts, writer.
That was amazing!
Chills.
Feel my hand...
I won't feel your hand, but I believe you.
I won't feel your hand either, but I believe you, too.
That is one special dog.
We've done special here.
Special has been done, people!
Boi was meant for Broadway.
We both were.
(BARKS)
So, when do we start?
Well, there's one more waiting.
One more!
One more, people!
Could you take a seat in the front row, please?
There.
Now.
Roger Elliston
the third.
And his dog, Countess.
FYI, I'm Roger.
As you can see by our extensive resume, hand-printed on carbonless, environmental-friendly rice paper,
Countess has numerous major Broadway credits under her paws, including The Collar Purple, Three Puppy Opera, and the original Broadway cast production of A Wagging Tail of Two Cities, a musical opera in German.
Major pedigree.
I'm impressed.
This is us impressed.
Plus, she can bark a high C with sustained vibrato.
Sure, but only dogs can hear it.
(LAUGHING)
All right.
Let's see what Countess can do.
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING ON PIANO)
(SINGING) When a sign of the times is the times are extremely tough
When you look at the world and the world that you see is rough

(LAUGHING)
That's the best audition I've ever seen!
- Amazing!
I weeped!
- Wept.
GILL:
I wept!
- I wept!
- And not just regular weeping.
Theater weeping!
Amber Lee, what do you think?
Yes.
Amber Lee, thoughts?
Wow...
We are so meant to be BFFs!
Wow! "Wow" is a word, right?
Right.
Wow!
I just hope that the palpable chemistry surging between you and I right now like nuclear fusion won't in any way influence your decision towards our clearly superior audition.
How old are you?
Twelve.
I think I'm good.
And you, also!
Your dog...
Wow!
Wow.
- I know, right?
- (BARKING)
He's just saying hi.
Sharpay Evans of the New Mexico Evans.
I'm a mega fan.
Oh, you are not!
So am!
I am gonna tweet about you right now.
Shut up!
I follow your tweets.
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)
She did!
She tweeted!
Okay, I don't know how we're gonna decide.
You're amazing!
All this and a grade school diploma.
And you, amazing!
Wow.
I would be excited to work with either one of you and your dogs.
And can I just say, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Because Broadway...
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, real people are watching.
- Wow.
- Me, too.
I am just so excited to be performing on the Great White Way!
Not that I don't love all colors.
Well, I know both these talented dogs want to work with you.
But only one can be in the show.
- How are we gonna decide?
- Wait.
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals?
Wait!
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals!
That way I could see which one I work best with.
- That sounds like a solution.
- We have a solution, people!
Can I just say how totally great I think you are?
You do, and I'll never wash my ears again.
You know what I think?
Well, of course you don't because I just thought of it, but I think they loved you!
I like the way you think!
And you're such a good singer.
And I would know.
- My album went triple platinum.
- Well, I've done quite a bit of theater.
It totally shows.
Listen, I'm gonna have my assistant give you my phone number.
If there's anything that you need, you just let me know, okay?
We girls gotta stick together, right?
- Here.
- Wow.
I mean, this is actually your number!
It looks like any ordinary number, but it's not.
It's yours!
- Oh, and, hey, may the best dog win!
- Thanks!
(SQUEALING SOFTLY)
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Can you believe it?
PE YTON:
You were great!
Boi was great.
This new strategy just might work.
- Amber Lee really likes you, too.
- Is she awesome or what?
She inspires me.
There.
I said it.
Quelle inspired.
We are so gonna get that part.
- How do you know?
- Easy.
I don't do rejection.
Sharpay!
I just wanted to wish you both luck.
Oh!
That's so nice of you.
And suggest that you give up now, while you still have your dignity.
Distant though it already might be.
Sorry, which Smurf are you again?
True, you have talent.
But you lack both the experience and the finesse to ever achieve the Holy Grail of possibility.
- Yeah, but Boi is cuter.
- Countess is a theatrical ninja.
(SNORING)
I'm sorry.
For a minute there you just bored me to death.
I have a foolproof strategy of getting what I want.
See it, want it, have a fit, get it.
- Yeah, well, this playdate's over.
- I hope you enjoy rejection.
- We're gonna get that part.
- We're gonna destroy you.
- Bring it on.
- Oh, it's brought.
All right, Boi.
This foot.
That foot.
Good boy!
Yeah!
Okay, let's try our next one.
Stay.
Catch your tail.
Catch your tail!
Good!
Yeah, good.
Sit.
Stay.
We are so going to take them on.
I'm not gonna let some hobbit get in my way.
And, look.
All Boi can do is think about how horrible that other little mangy dog was.
(WHIMPERING)
If you want success so badly, then you will get it.
All you need is one shot to make it happen.
Yeah, and this is my shot.
It's like my grandmother says.
"God only got one book published,
"and look how well it did for him."
Doing this is all I've ever dreamed about, especially since I already have everything else.
Well, there's still humility.
What's wrong with being confident?
Confidence is when you know you're good.
Arrogance is when you think others know you're good.
Well, I want everyone to know I'm as good as I think everyone thinks I am without them knowing I know they think it.
- And do you have to film everything?
- Yep, 'cause this is my shot.
If my professor loves my film, he talks about it.
Then there's a buzz, then it gets in a festival, then it gets distribution, then I'm signing a studio deal, then I'm getting an Oscar.
(SIGHS)
I always knew I wanted to be an actress the first time I produced and performed the entire production of Snow White.
Full dance, musical numbers, handmade costumes.
I made my brother play all the dwarfs.
Everyone in that pre-school worshipped me.
(LAUGHS)
I just want to wake up every morning and be onstage.
GILL:
Good morning!
Good morning, everyone.
- And welcome to the first rehearsal...
- Of the new Broadway musical.
A Girl's Best Friend!
And you are all amazing.
- No, you are!
- Him or me?
- You!
- No, you!
Me?
Okay!
And heading our superb cast, we are thrilled to welcome one of the biggest stars around,
Amber Lee Adams!
Oh, stop!
NEAL:
Yes!
AMBER LEE:
Guys, come on.
Can I just say that this, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, people can see if you write your lines on your hands!
(ALL LAUGHING)
All right.
Let's rehearse.
I want everybody downstairs with piano, rehearsing the music for the opening number.
Amber Lee and Judith,
I want you onstage so we can block that first scene.
- Let's go!
- Let's go, people!
All right.
Let's start with Boi.
Let's go!
AMBER LEE:
What a perfect goodbye party.
Thank you, Mom!
JUDITH:
I can't believe my little girl is going out into the world on her own for the first time.
I have to, Mom.
And who knows, maybe I'll find fame and fortune!
Actually, reverse that.
(LAUGHING)
- Why is that funny?
- Well...
Because you'd rather have the...
I'll explain later.
Just keep going.
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Pick it up!
Go, go!
A star is about to be born!
Shelby!
Oh!
What's in this envelope?
This very wet envelope.
(LAUGHING)
- Again, I don't get that.
- Keep going.
Gasp!
Actually, that's a stage direction.
You gasp, you don't say "gasp."
GILL:
Simple mistake.
Keep going.
(GASPS)
Shelby!
Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
(LAUGHS)
(BARKS)
Oh, Shelby.
This is the first time we'll be apart.
I wish I could just pack you up in a widdle doggie bag.
(CHUCKLING)
Okay.
Let's get Countess in there and continue.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Shelby and I will both be here when you get back.
You're killing me.
AMBER LEE:
Oh!
NEAL:
That is adorable!
AMBER LEE:
You're right, Shelby!
Why not go with me?
Any place that doesn't want you, I don't wanna be.
Let's see what New York has in store for us together!
Good.
Let's talk about the scene a bit, and we'll do it again.
And both dogs, great work!
Shelby!
Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
What's going on?
The dog.
What is this?
Somebody, please.
The dog is licking me.
All right, all right.
Get me the other dog!
(SIGHING)
Sorry.
What can you do?
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go, go!
(DOG WHISTLE BLOWING)
- GILL:
Why is she twirling?
- What is she doing?
(GROANING)
- Gill?
- Roger!
Figure out what's going on with the dog.
It's not helping me.
- Not helping, people!
- Meanwhile, get the other dog!
Sorry.
What can you do?
AMBER LEE:
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go!
Oh, hey!
(BARKS)
(CAT MEWING)
(CAT SCREECHING)
(CRASHING)
(EX CLAIMING)
How is this helping?
Really.
Am I the only one bothered by this?
Gill?
Okay, everybody, that's 10!
I'll admit you're good.
But we're better.
Give up!
Give up?
Not until there's a Broadway marquee with a picture of my dog so big you can walk by and smell his puppy breath!
I have to take the dogs for a nap.
Union rules.
Thank you.
- You break first.
- No, you break first.
AMBER LEE:
Oh!
- Pretty cute, huh?
- Yeah!
Yes, they are!
I just wanted to tell you something.
This is my show.
I'm America's sweetheart.
They're paying to see me, not you two over-bred fur balls.
So, until I can figure out a way to get rid of you, you better watch your step, otherwise you'll find out the real meaning of going home in a doggie bag.
(CHUCKLES EVILLY)
PE YTON:
This film is cutting together really well.
Do I look amazing?
- The camera loves you.
- I know!
(COMPUTER CHIMES)
Oh, no!
My dad's video-chatting me.
He thinks I live in a penthouse.
I can't let him see that I live in a tiny studio in a filthy tenement.
With a boy in my room!
A boy, by the way, that has no money, and lives in a tinier studio, and who, apparently, has never heard of the word "maid-service"!
No offense.
What of that could possibly offend me?
(PANTING) Oh, my!
Oh, my!
I don't know.
Hyperventilating!
- What do I do?
What do I do?
- Come on.
- Come on.
Hurry!
- (COMPUTER CHIMING)
- All right, scoot over.
Okay, go, go.
- Okay, I gotta get this.
Stop!
Hi, Daddy!
Hey, princess!
How's my little girl?
Overpaying for everything and yelling at total strangers.
(EX CLAIMS) You're practically a native.
Hey, where are you?
That view is spectacular.
Well, there's hardly a penthouse in the city that doesn't have a spectacular view!
So, you the toast of Broadway?
Daddy, you know how I feel about carb references.
Just a little concerned, sweetie.
The last time no one's heard from you for this long was when you found out your gold card wasn't actually made of gold.
Well, I've been busy with rehearsals.
Outstanding!
You got into the show?
Well, it doesn't quite work like that.
It's complicated.
But I know it's gonna work out.
Sharpay, is there something you're not telling me?
You remember the deal, right?
If things aren't working out...
I know, I know.
I have one month to get in the show, and then...
Two weeks, sweetie.
You have two weeks left.
You're sure everything's okay?
It's fine, Daddy.
Well, okay.
We miss you, angel.
Miss you, too.
I love you!
Boi has to get that role.
I can't go home.
Not as a failure.
I need some sort of subtle, visibly crushing advantage over Roger.
Look, why not just trust Boi is talented, that you've trained him well,
- and let fate take it from there.
- Fate?
Fate gave a girl in my graduating class one long eyebrow.
I can't trust fate.
Some matters you just have to take into your own hands.
What do you mean you forgot my bottled water?
Well, I was going to get those magazines that you said you wanted from across town, and I got hit by a bike messenger.
So I went to the hospital for, like, just one second to get these stitches.
And meanwhile, I had no water!
I will get it for you right now.
Now I've had to drink tap!
- I am so sorry.
- (MOCKING) "I am so sorry."
- I will do better.
- Forget it, okay?
Aside from catching some shade from the shadow cast by your madam's apple, you're of no use to me.
You're... (WHIMPERING) fired!
(CRYING) God!
Amber Lee?
Oh, wow!
You look so cute, Sharpie!
- Sharpay.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
So, tell me, what's on your mind?
I just saw your assistant leave in tears.
She's not my assistant.
She quit.
No wonder she was crying.
Yeah, I don't think she even really cared.
Next time I should probably just hire a best friend instead.
Wait!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
What are you thinking that I should be thinking?
I could help you out until you replace her.
That is what I was thinking about thinking.
Of course this can't, in any way, affect your decision of which dog gets the starring role.
Oh, it won't.
I couldn't live with myself if I thought I did anything unfair.
You have my word.
Hey, I know!
How about dinner?
- That sounds awesome!
- Right?
Get me a reservation for two at someplace fantastic.
Then call my agent, have her meet me.
Right.
Sure.
Oh.
I won't forget this.
And I promise, it won't be because you're helping me if I happen to take a little extra liking to Girl.
- Boi.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
Oh, and can you take my mic down to the sound guy
- and tell him the wire hurts my scalp.
- Okay.
You're the best.
Amber Lee says the wire is hurting her scalp.
Personally, I think she's using the wrong shampoo, but she's the star, and you know, I don't wanna say anything.
You're hot.
Excuse me?
You're hot.
Okay.
Even though theater lighting highlights my natural skin tones, thank you for noticing, that's a little rude, don't you think?
No.
Your mic's hot.
It means it's on.
You see that little switch.
When it's flipped over like that, it means it's on and it's going through the entire theater.
Well, you could have led with that part, thank you.
Amber Lee's got a great scalp!
(LAUGHS) You're hot.
Then she asked me to help her out after her assistant quit.
And after I suggested it.
Are you sure this is wise?
I'm sorry.
Let me re-phrase that.
This isn't wise.
It's perfect.
Amber Lee will see that she and I are exactly alike, we'll become BFFs, she'll make sure Boi gets the role, then his fame becomes my fame!
I mean, this is the advantage I've been waiting for!
Isn't it more like taking advantage?
And my father thought I couldn't do this in a month.
It's turning out better than I imagined.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Sure.
Be right over.
(SIGHING)
Hello?
Oh, thank goodness.
In here, quickly.
I just...
I can't reach that.
Can't reach it?
Okay, it was a little bit of a test.
Only a true friend would come all the way down here at this hour and help me with something like that.
- So, I passed?
- Yes.
(GIGGLING)
- But, seriously, the purse.
- Okay.
Thank you.
All right, here's your bag.
Here's your other bag.
Oh, and don't forget your photo shoot.
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
You must be at that photo shoot to make sure I look as fabulous as you always do.
- Are you serious?
- Serious?
You're now also my stylist.
You have to tell me all your secrets.
Okay, gotta go.
"Life is so strange.
"Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune,
"and instead, we find love."
Hey!
How about dinner?
Split some egg rolls at Wok This Way?
Can't.
I have to highlight script changes for Amber Lee, then highlight her hair.
Highlight of my night!
Okay.
But I miss spending time with you.
And you did promise to shoot some more stuff for my film.
You know, what I'm doing is important, too.
Oh.
For a minute there, you sounded like Amber Lee.
"Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you."
Bad news.
My maid quit.
So, here's a list of chores.
Chores?
And I want to talk to you about Boi.
But you have to promise it'll stay between us.
Okay.
I think I'm going to ask the director to give Boi the part.
- Are you serious?
- Almost positive!
You won't be sorry.
Trust me.
I know.
(RUMBLING)
Oh!
Oh, no.
There are some changes for the blocking in the dog scene, top of act two.
Countess can learn these in no time.
She's got a memory like a digital hard drive.
- No bark and all mega-bite.
- Funny.
I need to find Sharpay and make sure she gets them.
Boi is doing the first run-through tomorrow.
I'd be more than happy to deliver them to her.
- Great.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Sharpay?
Sharpay?
(SIGHS)
That's unfortunate.
And I've been here ever since.
Life is so strange.
Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune, and instead, we find love.
Lenore, I have something to ask you.
We have something to ask you.
(BARKING)
He's supposed to come from the other side of the stage with the ring box!
Yeah, sorry.
We changed that blocking.
What happened?
What is wrong with this dog?
And is he okay?
It's not his fault.
He's just a little dog!
He's just so sweet.
GILL:
Okay, everybody.
Let's break for a few.
That's 10, people.
I'm aware.
I know.
SHARPAY:
I don't know what happened.
We sent out the script changes, but Boi didn't do them.
But I didn't get any new script change.
(SIGHS)
I looked everywhere last night to give them to you.
I guess working for Amber Lee has its drawbacks.
- You did this on purpose.
- That's a complete...
Yeah.
You're threatened because you know Amber Lee is gonna choose Boi.
Not after today she won't.
Okay.
Countess doesn't have half the personality that Boi has.
And Boi doesn't have half the talent that Countess has.
Isn't that right, girl?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Has anyone seen Boi?
- No, sorry.
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Anyone seen Countess?
- Nope.
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
- Hello?
- Boi and Countess are gone!
Gone!
What?
We have to find them!
Wait, where are you now?
Leaving the theater.
We're gonna look around here.
Can you look near the apartment in case they come back?
Yeah, yeah.
Of course.
Just keep me posted, and I'll call you if they show up.
Okay.
What if they were dog-napped?
Do you think we pushed them too hard?
- I don't know.
- Countess is uber-sensitive.
She cries watching dog food commercials!
I just hope they're not huddled in a corner somewhere.
Afraid, lost, at each other's throats!
(SINGING) You know you love me I know you care
Just shout whenever And I'll be there
You are my love You are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item?
Girl, quit playin'
"We're just friends," What are you sayin'?
Said, "There's another" And looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine
I'm goin' down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around
And I'm like baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby...
SHARPAY:
What if we never see them again?
They're smart dogs.
Smarter than we are.
They'll be okay.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Oh, no.
It's my dad.
I just...
I can't deal with him right now.
(BOI BARKING)
- Countess!
- Boi!
Hi!
I missed you!
You're back!
It's amazing.
They came back to the apartment.
Thanks, Peyton.
Oh, and Sharpay, it's still on.
Bring it.
You're back!
Yeah!
You bad, bad boy, Boi.
I'm just glad you're okay.
He and Countess had an adventure.
She probably coaxed him into joining a doggy gang or something.
We'd better check him over for tattoos.
Are you so lost in what you're doing that you haven't noticed?
Noticed what?
Boi and Countess are in love.
- With what?
- Each other.
No way!
You're right.
He's dilated.
He's got puppy dog eyes.
How could I have not noticed puppy love?
Well, there's a lot you haven't noticed.
Like lately, you've had no time for me.
You know, I was counting on you to help me finish my film.
I said I would, and I will.
Things have become complicated.
It's not that complicated.
Amber Lee is using you, and you're letting her.
You don't know what you're talking about.
- I don't?
- No!
Where's the Sharpay that was determined not to go back home because she didn't want to work for anyone?
Why don't you tell me?
Working for someone, that's where.
- So at least be honest as to why.
- I know what I'm doing.
You've sold your soul to get Boi in that show, rather than trust in the dog that you raised.
Even worse, you've stopped trusting that your own talents would get you where you need to go.
And maybe you're jealous because I'm on my way up with a new famous friend, and you're just a student making a film about someone else's life instead of your own.
You don't have to be in my movie anymore.
I get it.
You have more important things to do.
Fine!
One question?
What happened to that hot pink whirlwind of confidence and ambition
I saw through my lens that first day you got here?
I mean, that girl knew she was special.
That girl knew she didn't have to do any of this to succeed.
What happened to her, huh?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello.
Oh, and Sharpay, can you remember to invite as many people from my fan club as possible to opening-night dress rehearsal?
I want the theater filled with people who love me as much as you do!
Sure.
You know what would be great after all this work?
A long, luxurious spa bath.
(SIGHING) Sounds amazing!
Thank you.
Run one for me, will you?
And then you can finish these.
You're the best!
(SIGHING)
- This is a big change.
- Huge change!
I don't think you're hearing me!
GILL:
New Jersey can hear you!
The name of the show is A Girl's Best Friend.
I didn't tell you to change the title.
But you want the best friend written out!
Oh.
Right.
Change the title!
GILL:
How are we supposed to get rid of one of our main characters a day before our dress rehearsal in front of an audience?
The audience is coming to see me.
You change that dog's part to a bark and play dead, or I don't go on.
Let's be reasonable here.
I'm a star.
I don't have to be reasonable!
Look, those mangy mutts are bothering me almost as much as their disposable owners.
I actually had to have one of them clean my toilet just to keep her away.
She thinks she's an actress.
(AMBER LEE LAUGHS)
She acts all right.
She acts just like every other obsessed fan.
Wait.
Everything you said...
You were...
Right?
Yes.
Thank you.
You must think I'm a total fool.
No.
Not total.
Maybe my dad was right.
(CRYING) Maybe I'm not ready for this.
Maybe I should just go home and... (STAMMERING) work for him.
I mean, did I really think I was just gonna come to Broadway and be a star?
Yes.
Because that's exactly how you think.
It's perfect.
Perfect is so hard.
And it doesn't prepare you for disappointment.
Well, if it helps, you still look adorable, even when you're disappointed.
Yeah, that doesn't help.
Look, Sharpay.
There is not a marquee big enough or lights bright enough to contain the fame you're gonna have.
Yeah, but not the way I've been doing it.
(SNIFFLING)
Like you said, the Sharpay you know isn't the Sharpay that has become the Sharpay that is this Sharpay.
Did all the Sharpays follow that?
I sacrificed integrity for opportunity.
I let someone insecure distract me.
I cleaned a bathroom!
But worst of all, I disappointed someone I care about.
I forgot what was really important to me.
I lost track of what I want.
And other than maid service and a canopy bed, what is it that you want?
A fair fight.
A lifetime in the spotlight.
And maybe you'll still let me be in your movie.
I guess.
(CAR HORNS HONKING)
(SIGHS)
Okay, I can't say I approve of dating beneath your station in life, but fine.
Go.
(EX CLAIMS)
Hey, I got your text.
What's C-Q-M-T-W-l-L-G-T mean?
"Come quick.
Major trouble.
Wow, I look great today." Duh.
I really should have gotten that.
Listen, Amber Lee Adams isn't what you think.
A self absorbed, two-faced panther who would eat her young alive on a reality show rather than allow anyone to steal her spotlight?
Okay, she's what you think.
Listen, I don't care if her parents had to tie beef jerky around her neck just to get the family dog to play with her, as long as Countess is at her side on that stage.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
She wants the part of the dog written out completely!
- That's not fair!
- Too far.
Well, I am 12, remember?
Roger, we've been fighting the wrong battle, each other.
We need to form an alliance and work against a common enemy.
- Zits?
- Amber Lee.
Trust me, the zit battle is one you won't win.
But what can we do?
Tonight is the dress rehearsal.
The audience will be filled with members of Amber Lee Adams' fan club.
I know, I saw the tweet.
Fine.
Yes, I follow her, too.
Okay, we need to show people exactly who Amber Lee really is.
It's time someone taught her how to behave in the theater.
I like the way you think.
It's manipulative, but for a good cause.
Tell me what you need me to do.
- Hey, Amber Lee, I...
- Where have you been?
I have been trying to reach you all day.
Oh.
Sorry, my phone must have been turned off.
Without asking me first?
I just wanted to say good luck.
You know, I know you chose Countess for this performance tonight, and I'm fine with that.
Well, it was nothing personal, but your phone was shut off, so I couldn't talk to you about it.
I guess that won't happen again, will it?
We're good.
Hug?
Okay.
(ALL CHATTERING)
Hello, everyone.
I'm Gill, the director.
And I'm Neal, the under-appreciated writer.
(ALL LAUGHING)
And we are thrilled that you're here for our first performance in front of an audience.
Does everyone here know how to applaud?
Okay, how about the balcony up there?
SHARPAY:
Okay, now.
NEAL:
Can you hear us?
You're good!
(VOCALIZING)
- (BARKING) - (SCREAMS)
Will somebody please control these wannabe werewolves?
Hello?
People?
See, this is exactly why I didn't want to do a show with dogs!
I'm the star, not them!
Stage people?
Could somebody please put these rats with rabies out of my misery?
Anyone!
Finally, you idiot!
What took so long?
Now, hurry up and get these flea-bitten fur bags out of here!
- There are people waiting to see me!
- Okay, go now.
You think all those boring freaks with no lives came to worship two no-name mutts?
I don't think so!
I'm the one they love!
Me!
They came to see...
(ALL BOOING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I knew I forgot to tell you something.
Careful, your mic's on.
You did this to me.
You ruined me!
News flash!
You ruined you!
Oh, what do you know?
You're a nobody!
The only reason you even wanted to be my friend is so I'd choose your dog!
No, no.
At first, I idolized you, even more than myself, which isn't easy.
But you're not at all what I thought you were.
(SCOFFS)
You and I are exactly alike.
Except I don't enjoy letting people down.
I don't use people to feel better about myself.
And I definitely don't wear yellow and orange in the same week, let alone the same outfit, okay?
Maybe I did think you and I were alike, but not anymore.
In fact, I'd be embarrassed if someone thought I was like you.
Well, I quit!
And without me, there's no show.
Now neither one of your furry little friends will have their shot and neither will you.
Blame her!
I'm sorry.
Someone had to say it.
I'll go talk some sense into her.
You, out of this theater right now.
Wait, Sharpay.
If you go, then I'll go, too.
No.
You wanted this as badly as I did.
This mess was my idea.
You win.
That's not what it feels like.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
- Hey.
Can I come in?
- Sure.
- So, you're really leaving, huh?
- Yeah.
I'm packing my carry-on stuff first.
- I wish you weren't going.
- Me, too.
Have you thought about what you're gonna do now?
Move home where there's enough room for my pores to open, spend months in the spa getting this layer of New York grime off my skin, and mostly miss you.
Look, I know exactly how to help that.
Don't go.
I already talked to my dad.
I guess I'm gonna start...
(STAMMERING)
- You don't have to say it.
- Thank you.
What about your dream of being a star?
It's still there.
It's just a little bit more of a dream than a reality.
- You know what today is?
- What?
I got here exactly one month ago.
My time was up tonight anyway.
Well, so then you still have eight hours.
This isn't how my movie's supposed to end.
I guess it is.
(PHONE RINGING)
This is Sharpay.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
No, no.
I'll be there.
(SIGHS)
That was the stage manager.
They want me to come to the theater and clear out Boi's things.
I can go with you if you want.
I want.
GILL:
And, so, Amber Lee has quit.
- Gone.
- Kaput.
NEAL:
The producers feel, without a star, we can't open.
The time it would take to find someone who could learn the role and do it well might take weeks, and it would cost too much to keep the production going.
But we want you all to know, it was great almost working with you.
- I'm gonna meet you outside.
- All right.
GILL:
Thank you for your hard work.
We are so, so sorry, people.
Wait!
Wait, it's not over.
It's not over.
Look, it doesn't have to be.
Look, there is someone who knows the part by heart and who is amazing.
All right, maybe she's not a star yet, but she will be.
This show will make her one.
Just watch.
SHARPAY:
Boi, keep your voice down.
Peyton, start shooting the rehearsal.
Boi, go mark.
Go mark.
Good!
Okay, stay.
Stay.
I love when you use that accent, but...
(SHUSHING)
We're not supposed to be in here.
Okay, now let's do the scene where the character Lenore thinks she's lost everything and you come over to console her.
Come on.
Shelby, what is going on?
I feel invisible here.
Nothing is working out the way I planned it.
(SINGING) I got something inside of me
Something that needs to be heard
Deep down a voice is guiding me
Hidden emotions have stirred
Why have I let others lead the way
When all along I know what it is I want to say
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
I thought I had a perfect plan
Where I would wind up on top
One day I'm thinking, "Yes I can"
Next thing you know, I'm a flop
Why did I ever play this silly game?
I got to shake up the rules
And stake my claim
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
What if I missed my window?
What if I blew my shot?
What if the only chance I was going to get
I already got?
I'm not ready to turn the page
Until I'm on stage in a show
No, nobody move I've got something to prove
Don't you know?
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
(HUMMING)
PE YTON:
Well, did I tell you?
(LAUGHING)
- Amazing!
- Amazing!
You're amazing!
You have more depth, range and tone in one note than Amber Lee had in her entire surgically reshaped body.
We'll promote you as "The girl who we're promoting."
The producers will love it.
Wait, wait.
What are you saying?
We need you to save the show.
- Seriously?
- We know it's a risk.
- A gamble.
- A risk.
Did I do "risk" already?
You did.
And, true, we did fire you.
- He fired you.
- But now I'm un-firing you.
- Can we do that?
- Just did.
- Good for us!
- We need you.
What do you say?
Um... (STAMMERING) I guess we could take the costumes in a few sizes and get everyone used to hearing the songs sung on key,
but there's one condition.
Boi and Countess split the role of Shelby the dog equally.
Done!
NEAL:
We've a lot of work to do, people!
- GILL:
Are we crazy?
- Crazy for theater!
- Let's rehearse!
- Let's rehearse, people!
GILL:
Where are those wonderful dogs?
- Thank you.
- This is it.
The chance you've been waiting for.
(PE YTON SIGHING)
- What if I'm not ready for this?
- Oh, you're ready.
"Ready" isn't as ready as you are.
- What if I'm horrible?
- Won't happen.
- What if I forget my lines?
- Impossible.
- What if I...
- Everything in your life so far has been leading you to this moment.
Your moment.
Embrace it.
I'm scared.
Finally.
Let's rehearse, people!
(GIRLS SQUEALING)
GIRL:
Over here!
REPORTER:
Mr. Pinto, Mr. Pinto, over here.
Mr. Pinto, look this way.
(ALL CHATTERING)
(INAUDIBLE)
(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
(SINGING) I've got a feeling inside of me
Running all through my veins
It's like electrical energy
A world about to change
It's an open road
So here I go
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
I'm gonna go for it all out
I know there's no guarantee
But I've been given a chance and now
What's next is up to me
I'm gonna set my sights
So light those lights
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
If all the world's a stage
I'm here to take my place
I know I'll always find a way to shine
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
It starts with a dream
Of who I could be
Wherever it takes me I can't wait
So I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
The rest of my life
The rest of my life
(ALL APPLAUDING)
SHARPAY:
I want fabulous That is my simple request
All things fabulous Bigger and better and best
I need something inspiring to help me get along
I need a little fabulous Is that so wrong?
Fetch me my Jimmy Choo flip-flops
Where is my pink Prada tote?
ALL:
A summer like never before
SHARPAY:
I want more!
ALL:
She wants fabulous That is her simple request
All things fabulous Bigger and better and best
She needs something inspiring to help her get along
She needs a little fabulous Is that so wrong?
SHARPAY:
Absolutely...
Not!
ripped by carrot
There's a moment when you realize that something's changed
And all the bits and pieces start to fit
It's so fab!
When nothing that you know will ever be the same
Ring the bell
That's my cue
Gotta try something new
Gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
Yeah
Listen up, fellas.
Now there's nothing in this universe to hold me back
Bye, Gab.
No endless night can keep me in the dark
And I just might give my dear old dad a heart attack
- But he'll live
- He'll live
- And he'll see
- He'll see
What his girl is meant to be
Gonna shine
And leave the past behind
Gonna try to fly so high
Gonna climb and make the prize all mine
Then I'll write my name in letters across the sky
I'm gonna shine
And if my present luminescent state is second rate
I'll turn it up a notch past nine
And watch the world go blind
Got a diva dazzle that you just can't touch
Like an angel in Armani I'm too fabulous
They'll be lining up for blocks Once I bop to the top
With a poochie in my Gucci I just can't be stopped
I'm gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
There she is.
Wonderful!
Hi!
- I know, I know.
- I loved it.
Excuse us.
There's our little superstar!
Princess, you had better watch out for law enforcement.
They are gonna come after you for stealing the show!
Honey, on a scale of one to 10, you were an entirely different scale.
And you know my aversion to scales.
Sharpay!
Yes, I know.
And thank you.
We'd like to introduce you to Jerry Taylor.
He's a good friend of our family, visiting for the week.
May I just say how wonderful you were?
As many times as you'd like!
I really see a unique talent here.
I mean, a true gift.
And your kind, true words are a gift as well.
It was so nice to meet you.
But if you'll excuse me, my friends have been waiting.
I'm a casting agent from New York.
And will keep waiting until I tell you how much I love your suit.
I'm about to start casting for a new musical on Broadway.
Broadway?
As in "Broadway?"
Yeah.
And I think that there is a perfect part.
I would be more than happy to arrange an audition if you happen to find yourself in the Big Apple any time soon.
That would be...
I would be...
It would be, like...
The show is gonna star Amber Lee Adams.
- No.
- Yeah.
Stop.
Seriously, stop.
Who's Amber Lee Adams?
She's only the most amazing performer ever!
We have so much in common.
I won't keep you.
It was so nice to meet you, Sharpay.
Congratulations again.
And, who knows, maybe we'll see you in New York.
Okay?
- Congrats!
- Bye.
Toodles!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
- No!
- No?
I don't understand!
What language is that?
No, I don't think going to New York is a good idea.
See, there you go, believing everything you think.
Do you really believe you're ready for such a monumental step?
Daddy, the main reason I buy such expensive shoes is to take monumental steps.
Sweetheart, when you graduated from high school almost a year ago, do you remember what you said to me?
"How come no one makes a cap and gown in hot pink?"
No.
"How come you get a car and driver and I don't?"
- No.
- "Good luck finding anyone
"to fill the talent-less void of boring and unattractive
"that will exist in these hallways
- "once I graduate"?
- No.
Yes, but you also said that you needed a year to find yourself, to figure out what came next in your life.
That year's almost up, and you haven't found anything.
It's a small town.
I mean, there's only so many places to look.
Besides, I did find something.
A show I wanna be in.
This is more than just a show.
You're talking about going it alone in the big city.
Right!
To star on Broadway with Amber Lee Adams.
Could you really deny the world that opportunity?
I'm sorry, princess.
But nothing you've shown me convinces me you're ready for something like this.
Okay, ladies.
Team Sharpay.
New York.
Daddy says I'm not ready for this.
So, what does that mean?
You pout, throw a tantrum, and he buys you a new Burberry bag to make you feel better?
That's good, but no.
It means we show him I'm determined.
And when I make up my mind...
And no one is better with make-up.
...my mind looks amazing.
Okay, here's your assignments.
I texted Bridget, who e-mailed Constance, who tweeted Bethany, who IM'ed Jenn, who Facebooked Kara, who has an ex-friend who she caught with her boyfriend, who she then dumped, so now Kara's her friend again,
who knows of a New York apartment available in a luxury townhouse.
That is, like, the best house you can get in terms of towns.
- Sounds perfect.
- It gets better.
- It can't.
- But it does.
It is equal distance from both Chanel and wicked.
Okay.
Now, on to travel plans.
That's right.
Albuquerque to New York.
One adult and one dog.
Excuse me?
Coach?
Hi, I'm calling for Sharpay Evans.
Mr. Taylor wanted to set up an audition with her for a new musical.
Two weeks from today is perfect.
Now, new outfits.
And this would be for opening night.
The beading actually doubles the reflection of paparazzi flashbulbs!
You can wear anything.
You should have your own reality show called I Can Wear Anything.
Where you wear anything.
All right.
I'm ready to show Daddy what we've accomplished.
Ladies, and people I don't know,
New York is calling.
And this is one call that is not going to voice-mail.
So, by way of review, this is my shoe closet, that is my bedroom, these are my new clothes and where I'll wear them, and then I'm a star!
See?
I'm just not totally convinced.
Daddy, you said I haven't shown you anything to let you know I'm ready for this.
But, look, I took matters into my own hands, and without even chipping my manicure.
Sweetheart, it's not as easy as putting pictures on boards.
But I've worked everything out!
And used this pointer.
- I don't know...
- Please, Daddy.
Alone, in New York?
My dear college friend, Michelle, has a son that goes to NYU.
I've met him.
He's a very nice boy.
I could ask her to make sure that he keeps his eye on you.
Are you sure you're ready to take this on?
I know I can do this.
I know it like I know purple washes me out and that my eyes are the exact same distance apart to be a supermodel.
What I don't know is whether you believe in me.
Mom seems to.
Okay, you have my blessing.
Thank you, Daddy!
I'll call my friend Michelle and have her talk to her son.
Thanks, Mom.
There's just one condition.
Fine.
I love a good conditioner.
You have one month.
I'll fly you to New York, I'll pay for your penthouse, but you have to get yourself in that show and prove to me you can take care of yourself.
One month.
- Deal?
- So deal!
But if it doesn't work out, you come back here and work for me.
At the country club.
- Work?
- A job.
That's the deal.
Prove yourself, or come back in a month and work for me.
Fine.
Prove myself it is!
Look!
Look, Boi, look!
- Sharpay?
- In the flesh and pastels!
- We've been awaiting your arrival.
- Then the wait's over!
We spoke on the phone.
I'm Marjorie Grande, the manager for the building.
My pleasure.
Please, follow me to the penthouse.
Ooh!
I hope this is to your liking.
No.
It's to my loving!
Boi, you've gotta see this.
- That's a dog.
- Try to get him to believe that.
I'm sorry.
There are no dogs in the building.
Sure there are.
See?
The members of the co-op board have a strict no-dog policy.
Well...
My father heads our country club board, so I'm sure that gives me some kind of board immunity.
Miss Sharpay, this building is pleased to have you.
This dog...
Not so pleased.
Miss Grande, Ma'am.
If he goes, I go.
What are you doing?
Filming you.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
Do you always just film totally stunning people on the street that you don't know?
Only when I think the subject is interesting.
And you look baffled and scared and really pink.
So, yeah, interesting.
Are you paparazzi?
I'm a film student at NYU, working on a short film.
The assignment is to capture one unique New York story.
Maybe you're it.
So, you decided to film me without my permission, just for a school assignment?
- Yep.
- How dare you!
And my left side is better for close-ups.
I'm Peyton.
Sharpay Evans.
Actress, heiress, soon to be Broadway legend.
- Wait!
- About 105,
- but it's really not polite to ask.
- No...
I should know my own weight, okay?
No, I'm Peyton Leverett.
Our moms went to college together.
This is crazy!
I was on my way up to your apartment to make sure you were okay.
And here you are.
Right, they told me to expect you.
Well, glad we could finally meet.
- Oh, and this is Boi.
- Well, nice to meet you, Boi.
So, why are you out here?
Is everything okay?
Not really.
When I rented this apartment online, it never said they don't allow dogs.
And now they won't let us live here.
Yeah, well, it's their loss!
- Do you have someplace else to go?
- Okay, it's my loss and their loss!
Actually, the only place I have to go is home.
And trust me, that is not an option!
Listen, there's an empty studio in my building, if you're interested.
I'm friends with the building manager.
I'm sure I can make a call.
And...
Well, I'm sure I can make a call and arrange something.
Maybe get you to see it.
Well, since I don't seem to have any other options.
Bellman!
Oh, yeah, right.
Seriously?
Careful with those!
This is all I have to get by on until the truck arrives with the bulk of my things.
Oh!
That's good.
Okay, now, go outside, and then come back in and give me even more of that it's-the-end-of-the-world look.
Okay?
- Hey, Peyton.
- Hey, Peyton!
- What's up?
- Off to acting class.
"Maggie, the cat is alive.
I'm alive!"
Singing lesson.
Cool, guys.
Okay.
Hey, this is Sharpay and Boi.
Hi, Sharpay.
Hi, Boi!
Anyways, gotta go.
See ya, Peyton.
- Nice meeting you, Sharpay.
- Later, guys.
Okay.
Really, you're going to love this place.
Okay?
Up you go.
Sorry.
It's a pre-war building.
And during the war, they didn't fight for an elevator?
Listen, the building has two things going for it.
It's got something available, and I live here.
Fine.
But if I break a heel, or a sweat, you're responsible.
Get my bags.
See?
That wasn't so bad.
Yeah.
Down the hall.
The one with the police tape and chalk outline.
Really?
Kidding.
- You said this was a studio.
- It is.
No way!
MGM was a studio!
This?
This is a roach motel with no room service.
Yeah, a studio apartment.
Sure, from certain angles, it's a bit small.
A two-karat engagement ring is a bit small!
This is a doll house!
- So what do you think?
- Forget it!
I'd need an entirely separate apartment just for my lipsticks.
And where am I supposed to sleep?
- What is that?
- It's your bed.
That is not a bed.
It's a closet with a tongue.
You can't be serious!
- There is one really good thing about it.
- Yeah, sure.
See?
This is my place!
Looking better, huh?
Am I missing something?
Oh, right.
Space!
Luxury!
Maid service!
Let me guess.
You're used to being spoiled.
I'm not used to it.
I just expect it.
You know, half this building is filled with performers who came here with the same ambitions you did.
What makes you so much better than them?
Money, breeding, talent, great hair, perfect jaw line, chic taste.
How much time do you have?
All right, fine.
I tried to help you out like my mom asked, but whatever.
I'll find someone else to film.
The only problem is if I call my father and tell him how I messed up on the other apartment and how I have nowhere to go but here, and I ask for his help, he'll make me come home and...
Work!
- So?
- So?
Then I'll never get my big break.
Oh, and promise you won't call your mother and tell her about this, because then she'll call my mom who will tell my dad, and I don't think he really believes I can make this happen.
He only gave me one month to prove it.
Well, then you've got one month to prove him wrong.
Why did I do this?
I want my canopy bed and my housekeeper.
And a shower that doesn't share a room with a kitchen.
- Come on.
- Where to?
- Do you trust me?
- You suggested this place.
Yeah.
Point taken.
Come anyway.
Come on.
I hope you're taking me to a better apartment than what you just showed me.
Because let me tell you, if that's it?
No way!
Absolutely no!
Just come on.
Just don't ask any questions.
I need luxury!
Are you kidding me?
That was like a green, dark hole that I never wanna be in ever again.
All right, here you go.
Butchy!
- Come on...
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.
Come on.
- Why are we here?
All right, all right.
Now, you're gonna have to close your eyes.
- Close my eyes?
- Yeah, just close your eyes.
- Why?
- Because!
Just do it.
All right, now.
Keep them closed.
- Well, what if I hit into something?
- You won't.
I got you.
All right, all right.
Keep them closed.
All right.
- All right, you got them closed?
- Yes, I do.
All right, all right.
Perfect.
All right.
Now, stay here, keep them closed.
Keep them closed.
All righty.
Keep them closed.
All right.
Open them.
Hit it, Butchy!
Wow.
I know.
When I left Indiana to go to school here, I didn't know a soul either, and I was just as overwhelmed as you.
But I had two things, my dream and my camera.
And look at me now.
You still only have your dream and your camera.
Yes, but I met you, didn't I?
So, something's working out.
Well, whenever people meet me, things get better.
Look, you just have to adapt to your surroundings.
And remember that for now this is all just temporary.
Right.
Like prom dresses and first boyfriends.
Look, anything you have to do will be worth it to get your dream.
Okay.
I'm gonna meet with that casting director, get the part,
- be a star and have a palace!
- There you go.
That's the self-indulgent, self-entitled, optimistic pink hurricane
I've been seeing through my lens.
And I like how perceptive you are.
Okay, New York.
Bring it on.
I used to think maybe you loved me
Now, baby, I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day When you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox Gotta hold myself down
"Cause I just can't wait till you write me You're coming around
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
- And don't it feel good!
- Hey!
All right now And don't it feel good!
Hey!
All right now, yeah
Hi!
Turn it off.
Turn it off!
Just waiting foryou
Just waiting for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day
No, no, no
What?
I want you to stay
I'm walking on sunshine
- And don't it feel good!
- Hey!
All right now And don't it feel good!
Oh, yeah!
Looking good.
So pink.
You're good.
- Do you wanna try some?
- No, I don't want any!
Lay down.
Lay down.
Night, Boi!
Boi?
Get help!
- Knock, knock.
- Come in!
Wow!
And wow.
Hey, are you on your way to meet with the casting director?
No, I'm on my way to change theater history.
You think this is a good outfit for changing history?
Perfect!
Mind if I tag along and film?
Not that you could ever mind me, right?
I think you should.
After all, not many people can say they were there to film the creation of a legend.
Sharpay!
You made it after all!
Destiny called, and I get great reception!
Well, your timing is perfect.
What's tomorrow like for you?
The first day of the rest of my fame.
Well, all right.
I'll set up your audition for 3:00.
I'll e-mail you the musical number that we'd like you to prepare.
And could you make sure that he's well-groomed and, you know, takes care of any business beforehand.
- What?
- What?
- He?
- Yes.
- Him?
- Him.
- He?
- Yes!
Wait, what?
It's your dog that we want to audition.
He was amazing!
Oh.
What?
I mean...
I sent you all the information in response to your e-mail.
I mean, didn't the title of the musical give you any indication?
A Girl's Best Friend?
A Girl's Best Friend!
And I'm here for the girl!
You're here for the girl?
Well, I'm never the best friend!
Oh, no.
No, no.
We wanted Boi.
As the girl?
No, as the best friend.
Wait, wait.
You wanted Boi as the best friend of the girl?
Not me as the girl with the best friend?
Exactly.
Oh, Sharpay, I am so sorry for the confusion.
If you don't want Boi to audition, I would totally understand.
Sharpay.
Sharpay!
Hey, stop.
Hey, don't touch the car!
Look, slow down.
Even New Yorkers can't keep up with you.
It's not even me they wanted!
Well, to be fair, the role is for a dog.
If they wanted you, I could understand you being upset.
Why did I come all this way?
Leave my friends, family, a dry, self-hydrating climate?
To follow your dream!
Or at least that's what I thought.
Nothing is turning out the way I planned it!
Plan A. Live in a penthouse and star on Broadway.
Plan B...
Don't have a plan B!
What do I tell my father now?
That you came to a very special city determined to be someone very special, which you are.
Oh, I'm not so special.
I'm just like everyone else.
Maybe a little better.
Look at it this way.
Boi is your dog, and he has an opportunity, so be happy for him.
You're right.
I'm being, you know, what's the word?
When you do something for yourself even though it's not so good for other people?
- Selfish?
- No!
Oh, yeah.
Look, Sharpay, you can't give up.
Okay?
And, anyway, you're officially the star of my film.
I am?
Yeah, you are.
Oh.
So now it's all about you?
Only because I need you here.
Fine.
I'll star in your movie.
Okay.
Good, good!
Okay, change of strategy.
I didn't know you had a strategy, but I like the way you think.
If Boi becomes a success, everyone will see me as well.
After all, I am his entourage.
I am the one who's holding his leash.
His fame will ultimately lead to my fame.
That's what I came here for, right?
Still a little selfish, but heading in the right direction.
We're gonna do this.
It's like I tell the housekeepers.
If you can't see the bright side, polish the dull side.
Yeah, not quite what I was talking...
They want Boi to audition?
It's Boi they will get!

Wait!
That's the best audition I've ever seen!
I'm Gill Samms, the director.
Neal Roberts, writer.
That was amazing!
Chills.
Feel my hand...
I won't feel your hand, but I believe you.
I won't feel your hand either, but I believe you, too.
That is one special dog.
We've done special here.
Special has been done, people!
Boi was meant for Broadway.
We both were.
So, when do we start?
Well, there's one more waiting.
One more!
One more, people!
Could you take a seat in the front row, please?
There.
Now.
Roger Elliston
the third.
And his dog, Countess.
FYI, I'm Roger.
As you can see by our extensive resume, hand-printed on carbonless, environmental-friendly rice paper,
Countess has numerous major Broadway credits under her paws, including The Collar Purple Three Puppy Opera, and the original Broadway cast production of A Wagging Tail of Two Cities, a musical opera in German.
Major pedigree.
I'm impressed.
This is us impressed.
Plus, she can bark a high C with sustained vibrato.
Sure, but only dogs can hear it.
All right.
Let's see what Countess can do.

- Amazing!
I weeped!
- Wept.
I wept!
- I wept!
- And not just regular weeping.
Theater weeping!
Amber Lee, what do you think?
Yes.
Amber Lee, thoughts?
Wow...
We are so meant to be BFFs!
Wow! "Wow" is a word, right?
Right.
Wow!
I just hope that the palpable chemistry surging between you and I right now like nuclear fusion won't in any way influence your decision towards our clearly superior audition.
How old are you?
Twelve.
I think I'm good.
And you, also!
Your dog...
Wow!
Wow.
I know, right?
He's just saying hi.
Sharpay Evans of the New Mexico Evans.
I'm a mega fan.
Oh, you are not!
So am!
I am gonna tweet about you right now.
Shut up!
I follow your tweets.
She did!
She tweeted!
Okay, I don't know how we're gonna decide.
You're amazing!
All this and a grade school diploma.
And you, amazing!
Wow.
I would be excited to work with either one of you and your dogs.
And can I just say, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Because Broadway...
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, real people are watching.
- Wow.
- Me, too.
I am just so excited to be performing on the Great White Way!
Not that I don't love all colors.
Well, I know both these talented dogs want to work with you.
But only one can be in the show.
- How are we gonna decide?
- Wait.
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals?
Wait!
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals!
That way I could see which one I work best with.
- That sounds like a solution.
- We have a solution, people!
Can I just say how totally great I think you are?
You do, and I'll never wash my ears again.
You know what I think?
Well, of course you don't because I just thought of it, but I think they loved you!
I like the way you think!
And you're such a good singer.
And I would know.
- My album went triple platinum.
- Well, I've done quite a bit of theater.
It totally shows.
Listen, I'm gonna have my assistant give you my phone number.
If there's anything that you need, you just let me know, okay?
We girls gotta stick together, right?
- Here.
- Wow.
I mean, this is actually your number!
It looks like any ordinary number, but it's not.
It's yours!
- Oh, and, hey, may the best dog win!
- Thanks!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Can you believe it?
You were great!
Boi was great.
This new strategy just might work.
- Amber Lee really likes you, too.
- Is she awesome or what?
She inspires me.
There.
I said it.
Quelle inspired.
We are so gonna get that part.
- How do you know?
- Easy.
I don't do rejection.
Sharpay!
I just wanted to wish you both luck.
Oh!
That's so nice of you.
And suggest that you give up now, while you still have your dignity.
Distant though it already might be.
Sorry, which Smurf are you again?
True, you have talent.
But you lack both the experience and the finesse to ever achieve the Holy Grail of possibility.
- Yeah, but Boi is cuter.
- Countess is a theatrical ninja.
I'm sorry.
For a minute there you just bored me to death.
I have a foolproof strategy of getting what I want.
See it, want it, have a fit, get it.
- Yeah, well, this playdate's over.
- I hope you enjoy rejection.
- We're gonna get that part.
- We're gonna destroy you.
- Bring it on.
- Oh, it's brought.
All right, Boi.
This foot.
That foot.
Good boy!
Yeah!
Okay, let's try our next one.
Stay.
Catch your tail.
Catch your tail!
Good!
Yeah, good.
Sit.
Stay.
We are so going to take them on.
I'm not gonna let some hobbit get in my way.
And, look.
All Boi can do is think about how horrible that other little mangy dog was.
If you want success so badly, then you will get it.
All you need is one shot to make it happen.
Yeah, and this is my shot.
It's like my grandmother says.
"God only got one book published,
"and look how well it did for him."
Doing this is all I've ever dreamed about, especially since I already have everything else.
Well, there's still humility.
What's wrong with being confident?
Confidence is when you know you're good.
Arrogance is when you think others know you're good.
Well, I want everyone to know I'm as good as I think everyone thinks I am without them knowing I know they think it.
- And do you have to film everything?
- Yep, 'cause this is my shot.
If my professor loves my film, he talks about it.
Then there's a buzz, then it gets in a festival, then it gets distribution, then I'm signing a studio deal, then I'm getting an Oscar.
I always knew I wanted to be an actress the first time I produced and performed the entire production of Snow white.
Full dance, musical numbers, handmade costumes.
I made my brother play all the dwarfs.
Everyone in that pre-school worshipped me.
I just want to wake up every morning and be onstage.
Good morning!
Good morning, everyone.
- And welcome to the first rehearsal...
- Of the new Broadway musical.
A Girl's Best Friend!
And you are all amazing.
- No, you are!
- Him or me?
- You!
- No, you!
Me?
Okay!
And heading our superb cast, we are thrilled to welcome one of the biggest stars around,
Amber Lee Adams!
Oh, stop!
- Yes!
- Guys, come on.
Can I just say that this, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, people can see if you write your lines on your hands!
All right.
Let's rehearse.
I want everybody downstairs with piano, rehearsing the music for the opening number.
Amber Lee and Judith,
I want you onstage so we can block that first scene.
- Let's go!
- Let's go, people!
All right.
Let's start with Boi.
Let's go!
What a perfect goodbye party.
Thank you, Mom!
I can't believe my little girl is going out into the world on her own for the first time.
I have to, Mom.
And who knows, maybe I'll find fame and fortune!
Actually, reverse that.
- Why is that funny?
- Well...
Because you'd rather have the...
I'll explain later.
Just keep going.
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Pick it up!
Go, go!
A star is about to be born!
Shelby!
Oh!
What's in this envelope?
This very wet envelope.
- Again, I don't get that.
- Keep going.
Gasp!
Actually, that's a stage direction.
You gasp, you don't say "gasp."
Simple mistake.
Keep going.
Shelby!
Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
Oh, Shelby.
This is the first time we'll be apart.
I wish I could just pack you up in a widdle doggie bag.
Okay.
Let's get Countess in there and continue.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Shelby and I will both be here when you get back.
You're killing me.
Oh!
That is adorable!
You're right, Shelby!
Why not go with me?
Any place that doesn't want you, I don't wanna be.
Let's see what New York has in store for us together!
Good.
Let's talk about the scene a bit, and we'll do it again.
And both dogs, great work!
Shelby!
Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
What's going on?
The dog.
What is this?
Somebody, please.
The dog is licking me.
All right, all right.
Get me the other dog!
Sorry.
What can you do?
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go, go!
- Why is she twirling?
- What is she doing?
- Gill?
- Roger!
Figure out what's going on with the dog.
It's not helping me.
- Not helping, people!
- Meanwhile, get the other dog!
Sorry.
What can you do?
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go!
Oh, hey!
How is this helping?
Really.
Am I the only one bothered by this?
Gill?
Okay, everybody, that's 10!
I'll admit you're good.
But we're better.
Give up!
Give up?
Not until there's a Broadway marquee with a picture of my dog so big you can walk by and smell his puppy breath!
I have to take the dogs for a nap.
Union rules.
Thank you.
- You break first.
- No, you break first.
Oh!
- Pretty cute, huh?
- Yeah!
Yes, they are!
I just wanted to tell you something.
This is my show.
I'm America's sweetheart.
They're paying to see me, not you two over-bred fur balls.
So, until I can figure out a way to get rid of you, you better watch your step, otherwise you'll find out the real meaning of going home in a doggie bag.
This film is cutting together really well.
Do I look amazing?
- The camera loves you.
- I know!
Oh, no!
My dad's video-chatting me.
He thinks I live in a penthouse.
I can't let him see that I live in a tiny studio in a filthy tenement.
With a boy in my room!
A boy, by the way, that has no money, and lives in a tinier studio, and who, apparently, has never heard of the word "maid-service"!
No offense.
What of that could possibly offend me?
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
I don't know.
Hyperventilating!
- What do I do?
What do I do?
- Come on.
Come on.
Hurry!
- All right, scoot over.
Okay, go, go.
- Okay, I gotta get this.
Stop!
Hi, Daddy!
Hey, princess!
How's my little girl?
Overpaying for everything and yelling at total strangers.
You're practically a native.
Hey, where are you?
That view is spectacular.
Well, there's hardly a penthouse in the city that doesn't have a spectacular view!
So, you the toast of Broadway?
Daddy, you know how I feel about carb references.
Just a little concerned, sweetie.
The last time no one's heard from you for this long was when you found out your gold card wasn't actually made of gold.
Well, I've been busy with rehearsals.
Outstanding!
You got into the show?
Well, it doesn't quite work like that.
It's complicated.
But I know it's gonna work out.
Sharpay, is there something you're not telling me?
You remember the deal, right?
If things aren't working out...
I know, I know.
I have one month to get in the show, and then...
Two weeks, sweetie.
You have two weeks left.
You're sure everything's okay?
It's fine, Daddy.
Well, okay.
We miss you, angel.
Miss you, too.
I love you!
Boi has to get that role.
I can't go home.
Not as a failure.
I need some sort of subtle, visibly crushing advantage over Roger.
Look, why not just trust Boi is talented, that you've trained him well,
- and let fate take it from there.
- Fate?
Fate gave a girl in my graduating class one long eyebrow.
I can't trust fate.
Some matters you just have to take into your own hands.
What do you mean you forgot my bottled water?
Well, I was going to get those magazines that you said you wanted from across town, and I got hit by a bike messenger.
So I went to the hospital for, like, just one second to get these stitches.
And meanwhile, I had no water!
I will get it for you right now.
Now I've had to drink tap!
- I am so sorry.
- "I am so sorry."
- I will do better.
- Forget it, okay?
Aside from catching some shade from the shadow cast by your madam's apple, you're of no use to me.
You're... fired!
God!
Amber Lee?
Oh, wow!
You look so cute, Sharpie!
- Sharpay.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
So, tell me, what's on your mind?
I just saw your assistant leave in tears.
She's not my assistant.
She quit.
No wonder she was crying.
Yeah, I don't think she even really cared.
Next time I should probably just hire a best friend instead.
Wait!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
What are you thinking that I should be thinking?
I could help you out until you replace her.
That is what I was thinking about thinking.
Of course this can't, in any way, affect your decision of which dog gets the starring role.
Oh, it won't.
I couldn't live with myself if I thought I did anything unfair.
You have my word.
Hey, I know!
How about dinner?
- That sounds awesome!
- Right?
Get me a reservation for two at someplace fantastic.
Then call my agent, have her meet me.
Right.
Sure.
Oh.
I won't forget this.
And I promise, it won't be because you're helping me if I happen to take a little extra liking to Girl.
- Boi.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
Oh, and can you take my mic down to the sound guy
- and tell him the wire hurts my scalp.
- Okay.
You're the best.
Amber Lee says the wire is hurting her scalp.
Personally, I think she's using the wrong shampoo, but she's the star, and you know, I don't wanna say anything.
You're hot.
Excuse me?
You're hot.
Okay.
Even though theater lighting highlights my natural skin tones, thank you for noticing, that's a little rude, don't you think?
No.
Your mic's hot.
It means it's on.
You see that little switch.
When it's flipped over like that, it means it's on and it's going through the entire theater.
Well, you could have led with that part, thank you.
Amber Lee's got a great scalp!
You're hot.
Then she asked me to help her out after her assistant quit.
And after I suggested it.
Are you sure this is wise?
I'm sorry.
Let me re-phrase that.
This isn't wise.
It's perfect.
Amber Lee will see that she and I are exactly alike, we'll become BFFs, she'll make sure Boi gets the role, then his fame becomes my fame!
I mean, this is the advantage I've been waiting for!
Isn't it more like taking advantage?
And my father thought I couldn't do this in a month.
It's turning out better than I imagined.
Hello?
Sure.
Be right over.
Hello?
Oh, thank goodness.
In here, quickly.
I just...
I can't reach that.
Can't reach it?
Okay, it was a little bit of a test.
Only a true friend would come all the way down here at this hour and help me with something like that.
- So, I passed?
- Yes.
- But, seriously, the purse.
- Okay.
Thank you.
All right, here's your bag.
Here's your other bag.
Oh, and don't forget your photo shoot.
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
You must be at that photo shoot to make sure I look as fabulous as you always do.
- Are you serious?
- Serious?
You're now also my stylist.
You have to tell me all your secrets.
Okay, gotta go.
"Life is so strange.
"Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune,
"and instead, we find love."
Hey!
How about dinner?
Split some egg rolls at Wok This Way?
Can't.
I have to highlight script changes for Amber Lee, then highlight her hair.
Highlight of my night!
Okay.
But I miss spending time with you.
And you did promise to shoot some more stuff for my film.
You know, what I'm doing is important, too.
Oh.
For a minute there, you sounded like Amber Lee.
"Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you."
Bad news.
My maid quit.
So, here's a list of chores.
Chores?
And I want to talk to you about Boi.
But you have to promise it'll stay between us.
Okay.
I think I'm going to ask the director to give Boi the part.
- Are you serious?
- Almost positive!
You won't be sorry.
Trust me.
I know.
Oh!
Oh, no.
There are some changes for the blocking in the dog scene, top of act two.
Countess can learn these in no time.
She's got a memory like a digital hard drive.
- No bark and all mega-bite.
- Funny.
I need to find Sharpay and make sure she gets them.
Boi is doing the first run-through tomorrow.
I'd be more than happy to deliver them to her.
- Great.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Sharpay?
That's unfortunate.
And I've been here ever since.
Life is so strange.
Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune, and instead, we find love.
Lenore, I have something to ask you.
We have something to ask you.
He's supposed to come from the other side of the stage with the ring box!
Yeah, sorry.
We changed that blocking.
What happened?
What is wrong with this dog?
And is he okay?
It's not his fault.
He's just a little dog!
He's just so sweet.
Okay, everybody.
Let's break for a few.
That's 10, people.
I'm aware.
I know.
I don't know what happened.
We sent out the script changes, but Boi didn't do them.
But I didn't get any new script change.
I looked everywhere last night to give them to you.
I guess working for Amber Lee has its drawbacks.
- You did this on purpose.
- That's a complete...
Yeah.
You're threatened because you know Amber Lee is gonna choose Boi.
Not after today she won't.
Okay.
Countess doesn't have half the personality that Boi has.
And Boi doesn't have half the talent that Countess has.
Isn't that right, girl?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Has anyone seen Boi?
- No, sorry.
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Anyone seen Countess?
- Nope.
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Hello?
- Boi and Countess are gone!
Gone!
What?
We have to find them!
Wait, where are you now?
Leaving the theater.
We're gonna look around here.
Can you look near the apartment in case they come back?
Yeah, yeah.
Of course.
Just keep me posted, and I'll call you if they show up.
Okay.
What if they were dog-napped?
Do you think we pushed them too hard?
- I don't know.
- Countess is über-sensitive.
She cries watching dog food commercials!
I just hope they're not huddled in a corner somewhere.
Afraid, lost, at each other's throats!
You knowyou love me I know you care
Just shout whenever And I'll be there
You are my love You are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item?
Girl, quit playin'
"We're just friends," What are you sayin'?
Said, "There's another" And looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine
I'm goin' down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around
And I'm like baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby...
What if we never see them again?
They're smart dogs.
Smarter than we are.
They'll be okay.
Oh, no.
It's my dad.
I just...
I can't deal with him right now.
- Countess!
- Boi!
Hi!
I missed you!
You're back!
It's amazing.
They came back to the apartment.
Thanks, Peyton.
Oh, and Sharpay, it's still on.
Bring it.
You're back!
Yeah!
You bad, bad boy, Boi.
I'm just glad you're okay.
He and Countess had an adventure.
She probably coaxed him into joining a doggy gang or something.
We'd better check him over for tattoos.
Are you so lost in what you're doing that you haven't noticed?
Noticed what?
Boi and Countess are in love.
- With what?
- Each other.
No way!
You're right.
He's dilated.
He's got puppy dog eyes.
How could I have not noticed puppy love?
Well, there's a lot you haven't noticed.
Like lately, you've had no time for me.
You know, I was counting on you to help me finish my film.
I said I would, and I will.
Things have become complicated.
It's not that complicated.
Amber Lee is using you, and you're letting her.
You don't know what you're talking about.
- I don't?
- No!
Where's the Sharpay that was determined not to go back home because she didn't want to work for anyone?
Why don't you tell me?
Working for someone, that's where.
- So at least be honest as to why.
- I know what I'm doing.
You've sold your soul to get Boi in that show, rather than trust in the dog that you raised.
Even worse, you've stopped trusting that your own talents would get you where you need to go.
And maybe you're jealous because I'm on my way up with a new famous friend, and you're just a student making a film about someone else's life instead of your own.
You don't have to be in my movie anymore.
I get it.
You have more important things to do.
Fine!
One question?
What happened to that hot pink whirlwind of confidence and ambition
I saw through my lens that first day you got here?
I mean, that girl knew she was special.
That girl knew she didn't have to do any of this to succeed.
What happened to her, huh?
Hello.
Oh, and Sharpay, can you remember to invite as many people from my fan club as possible to opening-night dress rehearsal?
I want the theater filled with people who love me as much as you do!
Sure.
You know what would be great after all this work?
A long, luxurious spa bath.
Sounds amazing!
Thank you.
Run one for me, will you?
And then you can finish these.
You're the best!
- This is a big change.
- Huge change!
I don't think you're hearing me!
New Jersey can hear you!
The name of the show is A Girl's Best Friend.
I didn't tell you to change the title.
But you want the best friend written out!
Oh.
Right.
Change the title!
How are we supposed to get rid of one of our main characters a day before our dress rehearsal in front of an audience?
The audience is coming to see me.
You change that dog's part to a bark and play dead, or I don't go on.
Let's be reasonable here.
I'm a star.
I don't have to be reasonable!
Look, those mangy mutts are bothering me almost as much as their disposable owners.
I actually had to have one of them clean my toilet just to keep her away.
She thinks she's an actress.
She acts all right.
She acts just like every other obsessed fan.
Wait.
Everything you said...
You were...
Right?
Yes.
Thank you.
You must think I'm a total fool.
No.
Not total.
Maybe my dad was right.
Maybe I'm not ready for this.
Maybe I should just go home and... work for him.
I mean, did I really think I was just gonna come to Broadway and be a star?
Yes.
Because that's exactly how you think.
It's perfect.
Perfect is so hard.
And it doesn't prepare you for disappointment.
Well, if it helps, you still look adorable, even when you're disappointed.
Yeah, that doesn't help.
Look, Sharpay.
There is not a marquee big enough or lights bright enough to contain the fame you're gonna have.
Yeah, but not the way I've been doing it.
Like you said, the Sharpay you know isn't the Sharpay that has become the Sharpay that is this Sharpay.
Did all the Sharpays follow that?
I sacrificed integrity for opportunity.
I let someone insecure distract me.
I cleaned a bathroom!
But worst of all, I disappointed someone I care about.
I forgot what was really important to me.
I lost track of what I want.
And other than maid service and a canopy bed, what is it that you want?
A fair fight.
A lifetime in the spotlight.
And maybe you'll still let me be in your movie.
I guess.
Okay, I can't say I approve of dating beneath your station in life, but fine.
Go.
Hey, I got your text.
What's C-Q-M-T-W-I-L-G-T mean?
"Come quick.
Major trouble.
Wow, I look great today." Duh.
I really should have gotten that.
Listen, Amber Lee Adams isn't what you think.
A self absorbed, two-faced panther who would eat her young alive on a reality show rather than allow anyone to steal her spotlight?
Okay, she's what you think.
Listen, I don't care if her parents had to tie beefjerky around her neck just to get the family dog to play with her, as long as Countess is at her side on that stage.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
She wants the part of the dog written out completely!
- That's not fair!
- Too far.
Well, I am 12, remember?
Roger, we've been fighting the wrong battle, each other.
We need to form an alliance and work against a common enemy.
- Zits?
- Amber Lee.
Trust me, the zit battle is one you won't win.
But what can we do?
Tonight is the dress rehearsal.
The audience will be filled with members of Amber Lee Adams' fan club.
I know, I saw the tweet.
Fine.
Yes, I follow her, too.
Okay, we need to show people exactly who Amber Lee really is.
It's time someone taught her how to behave in the theater.
I like the way you think.
It's manipulative, but for a good cause.
Tell me what you need me to do.
- Hey, Amber Lee, I...
- Where have you been?
I have been trying to reach you all day.
Oh.
Sorry, my phone must have been turned off.
Without asking me first?
I just wanted to say good luck.
You know, I know you chose Countess for this performance tonight, and I'm fine with that.
Well, it was nothing personal, but your phone was shut off, so I couldn't talk to you about it.
I guess that won't happen again, will it?
We're good.
Hug?
Okay.
Hello, everyone.
I'm Gill, the director.
And I'm Neal, the under-appreciated writer.
And we are thrilled that you're here for our first performance in front of an audience.
Does everyone here know how to applaud?
Okay, how about the balcony up there?
- Okay, now.
- Can you hear us?
You're good!
Will somebody please control these wannabe werewolves?
Hello?
People?
See, this is exactly why I didn't want to do a show with dogs!
I'm the star, not them!
Stage people?
Could somebody please put these rats with rabies out of my misery?
Anyone!
Finally, you idiot!
What took so long?
Now, hurry up and get these flea-bitten fur bags out of here!
- There are people waiting to see me!
- Okay, go now.
You think all those boring freaks with no lives came to worship two no-name mutts?
I don't think so!
I'm the one they love!
Me!
They came to see...
I knew I forgot to tell you something.
Careful, your mic's on.
You did this to me.
You ruined me!
News flash!
You ruined you!
Oh, what do you know?
You're a nobody!
The only reason you even wanted to be my friend is so I'd choose your dog!
No, no.
At first, I idolized you, even more than myself, which isn't easy.
But you're not at all what I thought you were.
You and I are exactly alike.
Except I don't enjoy letting people down.
I don't use people to feel better about myself.
And I definitely don't wear yellow and orange in the same week, let alone the same outfit, okay?
Maybe I did think you and I were alike, but not anymore.
In fact, I'd be embarrassed if someone thought I was like you.
Well, I quit!
And without me, there's no show.
Now neither one of your furry little friends will have their shot and neither will you.
Blame her!
I'm sorry.
Someone had to say it.
I'll go talk some sense into her.
You, out of this theater right now.
Wait, Sharpay.
If you go, then I'll go, too.
No.
You wanted this as badly as I did.
This mess was my idea.
You win.
That's not what it feels like.
- Hey.
Can I come in?
- Sure.
- So, you're really leaving, huh?
- Yeah.
I'm packing my carry-on stuff first.
- I wish you weren't going.
- Me, too.
Have you thought about what you're gonna do now?
Move home where there's enough room for my pores to open, spend months in the spa getting this layer of New York grime off my skin, and mostly miss you.
Look, I know exactly how to help that.
Don't go.
I already talked to my dad.
I guess I'm gonna start...
- You don't have to say it.
- Thank you.
What about your dream of being a star?
It's still there.
It's just a little bit more of a dream than a reality.
- You know what today is?
- What?
I got here exactly one month ago.
My time was up tonight anyway.
Well, so then you still have eight hours.
This isn't how my movie's supposed to end.
I guess it is.
This is Sharpay.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
No, no.
I'll be there.
That was the stage manager.
They want me to come to the theater and clear out Boi's things.
I can go with you if you want.
I want.
And, so, Amber Lee has quit.
- Gone.
- Kaput.
The producers feel, without a star, we can't open.
The time it would take to find someone who could learn the role and do it well might take weeks, and it would cost too much to keep the production going.
But we want you all to know, it was great almost working with you.
- I'm gonna meet you outside.
- All right.
Thank you for your hard work.
We are so, so sorry, people.
Wait!
Wait, it's not over.
It's not over.
Look, it doesn't have to be.
Look, there is someone who knows the part by heart and who is amazing.
All right, maybe she's not a star yet, but she will be.
This show will make her one.
Just watch.
Boi, keep your voice down.
Peyton, start shooting the rehearsal.
Boi, go mark.
Go mark.
Good!
Okay, stay.
Stay.
I love when you use that accent, but...
We're not supposed to be in here.
Okay, now let's do the scene where the character Lenore thinks she's lost everything and you come over to console her.
Come on.
Shelby, what is going on?
I feel invisible here.
Nothing is working out the way I planned it.
I got something inside ofme
Something that needs to be heard
Deep down a voice is guiding me
Hidden emotions have stirred
Why have I let others lead the way
When all along I know what it is I want to say
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
I thought I had a perfect plan
Where I would wind up on top
One day I'm thinking, "Yes I can"
Next thing you know, I'm a flop
Why did I ever play this silly game?
I got to shake up the rules
And stake my claim
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
What if I missed my window?
What if I blew my shot?
What if the only chance I was going to get
I already got?
I'm not ready to turn the page
Until I'm on stage in a show
No, nobody move I've got something to prove
Don't you know?
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
Well, did I tell you?
- Amazing!
- Amazing!
You're amahzing!
You have more depth, range and tone in one note than Amber Lee had in her entire surgically reshaped body.
We'll promote you as "The girl who we're promoting."
The producers will love it.
Wait, wait.
What are you saying?
We need you to save the show.
- Seriously?
- We know it's a risk.
- A gamble.
- A risk.
Did I do "risk" already?
You did.
And, true, we did fire you.
- He fired you.
- But now I'm un-firing you.
- Can we do that?
- Just did.
- Good for us!
- We need you.
What do you say?
Um...
I guess we could take the costumes in a few sizes and get everyone used to hearing the songs sung on key, but there's one condition.
Boi and Countess split the role of Shelby the dog equally.
Done!
We've a lot of work to do, people!
- Are we crazy?
- Crazy for theater!
- Let's rehearse!
- Let's rehearse, people!
Where are those wonderful dogs?
- Thank you.
- This is it.
The chance you've been waiting for.
- What if I'm not ready for this?
- Oh, you're ready.
"Ready" isn't as ready as you are.
- What if I'm horrible?
- Won't happen.
- What if I forget my lines?
- Impossible.
- What if I...
- Everything in your life so far has been leading you to this moment.
Your moment.
Embrace it.
I'm scared.
Finally.
Let's rehearse, people!
Over here!
Mr. Pinto, Mr. Pinto, over here.
Mr. Pinto, look this way.
I've got a feeling inside of me
Running all through my veins
It's like electrical energy
A world about to change
It's an open road
So here I go
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
I'm gonna go for it all out
I know there's no guarantee
But I've been given a chance and now
What's next is up to me
I'm gonna set my sights
So light those lights
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
If all the world's a stage
I'm here to take my place
I know I'll always find a way to shine
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
It starts with a dream
Of who I could be
Wherever it takes me I can't wait
So I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
I want fabulous That is my simple request
All things fabulous Bigger and better and best
I need something inspiring to help me get along
I need a little fabulous Is that so wrong?
Fetch me my Jimmy Choo flip-flops
Where is my pink Prada tote?
A summer like never before
I want more!
She wants fabulous That is her simple request
All things fabulous Bigger and better and best
She needs something inspiring to help her get along
She needs a little fabulous Is that so wrong?
Absolutely...
Not!
English

- SDH
There's a moment when you realize that something's changed
And all the bits and pieces start to fit
It's so fab!
When nothing that you know will ever be the same
Ring the bell
That's my cue
Gotta try something new
Gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
Yeah
Listen up, fellas.
Now there's nothing in this universe to hold me back
Bye, Gab.
No endless night can keep me in the dark
And I just might give my dear old dad a heart attack
- But he'll live
- He'll live
- And he'll see
- He'll see
What his girl is meant to be
Gonna shine
And leave the past behind
Gonna try to fly so high
Gonna climb and make the prize all mine
Then I'll write my name in letters across the sky
I'm gonna shine
And if my present luminescent state is second rate
I'll turn it up a notch past nine
And watch the world go blind
Got a diva dazzle that you just can't touch
Like an angel in Armani I'm too fabulous
They'll be lining up for blocks Once I bop to the top
With a poochie in my Gucci I just can't be stopped
I'm gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
There she is.
Wonderful!
Hi!
- I know, I know.
- I loved it.
Excuse us.
There's our little superstar!
Princess, you had better watch out for law enforcement.
They are gonna come after you for stealing the show!
Honey, on a scale of one to 10, you were an entirely different scale.
And you know my aversion to scales.
Sharpay!
Yes, I know.
And thank you.
We'd like to introduce you to Jerry Taylor.
He's a good friend of our family, visiting for the week.
May I just say how wonderful you were?
As many times as you'd like!
I really see a unique talent here.
I mean, a true gift.
And your kind, true words are a gift as well.
It was so nice to meet you.
But if you'll excuse me, my friends have been waiting.
I'm a casting agent from New York.
And will keep waiting until I tell you how much I love your suit.
I'm about to start casting for a new musical on Broadway.
Broadway?
As in "Broadway?"
Yeah.
And I think that there is a perfect part.
I would be more than happy to arrange an audition if you happen to find yourself in the Big Apple any time soon.
That would be...
I would be...
It would be, like...
The show is gonna star Amber Lee Adams.
- No.
- Yeah.
Stop.
Seriously, stop.
Who's Amber Lee Adams?
She's only the most amazing performer ever!
We have so much in common.
I won't keep you.
It was so nice to meet you, Sharpay.
Congratulations again.
And, who knows, maybe we'll see you in New York.
Okay?
- Congrats!
- Bye.
Toodles!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
- No!
- No?
I don't understand!
What language is that?
No, I don't think going to New York is a good idea.
See, there you go, believing everything you think.
Do you really believe you're ready for such a monumental step?
Daddy, the main reason I buy such expensive shoes is to take monumental steps.
Sweetheart, when you graduated from high school almost a year ago, do you remember what you said to me?
"How come no one makes a cap and gown in hot pink?"
No.
"How come you get a car and driver and I don't?"
- No.
- "Good luck finding anyone
"to fill the talent-less void of boring and unattractive
"that will exist in these hallways
- "once I graduate"?
- No.
Yes, but you also said that you needed a year to find yourself, to figure out what came next in your life.
That year's almost up, and you haven't found anything.
It's a small town.
I mean, there's only so many places to look.
Besides, I did find something.
A show I wanna be in.
This is more than just a show.
You're talking about going it alone in the big city.
Right!
To star on Broadway with Amber Lee Adams.
Could you really deny the world that opportunity?
I'm sorry, princess.
But nothing you've shown me convinces me you're ready for something like this.
Okay, ladies.
Team Sharpay.
New York.
Daddy says I'm not ready for this.
So, what does that mean?
You pout, throw a tantrum, and he buys you a new Burberry bag to make you feel better?
That's good, but no.
It means we show him I'm determined.
And when I make up my mind...
And no one is better with make-up.
...my mind looks amazing.
Okay, here's your assignments.
I texted Bridget, who e-mailed Constance, who tweeted Bethany, who IM'ed Jenn, who Facebooked Kara, who has an ex-friend who she caught with her boyfriend, who she then dumped, so now Kara's her friend again,
who knows of a New York apartment available in a luxury townhouse.
That is, like, the best house you can get in terms of towns.
- Sounds perfect.
- It gets better.
- It can't.
- But it does.
It is equal distance from both Chanel and wicked.
Okay.
Now, on to travel plans.
That's right.
Albuquerque to New York.
One adult and one dog.
Excuse me?
Coach?
Hi, I'm calling for Sharpay Evans.
Mr. Taylor wanted to set up an audition with her for a new musical.
Two weeks from today is perfect.
Now, new outfits.
And this would be for opening night.
The beading actually doubles the reflection of paparazzi flashbulbs!
You can wear anything.
You should have your own reality show called I Can Wear Anything.
Where you wear anything.
All right.
I'm ready to show Daddy what we've accomplished.
Ladies, and people I don't know,
New York is calling.
And this is one call that is not going to voice-mail.
So, by way of review, this is my shoe closet, that is my bedroom, these are my new clothes and where I'll wear them, and then I'm a star!
See?
I'm just not totally convinced.
Daddy, you said I haven't shown you anything to let you know I'm ready for this.
But, look, I took matters into my own hands, and without even chipping my manicure.
Sweetheart, it's not as easy as putting pictures on boards.
But I've worked everything out!
And used this pointer.
- I don't know...
- Please, Daddy.
Alone, in New York?
My dear college friend, Michelle, has a son that goes to NYU.
I've met him.
He's a very nice boy.
I could ask her to make sure that he keeps his eye on you.
Are you sure you're ready to take this on?
I know I can do this.
I know it like I know purple washes me out and that my eyes are the exact same distance apart to be a supermodel.
What I don't know is whether you believe in me.
Mom seems to.
Okay, you have my blessing.
Thank you, Daddy!
I'll call my friend Michelle and have her talk to her son.
Thanks, Mom.
There's just one condition.
Fine.
I love a good conditioner.
You have one month.
I'll fly you to New York, I'll pay for your penthouse, but you have to get yourself in that show and prove to me you can take care of yourself.
One month.
- Deal?
- So deal!
But if it doesn't work out, you come back here and work for me.
At the country club.
- Work?
- A job.
That's the deal.
Prove yourself, or come back in a month and work for me.
Fine.
Prove myself it is!
Look!
Look, Boi, look!
- Sharpay?
- In the flesh and pastels!
- We've been awaiting your arrival.
- Then the wait's over!
We spoke on the phone.
I'm Marjorie Grande, the manager for the building.
My pleasure.
Please, follow me to the penthouse.
Ooh!
I hope this is to your liking.
No.
It's to my loving!
Boi, you've gotta see this.
- That's a dog.
- Try to get him to believe that.
I'm sorry.
There are no dogs in the building.
Sure there are.
See?
The members of the co-op board have a strict no-dog policy.
Well...
My father heads our country club board, so I'm sure that gives me some kind of board immunity.
Miss Sharpay, this building is pleased to have you.
This dog...
Not so pleased.
Miss Grande, Ma'am.
If he goes, I go.
What are you doing?
Filming you.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
Do you always just film totally stunning people on the street that you don't know?
Only when I think the subject is interesting.
And you look baffled and scared and really pink.
So, yeah, interesting.
Are you paparazzi?
I'm a film student at NYU, working on a short film.
The assignment is to capture one unique New York story.
Maybe you're it.
So, you decided to film me without my permission, just for a school assignment?
- Yep.
- How dare you!
And my left side is better for close-ups.
I'm Peyton.
Sharpay Evans.
Actress, heiress, soon to be Broadway legend.
- Wait!
- About 105,
- but it's really not polite to ask.
- No...
I should know my own weight, okay?
No, I'm Peyton Leverett.
Our moms went to college together.
This is crazy!
I was on my way up to your apartment to make sure you were okay.
And here you are.
Right, they told me to expect you.
Well, glad we could finally meet.
- Oh, and this is Boi.
- Well, nice to meet you, Boi.
So, why are you out here?
Is everything okay?
Not really.
When I rented this apartment online, it never said they don't allow dogs.
And now they won't let us live here.
Yeah, well, it's their loss!
- Do you have someplace else to go?
- Okay, it's my loss and their loss!
Actually, the only place I have to go is home.
And trust me, that is not an option!
Listen, there's an empty studio in my building, if you're interested.
I'm friends with the building manager.
I'm sure I can make a call.
And...
Well, I'm sure I can make a call and arrange something.
Maybe get you to see it.
Well, since I don't seem to have any other options.
Bellman!
Oh, yeah, right.
Seriously?
Careful with those!
This is all I have to get by on until the truck arrives with the bulk of my things.
Oh!
That's good.
Okay, now, go outside, and then come back in and give me even more of that it's-the-end-of-the-world look.
Okay?
- Hey, Peyton.
- Hey, Peyton!
- What's up?
- Off to acting class.
"Maggie, the cat is alive.
I'm alive!"
Singing lesson.
Cool, guys.
Okay.
Hey, this is Sharpay and Boi.
Hi, Sharpay.
Hi, Boi!
Anyways, gotta go.
See ya, Peyton.
- Nice meeting you, Sharpay.
- Later, guys.
Okay.
Really, you're going to love this place.
Okay?
Up you go.
Sorry.
It's a pre-war building.
And during the war, they didn't fight for an elevator?
Listen, the building has two things going for it.
It's got something available, and I live here.
Fine.
But if I break a heel, or a sweat, you're responsible.
Get my bags.
See?
That wasn't so bad.
Yeah.
Down the hall.
The one with the police tape and chalk outline.
Really?
Kidding.
- You said this was a studio.
- It is.
No way!
MGM was a studio!
This?
This is a roach motel with no room service.
Yeah, a studio apartment.
Sure, from certain angles, it's a bit small.
A two-karat engagement ring is a bit small!
This is a doll house!
- So what do you think?
- Forget it!
I'd need an entirely separate apartment just for my lipsticks.
And where am I supposed to sleep?
- What is that?
- It's your bed.
That is not a bed.
It's a closet with a tongue.
You can't be serious!
- There is one really good thing about it.
- Yeah, sure.
See?
This is my place!
Looking better, huh?
Am I missing something?
Oh, right.
Space!
Luxury!
Maid service!
Let me guess.
You're used to being spoiled.
I'm not used to it.
I just expect it.
You know, half this building is filled with performers who came here with the same ambitions you did.
What makes you so much better than them?
Money, breeding, talent, great hair, perfect jaw line, chic taste.
How much time do you have?
All right, fine.
I tried to help you out like my mom asked, but whatever.
I'll find someone else to film.
The only problem is if I call my father and tell him how I messed up on the other apartment and how I have nowhere to go but here, and I ask for his help, he'll make me come home and...
Work!
- So?
- So?
Then I'll never get my big break.
Oh, and promise you won't call your mother and tell her about this, because then she'll call my mom who will tell my dad, and I don't think he really believes I can make this happen.
He only gave me one month to prove it.
Well, then you've got one month to prove him wrong.
Why did I do this?
I want my canopy bed and my housekeeper.
And a shower that doesn't share a room with a kitchen.
- Come on.
- Where to?
- Do you trust me?
- You suggested this place.
Yeah.
Point taken.
Come anyway.
Come on.
I hope you're taking me to a better apartment than what you just showed me.
Because let me tell you, if that's it?
No way!
Absolutely no!
Just come on.
Just don't ask any questions.
I need luxury!
Are you kidding me?
That was like a green, dark hole that I never wanna be in ever again.
All right, here you go.
Butchy!
- Come on...
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.
Come on.
- Why are we here?
All right, all right.
Now, you're gonna have to close your eyes.
- Close my eyes?
- Yeah, just close your eyes.
- Why?
- Because!
Just do it.
All right, now.
Keep them closed.
- Well, what if I hit into something?
- You won't.
I got you.
All right, all right.
Keep them closed.
All right.
- All right, you got them closed?
- Yes, I do.
All right, all right.
Perfect.
All right.
Now, stay here, keep them closed.
Keep them closed.
All righty.
Keep them closed.
All right.
Open them.
Hit it, Butchy!
Wow.
I know.
When I left Indiana to go to school here, I didn't know a soul either, and I was just as overwhelmed as you.
But I had two things, my dream and my camera.
And look at me now.
You still only have your dream and your camera.
Yes, but I met you, didn't I?
So, something's working out.
Well, whenever people meet me, things get better.
Look, you just have to adapt to your surroundings.
And remember that for now this is all just temporary.
Right.
Like prom dresses and first boyfriends.
Look, anything you have to do will be worth it to get your dream.
Okay.
I'm gonna meet with that casting director, get the part,
- be a star and have a palace!
- There you go.
That's the self-indulgent, self-entitled, optimistic pink hurricane
I've been seeing through my lens.
And I like how perceptive you are.
Okay, New York.
Bring it on.
I used to think maybe you loved me
Now, baby, I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day When you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox Gotta hold myself down
"Cause I just can't wait till you write me You're coming around
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
- And don't it feel good!
- Hey!
All right now And don't it feel good!
Hey!
All right now, yeah
Hi!
Turn it off.
Turn it off!
Just waiting foryou
Just waiting for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day
No, no, no
What?
I want you to stay
I'm walking on sunshine
- And don't it feel good!
- Hey!
All right now And don't it feel good!
Oh, yeah!
Looking good.
So pink.
You're good.
- Do you wanna try some?
- No, I don't want any!
Lay down.
Lay down.
Night, Boi!
Boi?
Get help!
- Knock, knock.
- Come in!
Wow!
And wow.
Hey, are you on your way to meet with the casting director?
No, I'm on my way to change theater history.
You think this is a good outfit for changing history?
Perfect!
Mind if I tag along and film?
Not that you could ever mind me, right?
I think you should.
After all, not many people can say they were there to film the creation of a legend.
Sharpay!
You made it after all!
Destiny called, and I get great reception!
Well, your timing is perfect.
What's tomorrow like for you?
The first day of the rest of my fame.
Well, all right.
I'll set up your audition for 3:00.
I'll e-mail you the musical number that we'd like you to prepare.
And could you make sure that he's well-groomed and, you know, takes care of any business beforehand.
- What?
- What?
- He?
- Yes.
- Him?
- Him.
- He?
- Yes!
Wait, what?
It's your dog that we want to audition.
He was amazing!
Oh.
What?
I mean...
I sent you all the information in response to your e-mail.
I mean, didn't the title of the musical give you any indication?
A Girl's Best Friend?
A Girl's Best Friend!
And I'm here for the girl!
You're here for the girl?
Well, I'm never the best friend!
Oh, no.
No, no.
We wanted Boi.
As the girl?
No, as the best friend.
Wait, wait.
You wanted Boi as the best friend of the girl?
Not me as the girl with the best friend?
Exactly.
Oh, Sharpay, I am so sorry for the confusion.
If you don't want Boi to audition, I would totally understand.
Sharpay.
Sharpay!
Hey, stop.
Hey, don't touch the car!
Look, slow down.
Even New Yorkers can't keep up with you.
It's not even me they wanted!
Well, to be fair, the role is for a dog.
If they wanted you, I could understand you being upset.
Why did I come all this way?
Leave my friends, family, a dry, self-hydrating climate?
To follow your dream!
Or at least that's what I thought.
Nothing is turning out the way I planned it!
Plan A. Live in a penthouse and star on Broadway.
Plan B...
Don't have a plan B!
What do I tell my father now?
That you came to a very special city determined to be someone very special, which you are.
Oh, I'm not so special.
I'm just like everyone else.
Maybe a little better.
Look at it this way.
Boi is your dog, and he has an opportunity, so be happy for him.
You're right.
I'm being, you know, what's the word?
When you do something for yourself even though it's not so good for other people?
- Selfish?
- No!
Oh, yeah.
Look, Sharpay, you can't give up.
Okay?
And, anyway, you're officially the star of my film.
I am?
Yeah, you are.
Oh.
So now it's all about you?
Only because I need you here.
Fine.
I'll star in your movie.
Okay.
Good, good!
Okay, change of strategy.
I didn't know you had a strategy, but I like the way you think.
If Boi becomes a success, everyone will see me as well.
After all, I am his entourage.
I am the one who's holding his leash.
His fame will ultimately lead to my fame.
That's what I came here for, right?
Still a little selfish, but heading in the right direction.
We're gonna do this.
It's like I tell the housekeepers.
If you can't see the bright side, polish the dull side.
Yeah, not quite what I was talking...
They want Boi to audition?
It's Boi they will get!

That's the best audition I've ever seen!
I'm Gill Samms, the director.
Neal Roberts, writer.
That was amazing!
Chills.
Feel my hand...
I won't feel your hand, but I believe you.
I won't feel your hand either, but I believe you, too.
That is one special dog.
We've done special here.
Special has been done, people!
Boi was meant for Broadway.
We both were.
So, when do we start?
Well, there's one more waiting.
One more!
One more, people!
Could you take a seat in the front row, please?
There.
Now.
Roger Elliston
the third.
And his dog, Countess.
FYI, I'm Roger.
As you can see by our extensive resume, hand-printed on carbonless, environmental-friendly rice paper,
Countess has numerous major Broadway credits under her paws, including The Collar Purple Three Puppy Opera, and the original Broadway cast production of A Wagging Tail of Two Cities, a musical opera in German.
Major pedigree.
I'm impressed.
This is us impressed.
Plus, she can bark a high C with sustained vibrato.
Sure, but only dogs can hear it.
All right.
Let's see what Countess can do.

- Amazing!
I weeped!
- Wept.
I wept!
- I wept!
- And not just regular weeping.
Theater weeping!
Amber Lee, what do you think?
Yes.
Amber Lee, thoughts?
Wow...
We are so meant to be BFFs!
Wow! "Wow" is a word, right?
Right.
Wow!
I just hope that the palpable chemistry surging between you and I right now like nuclear fusion won't in any way influence your decision towards our clearly superior audition.
How old are you?
Twelve.
I think I'm good.
And you, also!
Your dog...
Wow!
Wow.
I know, right?
He's just saying hi.
Sharpay Evans of the New Mexico Evans.
I'm a mega fan.
Oh, you are not!
So am!
I am gonna tweet about you right now.
Shut up!
I follow your tweets.
She did!
She tweeted!
Okay, I don't know how we're gonna decide.
You're amazing!
All this and a grade school diploma.
And you, amazing!
Wow.
I would be excited to work with either one of you and your dogs.
And can I just say, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Because Broadway...
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, real people are watching.
- Wow.
- Me, too.
I am just so excited to be performing on the Great White Way!
Not that I don't love all colors.
Well, I know both these talented dogs want to work with you.
But only one can be in the show.
- How are we gonna decide?
- Wait.
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals?
Wait!
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals!
That way I could see which one I work best with.
- That sounds like a solution.
- We have a solution, people!
Can I just say how totally great I think you are?
You do, and I'll never wash my ears again.
You know what I think?
Well, of course you don't because I just thought of it, but I think they loved you!
I like the way you think!
And you're such a good singer.
And I would know.
- My album went triple platinum.
- Well, I've done quite a bit of theater.
It totally shows.
Listen, I'm gonna have my assistant give you my phone number.
If there's anything that you need, you just let me know, okay?
We girls gotta stick together, right?
- Here.
- Wow.
I mean, this is actually your number!
It looks like any ordinary number, but it's not.
It's yours!
- Oh, and, hey, may the best dog win!
- Thanks!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Can you believe it?
You were great!
Boi was great.
This new strategy just might work.
- Amber Lee really likes you, too.
- Is she awesome or what?
She inspires me.
There.
I said it.
Quelle inspired.
We are so gonna get that part.
- How do you know?
- Easy.
I don't do rejection.
Sharpay!
I just wanted to wish you both luck.
Oh!
That's so nice of you.
And suggest that you give up now, while you still have your dignity.
Distant though it already might be.
Sorry, which Smurf are you again?
True, you have talent.
But you lack both the experience and the finesse to ever achieve the Holy Grail of possibility.
- Yeah, but Boi is cuter.
- Countess is a theatrical ninja.
I'm sorry.
For a minute there you just bored me to death.
I have a foolproof strategy of getting what I want.
See it, want it, have a fit, get it.
- Yeah, well, this playdate's over.
- I hope you enjoy rejection.
- We're gonna get that part.
- We're gonna destroy you.
- Bring it on.
- Oh, it's brought.
All right, Boi.
This foot.
That foot.
Good boy!
Yeah!
Okay, let's try our next one.
Stay.
Catch your tail.
Catch your tail!
Good!
Yeah, good.
Sit.
Stay.
We are so going to take them on.
I'm not gonna let some hobbit get in my way.
And, look.
All Boi can do is think about how horrible that other little mangy dog was.
If you want success so badly, then you will get it.
All you need is one shot to make it happen.
Yeah, and this is my shot.
It's like my grandmother says.
"God only got one book published,
"and look how well it did for him."
Doing this is all I've ever dreamed about, especially since I already have everything else.
Well, there's still humility.
What's wrong with being confident?
Confidence is when you know you're good.
Arrogance is when you think others know you're good.
Well, I want everyone to know I'm as good as I think everyone thinks I am without them knowing I know they think it.
- And do you have to film everything?
- Yep, 'cause this is my shot.
If my professor loves my film, he talks about it.
Then there's a buzz, then it gets in a festival, then it gets distribution, then I'm signing a studio deal, then I'm getting an Oscar.
I always knew I wanted to be an actress the first time I produced and performed the entire production of Snow white.
Full dance, musical numbers, handmade costumes.
I made my brother play all the dwarfs.
Everyone in that pre-school worshipped me.
I just want to wake up every morning and be onstage.
Good morning!
Good morning, everyone.
- And welcome to the first rehearsal...
- Of the new Broadway musical.
A Girl's Best Friend!
And you are all amazing.
- No, you are!
- Him or me?
- You!
- No, you!
Me?
Okay!
And heading our superb cast, we are thrilled to welcome one of the biggest stars around,
Amber Lee Adams!
Oh, stop!
- Yes!
- Guys, come on.
Can I just say that this, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, people can see if you write your lines on your hands!
All right.
Let's rehearse.
I want everybody downstairs with piano, rehearsing the music for the opening number.
Amber Lee and Judith,
I want you onstage so we can block that first scene.
- Let's go!
- Let's go, people!
All right.
Let's start with Boi.
Let's go!
What a perfect goodbye party.
Thank you, Mom!
I can't believe my little girl is going out into the world on her own for the first time.
I have to, Mom.
And who knows, maybe I'll find fame and fortune!
Actually, reverse that.
- Why is that funny?
- Well...
Because you'd rather have the...
I'll explain later.
Just keep going.
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Pick it up!
Go, go!
A star is about to be born!
Shelby!
Oh!
What's in this envelope?
This very wet envelope.
- Again, I don't get that.
- Keep going.
Gasp!
Actually, that's a stage direction.
You gasp, you don't say "gasp."
Simple mistake.
Keep going.
Shelby!
Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
Oh, Shelby.
This is the first time we'll be apart.
I wish I could just pack you up in a widdle doggie bag.
Okay.
Let's get Countess in there and continue.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Shelby and I will both be here when you get back.
You're killing me.
Oh!
That is adorable!
You're right, Shelby!
Why not go with me?
Any place that doesn't want you, I don't wanna be.
Let's see what New York has in store for us together!
Good.
Let's talk about the scene a bit, and we'll do it again.
And both dogs, great work!
Shelby!
Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
What's going on?
The dog.
What is this?
Somebody, please.
The dog is licking me.
All right, all right.
Get me the other dog!
Sorry.
What can you do?
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go, go!
- Why is she twirling?
- What is she doing?
- Gill?
- Roger!
Figure out what's going on with the dog.
It's not helping me.
- Not helping, people!
- Meanwhile, get the other dog!
Sorry.
What can you do?
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go!
Oh, hey!
How is this helping?
Really.
Am I the only one bothered by this?
Gill?
Okay, everybody, that's 10!
I'll admit you're good.
But we're better.
Give up!
Give up?
Not until there's a Broadway marquee with a picture of my dog so big you can walk by and smell his puppy breath!
I have to take the dogs for a nap.
Union rules.
Thank you.
- You break first.
- No, you break first.
Oh!
- Pretty cute, huh?
- Yeah!
Yes, they are!
I just wanted to tell you something.
This is my show.
I'm America's sweetheart.
They're paying to see me, not you two over-bred fur balls.
So, until I can figure out a way to get rid of you, you better watch your step, otherwise you'll find out the real meaning of going home in a doggie bag.
This film is cutting together really well.
Do I look amazing?
- The camera loves you.
- I know!
Oh, no!
My dad's video-chatting me.
He thinks I live in a penthouse.
I can't let him see that I live in a tiny studio in a filthy tenement.
With a boy in my room!
A boy, by the way, that has no money, and lives in a tinier studio, and who, apparently, has never heard of the word "maid-service"!
No offense.
What of that could possibly offend me?
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
I don't know.
Hyperventilating!
- What do I do?
What do I do?
- Come on.
Come on.
Hurry!
- All right, scoot over.
Okay, go, go.
- Okay, I gotta get this.
Stop!
Hi, Daddy!
Hey, princess!
How's my little girl?
Overpaying for everything and yelling at total strangers.
You're practically a native.
Hey, where are you?
That view is spectacular.
Well, there's hardly a penthouse in the city that doesn't have a spectacular view!
So, you the toast of Broadway?
Daddy, you know how I feel about carb references.
Just a little concerned, sweetie.
The last time no one's heard from you for this long was when you found out your gold card wasn't actually made of gold.
Well, I've been busy with rehearsals.
Outstanding!
You got into the show?
Well, it doesn't quite work like that.
It's complicated.
But I know it's gonna work out.
Sharpay, is there something you're not telling me?
You remember the deal, right?
If things aren't working out...
I know, I know.
I have one month to get in the show, and then...
Two weeks, sweetie.
You have two weeks left.
You're sure everything's okay?
It's fine, Daddy.
Well, okay.
We miss you, angel.
Miss you, too.
I love you!
Boi has to get that role.
I can't go home.
Not as a failure.
I need some sort of subtle, visibly crushing advantage over Roger.
Look, why not just trust Boi is talented, that you've trained him well,
- and let fate take it from there.
- Fate?
Fate gave a girl in my graduating class one long eyebrow.
I can't trust fate.
Some matters you just have to take into your own hands.
What do you mean you forgot my bottled water?
Well, I was going to get those magazines that you said you wanted from across town, and I got hit by a bike messenger.
So I went to the hospital for, like, just one second to get these stitches.
And meanwhile, I had no water!
I will get it for you right now.
Now I've had to drink tap!
- I am so sorry.
- "I am so sorry."
- I will do better.
- Forget it, okay?
Aside from catching some shade from the shadow cast by your madam's apple, you're of no use to me.
You're... fired!
God!
Amber Lee?
Oh, wow!
You look so cute, Sharpie!
- Sharpay.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
So, tell me, what's on your mind?
I just saw your assistant leave in tears.
She's not my assistant.
She quit.
No wonder she was crying.
Yeah, I don't think she even really cared.
Next time I should probably just hire a best friend instead.
Wait!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
What are you thinking that I should be thinking?
I could help you out until you replace her.
That is what I was thinking about thinking.
Of course this can't, in any way, affect your decision of which dog gets the starring role.
Oh, it won't.
I couldn't live with myself if I thought I did anything unfair.
You have my word.
Hey, I know!
How about dinner?
- That sounds awesome!
- Right?
Get me a reservation for two at someplace fantastic.
Then call my agent, have her meet me.
Right.
Sure.
Oh.
I won't forget this.
And I promise, it won't be because you're helping me if I happen to take a little extra liking to Girl.
- Boi.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
Oh, and can you take my mic down to the sound guy
- and tell him the wire hurts my scalp.
- Okay.
You're the best.
Amber Lee says the wire is hurting her scalp.
Personally, I think she's using the wrong shampoo, but she's the star, and you know, I don't wanna say anything.
You're hot.
Excuse me?
You're hot.
Okay.
Even though theater lighting highlights my natural skin tones, thank you for noticing, that's a little rude, don't you think?
No.
Your mic's hot.
It means it's on.
You see that little switch.
When it's flipped over like that, it means it's on and it's going through the entire theater.
Well, you could have led with that part, thank you.
Amber Lee's got a great scalp!
You're hot.
Then she asked me to help her out after her assistant quit.
And after I suggested it.
Are you sure this is wise?
I'm sorry.
Let me re-phrase that.
This isn't wise.
It's perfect.
Amber Lee will see that she and I are exactly alike, we'll become BFFs, she'll make sure Boi gets the role, then his fame becomes my fame!
I mean, this is the advantage I've been waiting for!
Isn't it more like taking advantage?
And my father thought I couldn't do this in a month.
It's turning out better than I imagined.
Hello?
Sure.
Be right over.
Hello?
Oh, thank goodness.
In here, quickly.
I just...
I can't reach that.
Can't reach it?
Okay, it was a little bit of a test.
Only a true friend would come all the way down here at this hour and help me with something like that.
- So, I passed?
- Yes.
- But, seriously, the purse.
- Okay.
Thank you.
All right, here's your bag.
Here's your other bag.
Oh, and don't forget your photo shoot.
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
You must be at that photo shoot to make sure I look as fabulous as you always do.
- Are you serious?
- Serious?
You're now also my stylist.
You have to tell me all your secrets.
Okay, gotta go.
"Life is so strange.
"Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune,
"and instead, we find love."
Hey!
How about dinner?
Split some egg rolls at Wok This Way?
Can't.
I have to highlight script changes for Amber Lee, then highlight her hair.
Highlight of my night!
Okay.
But I miss spending time with you.
And you did promise to shoot some more stuff for my film.
You know, what I'm doing is important, too.
Oh.
For a minute there, you sounded like Amber Lee.
"Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you."
Bad news.
My maid quit.
So, here's a list of chores.
Chores?
And I want to talk to you about Boi.
But you have to promise it'll stay between us.
Okay.
I think I'm going to ask the director to give Boi the part.
- Are you serious?
- Almost positive!
You won't be sorry.
Trust me.
I know.
Oh!
Oh, no.
There are some changes for the blocking in the dog scene, top of act two.
Countess can learn these in no time.
She's got a memory like a digital hard drive.
- No bark and all mega-bite.
- Funny.
I need to find Sharpay and make sure she gets them.
Boi is doing the first run-through tomorrow.
I'd be more than happy to deliver them to her.
- Great.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Sharpay?
That's unfortunate.
And I've been here ever since.
Life is so strange.
Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune, and instead, we find love.
Lenore, I have something to ask you.
We have something to ask you.
He's supposed to come from the other side of the stage with the ring box!
Yeah, sorry.
We changed that blocking.
What happened?
What is wrong with this dog?
And is he okay?
It's not his fault.
He's just a little dog!
He's just so sweet.
Okay, everybody.
Let's break for a few.
That's 10, people.
I'm aware.
I know.
I don't know what happened.
We sent out the script changes, but Boi didn't do them.
But I didn't get any new script change.
I looked everywhere last night to give them to you.
I guess working for Amber Lee has its drawbacks.
- You did this on purpose.
- That's a complete...
Yeah.
You're threatened because you know Amber Lee is gonna choose Boi.
Not after today she won't.
Okay.
Countess doesn't have half the personality that Boi has.
And Boi doesn't have half the talent that Countess has.
Isn't that right, girl?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Has anyone seen Boi?
- No, sorry.
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Anyone seen Countess?
- Nope.
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Hello?
- Boi and Countess are gone!
Gone!
What?
We have to find them!
Wait, where are you now?
Leaving the theater.
We're gonna look around here.
Can you look near the apartment in case they come back?
Yeah, yeah.
Of course.
Just keep me posted, and I'll call you if they show up.
Okay.
What if they were dog-napped?
Do you think we pushed them too hard?
- I don't know.
- Countess is über-sensitive.
She cries watching dog food commercials!
I just hope they're not huddled in a corner somewhere.
Afraid, lost, at each other's throats!
You knowyou love me I know you care
Just shout whenever And I'll be there
You are my love You are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item?
Girl, quit playin'
"We're just friends," What are you sayin'?
Said, "There's another" And looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine
I'm goin' down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around
And I'm like baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby...
What if we never see them again?
They're smart dogs.
Smarter than we are.
They'll be okay.
Oh, no.
It's my dad.
I just...
I can't deal with him right now.
- Countess!
- Boi!
Hi!
I missed you!
You're back!
It's amazing.
They came back to the apartment.
Thanks, Peyton.
Oh, and Sharpay, it's still on.
Bring it.
You're back!
Yeah!
You bad, bad boy, Boi.
I'm just glad you're okay.
He and Countess had an adventure.
She probably coaxed him into joining a doggy gang or something.
We'd better check him over for tattoos.
Are you so lost in what you're doing that you haven't noticed?
Noticed what?
Boi and Countess are in love.
- With what?
- Each other.
No way!
You're right.
He's dilated.
He's got puppy dog eyes.
How could I have not noticed puppy love?
Well, there's a lot you haven't noticed.
Like lately, you've had no time for me.
You know, I was counting on you to help me finish my film.
I said I would, and I will.
Things have become complicated.
It's not that complicated.
Amber Lee is using you, and you're letting her.
You don't know what you're talking about.
- I don't?
- No!
Where's the Sharpay that was determined not to go back home because she didn't want to work for anyone?
Why don't you tell me?
Working for someone, that's where.
- So at least be honest as to why.
- I know what I'm doing.
You've sold your soul to get Boi in that show, rather than trust in the dog that you raised.
Even worse, you've stopped trusting that your own talents would get you where you need to go.
And maybe you're jealous because I'm on my way up with a new famous friend, and you're just a student making a film about someone else's life instead of your own.
You don't have to be in my movie anymore.
I get it.
You have more important things to do.
Fine!
One question?
What happened to that hot pink whirlwind of confidence and ambition
I saw through my lens that first day you got here?
I mean, that girl knew she was special.
That girl knew she didn't have to do any of this to succeed.
What happened to her, huh?
Hello.
Oh, and Sharpay, can you remember to invite as many people from my fan club as possible to opening-night dress rehearsal?
I want the theater filled with people who love me as much as you do!
Sure.
You know what would be great after all this work?
A long, luxurious spa bath.
Sounds amazing!
Thank you.
Run one for me, will you?
And then you can finish these.
You're the best!
- This is a big change.
- Huge change!
I don't think you're hearing me!
New Jersey can hear you!
The name of the show is A Girl's Best Friend.
I didn't tell you to change the title.
But you want the best friend written out!
Oh.
Right.
Change the title!
How are we supposed to get rid of one of our main characters a day before our dress rehearsal in front of an audience?
The audience is coming to see me.
You change that dog's part to a bark and play dead, or I don't go on.
Let's be reasonable here.
I'm a star.
I don't have to be reasonable!
Look, those mangy mutts are bothering me almost as much as their disposable owners.
I actually had to have one of them clean my toilet just to keep her away.
She thinks she's an actress.
She acts all right.
She acts just like every other obsessed fan.
Wait.
Everything you said...
You were...
Right?
Yes.
Thank you.
You must think I'm a total fool.
No.
Not total.
Maybe my dad was right.
Maybe I'm not ready for this.
Maybe I should just go home and... work for him.
I mean, did I really think I was just gonna come to Broadway and be a star?
Yes.
Because that's exactly how you think.
It's perfect.
Perfect is so hard.
And it doesn't prepare you for disappointment.
Well, if it helps, you still look adorable, even when you're disappointed.
Yeah, that doesn't help.
Look, Sharpay.
There is not a marquee big enough or lights bright enough to contain the fame you're gonna have.
Yeah, but not the way I've been doing it.
Like you said, the Sharpay you know isn't the Sharpay that has become the Sharpay that is this Sharpay.
Did all the Sharpays follow that?
I sacrificed integrity for opportunity.
I let someone insecure distract me.
I cleaned a bathroom!
But worst of all, I disappointed someone I care about.
I forgot what was really important to me.
I lost track of what I want.
And other than maid service and a canopy bed, what is it that you want?
A fair fight.
A lifetime in the spotlight.
And maybe you'll still let me be in your movie.
I guess.
Okay, I can't say I approve of dating beneath your station in life, but fine.
Go.
Hey, I got your text.
What's C-Q-M-T-W-I-L-G-T mean?
"Come quick.
Major trouble.
Wow, I look great today." Duh.
I really should have gotten that.
Listen, Amber Lee Adams isn't what you think.
A self absorbed, two-faced panther who would eat her young alive on a reality show rather than allow anyone to steal her spotlight?
Okay, she's what you think.
Listen, I don't care if her parents had to tie beefjerky around her neck just to get the family dog to play with her, as long as Countess is at her side on that stage.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
She wants the part of the dog written out completely!
- That's not fair!
- Too far.
Well, I am 12, remember?
Roger, we've been fighting the wrong battle, each other.
We need to form an alliance and work against a common enemy.
- Zits?
- Amber Lee.
Trust me, the zit battle is one you won't win.
But what can we do?
Tonight is the dress rehearsal.
The audience will be filled with members of Amber Lee Adams' fan club.
I know, I saw the tweet.
Fine.
Yes, I follow her, too.
Okay, we need to show people exactly who Amber Lee really is.
It's time someone taught her how to behave in the theater.
I like the way you think.
It's manipulative, but for a good cause.
Tell me what you need me to do.
- Hey, Amber Lee, I...
- Where have you been?
I have been trying to reach you all day.
Oh.
Sorry, my phone must have been turned off.
Without asking me first?
I just wanted to say good luck.
You know, I know you chose Countess for this performance tonight, and I'm fine with that.
Well, it was nothing personal, but your phone was shut off, so I couldn't talk to you about it.
I guess that won't happen again, will it?
We're good.
Hug?
Okay.
Hello, everyone.
I'm Gill, the director.
And I'm Neal, the under-appreciated writer.
And we are thrilled that you're here for our first performance in front of an audience.
Does everyone here know how to applaud?
Okay, how about the balcony up there?
- Okay, now.
- Can you hear us?
You're good!
Will somebody please control these wannabe werewolves?
Hello?
People?
See, this is exactly why I didn't want to do a show with dogs!
I'm the star, not them!
Stage people?
Could somebody please put these rats with rabies out of my misery?
Anyone!
Finally, you idiot!
What took so long?
Now, hurry up and get these flea-bitten fur bags out of here!
- There are people waiting to see me!
- Okay, go now.
You think all those boring freaks with no lives came to worship two no-name mutts?
I don't think so!
I'm the one they love!
Me!
They came to see...
I knew I forgot to tell you something.
Careful, your mic's on.
You did this to me.
You ruined me!
News flash!
You ruined you!
Oh, what do you know?
You're a nobody!
The only reason you even wanted to be my friend is so I'd choose your dog!
No, no.
At first, I idolized you, even more than myself, which isn't easy.
But you're not at all what I thought you were.
You and I are exactly alike.
Except I don't enjoy letting people down.
I don't use people to feel better about myself.
And I definitely don't wear yellow and orange in the same week, let alone the same outfit, okay?
Maybe I did think you and I were alike, but not anymore.
In fact, I'd be embarrassed if someone thought I was like you.
Well, I quit!
And without me, there's no show.
Now neither one of your furry little friends will have their shot and neither will you.
Blame her!
I'm sorry.
Someone had to say it.
I'll go talk some sense into her.
You, out of this theater right now.
Wait, Sharpay.
If you go, then I'll go, too.
No.
You wanted this as badly as I did.
This mess was my idea.
You win.
That's not what it feels like.
- Hey.
Can I come in?
- Sure.
- So, you're really leaving, huh?
- Yeah.
I'm packing my carry-on stuff first.
- I wish you weren't going.
- Me, too.
Have you thought about what you're gonna do now?
Move home where there's enough room for my pores to open, spend months in the spa getting this layer of New York grime off my skin, and mostly miss you.
Look, I know exactly how to help that.
Don't go.
I already talked to my dad.
I guess I'm gonna start...
- You don't have to say it.
- Thank you.
What about your dream of being a star?
It's still there.
It's just a little bit more of a dream than a reality.
- You know what today is?
- What?
I got here exactly one month ago.
My time was up tonight anyway.
Well, so then you still have eight hours.
This isn't how my movie's supposed to end.
I guess it is.
This is Sharpay.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
No, no.
I'll be there.
That was the stage manager.
They want me to come to the theater and clear out Boi's things.
I can go with you if you want.
I want.
And, so, Amber Lee has quit.
- Gone.
- Kaput.
The producers feel, without a star, we can't open.
The time it would take to find someone who could learn the role and do it well might take weeks, and it would cost too much to keep the production going.
But we want you all to know, it was great almost working with you.
- I'm gonna meet you outside.
- All right.
Thank you for your hard work.
We are so, so sorry, people.
Wait!
Wait, it's not over.
It's not over.
Look, it doesn't have to be.
Look, there is someone who knows the part by heart and who is amazing.
All right, maybe she's not a star yet, but she will be.
This show will make her one.
Just watch.
Boi, keep your voice down.
Peyton, start shooting the rehearsal.
Boi, go mark.
Go mark.
Good!
Okay, stay.
Stay.
I love when you use that accent, but...
We're not supposed to be in here.
Okay, now let's do the scene where the character Lenore thinks she's lost everything and you come over to console her.
Come on.
Shelby, what is going on?
I feel invisible here.
Nothing is working out the way I planned it.
I got something inside ofme
Something that needs to be heard
Deep down a voice is guiding me
Hidden emotions have stirred
Why have I let others lead the way
When all along I know what it is I want to say
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
I thought I had a perfect plan
Where I would wind up on top
One day I'm thinking, "Yes I can"
Next thing you know, I'm a flop
Why did I ever play this silly game?
I got to shake up the rules
And stake my claim
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
What if I missed my window?
What if I blew my shot?
What if the only chance I was going to get
I already got?
I'm not ready to turn the page
Until I'm on stage in a show
No, nobody move I've got something to prove
Don't you know?
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
Well, did I tell you?
- Amazing!
- Amazing!
You're amahzing!
You have more depth, range and tone in one note than Amber Lee had in her entire surgically reshaped body.
We'll promote you as "The girl who we're promoting."
The producers will love it.
Wait, wait.
What are you saying?
We need you to save the show.
- Seriously?
- We know it's a risk.
- A gamble.
- A risk.
Did I do "risk" already?
You did.
And, true, we did fire you.
- He fired you.
- But now I'm un-firing you.
- Can we do that?
- Just did.
- Good for us!
- We need you.
What do you say?
Um...
I guess we could take the costumes in a few sizes and get everyone used to hearing the songs sung on key, but there's one condition.
Boi and Countess split the role of Shelby the dog equally.
Done!
We've a lot of work to do, people!
- Are we crazy?
- Crazy for theater!
- Let's rehearse!
- Let's rehearse, people!
Where are those wonderful dogs?
- Thank you.
- This is it.
The chance you've been waiting for.
- What if I'm not ready for this?
- Oh, you're ready.
"Ready" isn't as ready as you are.
- What if I'm horrible?
- Won't happen.
- What if I forget my lines?
- Impossible.
- What if I...
- Everything in your life so far has been leading you to this moment.
Your moment.
Embrace it.
I'm scared.
Finally.
Let's rehearse, people!
Over here!
Mr. Pinto, Mr. Pinto, over here.
Mr. Pinto, look this way.
I've got a feeling inside of me
Running all through my veins
It's like electrical energy
A world about to change
It's an open road
So here I go
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
I'm gonna go for it all out
I know there's no guarantee
But I've been given a chance and now
What's next is up to me
I'm gonna set my sights
So light those lights
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
If all the world's a stage
I'm here to take my place
I know I'll always find a way to shine
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
It starts with a dream
Of who I could be
Wherever it takes me I can't wait
So I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
I want fabulous That is my simple request
All things fabulous Bigger and better and best
I need something inspiring to help me get along
I need a little fabulous Is that so wrong?
Fetch me my Jimmy Choo flip-flops
Where is my pink Prada tote?
A summer like never before
I want more!
She wants fabulous That is her simple request
All things fabulous Bigger and better and best
She needs something inspiring to help her get along
She needs a little fabulous Is that so wrong?
Absolutely...
Not!
English
- US
- SDH
There's a moment when you realize that something's changed
And all the bits and pieces start to fit
It's so fab!
When nothing that you know will ever be the same
Ring the bell
That's my cue
Gotta try something new
Gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
Yeah
Listen up, fellas.
Now there's nothing in this universe to hold me back
Bye, Gab.
No endless night can keep me in the dark
And I just might give my dear old dad a heart attack
- But he'll live
- He'll live
- And he'll see
- He'll see
What his girl is meant to be
Gonna shine
And leave the past behind
Gonna try to fly so high
Gonna climb and make the prize all mine
Then I'll write my name in letters across the sky
I'm gonna shine
And if my present luminescent state is second rate
I'll turn it up a notch past nine
And watch the world go blind
Got a diva dazzle that you just can't touch
Like an angel in Armani I'm too fabulous
They'll be lining up for blocks Once I bop to the top
With a poochie in my Gucci I just can't be stopped
I'm gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
There she is.
Wonderful!
Hi!
- I know, I know.
- I loved it.
Excuse us.
There's our little superstar!
Princess, you had better watch out for law enforcement.
They are gonna come after you for stealing the show!
Honey, on a scale of one to 10, you were an entirely different scale.
And you know my aversion to scales.
Sharpay!
Yes, I know.
And thank you.
We'd like to introduce you to Jerry Taylor.
He's a good friend of our family, visiting for the week.
May I just say how wonderful you were?
As many times as you'd like!
I really see a unique talent here.
I mean, a true gift.
And your kind, true words are a gift as well.
It was so nice to meet you.
But if you'll excuse me, my friends have been waiting.
I'm a casting agent from New York.
And will keep waiting until I tell you how much I love your suit.
I'm about to start casting for a new musical on Broadway.
Broadway?
As in "Broadway?"
Yeah.
And I think that there is a perfect part.
I would be more than happy to arrange an audition if you happen to find yourself in the Big Apple any time soon.
That would be...
I would be...
It would be, like...
The show is gonna star Amber Lee Adams.
- No.
- Yeah.
Stop.
Seriously, stop.
Who's Amber Lee Adams?
She's only the most amazing performer ever!
We have so much in common.
I won't keep you.
It was so nice to meet you, Sharpay.
Congratulations again.
And, who knows, maybe we'll see you in New York.
Okay?
- Congrats!
- Bye.
Toodles!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
- No!
- No?
- No!
- No?
I don't understand!
What language is that?
No, I don't think going to New York is a good idea.
See, there you go, believing everything you think.
Do you really believe you're ready for such a monumental step?
Daddy, the main reason I buy such expensive shoes is to take monumental steps.
Sweetheart, when you graduated from high school almost a year ago, do you remember what you said to me?
"How come no one makes a cap and gown in hot pink?"
No.
"How come you get a car and driver and I don't?"
- No.
- "Good luck finding anyone
"to fill the talent-less void of boring and unattractive
"that will exist in these hallways
- "once I graduate"?
- No.
Yes, but you also said that you needed a year to find yourself, to figure out what came next in your life.
That year's almost up, and you haven't found anything.
It's a small town.
I mean, there's only so many places to look.
Besides, I did find something.
A show I wanna be in.
This is more than just a show.
You're talking about going it alone in the big city.
Right!
To star on Broadway with Amber Lee Adams.
Could you really deny the world that opportunity?
I'm sorry, princess.
But nothing you've shown me convinces me you're ready for something like this.
Okay, ladies.
Team Sharpay.
New York.
Daddy says I'm not ready for this.
So, what does that mean?
You pout, throw a tantrum, and he buys you a new Burberry bag to make you feel better?
That's good, but no.
It means we show him I'm determined.
And when I make up my mind...
And no one is better with make-up.
...my mind looks amazing.
Okay, here's your assignments.
I texted Bridget, who e-mailed Constance, who tweeted Bethany, who IM'ed Jenn, who Facebooked Kara, who has an ex-friend who she caught with her boyfriend, who she then dumped, so now Kara's her friend again,
who knows of a New York apartment available in a luxury townhouse.
That is, like, the best house you can get in terms of towns.
- Sounds perfect.
- It gets better.
- It can't.
- But it does.
It is equal distance from both Chanel and Wicked.
Okay.
Now, on to travel plans.
That's right.
Albuquerque to New York.
One adult and one dog.
Excuse me?
Coach?
Hi, I'm calling for Sharpay Evans.
Mr. Taylor wanted to set up an audition with her for a new musical.
Two weeks from today is perfect.
Now, new outfits.
And this would be for opening night.
The beading actually doubles the reflection of paparazzi flashbulbs!
You can wear anything.
You should have your own reality show called I Can Wear Anything.
Where you wear anything.
All right.
I'm ready to show Daddy what we've accomplished.
Ladies, and people I don't know,
New York is calling.
And this is one call that is not going to voice-mail.
So, by way of review, this is my shoe closet, that is my bedroom, these are my new clothes and where I'll wear them, and then I'm a star!
See?
I'm just not totally convinced.
Daddy, you said I haven't shown you anything to let you know I'm ready for this.
But, look, I took matters into my own hands, and without even chipping my manicure.
Sweetheart, it's not as easy as putting pictures on boards.
But I've worked everything out!
And used this pointer.
- I don't know...
- Please, Daddy.
Alone, in New York?
My dear college friend, Michelle, has a son that goes to NYU.
I've met him.
He's a very nice boy.
I could ask her to make sure that he keeps his eye on you.
Are you sure you're ready to take this on?
I know I can do this.
I know it like I know purple washes me out and that my eyes are the exact same distance apart to be a supermodel.
What I don't know is whether you believe in me.
Mom seems to.
Okay, you have my blessing.
Thank you, Daddy!
I'll call my friend Michelle and have her talk to her son.
Thanks, Mom.
There's just one condition.
Fine.
I love a good conditioner.
You have one month.
I'll fly you to New York, I'll pay for your penthouse, but you have to get yourself in that show and prove to me you can take care of yourself.
One month.
- Deal?
- So deal!
But if it doesn't work out, you come back here and work for me.
At the country club.
- Work?
- A job.
That's the deal.
Prove yourself, or come back in a month and work for me.
Fine.
Prove myself it is!
Look!
Look, Boi, look!
- Sharpay?
- In the flesh and pastels!
- We've been awaiting your arrival.
- Then the wait's over!
We spoke on the phone.
I'm Marjorie Grande, the manager for the building.
My pleasure.
Please, follow me to the penthouse.
Ooh!
I hope this is to your liking.
No.
It's to my loving!
Boi, you've gotta see this.
- That's a dog.
- Try to get him to believe that.
I'm sorry.
There are no dogs in the building.
Sure there are.
See?
The members of the co-op board have a strict no-dog policy.
Well...
My father heads our country club board, so I'm sure that gives me some kind of board immunity.
Miss Sharpay, this building is pleased to have you.
This dog...
Not so pleased.
Miss Grande, Ma'am.
If he goes, I go.
What are you doing?
Filming you.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
Do you always just film totally stunning people on the street that you don't know?
Only when I think the subject is interesting.
And you look baffled and scared and really pink.
So, yeah, interesting.
Are you paparazzi?
I'm a film student at NYU, working on a short film.
The assignment is to capture one unique New York story.
Maybe you're it.
So, you decided to film me without my permission, just for a school assignment?
- Yep.
- How dare you!
And my left side is better for close-ups.
I'm Peyton.
Sharpay Evans.
Actress, heiress, soon to be Broadway legend.
- Wait!
- About 105,
- but it's really not polite to ask.
- No...
I should know my own weight, okay?
No, I'm Peyton Leverett.
Our moms went to college together.
This is crazy!
I was on my way up to your apartment to make sure you were okay.
And here you are.
Right, they told me to expect you.
Well, glad we could finally meet.
- Oh, and this is Boi.
- Well, nice to meet you, Boi.
So, why are you out here?
Is everything okay?
Not really.
When I rented this apartment online, it never said they don't allow dogs.
And now they won't let us live here.
Yeah, well, it's their loss!
- Do you have someplace else to go?
- Okay, it's my loss and their loss!
Actually, the only place I have to go is home.
And trust me, that is not an option!
Listen, there's an empty studio in my building, if you're interested.
I'm friends with the building manager.
I'm sure I can make a call.
And...
Well, I'm sure I can make a call and arrange something.
Maybe get you to see it.
Well, since I don't seem to have any other options.
Bellman!
Oh, yeah, right.
Seriously?
Careful with those!
This is all I have to get by on until the truck arrives with the bulk of my things.
Oh!
That's good.
Okay, now, go outside, and then come back in and give me even more of that it's-the-end-of-the-world look.
Okay?
- Hey, Peyton.
- Hey, Peyton!
- What's up?
- Off to acting class.
"Maggie, the cat is alive.
I'm alive!"
Singing lesson.
Cool, guys.
Okay.
Hey, this is Sharpay and Boi.
Hi, Sharpay.
Hi, Boi!
Anyways, gotta go.
See ya, Peyton.
- Nice meeting you, Sharpay.
- Later, guys.
Okay.
Really, you're going to love this place.
Okay?
Up you go.
Sorry.
It's a pre-war building.
And during the war, they didn't fight for an elevator?
Listen, the building has two things going for it.
It's got something available, and I live here.
Fine.
But if I break a heel, or a sweat, you're responsible.
Get my bags.
See?
That wasn't so bad.
Yeah.
Down the hall.
The one with the police tape and chalk outline.
Really?
Kidding.
- You said this was a studio.
- It is.
No way!
MGM was a studio!
This?
This is a roach motel with no room service.
Yeah, a studio apartment.
Sure, from certain angles, it's a bit small.
A two-karat engagement ring is a bit small!
This is a doll house!
- So what do you think?
- Forget it!
I'd need an entirely separate apartment just for my lipsticks.
And where am I supposed to sleep?
- What is that?
- It's your bed.
That is not a bed.
It's a closet with a tongue.
You can't be serious!
- There is one really good thing about it.
- Yeah, sure.
See?
This is my place!
Looking better, huh?
Am I missing something?
Oh, right.
Space!
Luxury!
Maid service!
Let me guess.
You're used to being spoiled.
I'm not used to it.
I just expect it.
You know, half this building is filled with performers who came here with the same ambitions you did.
What makes you so much better than them?
Money, breeding, talent, great hair, perfect jaw line, chic taste.
How much time do you have?
All right, fine.
I tried to help you out like my mom asked, but whatever.
I'll find someone else to film.
The only problem is if I call my father and tell him how I messed up on the other apartment and how I have nowhere to go but here, and I ask for his help, he'll make me come home and...
Work!
- So?
- So?
Then I'll never get my big break.
Oh, and promise you won't call your mother and tell her about this, because then she'll call my mom who will tell my dad, and I don't think he really believes I can make this happen.
He only gave me one month to prove it.
Well, then you've got one month to prove him wrong.
Why did I do this?
I want my canopy bed and my housekeeper.
And a shower that doesn't share a room with a kitchen.
- Come on.
- Where to?
- Do you trust me?
- You suggested this place.
Yeah.
Point taken.
Come anyway.
Come on.
I hope you're taking me to a better apartment than what you just showed me.
Because let me tell you, if that's it?
No way!
Absolutely no!
Just come on.
Just don't ask any questions.
I need luxury!
Are you kidding me?
That was like a green, dark hole that I never wanna be in ever again.
All right, here you go.
Butchy!
- Come on...
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.
Come on.
- Why are we here?
All right, all right.
Now, you're gonna have to close your eyes.
- Close my eyes?
- Yeah, just close your eyes.
- Why?
- Because!
Just do it.
All right, now.
Keep them closed.
- Well, what if I hit into something?
- You won't.
I got you.
All right, all right.
Keep them closed.
All right.
- All right, you got them closed?
- Yes, I do.
All right, all right.
Perfect.
All right.
Now, stay here, keep them closed.
Keep them closed.
All righty.
Keep them closed.
All right.
Open them.
Hit it, Butchy!
Wow.
I know.
When I left Indiana to go to school here, I didn't know a soul either, and I was just as overwhelmed as you.
But I had two things, my dream and my camera.
And look at me now.
You still only have your dream and your camera.
Yes, but I met you, didn't I?
So, something's working out.
Well, whenever people meet me, things get better.
Look, you just have to adapt to your surroundings.
And remember that for now this is all just temporary.
Right.
Like prom dresses and first boyfriends.
Look, anything you have to do will be worth it to get your dream.
Okay.
I'm gonna meet with that casting director, get the part,
- be a star and have a palace!
- There you go.
That's the self-indulgent, self-entitled, optimistic pink hurricane
I've been seeing through my lens.
And I like how perceptive you are.
Okay, New York.
Bring it on.
I used to think maybe you loved me
Now, baby, I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day When you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox Gotta hold myself down
'Cause I just can't wait till you write me You're coming around
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
- And don't it feel good!
- Hey!
All right now And don't it feel good!
Hey!
All right now, yeah
Hi!
Turn it off.
Turn it off!
Just waiting for you
Just waiting for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day
No, no, no
What?
I want you to stay
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
- And don't it feel good!
- Hey!
All right now And don't it feel good!
Oh, yeah!
Looking good.
So pink.
You're good.
- Do you wanna try some?
- No, I don't want any!
Lay down.
Lay down.
Night, Boi!
Boi?
Get help!
- Knock, knock.
- Come in!
Wow!
And wow.
Hey, are you on your way to meet with the casting director?
No, I'm on my way to change theater history.
You think this is a good outfit for changing history?
Perfect!
Mind if I tag along and film?
Not that you could ever mind me, right?
I think you should.
After all, not many people can say they were there to film the creation of a legend.
Sharpay!
You made it after all!
Destiny called, and I get great reception!
Well, your timing is perfect.
What's tomorrow like for you?
The first day of the rest of my fame.
Well, all right.
I'll set up your audition for 3:00.
I'll e-mail you the musical number that we'd like you to prepare.
And could you make sure that he's well-groomed and, you know, takes care of any business beforehand.
- What?
- What?
- He?
- Yes.
- Him?
- Him.
- He?
- Yes!
Wait, what?
It's your dog that we want to audition.
He was amazing!
Oh.
What?
I mean...
I sent you all the information in response to your e-mail.
I mean, didn't the title of the musical give you any indication?
A Girl's Best Friend?
A Girl's Best Friend!
And I'm here for the girl!
You're here for the girl?
Well, I'm never the best friend!
Oh, no.
No, no.
We wanted Boi.
As the girl?
No, as the best friend.
Wait, wait.
You wanted Boi as the best friend of the girl?
Not me as the girl with the best friend?
Exactly.
Oh, Sharpay, I am so sorry for the confusion.
If you don't want Boi to audition, I would totally understand.
Sharpay.
Sharpay!
Hey, stop.
Hey, don't touch the car!
Look, slow down.
Even New Yorkers can't keep up with you.
It's not even me they wanted!
Well, to be fair, the role is for a dog.
If they wanted you, I could understand you being upset.
Why did I come all this way?
Leave my friends, family, a dry, self-hydrating climate?
To follow your dream!
Or at least that's what I thought.
Nothing is turning out the way I planned it!
Plan A. Live in a penthouse and star on Broadway.
Plan B...
Don't have a plan B!
What do I tell my father now?
That you came to a very special city determined to be someone very special, which you are.
Oh, I'm not so special.
I'm just like everyone else.
Maybe a little better.
Look at it this way.
Boi is your dog, and he has an opportunity, so be happy for him.
You're right.
I'm being, you know, what's the word?
When you do something for yourself even though it's not so good for other people?
- Selfish?
- No!
Oh, yeah.
Look, Sharpay, you can't give up.
Okay?
And, anyway, you're officially the star of my film.
I am?
Yeah, you are.
Oh.
So now it's all about you?
Only because I need you here.
Fine.
I'll star in your movie.
Okay.
Good, good!
Okay, change of strategy.
I didn't know you had a strategy, but I like the way you think.
If Boi becomes a success, everyone will see me as well.
After all, I am his entourage.
I am the one who's holding his leash.
His fame will ultimately lead to my fame.
That's what I came here for, right?
Still a little selfish, but heading in the right direction.
We're gonna do this.
It's like I tell the housekeepers.
If you can't see the bright side, polish the dull side.
Yeah, not quite what I was talking...
They want Boi to audition?
It's Boi they will get!
When a sign of the times is the times are extremely tough
When you look at the world and the world that you see is
Yes, rough
When you feel like a long lost pup
And you need some cheering up
Sit back, relax and watch us do our stuff
Two, three, four
We're gonna sit and shake your hand That's how it starts
We're gonna nose our nosy way into your hearts
We'll sing and bark In two-part harmony
You're gonna love us That's our guarantee
We'll bow together on the count of three
Me and my Boi My Boi and me
We make the perfect pair
We've got that savoir-faire
Me and my Boi
Me and my Boi
Me and my Boi
My Boi and me
Wait!
That's the best audition I've ever seen!
I'm Gill Samms, the director.
Neal Roberts, writer.
That was amazing!
Chills.
Feel my hand...
I won't feel your hand, but I believe you.
I won't feel your hand either, but I believe you, too.
That is one special dog.
We've done special here.
Special has been done, people!
Boi was meant for Broadway.
We both were.
So, when do we start?
Well, there's one more waiting.
One more!
One more, people!
Could you take a seat in the front row, please?
There.
Now.
Roger Elliston
the third.
And his dog, Countess.
FYI, I'm Roger.
As you can see by our extensive resume, hand-printed on carbonless, environmental-friendly rice paper,
Countess has numerous major Broadway credits under her paws, including The Collar Purple, Three Puppy Opera, and the original Broadway cast production of A Wagging Tail of Two Cities, a musical opera in German.
Major pedigree.
I'm impressed.
This is us impressed.
Plus, she can bark a high C with sustained vibrato.
Sure, but only dogs can hear it.
All right.
Let's see what Countess can do.
When a sign of the times is the times are extremely tough
When you look at the world and the world that you see is rough
When you feel like a long lost pup
And you need some cheering up
Sit back, relax and watch us do our stuff
We're gonna sit and shake your hand That's how it starts
We're gonna nose our nosy way into your hearts
We'll sing and bark In two-part harmony
You're gonna love us That's our guarantee
We'll bow together on the count of three
Me and my girl My girl and me
We make the perfect pair
We've got that savoir-faire
Me and my girl
Me and my girl
Me and my girl
My girl and me
That's the best audition I've ever seen!
- Amazing!
I weeped!
- Wept.
I wept!
- I wept!
- And not just regular weeping.
Theater weeping!
Amber Lee, what do you think?
Yes.
Amber Lee, thoughts?
Wow...
We are so meant to be BFFs!
Wow! "Wow" is a word, right?
Right.
Wow!
I just hope that the palpable chemistry surging between you and I right now like nuclear fusion won't in any way influence your decision towards our clearly superior audition.
How old are you?
Twelve.
I think I'm good.
And you, also!
Your dog...
Wow!
Wow.
I know, right?
He's just saying hi.
Sharpay Evans of the New Mexico Evans.
I'm a mega fan.
Oh, you are not!
So am!
I am gonna tweet about you right now.
Shut up!
I follow your tweets.
She did!
She tweeted!
Okay, I don't know how we're gonna decide.
You're amazing!
All this and a grade school diploma.
And you, amazing!
Wow.
I would be excited to work with either one of you and your dogs.
And can I just say, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Because Broadway...
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, real people are watching.
- Wow.
- Me, too.
I am just so excited to be performing on the Great White Way!
Not that I don't love all colors.
Well, I know both these talented dogs want to work with you.
But only one can be in the show.
- How are we gonna decide?
- Wait.
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals?
Wait!
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals!
That way I could see which one I work best with.
- That sounds like a solution.
- We have a solution, people!
Can I just say how totally great I think you are?
You do, and I'll never wash my ears again.
You know what I think?
Well, of course you don't because I just thought of it, but I think they loved you!
I like the way you think!
And you're such a good singer.
And I would know.
- My album went triple platinum.
- Well, I've done quite a bit of theater.
It totally shows.
Listen, I'm gonna have my assistant give you my phone number.
If there's anything that you need, you just let me know, okay?
We girls gotta stick together, right?
- Here.
- Wow.
I mean, this is actually your number!
It looks like any ordinary number, but it's not.
It's yours!
- Oh, and, hey, may the best dog win!
- Thanks!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Can you believe it?
You were great!
Boi was great.
This new strategy just might work.
- Amber Lee really likes you, too.
- Is she awesome or what?
She inspires me.
There.
I said it.
Quelle inspired.
We are so gonna get that part.
- How do you know?
- Easy.
I don't do rejection.
Sharpay!
I just wanted to wish you both luck.
Oh!
That's so nice of you.
And suggest that you give up now, while you still have your dignity.
Distant though it already might be.
Sorry, which Smurf are you again?
True, you have talent.
But you lack both the experience and the finesse to ever achieve the Holy Grail of possibility.
- Yeah, but Boi is cuter.
- Countess is a theatrical ninja.
I'm sorry.
For a minute there you just bored me to death.
I have a foolproof strategy of getting what I want.
See it, want it, have a fit, get it.
- Yeah, well, this playdate's over.
- I hope you enjoy rejection.
- We're gonna get that part.
- We're gonna destroy you.
- Bring it on.
- Oh, it's brought.
All right, Boi.
This foot.
That foot.
Good boy!
Yeah!
Okay, let's try our next one.
Stay.
Catch your tail.
Catch your tail!
Good!
Yeah, good.
Sit.
Stay.
We are so going to take them on.
I'm not gonna let some hobbit get in my way.
And, look.
All Boi can do is think about how horrible that other little mangy dog was.
If you want success so badly, then you will get it.
All you need is one shot to make it happen.
Yeah, and this is my shot.
It's like my grandmother says.
"God only got one book published,
"and look how well it did for him."
Doing this is all I've ever dreamed about, especially since I already have everything else.
Well, there's still humility.
What's wrong with being confident?
Confidence is when you know you're good.
Arrogance is when you think others know you're good.
Well, I want everyone to know I'm as good as I think everyone thinks I am without them knowing I know they think it.
- And do you have to film everything?
- Yep, 'cause this is my shot.
If my professor loves my film, he talks about it.
Then there's a buzz, then it gets in a festival, then it gets distribution, then I'm signing a studio deal, then I'm getting an Oscar.
I always knew I wanted to be an actress the first time I produced and performed the entire production of Snow White.
Full dance, musical numbers, handmade costumes.
I made my brother play all the dwarfs.
Everyone in that pre-school worshipped me.
I just want to wake up every morning and be onstage.
Good morning!
Good morning, everyone.
- And welcome to the first rehearsal...
- Of the new Broadway musical.
A Girl's Best Friend!
And you are all amazing.
- No, you are!
- Him or me?
- You!
- No, you!
Me?
Okay!
And heading our superb cast, we are thrilled to welcome one of the biggest stars around,
Amber Lee Adams!
Oh, stop!
- Yes!
- Guys, come on.
Can I just say that this, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, people can see if you write your lines on your hands!
All right.
Let's rehearse.
I want everybody downstairs with piano, rehearsing the music for the opening number.
Amber Lee and Judith,
I want you onstage so we can block that first scene.
- Let's go!
- Let's go, people!
All right.
Let's start with Boi.
Let's go!
What a perfect goodbye party.
Thank you, Mom!
I can't believe my little girl is going out into the world on her own for the first time.
I have to, Mom.
And who knows, maybe I'll find fame and fortune!
Actually, reverse that.
- Why is that funny?
- Well...
Because you'd rather have the...
I'll explain later.
Just keep going.
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Pick it up!
Go, go!
A star is about to be born!
Shelby!
Oh!
What's in this envelope?
This very wet envelope.
- Again, I don't get that.
- Keep going.
Gasp!
Actually, that's a stage direction.
You gasp, you don't say "gasp."
Simple mistake.
Keep going.
Shelby!
Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
Oh, Shelby.
This is the first time we'll be apart.
I wish I could just pack you up in a widdle doggie bag.
Okay.
Let's get Countess in there and continue.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Shelby and I will both be here when you get back.
You're killing me.
Oh!
That is adorable!
You're right, Shelby!
Why not go with me?
Any place that doesn't want you, I don't wanna be.
Let's see what New York has in store for us together!
Good.
Let's talk about the scene a bit, and we'll do it again.
And both dogs, great work!
Shelby!
Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
What's going on?
The dog.
What is this?
Somebody, please.
The dog is licking me.
All right, all right.
Get me the other dog!
Sorry.
What can you do?
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go, go!
- Why is she twirling?
- What is she doing?
- Gill?
- Roger!
Figure out what's going on with the dog.
It's not helping me.
- Not helping, people!
- Meanwhile, get the other dog!
Sorry.
What can you do?
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go!
Oh, hey!
How is this helping?
Really.
Am I the only one bothered by this?
Gill?
Okay, everybody, that's 10!
I'll admit you're good.
But we're better.
Give up!
Give up?
Not until there's a Broadway marquee with a picture of my dog so big you can walk by and smell his puppy breath!
I have to take the dogs for a nap.
Union rules.
Thank you.
- You break first.
- No, you break first.
Oh!
- Pretty cute, huh?
- Yeah!
Yes, they are!
I just wanted to tell you something.
This is my show.
I'm America's sweetheart.
They're paying to see me, not you two over-bred fur balls.
So, until I can figure out a way to get rid of you, you better watch your step, otherwise you'll find out the real meaning of going home in a doggie bag.
This film is cutting together really well.
Do I look amazing?
- The camera loves you.
- I know!
Oh, no!
My dad's video-chatting me.
He thinks I live in a penthouse.
I can't let him see that I live in a tiny studio in a filthy tenement.
With a boy in my room!
A boy, by the way, that has no money, and lives in a tinier studio, and who, apparently, has never heard of the word "maid-service"!
No offense.
What of that could possibly offend me?
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
I don't know.
Hyperventilating!
- What do I do?
What do I do?
- Come on.
Come on.
Hurry!
- All right, scoot over.
Okay, go, go.
- Okay, I gotta get this.
Stop!
Hi, Daddy!
Hey, princess!
How's my little girl?
Overpaying for everything and yelling at total strangers.
You're practically a native.
Hey, where are you?
That view is spectacular.
Well, there's hardly a penthouse in the city that doesn't have a spectacular view!
So, you the toast of Broadway?
Daddy, you know how I feel about carb references.
Just a little concerned, sweetie.
The last time no one's heard from you for this long was when you found out your gold card wasn't actually made of gold.
Well, I've been busy with rehearsals.
Outstanding!
You got into the show?
Well, it doesn't quite work like that.
It's complicated.
But I know it's gonna work out.
Sharpay, is there something you're not telling me?
You remember the deal, right?
If things aren't working out...
I know, I know.
I have one month to get in the show, and then...
Two weeks, sweetie.
You have two weeks left.
You're sure everything's okay?
It's fine, Daddy.
Well, okay.
We miss you, angel.
Miss you, too.
I love you!
Boi has to get that role.
I can't go home.
Not as a failure.
I need some sort of subtle, visibly crushing advantage over Roger.
Look, why not just trust Boi is talented, that you've trained him well,
- and let fate take it from there.
- Fate?
Fate gave a girl in my graduating class one long eyebrow.
I can't trust fate.
Some matters you just have to take into your own hands.
What do you mean you forgot my bottled water?
Well, I was going to get those magazines that you said you wanted from across town, and I got hit by a bike messenger.
So I went to the hospital for, like, just one second to get these stitches.
And meanwhile, I had no water!
I will get it for you right now.
Now I've had to drink tap!
- I am so sorry.
- "I am so sorry."
- I will do better.
- Forget it, okay?
Aside from catching some shade from the shadow cast by your madam's apple, you're of no use to me.
You're... (WHIMPERING) fired!
God!
Amber Lee?
Oh, wow!
You look so cute, Sharpie!
- Sharpay.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
So, tell me, what's on your mind?
I just saw your assistant leave in tears.
She's not my assistant.
She quit.
No wonder she was crying.
Yeah, I don't think she even really cared.
Next time I should probably just hire a best friend instead.
Wait!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
What are you thinking that I should be thinking?
I could help you out until you replace her.
That is what I was thinking about thinking.
Of course this can't, in any way, affect your decision of which dog gets the starring role.
Oh, it won't.
I couldn't live with myself if I thought I did anything unfair.
You have my word.
Hey, I know!
How about dinner?
- That sounds awesome!
- Right?
Get me a reservation for two at someplace fantastic.
Then call my agent, have her meet me.
Right.
Sure.
Oh.
I won't forget this.
And I promise, it won't be because you're helping me if I happen to take a little extra liking to Girl.
- Boi.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
Oh, and can you take my mic down to the sound guy
- and tell him the wire hurts my scalp.
- Okay.
You're the best.
Amber Lee says the wire is hurting her scalp.
Personally, I think she's using the wrong shampoo, but she's the star, and you know, I don't wanna say anything.
You're hot.
Excuse me?
You're hot.
Okay.
Even though theater lighting highlights my natural skin tones, thank you for noticing, that's a little rude, don't you think?
No.
Your mic's hot.
It means it's on.
You see that little switch.
When it's flipped over like that, it means it's on and it's going through the entire theater.
Well, you could have led with that part, thank you.
Amber Lee's got a great scalp!
You're hot.
Then she asked me to help her out after her assistant quit.
And after I suggested it.
Are you sure this is wise?
I'm sorry.
Let me re-phrase that.
This isn't wise.
It's perfect.
Amber Lee will see that she and I are exactly alike, we'll become BFFs, she'll make sure Boi gets the role, then his fame becomes my fame!
I mean, this is the advantage I've been waiting for!
Isn't it more like taking advantage?
And my father thought I couldn't do this in a month.
It's turning out better than I imagined.
Hello?
Sure.
Be right over.
Hello?
Oh, thank goodness.
In here, quickly.
I just...
I can't reach that.
Can't reach it?
Okay, it was a little bit of a test.
Only a true friend would come all the way down here at this hour and help me with something like that.
- So, I passed?
- Yes.
- But, seriously, the purse.
- Okay.
Thank you.
All right, here's your bag.
Here's your other bag.
Oh, and don't forget your photo shoot.
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
You must be at that photo shoot to make sure I look as fabulous as you always do.
- Are you serious?
- Serious?
You're now also my stylist.
You have to tell me all your secrets.
Okay, gotta go.
"Life is so strange.
"Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune,
"and instead, we find love."
Hey!
How about dinner?
Split some egg rolls at Wok This Way?
Can't.
I have to highlight script changes for Amber Lee, then highlight her hair.
Highlight of my night!
Okay.
But I miss spending time with you.
And you did promise to shoot some more stuff for my film.
You know, what I'm doing is important, too.
Oh.
For a minute there, you sounded like Amber Lee.
"Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you."
Bad news.
My maid quit.
So, here's a list of chores.
Chores?
And I want to talk to you about Boi.
But you have to promise it'll stay between us.
Okay.
I think I'm going to ask the director to give Boi the part.
- Are you serious?
- Almost positive!
You won't be sorry.
Trust me.
I know.
Oh!
Oh, no.
There are some changes for the blocking in the dog scene, top of act two.
Countess can learn these in no time.
She's got a memory like a digital hard drive.
- No bark and all mega-bite.
- Funny.
I need to find Sharpay and make sure she gets them.
Boi is doing the first run-through tomorrow.
I'd be more than happy to deliver them to her.
- Great.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Sharpay?
Sharpay?
That's unfortunate.
And I've been here ever since.
Life is so strange.
Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune, and instead, we find love.
Lenore, I have something to ask you.
We have something to ask you.
He's supposed to come from the other side of the stage with the ring box!
Yeah, sorry.
We changed that blocking.
What happened?
What is wrong with this dog?
And is he okay?
It's not his fault.
He's just a little dog!
He's just so sweet.
Okay, everybody.
Let's break for a few.
That's 10, people.
I'm aware.
I know.
I don't know what happened.
We sent out the script changes, but Boi didn't do them.
But I didn't get any new script change.
I looked everywhere last night to give them to you.
I guess working for Amber Lee has its drawbacks.
- You did this on purpose.
- That's a complete...
Yeah.
You're threatened because you know Amber Lee is gonna choose Boi.
Not after today she won't.
Okay.
Countess doesn't have half the personality that Boi has.
And Boi doesn't have half the talent that Countess has.
Isn't that right, girl?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Has anyone seen Boi?
- No, sorry.
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Anyone seen Countess?
- Nope.
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Hello?
- Boi and Countess are gone!
Gone!
What?
We have to find them!
Wait, where are you now?
Leaving the theater.
We're gonna look around here.
Can you look near the apartment in case they come back?
Yeah, yeah.
Of course.
Just keep me posted, and I'll call you if they show up.
Okay.
What if they were dog-napped?
Do you think we pushed them too hard?
- I don't know.
- Countess is uber-sensitive.
She cries watching dog food commercials!
I just hope they're not huddled in a corner somewhere.
Afraid, lost, at each other's throats!
You know you love me I know you care
Just shout whenever And I'll be there
You are my love You are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item?
Girl, quit playin'
"We're just friends," What are you sayin'?
Said, "There's another" And looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine
I'm goin' down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around
And I'm like baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby...
What if we never see them again?
They're smart dogs.
Smarter than we are.
They'll be okay.
Oh, no.
It's my dad.
I just...
I can't deal with him right now.
- Countess!
- Boi!
Hi!
I missed you!
You're back!
It's amazing.
They came back to the apartment.
Thanks, Peyton.
Oh, and Sharpay, it's still on.
Bring it.
You're back!
Yeah!
You bad, bad boy, Boi.
I'm just glad you're okay.
He and Countess had an adventure.
She probably coaxed him into joining a doggy gang or something.
We'd better check him over for tattoos.
Are you so lost in what you're doing that you haven't noticed?
Noticed what?
Boi and Countess are in love.
- With what?
- Each other.
No way!
You're right.
He's dilated.
He's got puppy dog eyes.
How could I have not noticed puppy love?
Well, there's a lot you haven't noticed.
Like lately, you've had no time for me.
You know, I was counting on you to help me finish my film.
I said I would, and I will.
Things have become complicated.
It's not that complicated.
Amber Lee is using you, and you're letting her.
You don't know what you're talking about.
- I don't?
- No!
Where's the Sharpay that was determined not to go back home because she didn't want to work for anyone?
Why don't you tell me?
Working for someone, that's where.
- So at least be honest as to why.
- I know what I'm doing.
You've sold your soul to get Boi in that show, rather than trust in the dog that you raised.
Even worse, you've stopped trusting that your own talents would get you where you need to go.
And maybe you're jealous because I'm on my way up with a new famous friend, and you're just a student making a film about someone else's life instead of your own.
You don't have to be in my movie anymore.
I get it.
You have more important things to do.
Fine!
One question?
What happened to that hot pink whirlwind of confidence and ambition
I saw through my lens that first day you got here?
I mean, that girl knew she was special.
That girl knew she didn't have to do any of this to succeed.
What happened to her, huh?
Hello.
Oh, and Sharpay, can you remember to invite as many people from my fan club as possible to opening-night dress rehearsal?
I want the theater filled with people who love me as much as you do!
Sure.
You know what would be great after all this work?
A long, luxurious spa bath.
Sounds amazing!
Thank you.
Run one for me, will you?
And then you can finish these.
You're the best!
- This is a big change.
- Huge change!
I don't think you're hearing me!
New Jersey can hear you!
The name of the show is A Girl's Best Friend.
I didn't tell you to change the title.
But you want the best friend written out!
Oh.
Right.
Change the title!
How are we supposed to get rid of one of our main characters a day before our dress rehearsal in front of an audience?
The audience is coming to see me.
You change that dog's part to a bark and play dead, or I don't go on.
Let's be reasonable here.
I'm a star.
I don't have to be reasonable!
Look, those mangy mutts are bothering me almost as much as their disposable owners.
I actually had to have one of them clean my toilet just to keep her away.
She thinks she's an actress.
She acts all right.
She acts just like every other obsessed fan.
Wait.
Everything you said...
You were...
Right?
Yes.
Thank you.
You must think I'm a total fool.
No.
Not total.
Maybe my dad was right.
Maybe I'm not ready for this.
Maybe I should just go home and... (STAMMERING) work for him.
I mean, did I really think I was just gonna come to Broadway and be a star?
Yes.
Because that's exactly how you think.
It's perfect.
Perfect is so hard.
And it doesn't prepare you for disappointment.
Well, if it helps, you still look adorable, even when you're disappointed.
Yeah, that doesn't help.
Look, Sharpay.
There is not a marquee big enough or lights bright enough to contain the fame you're gonna have.
Yeah, but not the way I've been doing it.
Like you said, the Sharpay you know isn't the Sharpay that has become the Sharpay that is this Sharpay.
Did all the Sharpays follow that?
I sacrificed integrity for opportunity.
I let someone insecure distract me.
I cleaned a bathroom!
But worst of all, I disappointed someone I care about.
I forgot what was really important to me.
I lost track of what I want.
And other than maid service and a canopy bed, what is it that you want?
A fair fight.
A lifetime in the spotlight.
And maybe you'll still let me be in your movie.
I guess.
Okay, I can't say I approve of dating beneath your station in life, but fine.
Go.
Hey, I got your text.
What's C-Q-M-T-W-l-L-G-T mean?
"Come quick.
Major trouble.
Wow, I look great today." Duh.
I really should have gotten that.
Listen, Amber Lee Adams isn't what you think.
A self absorbed, two-faced panther who would eat her young alive on a reality show rather than allow anyone to steal her spotlight?
Okay, she's what you think.
Listen, I don't care if her parents had to tie beef jerky around her neck just to get the family dog to play with her, as long as Countess is at her side on that stage.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
She wants the part of the dog written out completely!
- That's not fair!
- Too far.
Well, I am 12, remember?
Roger, we've been fighting the wrong battle, each other.
We need to form an alliance and work against a common enemy.
- Zits?
- Amber Lee.
Trust me, the zit battle is one you won't win.
But what can we do?
Tonight is the dress rehearsal.
The audience will be filled with members of Amber Lee Adams' fan club.
I know, I saw the tweet.
Fine.
Yes, I follow her, too.
Okay, we need to show people exactly who Amber Lee really is.
It's time someone taught her how to behave in the theater.
I like the way you think.
It's manipulative, but for a good cause.
Tell me what you need me to do.
- Hey, Amber Lee, I...
- Where have you been?
I have been trying to reach you all day.
Oh.
Sorry, my phone must have been turned off.
Without asking me first?
I just wanted to say good luck.
You know, I know you chose Countess for this performance tonight, and I'm fine with that.
Well, it was nothing personal, but your phone was shut off, so I couldn't talk to you about it.
I guess that won't happen again, will it?
We're good.
Hug?
Okay.
Hello, everyone.
I'm Gill, the director.
And I'm Neal, the under-appreciated writer.
And we are thrilled that you're here for our first performance in front of an audience.
Does everyone here know how to applaud?
Okay, how about the balcony up there?
- Okay, now.
- Can you hear us?
You're good!
Will somebody please control these wannabe werewolves?
Hello?
People?
See, this is exactly why I didn't want to do a show with dogs!
I'm the star, not them!
Stage people?
Could somebody please put these rats with rabies out of my misery?
Anyone!
Finally, you idiot!
What took so long?
Now, hurry up and get these flea-bitten fur bags out of here!
- There are people waiting to see me!
- Okay, go now.
You think all those boring freaks with no lives came to worship two no-name mutts?
I don't think so!
I'm the one they love!
Me!
They came to see...
I knew I forgot to tell you something.
Careful, your mic's on.
You did this to me.
You ruined me!
News flash!
You ruined you!
Oh, what do you know?
You're a nobody!
The only reason you even wanted to be my friend is so I'd choose your dog!
No, no.
At first, I idolized you, even more than myself, which isn't easy.
But you're not at all what I thought you were.
You and I are exactly alike.
Except I don't enjoy letting people down.
I don't use people to feel better about myself.
And I definitely don't wear yellow and orange in the same week, let alone the same outfit, okay?
Maybe I did think you and I were alike, but not anymore.
In fact, I'd be embarrassed if someone thought I was like you.
Well, I quit!
And without me, there's no show.
Now neither one of your furry little friends will have their shot and neither will you.
Blame her!
I'm sorry.
Someone had to say it.
I'll go talk some sense into her.
You, out of this theater right now.
Wait, Sharpay.
If you go, then I'll go, too.
No.
You wanted this as badly as I did.
This mess was my idea.
You win.
That's not what it feels like.
- Hey.
Can I come in?
- Sure.
- So, you're really leaving, huh?
- Yeah.
I'm packing my carry-on stuff first.
- I wish you weren't going.
- Me, too.
Have you thought about what you're gonna do now?
Move home where there's enough room for my pores to open, spend months in the spa getting this layer of New York grime off my skin, and mostly miss you.
Look, I know exactly how to help that.
Don't go.
I already talked to my dad.
I guess I'm gonna start...
- You don't have to say it.
- Thank you.
What about your dream of being a star?
It's still there.
It's just a little bit more of a dream than a reality.
- You know what today is?
- What?
I got here exactly one month ago.
My time was up tonight anyway.
Well, so then you still have eight hours.
This isn't how my movie's supposed to end.
I guess it is.
This is Sharpay.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
No, no.
I'll be there.
That was the stage manager.
They want me to come to the theater and clear out Boi's things.
I can go with you if you want.
I want.
And, so, Amber Lee has quit.
- Gone.
- Kaput.
The producers feel, without a star, we can't open.
The time it would take to find someone who could learn the role and do it well might take weeks, and it would cost too much to keep the production going.
But we want you all to know, it was great almost working with you.
- I'm gonna meet you outside.
- All right.
Thank you for your hard work.
We are so, so sorry, people.
Wait!
Wait, it's not over.
It's not over.
Look, it doesn't have to be.
Look, there is someone who knows the part by heart and who is amazing.
All right, maybe she's not a star yet, but she will be.
This show will make her one.
Just watch.
Boi, keep your voice down.
Peyton, start shooting the rehearsal.
Boi, go mark.
Go mark.
Good!
Okay, stay.
Stay.
I love when you use that accent, but...
We're not supposed to be in here.
Okay, now let's do the scene where the character Lenore thinks she's lost everything and you come over to console her.
Come on.
Shelby, what is going on?
I feel invisible here.
Nothing is working out the way I planned it.
I got something inside of me
Something that needs to be heard
Deep down a voice is guiding me
Hidden emotions have stirred
Why have I let others lead the way
When all along I know what it is I want to say
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
I thought I had a perfect plan
Where I would wind up on top
One day I'm thinking, "Yes I can"
Next thing you know, I'm a flop
Why did I ever play this silly game?
I got to shake up the rules
And stake my claim
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
What if I missed my window?
What if I blew my shot?
What if the only chance I was going to get
I already got?
I'm not ready to turn the page
Until I'm on stage in a show
No, nobody move I've got something to prove
Don't you know?
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
Well, did I tell you?
- Amazing!
- Amazing!
You're amazing!
You have more depth, range and tone in one note than Amber Lee had in her entire surgically reshaped body.
We'll promote you as "The girl who we're promoting."
The producers will love it.
Wait, wait.
What are you saying?
We need you to save the show.
- Seriously?
- We know it's a risk.
- A gamble.
- A risk.
Did I do "risk" already?
You did.
And, true, we did fire you.
- He fired you.
- But now I'm un-firing you.
- Can we do that?
- Just did.
- Good for us!
- We need you.
What do you say?
Um... (STAMMERING) I guess we could take the costumes in a few sizes and get everyone used to hearing the songs sung on key,
but there's one condition.
Boi and Countess split the role of Shelby the dog equally.
Done!
We've a lot of work to do, people!
- Are we crazy?
- Crazy for theater!
- Let's rehearse!
- Let's rehearse, people!
Where are those wonderful dogs?
- Thank you.
- This is it.
The chance you've been waiting for.
- What if I'm not ready for this?
- Oh, you're ready.
"Ready" isn't as ready as you are.
- What if I'm horrible?
- Won't happen.
- What if I forget my lines?
- Impossible.
- What if I...
- Everything in your life so far has been leading you to this moment.
Your moment.
Embrace it.
I'm scared.
Finally.
Let's rehearse, people!
Over here!
Mr. Pinto, Mr. Pinto, over here.
Mr. Pinto, look this way.
I've got a feeling inside of me
Running all through my veins
It's like electrical energy
A world about to change
It's an open road
So here I go
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
I'm gonna go for it all out
I know there's no guarantee
But I've been given a chance and now
What's next is up to me
I'm gonna set my sights
So light those lights
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
If all the world's a stage
I'm here to take my place
I know I'll always find a way to shine
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
It starts with a dream
Of who I could be
Wherever it takes me I can't wait
So I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
The rest of my life
The rest of my life
I want fabulous That is my simple request
All things fabulous Bigger and better and best
I need something inspiring to help me get along
I need a little fabulous Is that so wrong?
Fetch me my Jimmy Choo flip-flops
Where is my pink Prada tote?
A summer like never before
I want more!
She wants fabulous That is her simple request
All things fabulous Bigger and better and best
She needs something inspiring to help her get along
She needs a little fabulous Is that so wrong?
Absolutely...
Not!
ripped by carrot
There's a moment when you realize that something's changed
And all the bits and pieces start to fit
It's so fab!
When nothing that you know will ever be the same
Ring the bell
That's my cue
Gotta try something new
Gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
Yeah
Listen up, fellas.
Now there's nothing in this universe to hold me back
Bye, Gab.
No endless night can keep me in the dark
And I just might give my dear old dad a heart attack
- But he'll live
- He'll live
- And he'll see
- He'll see
What his girl is meant to be
Gonna shine
And leave the past behind
Gonna try to fly so high
Gonna climb and make the prize all mine
Then I'll write my name in letters across the sky
I'm gonna shine
And if my present luminescent state is second rate
I'll turn it up a notch past nine
And watch the world go blind
Got a diva dazzle that you just can't touch
Like an angel in Armani I'm too fabulous
They'll be lining up for blocks Once I bop to the top
With a poochie in my Gucci I just can't be stopped
I'm gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
There she is.
Wonderful!
Hi!
- I know, I know.
- I loved it.
Excuse us.
There's our little superstar!
Princess, you had better watch out for law enforcement.
They are gonna come after you for stealing the show!
Honey, on a scale of one to 10, you were an entirely different scale.
And you know my aversion to scales.
Sharpay!
Yes, I know.
And thank you.
We'd like to introduce you to Jerry Taylor.
He's a good friend of our family, visiting for the week.
May I just say how wonderful you were?
As many times as you'd like!
I really see a unique talent here.
I mean, a true gift.
And your kind, true words are a gift as well.
It was so nice to meet you.
But if you'll excuse me, my friends have been waiting.
I'm a casting agent from New York.
And will keep waiting until I tell you how much I love your suit.
I'm about to start casting for a new musical on Broadway.
Broadway?
As in "Broadway?"
Yeah.
And I think that there is a perfect part.
I would be more than happy to arrange an audition if you happen to find yourself in the Big Apple any time soon.
That would be...
I would be...
It would be, like...
The show is gonna star Amber Lee Adams.
- No.
- Yeah.
Stop.
Seriously, stop.
Who's Amber Lee Adams?
She's only the most amazing performer ever!
We have so much in common.
I won't keep you.
It was so nice to meet you, Sharpay.
Congratulations again.
And, who knows, maybe we'll see you in New York.
Okay?
- Congrats!
- Bye.
Toodles!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
- No!
- No?
- No!
- No?
I don't understand!
What language is that?
No, I don't think going to New York is a good idea.
See, there you go, believing everything you think.
Do you really believe you're ready for such a monumental step?
Daddy, the main reason I buy such expensive shoes is to take monumental steps.
Sweetheart, when you graduated from high school almost a year ago, do you remember what you said to me?
"How come no one makes a cap and gown in hot pink?"
No.
"How come you get a car and driver and I don't?"
- No.
- "Good luck finding anyone
"to fill the talent-less void of boring and unattractive
"that will exist in these hallways
- "once I graduate"?
- No.
Yes, but you also said that you needed a year to find yourself, to figure out what came next in your life.
That year's almost up, and you haven't found anything.
It's a small town.
I mean, there's only so many places to look.
Besides, I did find something.
A show I wanna be in.
This is more than just a show.
You're talking about going it alone in the big city.
Right!
To star on Broadway with Amber Lee Adams.
Could you really deny the world that opportunity?
I'm sorry, princess.
But nothing you've shown me convinces me you're ready for something like this.
Okay, ladies.
Team Sharpay.
New York.
Daddy says I'm not ready for this.
So, what does that mean?
You pout, throw a tantrum, and he buys you a new Burberry bag to make you feel better?
That's good, but no.
It means we show him I'm determined.
And when I make up my mind...
And no one is better with make-up.
...my mind looks amazing.
Okay, here's your assignments.
I texted Bridget, who e-mailed Constance, who tweeted Bethany, who IM'ed Jenn, who Facebooked Kara, who has an ex-friend who she caught with her boyfriend, who she then dumped, so now Kara's her friend again,
who knows of a New York apartment available in a luxury townhouse.
That is, like, the best house you can get in terms of towns.
- Sounds perfect.
- It gets better.
- It can't.
- But it does.
It is equal distance from both Chanel and Wicked.
Okay.
Now, on to travel plans.
That's right.
Albuquerque to New York.
One adult and one dog.
Excuse me?
Coach?
Hi, I'm calling for Sharpay Evans.
Mr. Taylor wanted to set up an audition with her for a new musical.
Two weeks from today is perfect.
Now, new outfits.
And this would be for opening night.
The beading actually doubles the reflection of paparazzi flashbulbs!
You can wear anything.
You should have your own reality show called I Can Wear Anything.
Where you wear anything.
All right.
I'm ready to show Daddy what we've accomplished.
Ladies, and people I don't know,
New York is calling.
And this is one call that is not going to voice-mail.
So, by way of review, this is my shoe closet, that is my bedroom, these are my new clothes and where I'll wear them, and then I'm a star!
See?
I'm just not totally convinced.
Daddy, you said I haven't shown you anything to let you know I'm ready for this.
But, look, I took matters into my own hands, and without even chipping my manicure.
Sweetheart, it's not as easy as putting pictures on boards.
But I've worked everything out!
And used this pointer.
- I don't know...
- Please, Daddy.
Alone, in New York?
My dear college friend, Michelle, has a son that goes to NYU.
I've met him.
He's a very nice boy.
I could ask her to make sure that he keeps his eye on you.
Are you sure you're ready to take this on?
I know I can do this.
I know it like I know purple washes me out and that my eyes are the exact same distance apart to be a supermodel.
What I don't know is whether you believe in me.
Mom seems to.
Okay, you have my blessing.
Thank you, Daddy!
I'll call my friend Michelle and have her talk to her son.
Thanks, Mom.
There's just one condition.
Fine.
I love a good conditioner.
You have one month.
I'll fly you to New York, I'll pay for your penthouse, but you have to get yourself in that show and prove to me you can take care of yourself.
One month.
- Deal?
- So deal!
But if it doesn't work out, you come back here and work for me.
At the country club.
- Work?
- A job.
That's the deal.
Prove yourself, or come back in a month and work for me.
Fine.
Prove myself it is!
Look!
Look, Boi, look!
- Sharpay?
- In the flesh and pastels!
- We've been awaiting your arrival.
- Then the wait's over!
We spoke on the phone.
I'm Marjorie Grande, the manager for the building.
My pleasure.
Please, follow me to the penthouse.
Ooh!
I hope this is to your liking.
No.
It's to my loving!
Boi, you've gotta see this.
- That's a dog.
- Try to get him to believe that.
I'm sorry.
There are no dogs in the building.
Sure there are.
See?
The members of the co-op board have a strict no-dog policy.
Well...
My father heads our country club board, so I'm sure that gives me some kind of board immunity.
Miss Sharpay, this building is pleased to have you.
This dog...
Not so pleased.
Miss Grande, Ma'am.
If he goes, I go.
What are you doing?
Filming you.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
Do you always just film totally stunning people on the street that you don't know?
Only when I think the subject is interesting.
And you look baffled and scared and really pink.
So, yeah, interesting.
Are you paparazzi?
I'm a film student at NYU, working on a short film.
The assignment is to capture one unique New York story.
Maybe you're it.
So, you decided to film me without my permission, just for a school assignment?
- Yep.
- How dare you!
And my left side is better for close-ups.
I'm Peyton.
Sharpay Evans.
Actress, heiress, soon to be Broadway legend.
- Wait!
- About 105,
- but it's really not polite to ask.
- No...
I should know my own weight, okay?
No, I'm Peyton Leverett.
Our moms went to college together.
This is crazy!
I was on my way up to your apartment to make sure you were okay.
And here you are.
Right, they told me to expect you.
Well, glad we could finally meet.
- Oh, and this is Boi.
- Well, nice to meet you, Boi.
So, why are you out here?
Is everything okay?
Not really.
When I rented this apartment online, it never said they don't allow dogs.
And now they won't let us live here.
Yeah, well, it's their loss!
- Do you have someplace else to go?
- Okay, it's my loss and their loss!
Actually, the only place I have to go is home.
And trust me, that is not an option!
Listen, there's an empty studio in my building, if you're interested.
I'm friends with the building manager.
I'm sure I can make a call.
And...
Well, I'm sure I can make a call and arrange something.
Maybe get you to see it.
Well, since I don't seem to have any other options.
Bellman!
Oh, yeah, right.
Seriously?
Careful with those!
This is all I have to get by on until the truck arrives with the bulk of my things.
Oh!
That's good.
Okay, now, go outside, and then come back in and give me even more of that it's-the-end-of-the-world look.
Okay?
- Hey, Peyton.
- Hey, Peyton!
- What's up?
- Off to acting class.
"Maggie, the cat is alive.
I'm alive!"
Singing lesson.
Cool, guys.
Okay.
Hey, this is Sharpay and Boi.
Hi, Sharpay.
Hi, Boi!
Anyways, gotta go.
See ya, Peyton.
- Nice meeting you, Sharpay.
- Later, guys.
Okay.
Really, you're going to love this place.
Okay?
Up you go.
Sorry.
It's a pre-war building.
And during the war, they didn't fight for an elevator?
Listen, the building has two things going for it.
It's got something available, and I live here.
Fine.
But if I break a heel, or a sweat, you're responsible.
Get my bags.
See?
That wasn't so bad.
Yeah.
Down the hall.
The one with the police tape and chalk outline.
Really?
Kidding.
- You said this was a studio.
- It is.
No way!
MGM was a studio!
This?
This is a roach motel with no room service.
Yeah, a studio apartment.
Sure, from certain angles, it's a bit small.
A two-karat engagement ring is a bit small!
This is a doll house!
- So what do you think?
- Forget it!
I'd need an entirely separate apartment just for my lipsticks.
And where am I supposed to sleep?
- What is that?
- It's your bed.
That is not a bed.
It's a closet with a tongue.
You can't be serious!
- There is one really good thing about it.
- Yeah, sure.
See?
This is my place!
Looking better, huh?
Am I missing something?
Oh, right.
Space!
Luxury!
Maid service!
Let me guess.
You're used to being spoiled.
I'm not used to it.
I just expect it.
You know, half this building is filled with performers who came here with the same ambitions you did.
What makes you so much better than them?
Money, breeding, talent, great hair, perfect jaw line, chic taste.
How much time do you have?
All right, fine.
I tried to help you out like my mom asked, but whatever.
I'll find someone else to film.
The only problem is if I call my father and tell him how I messed up on the other apartment and how I have nowhere to go but here, and I ask for his help, he'll make me come home and...
Work!
- So?
- So?
Then I'll never get my big break.
Oh, and promise you won't call your mother and tell her about this, because then she'll call my mom who will tell my dad, and I don't think he really believes I can make this happen.
He only gave me one month to prove it.
Well, then you've got one month to prove him wrong.
Why did I do this?
I want my canopy bed and my housekeeper.
And a shower that doesn't share a room with a kitchen.
- Come on.
- Where to?
- Do you trust me?
- You suggested this place.
Yeah.
Point taken.
Come anyway.
Come on.
I hope you're taking me to a better apartment than what you just showed me.
Because let me tell you, if that's it?
No way!
Absolutely no!
Just come on.
Just don't ask any questions.
I need luxury!
Are you kidding me?
That was like a green, dark hole that I never wanna be in ever again.
All right, here you go.
Butchy!
- Come on...
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.
Come on.
- Why are we here?
All right, all right.
Now, you're gonna have to close your eyes.
- Close my eyes?
- Yeah, just close your eyes.
- Why?
- Because!
Just do it.
All right, now.
Keep them closed.
- Well, what if I hit into something?
- You won't.
I got you.
All right, all right.
Keep them closed.
All right.
- All right, you got them closed?
- Yes, I do.
All right, all right.
Perfect.
All right.
Now, stay here, keep them closed.
Keep them closed.
All righty.
Keep them closed.
All right.
Open them.
Hit it, Butchy!
Wow.
I know.
When I left Indiana to go to school here, I didn't know a soul either, and I was just as overwhelmed as you.
But I had two things, my dream and my camera.
And look at me now.
You still only have your dream and your camera.
Yes, but I met you, didn't I?
So, something's working out.
Well, whenever people meet me, things get better.
Look, you just have to adapt to your surroundings.
And remember that for now this is all just temporary.
Right.
Like prom dresses and first boyfriends.
Look, anything you have to do will be worth it to get your dream.
Okay.
I'm gonna meet with that casting director, get the part,
- be a star and have a palace!
- There you go.
That's the self-indulgent, self-entitled, optimistic pink hurricane
I've been seeing through my lens.
And I like how perceptive you are.
Okay, New York.
Bring it on.
I used to think maybe you loved me
Now, baby, I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day When you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox Gotta hold myself down
'Cause I just can't wait till you write me You're coming around
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
- And don't it feel good!
- Hey!
All right now And don't it feel good!
Hey!
All right now, yeah
Hi!
Turn it off.
Turn it off!
Just waiting for you
Just waiting for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day
No, no, no
What?
I want you to stay
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
- And don't it feel good!
- Hey!
All right now And don't it feel good!
Oh, yeah!
Looking good.
So pink.
You're good.
- Do you wanna try some?
- No, I don't want any!
Lay down.
Lay down.
Night, Boi!
Boi?
Get help!
- Knock, knock.
- Come in!
Wow!
And wow.
Hey, are you on your way to meet with the casting director?
No, I'm on my way to change theater history.
You think this is a good outfit for changing history?
Perfect!
Mind if I tag along and film?
Not that you could ever mind me, right?
I think you should.
After all, not many people can say they were there to film the creation of a legend.
Sharpay!
You made it after all!
Destiny called, and I get great reception!
Well, your timing is perfect.
What's tomorrow like for you?
The first day of the rest of my fame.
Well, all right.
I'll set up your audition for 3:00.
I'll e-mail you the musical number that we'd like you to prepare.
And could you make sure that he's well-groomed and, you know, takes care of any business beforehand.
- What?
- What?
- He?
- Yes.
- Him?
- Him.
- He?
- Yes!
Wait, what?
It's your dog that we want to audition.
He was amazing!
Oh.
What?
I mean...
I sent you all the information in response to your e-mail.
I mean, didn't the title of the musical give you any indication?
A Girl's Best Friend?
A Girl's Best Friend!
And I'm here for the girl!
You're here for the girl?
Well, I'm never the best friend!
Oh, no.
No, no.
We wanted Boi.
As the girl?
No, as the best friend.
Wait, wait.
You wanted Boi as the best friend of the girl?
Not me as the girl with the best friend?
Exactly.
Oh, Sharpay, I am so sorry for the confusion.
If you don't want Boi to audition, I would totally understand.
Sharpay.
Sharpay!
Hey, stop.
Hey, don't touch the car!
Look, slow down.
Even New Yorkers can't keep up with you.
It's not even me they wanted!
Well, to be fair, the role is for a dog.
If they wanted you, I could understand you being upset.
Why did I come all this way?
Leave my friends, family, a dry, self-hydrating climate?
To follow your dream!
Or at least that's what I thought.
Nothing is turning out the way I planned it!
Plan A. Live in a penthouse and star on Broadway.
Plan B...
Don't have a plan B!
What do I tell my father now?
That you came to a very special city determined to be someone very special, which you are.
Oh, I'm not so special.
I'm just like everyone else.
Maybe a little better.
Look at it this way.
Boi is your dog, and he has an opportunity, so be happy for him.
You're right.
I'm being, you know, what's the word?
When you do something for yourself even though it's not so good for other people?
- Selfish?
- No!
Oh, yeah.
Look, Sharpay, you can't give up.
Okay?
And, anyway, you're officially the star of my film.
I am?
Yeah, you are.
Oh.
So now it's all about you?
Only because I need you here.
Fine.
I'll star in your movie.
Okay.
Good, good!
Okay, change of strategy.
I didn't know you had a strategy, but I like the way you think.
If Boi becomes a success, everyone will see me as well.
After all, I am his entourage.
I am the one who's holding his leash.
His fame will ultimately lead to my fame.
That's what I came here for, right?
Still a little selfish, but heading in the right direction.
We're gonna do this.
It's like I tell the housekeepers.
If you can't see the bright side, polish the dull side.
Yeah, not quite what I was talking...
They want Boi to audition?
It's Boi they will get!
When a sign of the times is the times are extremely tough
When you look at the world and the world that you see is
Yes, rough
When you feel like a long lost pup
And you need some cheering up
Sit back, relax and watch us do our stuff
Two, three, four
We're gonna sit and shake your hand That's how it starts
We're gonna nose our nosy way into your hearts
We'll sing and bark In two-part harmony
You're gonna love us That's our guarantee
We'll bow together on the count of three
Me and my Boi My Boi and me
We make the perfect pair
We've got that savoir-faire
Me and my Boi
Me and my Boi
Me and my Boi
My Boi and me
Wait!
That's the best audition I've ever seen!
I'm Gill Samms, the director.
Neal Roberts, writer.
That was amazing!
Chills.
Feel my hand...
I won't feel your hand, but I believe you.
I won't feel your hand either, but I believe you, too.
That is one special dog.
We've done special here.
Special has been done, people!
Boi was meant for Broadway.
We both were.
So, when do we start?
Well, there's one more waiting.
One more!
One more, people!
Could you take a seat in the front row, please?
There.
Now.
Roger Elliston
the third.
And his dog, Countess.
FYI, I'm Roger.
As you can see by our extensive resume, hand-printed on carbonless, environmental-friendly rice paper,
Countess has numerous major Broadway credits under her paws, including The Collar Purple, Three Puppy Opera, and the original Broadway cast production of A Wagging Tail of Two Cities, a musical opera in German.
Major pedigree.
I'm impressed.
This is us impressed.
Plus, she can bark a high C with sustained vibrato.
Sure, but only dogs can hear it.
All right.
Let's see what Countess can do.
When a sign of the times is the times are extremely tough
When you look at the world and the world that you see is rough
When you feel like a long lost pup
And you need some cheering up
Sit back, relax and watch us do our stuff
We're gonna sit and shake your hand That's how it starts
We're gonna nose our nosy way into your hearts
We'll sing and bark In two-part harmony
You're gonna love us That's our guarantee
We'll bow together on the count of three
Me and my girl My girl and me
We make the perfect pair
We've got that savoir-faire
Me and my girl
Me and my girl
Me and my girl
My girl and me
That's the best audition I've ever seen!
- Amazing!
I weeped!
- Wept.
I wept!
- I wept!
- And not just regular weeping.
Theater weeping!
Amber Lee, what do you think?
Yes.
Amber Lee, thoughts?
Wow...
We are so meant to be BFFs!
Wow! "Wow" is a word, right?
Right.
Wow!
I just hope that the palpable chemistry surging between you and I right now like nuclear fusion won't in any way influence your decision towards our clearly superior audition.
How old are you?
Twelve.
I think I'm good.
And you, also!
Your dog...
Wow!
Wow.
I know, right?
He's just saying hi.
Sharpay Evans of the New Mexico Evans.
I'm a mega fan.
Oh, you are not!
So am!
I am gonna tweet about you right now.
Shut up!
I follow your tweets.
She did!
She tweeted!
Okay, I don't know how we're gonna decide.
You're amazing!
All this and a grade school diploma.
And you, amazing!
Wow.
I would be excited to work with either one of you and your dogs.
And can I just say, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Because Broadway...
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, real people are watching.
- Wow.
- Me, too.
I am just so excited to be performing on the Great White Way!
Not that I don't love all colors.
Well, I know both these talented dogs want to work with you.
But only one can be in the show.
- How are we gonna decide?
- Wait.
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals?
Wait!
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals!
That way I could see which one I work best with.
- That sounds like a solution.
- We have a solution, people!
Can I just say how totally great I think you are?
You do, and I'll never wash my ears again.
You know what I think?
Well, of course you don't because I just thought of it, but I think they loved you!
I like the way you think!
And you're such a good singer.
And I would know.
- My album went triple platinum.
- Well, I've done quite a bit of theater.
It totally shows.
Listen, I'm gonna have my assistant give you my phone number.
If there's anything that you need, you just let me know, okay?
We girls gotta stick together, right?
- Here.
- Wow.
I mean, this is actually your number!
It looks like any ordinary number, but it's not.
It's yours!
- Oh, and, hey, may the best dog win!
- Thanks!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Can you believe it?
You were great!
Boi was great.
This new strategy just might work.
- Amber Lee really likes you, too.
- Is she awesome or what?
She inspires me.
There.
I said it.
Quelle inspired.
We are so gonna get that part.
- How do you know?
- Easy.
I don't do rejection.
Sharpay!
I just wanted to wish you both luck.
Oh!
That's so nice of you.
And suggest that you give up now, while you still have your dignity.
Distant though it already might be.
Sorry, which Smurf are you again?
True, you have talent.
But you lack both the experience and the finesse to ever achieve the Holy Grail of possibility.
- Yeah, but Boi is cuter.
- Countess is a theatrical ninja.
I'm sorry.
For a minute there you just bored me to death.
I have a foolproof strategy of getting what I want.
See it, want it, have a fit, get it.
- Yeah, well, this playdate's over.
- I hope you enjoy rejection.
- We're gonna get that part.
- We're gonna destroy you.
- Bring it on.
- Oh, it's brought.
All right, Boi.
This foot.
That foot.
Good boy!
Yeah!
Okay, let's try our next one.
Stay.
Catch your tail.
Catch your tail!
Good!
Yeah, good.
Sit.
Stay.
We are so going to take them on.
I'm not gonna let some hobbit get in my way.
And, look.
All Boi can do is think about how horrible that other little mangy dog was.
If you want success so badly, then you will get it.
All you need is one shot to make it happen.
Yeah, and this is my shot.
It's like my grandmother says.
"God only got one book published,
"and look how well it did for him."
Doing this is all I've ever dreamed about, especially since I already have everything else.
Well, there's still humility.
What's wrong with being confident?
Confidence is when you know you're good.
Arrogance is when you think others know you're good.
Well, I want everyone to know I'm as good as I think everyone thinks I am without them knowing I know they think it.
- And do you have to film everything?
- Yep, 'cause this is my shot.
If my professor loves my film, he talks about it.
Then there's a buzz, then it gets in a festival, then it gets distribution, then I'm signing a studio deal, then I'm getting an Oscar.
I always knew I wanted to be an actress the first time I produced and performed the entire production of Snow White.
Full dance, musical numbers, handmade costumes.
I made my brother play all the dwarfs.
Everyone in that pre-school worshipped me.
I just want to wake up every morning and be onstage.
Good morning!
Good morning, everyone.
- And welcome to the first rehearsal...
- Of the new Broadway musical.
A Girl's Best Friend!
And you are all amazing.
- No, you are!
- Him or me?
- You!
- No, you!
Me?
Okay!
And heading our superb cast, we are thrilled to welcome one of the biggest stars around,
Amber Lee Adams!
Oh, stop!
- Yes!
- Guys, come on.
Can I just say that this, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, people can see if you write your lines on your hands!
All right.
Let's rehearse.
I want everybody downstairs with piano, rehearsing the music for the opening number.
Amber Lee and Judith,
I want you onstage so we can block that first scene.
- Let's go!
- Let's go, people!
All right.
Let's start with Boi.
Let's go!
What a perfect goodbye party.
Thank you, Mom!
I can't believe my little girl is going out into the world on her own for the first time.
I have to, Mom.
And who knows, maybe I'll find fame and fortune!
Actually, reverse that.
- Why is that funny?
- Well...
Because you'd rather have the...
I'll explain later.
Just keep going.
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Pick it up!
Go, go!
A star is about to be born!
Shelby!
Oh!
What's in this envelope?
This very wet envelope.
- Again, I don't get that.
- Keep going.
Gasp!
Actually, that's a stage direction.
You gasp, you don't say "gasp."
Simple mistake.
Keep going.
Shelby!
Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
Oh, Shelby.
This is the first time we'll be apart.
I wish I could just pack you up in a widdle doggie bag.
Okay.
Let's get Countess in there and continue.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Shelby and I will both be here when you get back.
You're killing me.
Oh!
That is adorable!
You're right, Shelby!
Why not go with me?
Any place that doesn't want you, I don't wanna be.
Let's see what New York has in store for us together!
Good.
Let's talk about the scene a bit, and we'll do it again.
And both dogs, great work!
Shelby!
Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
What's going on?
The dog.
What is this?
Somebody, please.
The dog is licking me.
All right, all right.
Get me the other dog!
Sorry.
What can you do?
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go, go!
- Why is she twirling?
- What is she doing?
- Gill?
- Roger!
Figure out what's going on with the dog.
It's not helping me.
- Not helping, people!
- Meanwhile, get the other dog!
Sorry.
What can you do?
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go!
Oh, hey!
How is this helping?
Really.
Am I the only one bothered by this?
Gill?
Okay, everybody, that's 10!
I'll admit you're good.
But we're better.
Give up!
Give up?
Not until there's a Broadway marquee with a picture of my dog so big you can walk by and smell his puppy breath!
I have to take the dogs for a nap.
Union rules.
Thank you.
- You break first.
- No, you break first.
Oh!
- Pretty cute, huh?
- Yeah!
Yes, they are!
I just wanted to tell you something.
This is my show.
I'm America's sweetheart.
They're paying to see me, not you two over-bred fur balls.
So, until I can figure out a way to get rid of you, you better watch your step, otherwise you'll find out the real meaning of going home in a doggie bag.
This film is cutting together really well.
Do I look amazing?
- The camera loves you.
- I know!
Oh, no!
My dad's video-chatting me.
He thinks I live in a penthouse.
I can't let him see that I live in a tiny studio in a filthy tenement.
With a boy in my room!
A boy, by the way, that has no money, and lives in a tinier studio, and who, apparently, has never heard of the word "maid-service"!
No offense.
What of that could possibly offend me?
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
I don't know.
Hyperventilating!
- What do I do?
What do I do?
- Come on.
Come on.
Hurry!
- All right, scoot over.
Okay, go, go.
- Okay, I gotta get this.
Stop!
Hi, Daddy!
Hey, princess!
How's my little girl?
Overpaying for everything and yelling at total strangers.
You're practically a native.
Hey, where are you?
That view is spectacular.
Well, there's hardly a penthouse in the city that doesn't have a spectacular view!
So, you the toast of Broadway?
Daddy, you know how I feel about carb references.
Just a little concerned, sweetie.
The last time no one's heard from you for this long was when you found out your gold card wasn't actually made of gold.
Well, I've been busy with rehearsals.
Outstanding!
You got into the show?
Well, it doesn't quite work like that.
It's complicated.
But I know it's gonna work out.
Sharpay, is there something you're not telling me?
You remember the deal, right?
If things aren't working out...
I know, I know.
I have one month to get in the show, and then...
Two weeks, sweetie.
You have two weeks left.
You're sure everything's okay?
It's fine, Daddy.
Well, okay.
We miss you, angel.
Miss you, too.
I love you!
Boi has to get that role.
I can't go home.
Not as a failure.
I need some sort of subtle, visibly crushing advantage over Roger.
Look, why not just trust Boi is talented, that you've trained him well,
- and let fate take it from there.
- Fate?
Fate gave a girl in my graduating class one long eyebrow.
I can't trust fate.
Some matters you just have to take into your own hands.
What do you mean you forgot my bottled water?
Well, I was going to get those magazines that you said you wanted from across town, and I got hit by a bike messenger.
So I went to the hospital for, like, just one second to get these stitches.
And meanwhile, I had no water!
I will get it for you right now.
Now I've had to drink tap!
- I am so sorry.
- "I am so sorry."
- I will do better.
- Forget it, okay?
Aside from catching some shade from the shadow cast by your madam's apple, you're of no use to me.
You're... (WHIMPERING) fired!
God!
Amber Lee?
Oh, wow!
You look so cute, Sharpie!
- Sharpay.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
So, tell me, what's on your mind?
I just saw your assistant leave in tears.
She's not my assistant.
She quit.
No wonder she was crying.
Yeah, I don't think she even really cared.
Next time I should probably just hire a best friend instead.
Wait!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
What are you thinking that I should be thinking?
I could help you out until you replace her.
That is what I was thinking about thinking.
Of course this can't, in any way, affect your decision of which dog gets the starring role.
Oh, it won't.
I couldn't live with myself if I thought I did anything unfair.
You have my word.
Hey, I know!
How about dinner?
- That sounds awesome!
- Right?
Get me a reservation for two at someplace fantastic.
Then call my agent, have her meet me.
Right.
Sure.
Oh.
I won't forget this.
And I promise, it won't be because you're helping me if I happen to take a little extra liking to Girl.
- Boi.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
Oh, and can you take my mic down to the sound guy
- and tell him the wire hurts my scalp.
- Okay.
You're the best.
Amber Lee says the wire is hurting her scalp.
Personally, I think she's using the wrong shampoo, but she's the star, and you know, I don't wanna say anything.
You're hot.
Excuse me?
You're hot.
Okay.
Even though theater lighting highlights my natural skin tones, thank you for noticing, that's a little rude, don't you think?
No.
Your mic's hot.
It means it's on.
You see that little switch.
When it's flipped over like that, it means it's on and it's going through the entire theater.
Well, you could have led with that part, thank you.
Amber Lee's got a great scalp!
You're hot.
Then she asked me to help her out after her assistant quit.
And after I suggested it.
Are you sure this is wise?
I'm sorry.
Let me re-phrase that.
This isn't wise.
It's perfect.
Amber Lee will see that she and I are exactly alike, we'll become BFFs, she'll make sure Boi gets the role, then his fame becomes my fame!
I mean, this is the advantage I've been waiting for!
Isn't it more like taking advantage?
And my father thought I couldn't do this in a month.
It's turning out better than I imagined.
Hello?
Sure.
Be right over.
Hello?
Oh, thank goodness.
In here, quickly.
I just...
I can't reach that.
Can't reach it?
Okay, it was a little bit of a test.
Only a true friend would come all the way down here at this hour and help me with something like that.
- So, I passed?
- Yes.
- But, seriously, the purse.
- Okay.
Thank you.
All right, here's your bag.
Here's your other bag.
Oh, and don't forget your photo shoot.
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
You must be at that photo shoot to make sure I look as fabulous as you always do.
- Are you serious?
- Serious?
You're now also my stylist.
You have to tell me all your secrets.
Okay, gotta go.
"Life is so strange.
"Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune,
"and instead, we find love."
Hey!
How about dinner?
Split some egg rolls at Wok This Way?
Can't.
I have to highlight script changes for Amber Lee, then highlight her hair.
Highlight of my night!
Okay.
But I miss spending time with you.
And you did promise to shoot some more stuff for my film.
You know, what I'm doing is important, too.
Oh.
For a minute there, you sounded like Amber Lee.
"Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you."
Bad news.
My maid quit.
So, here's a list of chores.
Chores?
And I want to talk to you about Boi.
But you have to promise it'll stay between us.
Okay.
I think I'm going to ask the director to give Boi the part.
- Are you serious?
- Almost positive!
You won't be sorry.
Trust me.
I know.
Oh!
Oh, no.
There are some changes for the blocking in the dog scene, top of act two.
Countess can learn these in no time.
She's got a memory like a digital hard drive.
- No bark and all mega-bite.
- Funny.
I need to find Sharpay and make sure she gets them.
Boi is doing the first run-through tomorrow.
I'd be more than happy to deliver them to her.
- Great.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Sharpay?
Sharpay?
That's unfortunate.
And I've been here ever since.
Life is so strange.
Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune, and instead, we find love.
Lenore, I have something to ask you.
We have something to ask you.
He's supposed to come from the other side of the stage with the ring box!
Yeah, sorry.
We changed that blocking.
What happened?
What is wrong with this dog?
And is he okay?
It's not his fault.
He's just a little dog!
He's just so sweet.
Okay, everybody.
Let's break for a few.
That's 10, people.
I'm aware.
I know.
I don't know what happened.
We sent out the script changes, but Boi didn't do them.
But I didn't get any new script change.
I looked everywhere last night to give them to you.
I guess working for Amber Lee has its drawbacks.
- You did this on purpose.
- That's a complete...
Yeah.
You're threatened because you know Amber Lee is gonna choose Boi.
Not after today she won't.
Okay.
Countess doesn't have half the personality that Boi has.
And Boi doesn't have half the talent that Countess has.
Isn't that right, girl?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Has anyone seen Boi?
- No, sorry.
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Anyone seen Countess?
- Nope.
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Hello?
- Boi and Countess are gone!
Gone!
What?
We have to find them!
Wait, where are you now?
Leaving the theater.
We're gonna look around here.
Can you look near the apartment in case they come back?
Yeah, yeah.
Of course.
Just keep me posted, and I'll call you if they show up.
Okay.
What if they were dog-napped?
Do you think we pushed them too hard?
- I don't know.
- Countess is uber-sensitive.
She cries watching dog food commercials!
I just hope they're not huddled in a corner somewhere.
Afraid, lost, at each other's throats!
You know you love me I know you care
Just shout whenever And I'll be there
You are my love You are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item?
Girl, quit playin'
"We're just friends," What are you sayin'?
Said, "There's another" And looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine
I'm goin' down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around
And I'm like baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby...
What if we never see them again?
They're smart dogs.
Smarter than we are.
They'll be okay.
Oh, no.
It's my dad.
I just...
I can't deal with him right now.
- Countess!
- Boi!
Hi!
I missed you!
You're back!
It's amazing.
They came back to the apartment.
Thanks, Peyton.
Oh, and Sharpay, it's still on.
Bring it.
You're back!
Yeah!
You bad, bad boy, Boi.
I'm just glad you're okay.
He and Countess had an adventure.
She probably coaxed him into joining a doggy gang or something.
We'd better check him over for tattoos.
Are you so lost in what you're doing that you haven't noticed?
Noticed what?
Boi and Countess are in love.
- With what?
- Each other.
No way!
You're right.
He's dilated.
He's got puppy dog eyes.
How could I have not noticed puppy love?
Well, there's a lot you haven't noticed.
Like lately, you've had no time for me.
You know, I was counting on you to help me finish my film.
I said I would, and I will.
Things have become complicated.
It's not that complicated.
Amber Lee is using you, and you're letting her.
You don't know what you're talking about.
- I don't?
- No!
Where's the Sharpay that was determined not to go back home because she didn't want to work for anyone?
Why don't you tell me?
Working for someone, that's where.
- So at least be honest as to why.
- I know what I'm doing.
You've sold your soul to get Boi in that show, rather than trust in the dog that you raised.
Even worse, you've stopped trusting that your own talents would get you where you need to go.
And maybe you're jealous because I'm on my way up with a new famous friend, and you're just a student making a film about someone else's life instead of your own.
You don't have to be in my movie anymore.
I get it.
You have more important things to do.
Fine!
One question?
What happened to that hot pink whirlwind of confidence and ambition
I saw through my lens that first day you got here?
I mean, that girl knew she was special.
That girl knew she didn't have to do any of this to succeed.
What happened to her, huh?
Hello.
Oh, and Sharpay, can you remember to invite as many people from my fan club as possible to opening-night dress rehearsal?
I want the theater filled with people who love me as much as you do!
Sure.
You know what would be great after all this work?
A long, luxurious spa bath.
Sounds amazing!
Thank you.
Run one for me, will you?
And then you can finish these.
You're the best!
- This is a big change.
- Huge change!
I don't think you're hearing me!
New Jersey can hear you!
The name of the show is A Girl's Best Friend.
I didn't tell you to change the title.
But you want the best friend written out!
Oh.
Right.
Change the title!
How are we supposed to get rid of one of our main characters a day before our dress rehearsal in front of an audience?
The audience is coming to see me.
You change that dog's part to a bark and play dead, or I don't go on.
Let's be reasonable here.
I'm a star.
I don't have to be reasonable!
Look, those mangy mutts are bothering me almost as much as their disposable owners.
I actually had to have one of them clean my toilet just to keep her away.
She thinks she's an actress.
She acts all right.
She acts just like every other obsessed fan.
Wait.
Everything you said...
You were...
Right?
Yes.
Thank you.
You must think I'm a total fool.
No.
Not total.
Maybe my dad was right.
Maybe I'm not ready for this.
Maybe I should just go home and... (STAMMERING) work for him.
I mean, did I really think I was just gonna come to Broadway and be a star?
Yes.
Because that's exactly how you think.
It's perfect.
Perfect is so hard.
And it doesn't prepare you for disappointment.
Well, if it helps, you still look adorable, even when you're disappointed.
Yeah, that doesn't help.
Look, Sharpay.
There is not a marquee big enough or lights bright enough to contain the fame you're gonna have.
Yeah, but not the way I've been doing it.
Like you said, the Sharpay you know isn't the Sharpay that has become the Sharpay that is this Sharpay.
Did all the Sharpays follow that?
I sacrificed integrity for opportunity.
I let someone insecure distract me.
I cleaned a bathroom!
But worst of all, I disappointed someone I care about.
I forgot what was really important to me.
I lost track of what I want.
And other than maid service and a canopy bed, what is it that you want?
A fair fight.
A lifetime in the spotlight.
And maybe you'll still let me be in your movie.
I guess.
Okay, I can't say I approve of dating beneath your station in life, but fine.
Go.
Hey, I got your text.
What's C-Q-M-T-W-l-L-G-T mean?
"Come quick.
Major trouble.
Wow, I look great today." Duh.
I really should have gotten that.
Listen, Amber Lee Adams isn't what you think.
A self absorbed, two-faced panther who would eat her young alive on a reality show rather than allow anyone to steal her spotlight?
Okay, she's what you think.
Listen, I don't care if her parents had to tie beef jerky around her neck just to get the family dog to play with her, as long as Countess is at her side on that stage.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
She wants the part of the dog written out completely!
- That's not fair!
- Too far.
Well, I am 12, remember?
Roger, we've been fighting the wrong battle, each other.
We need to form an alliance and work against a common enemy.
- Zits?
- Amber Lee.
Trust me, the zit battle is one you won't win.
But what can we do?
Tonight is the dress rehearsal.
The audience will be filled with members of Amber Lee Adams' fan club.
I know, I saw the tweet.
Fine.
Yes, I follow her, too.
Okay, we need to show people exactly who Amber Lee really is.
It's time someone taught her how to behave in the theater.
I like the way you think.
It's manipulative, but for a good cause.
Tell me what you need me to do.
- Hey, Amber Lee, I...
- Where have you been?
I have been trying to reach you all day.
Oh.
Sorry, my phone must have been turned off.
Without asking me first?
I just wanted to say good luck.
You know, I know you chose Countess for this performance tonight, and I'm fine with that.
Well, it was nothing personal, but your phone was shut off, so I couldn't talk to you about it.
I guess that won't happen again, will it?
We're good.
Hug?
Okay.
Hello, everyone.
I'm Gill, the director.
And I'm Neal, the under-appreciated writer.
And we are thrilled that you're here for our first performance in front of an audience.
Does everyone here know how to applaud?
Okay, how about the balcony up there?
- Okay, now.
- Can you hear us?
You're good!
Will somebody please control these wannabe werewolves?
Hello?
People?
See, this is exactly why I didn't want to do a show with dogs!
I'm the star, not them!
Stage people?
Could somebody please put these rats with rabies out of my misery?
Anyone!
Finally, you idiot!
What took so long?
Now, hurry up and get these flea-bitten fur bags out of here!
- There are people waiting to see me!
- Okay, go now.
You think all those boring freaks with no lives came to worship two no-name mutts?
I don't think so!
I'm the one they love!
Me!
They came to see...
I knew I forgot to tell you something.
Careful, your mic's on.
You did this to me.
You ruined me!
News flash!
You ruined you!
Oh, what do you know?
You're a nobody!
The only reason you even wanted to be my friend is so I'd choose your dog!
No, no.
At first, I idolized you, even more than myself, which isn't easy.
But you're not at all what I thought you were.
You and I are exactly alike.
Except I don't enjoy letting people down.
I don't use people to feel better about myself.
And I definitely don't wear yellow and orange in the same week, let alone the same outfit, okay?
Maybe I did think you and I were alike, but not anymore.
In fact, I'd be embarrassed if someone thought I was like you.
Well, I quit!
And without me, there's no show.
Now neither one of your furry little friends will have their shot and neither will you.
Blame her!
I'm sorry.
Someone had to say it.
I'll go talk some sense into her.
You, out of this theater right now.
Wait, Sharpay.
If you go, then I'll go, too.
No.
You wanted this as badly as I did.
This mess was my idea.
You win.
That's not what it feels like.
- Hey.
Can I come in?
- Sure.
- So, you're really leaving, huh?
- Yeah.
I'm packing my carry-on stuff first.
- I wish you weren't going.
- Me, too.
Have you thought about what you're gonna do now?
Move home where there's enough room for my pores to open, spend months in the spa getting this layer of New York grime off my skin, and mostly miss you.
Look, I know exactly how to help that.
Don't go.
I already talked to my dad.
I guess I'm gonna start...
- You don't have to say it.
- Thank you.
What about your dream of being a star?
It's still there.
It's just a little bit more of a dream than a reality.
- You know what today is?
- What?
I got here exactly one month ago.
My time was up tonight anyway.
Well, so then you still have eight hours.
This isn't how my movie's supposed to end.
I guess it is.
This is Sharpay.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
No, no.
I'll be there.
That was the stage manager.
They want me to come to the theater and clear out Boi's things.
I can go with you if you want.
I want.
And, so, Amber Lee has quit.
- Gone.
- Kaput.
The producers feel, without a star, we can't open.
The time it would take to find someone who could learn the role and do it well might take weeks, and it would cost too much to keep the production going.
But we want you all to know, it was great almost working with you.
- I'm gonna meet you outside.
- All right.
Thank you for your hard work.
We are so, so sorry, people.
Wait!
Wait, it's not over.
It's not over.
Look, it doesn't have to be.
Look, there is someone who knows the part by heart and who is amazing.
All right, maybe she's not a star yet, but she will be.
This show will make her one.
Just watch.
Boi, keep your voice down.
Peyton, start shooting the rehearsal.
Boi, go mark.
Go mark.
Good!
Okay, stay.
Stay.
I love when you use that accent, but...
We're not supposed to be in here.
Okay, now let's do the scene where the character Lenore thinks she's lost everything and you come over to console her.
Come on.
Shelby, what is going on?
I feel invisible here.
Nothing is working out the way I planned it.
I got something inside of me
Something that needs to be heard
Deep down a voice is guiding me
Hidden emotions have stirred
Why have I let others lead the way
When all along I know what it is I want to say
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
I thought I had a perfect plan
Where I would wind up on top
One day I'm thinking, "Yes I can"
Next thing you know, I'm a flop
Why did I ever play this silly game?
I got to shake up the rules
And stake my claim
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
What if I missed my window?
What if I blew my shot?
What if the only chance I was going to get
I already got?
I'm not ready to turn the page
Until I'm on stage in a show
No, nobody move I've got something to prove
Don't you know?
Whatever it is I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
Well, did I tell you?
- Amazing!
- Amazing!
You're amazing!
You have more depth, range and tone in one note than Amber Lee had in her entire surgically reshaped body.
We'll promote you as "The girl who we're promoting."
The producers will love it.
Wait, wait.
What are you saying?
We need you to save the show.
- Seriously?
- We know it's a risk.
- A gamble.
- A risk.
Did I do "risk" already?
You did.
And, true, we did fire you.
- He fired you.
- But now I'm un-firing you.
- Can we do that?
- Just did.
- Good for us!
- We need you.
What do you say?
Um... (STAMMERING) I guess we could take the costumes in a few sizes and get everyone used to hearing the songs sung on key,
but there's one condition.
Boi and Countess split the role of Shelby the dog equally.
Done!
We've a lot of work to do, people!
- Are we crazy?
- Crazy for theater!
- Let's rehearse!
- Let's rehearse, people!
Where are those wonderful dogs?
- Thank you.
- This is it.
The chance you've been waiting for.
- What if I'm not ready for this?
- Oh, you're ready.
"Ready" isn't as ready as you are.
- What if I'm horrible?
- Won't happen.
- What if I forget my lines?
- Impossible.
- What if I...
- Everything in your life so far has been leading you to this moment.
Your moment.
Embrace it.
I'm scared.
Finally.
Let's rehearse, people!
Over here!
Mr. Pinto, Mr. Pinto, over here.
Mr. Pinto, look this way.
I've got a feeling inside of me
Running all through my veins
It's like electrical energy
A world about to change
It's an open road
So here I go
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
I'm gonna go for it all out
I know there's no guarantee
But I've been given a chance and now
What's next is up to me
I'm gonna set my sights
So light those lights
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
If all the world's a stage
I'm here to take my place
I know I'll always find a way to shine
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
It starts with a dream
Of who I could be
Wherever it takes me I can't wait
So I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
The rest of my life
The rest of my life
I want fabulous That is my simple request
All things fabulous Bigger and better and best
I need something inspiring to help me get along
I need a little fabulous Is that so wrong?
Fetch me my Jimmy Choo flip-flops
Where is my pink Prada tote?
A summer like never before
I want more!
She wants fabulous That is her simple request
All things fabulous Bigger and better and best
She needs something inspiring to help her get along
She needs a little fabulous Is that so wrong?
Absolutely...
Not!

Bloodlines Part 1
Anna Sandor.
Sofi Mustafova?
Anna Sandor.
Mustafova, Sofi.
"Body of Young Prostitute found in the Danube"
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Christ.
Blue jacket behind you.
You wore it to Amsterdam.
No, it's not.
How do you know these things?
I put it down to the absence of a Y chromosome.
Harry, I haven't had a week off since Christmas.
- What about Leo?
- I'll bring you back a present.
What?
Like the bottle of Advocaat you brought Leo back from the Dutch conference?
I'll get you back a Hungarian delicacy like, um...
- What do they have?
- Goulash.
And pretty lawyers, of course.
- This is work.
- And you just love your work!
This is an independent postmortem.
I shall be 48 hours max.
In and out?
If you like.
What is it?
Have you shagged everyone in London?
Not quite.
I think you like her this Ava.
Eva.
Anna.
I've only spent a couple of weekends with her.
But yes, I do like her.
But I love you...
Because you are giving up your whole weekend so that I can fight for women's rights in Budapest.
You're awfully cynical.
This is an octogenarian cardiac, this is a suspected arson in Peckham and this is an industrial accident in Acton.
- Enjoy.
- No.
I can't let you go out there.
Not like this.
Who or what is Simon?
You're not as young as you think you are.
Simon's my hairdresser.
He'll take ten years off you.
Nonsense.
Dr. Cunningham!
Duncan McBurney.
First Secretary at the Embassy.
British Embassy.
Welcome to Hungary.
- Thank you.
- You weren't expecting me.
The local Police notified us.
They don't much like being second-guessed.
I'm here in a private capacity to do an independent postmortem.
And I'm here in an official capacity to unofficially offer you a ride into town.
It's the first thing you learn as a diplomat.
Airport cabs will rob you blind.
That's a universal truth from Zurich to Addis Ababa.
Which one of you is going to drive?
A dead Roma prostitute.
What could be the British Embassy's interest?
The British Embassy's interest, Dr. Cunningham, is always the same.
A quiet life.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Hector's our first child.
He's got a more expensive wardrobe than I have.
So, officially, an unofficial warning to tread lightly?
It's always delicate.
Democracy made its first appearance here in 1989.
Prostitution was legalised in '93.
Romanians have had free entry since 2007.
The lawyer who's working for the deceased young lady likes to yell about all three.
Anna Sandor.
She's quite something, isn't she?
I've only met her a couple of time.
She seems, er... professional and committed.
And passionate.
She's not afraid to speak her mind.
In words of one syllable.
I like her.
They don't.
Her father's a doctor, isn't he?
- Neurosurgeon.
- Yes.
Istvan Sandor.
He's one of the few guys who managed to emerge from the Soviet era unscathed.
The best Health Minister they never had.
Office on the front, home on the back.
- Any time.
- Thanks.
It's the Euro qualifiers tonight.
A crowd of us gather at Molly Malone's if you're interested.
OK.
Yeah, I came to Budapest to hang out with Brits in an Irish bar!
Yes, quite.
The second rule of the diplomatic service, Dr. Cunningham... don't get sucked in.
They do things differently here.
Jo napot.
Hogy vagy?
Nagyon jol kos zonet es Onnek.
Boldog szuletesnapot.
It's not my birthday.
What a shame.
That's the only other phrase they had in the easyJet city guide.
- Where are you?
- Right behind you.
Across the road in the park.
You know this is costing me 58p a minute.
Aren't I worth it?
I'm the one sitting by the fountain with the Herald Tribune under my arm.
The slinky one with the suspicious look in her eye.
That's me.
- We could probably hang up.
- But we get on so well on the phone.
I worked it out.
85% of our relationship has been telephonic.
I'd hate to spoil it now.
83%.
According to my last monthly statement.
Sofi Mustafova was meant to meet her social worker on Thursday.
She never showed up.
She always showed up.
They're saying suicide.
- They always say suicide.
- Maybe they're right this time.
You said she was anxious.
They were making her have unprotected sex with the clients.
It pays them double.
Sofi was afraid.
She wasn't your average smack-addict hooker, she was a professional.
She had dreams of going back home with a brand new Mercedes.
She got pregnant.
That could've been why she have killed herself.
I don't think so.
But it could be why they'd have killed her.
Maybe she refused an abortion.
Sofi knew her mind.
She thought she was in control.
Why is the morgue always in the basement?
It's never going to be the shop window, is it?
You don't want to pass that on your way to see granny.
It should be on the top floor.
Closer to God.
- I thought you were an atheist.
- I lapse occasionally.
Here, have one of these.
It'll calm you down.
What is it?
- Valium?
- No.
A Murray Mint.
The English drug of choice.
Minimal side effects, though can prove highly addictive.
- Dr. Cunningham.
- Yes.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How do you do?
Dr. Cunningham's very expensive and I'm paying him by the hour.
Of course.
Here is my postmortem report.
Let me know if you require clarification on any matter.
Thanks, but I'd prefer not to prejudice my findings.
Is the scrub area?
I like to star.
I'm afraid you won't be able to do that.
I have permission from the Ministry for a second postmortem.
Dr. Cunningham's credentials have been approved.
You don't understand.
- You won't be able to.
- What possible reason do you have to refuse?
I'm not refusing, I'm just stating a fact.
You won't be able to do a postmortem because there is no body.
We cremated her this morning.
We only received notification of your request one hour ago.
Here are her personal possessions.
The police didn't know where else to send them.
It's standard procedure.
We have very little storage space.
You sent off for toxicology, I presume?
Of course.
I'm expecting the results later today.
We established that Miss Mustafova was indeed pregnant.
Towards the end of her first trimester.
I took full bloods and samples of foetal tissue.
I saw no bruising or defensive wounds.
No evidence of an injury suggesting any struggle.
No suspicious circumstances.
- Doctor, thank you very much.
- Good to meet you.
Come on.
What are you doing?
I was talking to him.
I'm a good pathologist, but I can't perform a postmortem on ashes.
It's not the first time I've had to deal with this bullshit.
Doctors and Police.
Half of them can't be bothered and the other half are lining their pockets.
- Hang on, I'm a doctor.
- In England.
Doctors here make 10,000 Euros a year.
Police even less.
The smart ones take bribes and the stupid ones starve.
- What about the honest ones?
- Yeah.
- Come on.
- Where are you going?
- "Laboratorium".
- You're practically fluent.
See?
You can be charming when you want to be.
Perhaps, but not many people make me want to be.
OK.
Toxicology.
Cocaine in her blood.
Sofi wasn't a regular user.
She hated drug addicts.
She had a friend,
Marina, who was on junk.
- She stopped seeing her.
- OK.
Well I can retest the samples to see if the cocaine usage was long-term, sustained.
Hang on.
Did you know about this?
No.
It can't be.
HIV positive.
You did say she was having unprotected sex.
Her pimp got her tested every two months.
I've got the report.
She was clean three months ago.
She could still have been infected.
The incubation period is up to six months.
They'll use this as evidence of suicide.
Maybe they're right.
Then again, they couldn't sell her any more.
So they threw her away.
Like dumping their garbage.
This is Sofi's medical report.
It's dated three months ago last Friday.
This isn't just an HIV test, this is a full STI screen.
A full blood count, ECG, chest scan.
I know.
I showed it to my father.
He said a medical report like this costs a couple of hundred euros.
This is a business.
They're professional about it.
Who are "they"?
Who runs the girls in this city?
Anyone with the means and the muscle.
It used be the Russians, the Ukrainians.
Now the Kosovans and Albanians have joined in.
This place has always been the crossroads.
Everything comes through here... drugs, contraband, women.
80% of the drugs entering Europe were brought in from Turkey in the back of television sets.
Were?
What, the police caught on?
Flat screen technology.
Christ, she looks young.
Agnes Dedej.
15.
Albanian.e
She came to me a year ago.
She wanted to see the world, or at least get away from her parents.
Her boyfriend said he could bring her to the EU.
Only when she arrives, the boyfriend's dust and she finds she owes 15,000 euros to someone she's never met.
Now she has to work to pay them.
I hadn't heard from her in months then she called me at the office yesterday.
She was upset.
She wanted to meet me at Nepliget bus station.
I waited for her all afternoon.
So now I'm waiting for a postcard.
Or a postmortem.
"Lo es eget", shot and burned.
They shoot them through the face, burn what's left.
Kill one troublemaker and the others will know to be scared.
What about you, trouble?
Do you know when to be scared?
If I was getting anywhere or doing any good, I'd be scared.
I think there's something worth fighting for here.
- We've got a problem.
- What?
You know what I love about this place?
Everyone, anyone comes here.
You know what I hate about it?
That includes my father.
- Oh, Christ, no!
- Harry...
How do I look?
Like a foreigner who's slept with his only child.
English, Papa.
This is Harry Cunningham.
- A very important doctor from London.
- Pleased to meet you, sir.
Are you gay?
Every Englishman I ever met was gay.
Well maybe I, er, just haven't met the right boy.
That's a shame.
I believe you've been using my name in vain.
The lab called me.
Said I'd ordered some results on a dead Romanian woman.
One of yours, I presume?
There's got to be some advantage to the name.
When I was six-years-old,
- I needed a kidney transplant...
- Here we go!
... but Saint Istvan here wouldn't let me jump the queue like the other sick little girls with important daddies.
And when they ask him if he'd give me one of his kidneys...
So what?
I'm quite attached to my kidneys.
I gave life to her once.
It was a great pleasure.
But once is enough, don't you think?
It was a little more complicated than that but
Anna likes the story that way.
It conforms to her image of the aloof father professor.
He professes to be my father.
That's not true.
Most of my time I do my best to deny it.
Now, Dr. Cunningham, let's get you a proper drink and you can tell me why you prefer your patients dead.
It's the Hippocratic Oath.
First rule, do no harm.
That's a shame.
I was hoping you'd hate each other.
He's screwing my only daughter.
Could I hate him more?
Your hair.
What have they done to your lovely hair?
This is the famous view of terrace.
Those damn bells.
Every time I called you, I thought you lived in a convent.
You had something you wanted to talk to me about.
Did I?
- Is it another case?
- No.
It was about me.
You mean there are things about you which I do not know?
Probably.
Maybe not.
I doubt it.
I know everything there is to know about women.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I know that your lung is there.
I know your liver is there.
And your kidney whoever you stole it from... is here.
Your pancreas starts there.
And your heart is there.
Here.
Signed by the artist.
Life makes you laugh, doesn't it?
What do you want, Harry?
If it's just a good time in a different time zone,
- I can understand that.
- Is that what you'd prefer?
I'm asking you a question.
- If you don't want to answer it...
- What do I want?
We barely know each other.
I live in London, you live here.
Will you always live in London?
Do you prefer to live alone?
Are you asking me what I want, or are you telling me what you want?
I was wondering if there's a coalition between them.
Coalition?
Is this a political pact?
You laugh at my English
- because the conversation's too much?
- No.
Grow up, Harry.
What's this about?
Are we having an argument?
I really... don't want to have an argument with you.
I asked you what you wanted.
You're not a child, Harry.
I'm not a child.
We can both be serious in our work.
Why not in our lives?
This is serious too,
- isn't it?
- Maybe.
I don't know yet.
Do you?
So why ask me?
Anna!
Anna?
Anna, I'm sorry.
Anna?
I'm sorry, Anna.
Come on.
Oh, Christ!
Oh, Christ!
Anna, what have you done?
Oh, Christ!
Who are you?
Who are you?
You stay there.
I don't speak Hungarian.
I'm English.
Ambulance.
Um, police.
I'm English!
Ambulance, police.
I don't know the address.
Stay down there!
Stay down.
Help!
Hey!
Hey!
Did you see a man running?
Did you see a man running?
Did you see someone running?
Anywhere?
Anna Sandor has been killed!
He's killed a girl!
Did someone go down there?
Did you see a man?
Police.
Ambulance.
Don't!
Duncan McBurney.
Duncan McBurney, please.
She's dead!
Anna is dead!
- Harry, slow down.
- A man in her...
- I told you a man in her apartment.
- What man?
Who killed her, Harry?
Are you hurt?
Are you OK?
Listen to me, Harry.
Go back to your hotel.
I will meet you there.
I'm not staying in a hotel, you see.
I'm staying with her.
- I'm staying with Anna.
- Where are you, Harry?
Eleonora utca.
I don't know.
I don't...
Ah, good.
At the end of that street there's a stadium.
I'm coming to get you.
Don't talk to anybody.
Do you hear me?
Wait for me there.
I'll be 30 minutes.
Less.
Jo napot.
Hello?
Deutsch?
Italiano?
Ma, ma, ma.
No?
Euro, foreign?
- No money.
- No, no money.
English?
American?
Dollar?
- OK.
Cigarette, ciggie, sandwich?
- Nothing.
Hey!
I don't have money, I don't have any cigarettes.
Just stay away from me.
Are you looking for me?
Did McBurney send you?
Go, go, go!
Come on!
Why did you run?
Who are they?
Why did you run?
Who are they?
Do you speak English?
No, no English.
Ruski, Romana, Deutsch.
English, no.
Warum hast du gelauft?
Warum hast du gelauft?
Polizei.
Mafia.
Alles zusammen.
Together.
- Danke.
Danke.
- Danke?
- Foreign dollar.
- OK.
Here.
Hey, hey!
Here.
Please, British Embassy.
British.
Thank you.
Was ist du?
Was ist du?
Was machst du?
I'm a doctor.
- Doctor?
- Ich bin doctor.
Good luck, Doctor.
Janos.
Meine freundin.
They killed her.
Who are they?
Please?
Go home, Doctor.
Go home.
- Harry?
- Anna is dead.
- What?
- She was murdered and I was there and I saw the guy...
Hang on, Harry.
Start again.
She was mixed up in something.
I don't know what.
Something to do with these criminal gangs and tattoos.
What are you talking about?
What guy?
It doesn't matter.
I ran and they might think I did it.
Harry, go straight to the police.
Explain everything to them and I'll be on a plane first thing.
All right?
I called the Embassy, I'm about to go there now.
Good.
Call me we you've spoke to them, yeah?
Harry?
Harry?
- What the hell are you doing...?
- Same.
Same.
Same police.
What are you talking about?
Same.
Same police.
Von der Brucke.
No, no, no, no.
No, no.
No police.
Polizei.
Mafia.
There must be someone I can trust.
There must be!
Trust?
Trust auf Gott.
Komm.
You've heard nothing from him since then?
I think he have must been attacked.
He would've been in touch, made contact somehow.
I mean he's not stupid.
We've checked the hospitals.
The trouble is, the police think he did it.
He was covered in her blood, he had the knife, he ran.
He didn't seem like that kind of guy.
He isn't.
Jesus.
Anna Sandor stepped on a lot of toes.
Harry didn't kill her.
We've got people looking for him.
- What about the police?
- Well, there are police and there are "police".
It's good that you're here.
The more people asking about Harry, the harder it is for him to disappear.
Sandor, Anna...
Excuse me.
Do you speak English?
I speak English.
I'm so sorry.
You knew her?
You might say.
She's my daughter.
And who are you?
Professor Leo Dalton.
My colleague...
Liver, lungs, kidney...
Your colleague drew on my daughter's body with a pen,
like a surgeon before an operation.
Then he cut her.
Like a butcher!
Professor Dalton, you have to leave now.
Why?
Who are you?
Detective Tibor Orban, National Investigators Office.
I've taken over the Anna Sandor case.
I don't mean to be rude, detective, but if I'm not able to observe the PM, I should like to know why.
Please.
In the circumstances, I think a second independent postmortem will have to be carried out.
You're his colleague.
His friend.
What makes you independent?
We're being premature here, I think.
Nobody has been charged.
I've heard many wonderful things about your daughter, Professor Sandor.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Where is he, Professor?
I don't know.
Do you think I'd be standing here if I did?
Possibly.
You might have thought that we were following you.
Are you?
Why don't I make it easy for you?
Let's assume that you're returning to the murder scene...
Why would we assume that?
You found out something in there, something that changes things, and you want to go back to understand it.
I think you're that kind of detective.
The neighbour upstairs reported hearing an argument in English.
A few minutes later, Dr. Cunningham ran out, he had blood on his shirt and he was carrying a knife.
To me, it seems personal.
Angry.
Reactive.
I know what it seems.
I'd think the same thing.
You mean if you didn't know him?
That's the reason you agreed to let me come along with you?
- On the off chance it would make me doubt him.
- I knew Anna Sandor.
She drove me crazy.
Everything was a conspiracy against minorities, against... against women, against her.
A woman with a cause can be a very tedious thing.
Harry said he saw a man.
He said he had tattoos, gang tattoos.
It wasn't a gang killing.
They like people to know that they were there.
Often the victim is disfigured, teeth are smashed and the body is burned.
"Lo es eget".
Shoot and burn.
Anna worked with people who were being trafficked.
Perhaps whoever killed her was trying to retrieve a document,
- witness statements.
- No evidence of theft.
Harry disturbed the assailant before he finished.
- Then we'd have two bodies.
- Or what looking here was a struggle.
A man trying to escape, a man trying to stop him.
You don't know what to make of it.
You've got a suspect, you've got a murder weapon.
You've got no motive.
Passion, sex, deceit, rejection.
Why did Dr. Cunningham come to Budapest?
You know why.
He came to do a postmortem on Sofi Mustafova, except you'd cremated her before he had a chance.
He had another reason to be here.
What did you find?
Was she sick?
Was she ill?
What?
Anna Sandor was pregnant.
About eight weeks.
- You didn't know that?
- I don't think he knew!
Anna Sandor was at a conference in Amsterdam two months ago and your friend was also there.
You're telling me it was Harry's child?
!
God!
Harry?
Harry?
It's a beautiful day.
Come on, let's go and have some breakfast.
We should swim.
It's hot.
Your forehead's burning.
I thought...
- You're OK?
- Of course.
I'm sorry we fought.
It was my fault.
What time is it?
Mittag.
Twelve.
It's quiet.
Sunday.
I give you.
Make you sleep.
Yeah.
You made me sleep all right.
I feel like shit.
I can't find my wallet.
Where...?
Wir mussen gehen.
Polizei.
Police looking for you.
Komm.
Komm, komm, komm, komm.
Janos, what were you before?
Polizei?
Informer?
For the Communists?
Is that it?
I'm sorry.
What?
I am Kommunist.
Die Welt.
The world, it turns.
Das war mein haus.
My friends.
My life.
Alles ended.
- '89.
- '89?
Wife, family?
Sorry.
I get some money.
No, no!
Kein bank.
Kein phone.
Kein Metro.
OK.
OK!
Janos...
Leo, what's going on?
Where is he?
I don't know.
They don't know.
- Oh, God!
- Listen,
I need you to courier his DNA samples to me.
To match against the crime scene?
They really think he did this?
How co-operative do you want to be, Leo?
This thing with Anna and him?
- How serious was it?
- I don't know.
They only met a couple of months ago.
About as serious as Harry normally is?
Maybe more.
- Why are you asking me this?
- Anna was eight weeks pregnant.
Did he know?
I hope not.
Nikki we'll find him.
We will find him.
Komm.
Komm, komm!
Komm, komm!
Sofi Mustafova.
Wo ist sie?
- Dead.
- Dead?
Tod.
She's dead.
Are you sure you want to add her contraceptive pills to your little medicine chest?
- Pretty woman, huh?
- Yeah.
She is prostitute?
What's in there?
Is there an address for her?
Strasse?
- Utca?
Utca?
- Utca.
Bar.
Club.
Work.
What bar?
Bar.
Angels Bar.
Aygtalok.
- Aygtalok.
- Aygtalok.
Prostitute bar.
Hey.
I don't speak Hungarian.
- I'm a tourist.
- Entrance that way.
- I've finished work.
- Listen, I was here before and, er...
- I met a girl I like.
- Lot of girls here.
This is a Romanian girl, I think.
Sofi something?
Do you know her?
- Ciao, Marina.
- Ciao.
Marina?
It's a nice name.
What's your name?
Leo.
Di Caprio.
Leonardo.
Yeah.
Listen Marina,
I think I know someone who knows you.
Anna Sandor.
Do you know her?
She sent me.
She wants to talk to you.
Would that be OK?
I can pay you for your time.
What's the problem, boys?
I've got money.
How many of your little girls do I get for that, huh?
Fair enough.
Janos, who are those guys... at the club?
Sofi's pimps.
- The mafia... who are they?
- No, no, no...
Listen to me.
Listen, listen!
Anna, the girl who died, OK.
It was my fault!
We had an argument.
I should have been there.
Do you understand me?
I should have been there.
I lost her... like your family.
I lost her.
Please?
Who are they?
- Serbo.
- OK.
Albanian.
Roma.
Kosovar.
Angyalok.
Ukrainisch.
The Wolves, the tattoo.
The Wolves... that gang is Ukrainian, yes?
No, no, no...
- I'm going to make a phone call.
- No!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
It's coins.
Coins.
Pay phone.
No trace.
- Yes.
I already have a mother.
- No, no!
Sorry, Mr. Dalton.
Still no message.
Thanks.
You have no new messages in your mailbox.
Leo, it's me.
I can't use my mobile.
You shouldn't be using yours.
Listen, I know who killed Anna.
I know who they are.
I want you to meet me at the ferry station,
Pier Seven at 11 tonight.
Please come on your own.
Shit!
Will you be OK, Janos?
Here.
Take.
Yours.
I stole it from a charity.
I'll pay them back when I get home.
Maybe you'll come to London?
Yes, you my guest.
Yes, I insist.
London.
You believed in something, didn't you, Janos?
You were wrong, weren't you?
And now you're here.
Do you want to hear something crazy?
Yesterday, just for a minute, I thought I would stay here.
Anna believed in something.
I thought maybe I could believe in something, too.
In her.
People believe in stuff, don't they?
The people I work with... they believe in things.
I used to make fun of them for it.
# Common people #
I'm the sceptic, I guess.
# Common people like you!
#
You're not listening to a word I'm saying, are you?
Yeah, go on, Jarvis!
Sing your heart out.
Come on!
# ..
Climb the wall
# If you called your dad He could end it all
# You'll never live like common people
# You'll never do whatever common people do
# You'll never live like common people
# You'll never watch your life slide out of view
# And dance and drink and screw... #
Careful, mate.
Janos?
Nikki, it's me.
When?
Harry!
HELP!
HELP ME!
HELP!
HELP ME!
I'm sorry, Professor Dalton.
I'm sorry, but I'm going to need that.
Shot in the head.
Executed.
Did you know him?
How did they find out, the police?
How did they get here so fast?
Not fast enough.
We knew he'd contact you.
Your cell phone.
The hotel phone.
That phone kiosk outside your hotel.
And... the people who killed Harry.
How did they know where to find him?
They were following him.
- We were too slow.
- They didn't follow him.
They knew where to find him.
The police.
You!
You're upset, Professor Dalton.
- You!
- You and your friend were playing games, but you didn't play very good.
You used that phone.
Go home, old man.
The body has been identified as that of Harry Cunningham.
They're going to get away with this, aren't they?
There are people who care.
Laszlo Voros.
Tell me what's going to happen.
Nothing!
I will still be a policeman and your friend will still be dead.
- What?
- They're watching us!
It proves that they knew it.
It gives them motive to kill her.
What do you want from me?
What are these guys paying you to leave them alone?
They're clearing up, aren't they?
They're really clearing up anyone who knows.

Ladies, I'd like to introduce you to Giles.
As you can see, he's a real peach.
He's quick to learn and eager to please.
He doesn't get tired, and he goes off like a firecracker.

Gonna be a good girl?
Give me your hand.
Oh, that's better.
Now, what's a sweet face like you doing hawking your fork?
I'm broke.
That's not what I'm paying you for.
Come on.
Now, what's a sweet thing like you doing on the streets?
I love sex.
Yes.
Um, I'm a slut.
I just can't get enough.

You're all the same.

The prick made me suck him off then arrested me anyway.
Ligurian arrested me.
His kid had just been born.
Does he know?
I'm meeting him for dinner.
Don't you tell him, Holly.
He'll stop you if he finds out.
I can't just disappear.
Forget the past.
In Paris, it'll be all future.
To the end.
To the beginning.
clink!
Show it to me.
First class.
I'm proud of you, Holly.
A little something to help you stay retired.
Happy birthday.
I don't know what to say.
Say a prayer for me in that hunchback's church.
I never thanked you.
What for?
Giving me a chance.
Why did you pick me?
I needed a blonde.
You looked tough.
You looked like a survivor.
I wasn't wrong.
Be careful, Holly.
Don't forget what he is.
Say something to me in French.
[speaks French]
Don't say what it means.
What are you after?
A hand job would be good.
50, up front.
[horns honking]

I'm Cindy.
Buy me a soft serve, Shay?
I'll pay you back.
Okay.

Don't flash your money around.
There's a lot of eyes, and they're always watching.
You must be starving, eh?
You want some?
This'll fill me up.
I'm a real sweet tooth.
Haven't seen you around here before.
I just got here.
[coughing]
Can you lend me a dollar?
I'll pay you back.
I can get a smoke for a dollar.
You're a real friend.
Don't keep your cash in your pocket either.
Happy birthday, Holly.
Come here.
Ever felt like running away?
Ever felt like changing your life?
What's your dream, Holly?
If you could do anything, go anywhere, what would it be?
Before my mum died, she took me to Paris.
That's what I remember about her.
She was happy.
I've always wanted to go back.
Let's do it.
Let's go to Paris.
I'm getting out.
I'm gonna disappear, and I want you to come with me.
Money won't be a problem.
What about your family?
I don't love them.

Bye.
Um, well I'm swinging by yours, like, in two minutes.

No, it's all right.
Okay, bye.
Hey, Monique, it's Holly.

It's good money.
Come on, Mon, you're my last hope.
Yeah, thanks anyway.
Dramas?
It's the night for it.
Full moon.
Everyone's a little crazy.
Great.
Maybe I can help.
Can you find me a brunette who can fuck and suck?
Look out!
Fuckin' asshole!
Why don't you watch where you're going?
You could've fuckin' killed me!
You fuckin' idiot!
She's perfect.
Wait up.
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Fuck off!
Want a job?
I said piss off, lady.
Don't you understand English?
I need a girl right now, and you're perfect.
Threesome at the Hyatt.
Couple of hours, tops.
It's 300.
When was the last time you made that much?
[sighs]
Nothing weird?
Nothing weird.
Just one bloke?
Just me and the guy.
$400.
Wait.
I need the money.
Just give me a chance.

[ethereal music]
[belches]
Better out than in.
Present company excepted.
You like that?
[hip-hop music playing]
When I fuck you, when I make you come,
I know it's all an act, an illusion.
It doesn't matter.
I want the illusion.
That's what I'm paying for.
Just for an hour, I've got the biggest dick... [laughs]
The magic touch.
I can make you come in under a minute.
Prove it.
[moaning]
[moaning]
Oh, yeah.
[shouts]
Mm.
[phone ringing]
Yeah?
No, no.
You're early.
No problem.
Come up.
Fuck!
I got business.
Get in the bathroom and shut up.
Take your clothes.
Come on, move!
Move!
[hip-hop music playing]
[knocking at door]
Hello, Willie.
Lovely night for it.
Yes, top night, Mr. Bennett.
Things went great, I'm happy to say.
Fine.
[music stops]
Well, come on.
Make me happy.
They loved the gear.
You too?
Did you love it too?
Yeah.
I had a taste, Mr. Bennett.
I'm not gonna deny it.
Of course you did, Willie.
Yeah.
A good salesman's got to know his product.
Here.
You better count that.
[sighs] [belches]
Do you like bowling, Willie?
Dunno.
Why?
[gunshots]
Because now you're a bowling ball.
[elevator dings]
Drive!
You've rung Holly.
I'm tied up right now, but if you leave your name and number, I'll call you back to arrange an appointment.
Gotcha.
[gasping]
Fuck.
Fuck.
Calm down.
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Shh.
- He shot him in the head!
- Shut up!
I saw it!
I saw it!
Just calm down, all right?
All right?
[sobbing]
Oh, shit.
What the fuck are you looking at?
Where to?
Just drive.
He knew we were there.
He didn't see us.
How do you know?
You're safe.
Oh, fuck.
Stop.
Stop!
You don't know me.
I don't know you.
Hey.
Wait!
Where to?
Where can I take you?
Look, give me a destination or get out.
You all right?
Everyone's crazy tonight.
[soft rattling]
What's that?
Don't worry.
Shh.
Can't leave him at home.
He's part of my act.
Look, can I take you somewhere?
I'm hungry.
How about your favorite restaurant?
Vegas is the place for any serious magician.
My old man used to say that if you conquer Vegas, the world will follow.
If you could work at any casino, which one would it be?
Caesar's.
How come?
It's the coolest.
And he played there once on the same bill as Tom Jones.
Who?
Tom Jones?
The singer.
Forget it.
Your Dad sounds cool.
Yeah, he was.
I used to watch his shows over and over.
My dad was magic too.
He disappeared when I was born.
[both laugh]
What, you never saw him?
I got a stepdad.
Aren't you cold?
I left my coat at the hotel.
Here.
So what did you want to be when you grew up?
I never had a dream or anything.
Not like you.
Maybe I could be your...
Your lovely assistant.
Hello, Holly.
I'm Willie's friend.
You going somewhere?
Where's your friend?
Willie was a greedy turd.
He always got a double act.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That was foreplay.
Do you want to fuck with me?
Your friend with the pink lipstick.
She was from the street.
I don't know her name.
Wrong answer.
[screaming]
[gasping]
[distorted audio] [light jangling]
Look into my eyes and listen to the sound of my voice.
There is nothing but the sound of my voice and my eyes.
I will count backwards from five.
When I reach one, you will be under my spell.
Five.
I want you to completely free your mind.
Four.
All tension flows from your body.
Three.
You feel totally relaxed.
Two.
You're light as a feather.
One.
A deep sleep envelopes you.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Tell me your name.
Shay Maree Ryan.
How old are you, Shay?
17.
Tell me something about yourself.
I never forget a face.
Where are you from?
Up north.
Why are you here?
Mum died, so I ran away.
Sorry.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No.
[laughs]
Look at me.
You're beautiful.
Don't.
[phone chimes]
Can I see you again?
Do you want to see me or see me?
I want to see you.
"Harry the Impossible."
Will you call?
I don't just hypnotize anyone, you know.
It wouldn't work out.
How do you know if you don't take a chance?
What's in the bag, bitch?
Hand it over, and you won't get hurt.
You're the one'll get hurt.
Aww teach her some manners, Rock.
I'll teach her some fuckin' manners, all right.
Oh, fuck!
My fuckin' eyes!
[shouting] [screaming]
My fucking head!
You bitch!
[engine revving]
I fuckin' hate you people.
Open your mouth!
Open your mouth!
[wolf whistle]
[loud electronic music playing]
I want a room.
$25 the half, $30 the hour.
Five bucks for the towel.
No, for the...
for the night.
80 bucks for the night.
Room three, first floor, end of the corridor.
Thanks.
[music pounding in distance]
[woman moaning]
Whoo, oh, my God!
[shouting]
[screaming in distance]
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, Mum.
Don't you ever be afraid to take a chance, Shay, you know?
[groans]
We're looking for your friend.
I don't know her.
Yeah, but you know what she looks like, though, don't you?
Huh?
Don't ya?
No.
Ah!
Don't you?
Stop, stop.
[screams]
All right.
All right!
She didn't see you.
She can't hurt you.
You can't trust women.
Shit just fuckin' flies out of their mouth without them even thinking.
It's biological.
It's because they got a cunt hidden away.
It's natural they're gonna be hiding something.
With a bloke, it's all just there, isn't it?
What you see is what you get.
But women are fuckin' liars.
I fuckin' hate women.
Start looking.
[moaning]
[knocking at door]
Where's Rose?
Don't know.
Who are you?
I heard you from next door.
Have you got anything?
No.
Got a smoke?
Sorry.
Fuck.
What time is it?
It's late.
Where the fuck is she?
I'll get you some water.
Okay?
Sweet.
Here I am, baby.
Who the fuck are you?
She's the girl from next door.
Well, she can fuck off, because we're fuckin' busy.
I was just seeing if your friend was all right.
He's not my friend.
Hurry.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on!
Half.
Half.
Half!
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck.
The back of your hand.
Shut up, bitch!
Shut up.
Fuck!
[sighs]
Ooh.
You got any money?
No.
Bullshit.
Cutie like you.
Come on.
Give us some money.
I don't have any.
Fuck you.
[knocking at next door]
Hey, open the fucking door.
Come on, sweetheart.
Open the fucking door.
The welcome wagon.
Cunts.
That's the way it is.
They fucked me.
Now it's your turn.
[men shouting in hallway]
I could tell 'em you're here.
They'd pay me for it.
[footsteps retreating]
Thanks.
Get fucked.
Hey.
Pink lipstick.
Run!
[chaotic dance music]
Gotcha.
[tires screeching]
Get in!
[engine revs] [screams]
Are you all right?
[sighs]
What did he do to you?
[indistinct radio chatter]
Police radio.
What?
He's a cop.
Fuck.
You should go home.
I can't.
Somewhere else, then.
There's nowhere else.
I could stay with you.
I'm going to the airport to get on a plane out of here.
That guy'll come after me.
I offered you a job.
No one forced you.
You don't give a shit.
I just saved you.
I don't owe you anything.
[sobbing]
You can have the car.
I can't drive.
Get out.
Get out!
Get out!
[engine revs]
[melancholy music]
[horns honking]
[retching]
Hey.
Fuck off!
It's Shay.
Fully didn't recognize you.
Where you going?
Nowhere.
Can I come?
I saw a guy get killed.
You okay?
I think someone's after me.
Who's lookin' out for you?
Rocky will help.
He looks after me.
He'll love you.
Yeah.
I'll go get him.
Lend me some ciggie money?
I'll pay you back.
You're a real friend.
Don't move.
Get in.
I'm waiting for someone.
Shay, get in.
I met my first trick on this street.
I was so scared.
This big old man.
I thought he was gonna have a heart attack on me.
I promised myself, before I turned 30, I'd quit, move to Paris, reinvent myself.
It's my birthday today.
I've been fucking for money since I was 15.
I want a new life.
There's this guy.
He doesn't know that I'm leaving, and I don't want him to.
He can help us.
Who is he?
He's a cop.
[harsh electronic music]
[knocking on door]
Don't worry, ladies.
Safe as houses here.
Take a load off.
This is Bob's place.
No secrets between him and me.
Except where the bodies are buried.
[cackling]
Good one.
- Who's this?
- Shay.
We were on the job together.
You see what happened?
- He shot him in the head.
- Who shot him?
A cop named Bennett.
He tried to kill us.
He's after us, Michael.
Where'd you park his car darlin'?
We didn't say anything about a car.
[clattering]
Gotcha.
[laughing]
Mate, you got more bruises than a Queensland banana.
[laughing]
I reckon your nose looks better on this side.
[laughing]
Fonzie got busted!
[laughing] [muffled struggling]
Laugh now, you fuckin' dog!
Where's my car, cunt?
Settle down.
Get out of my way.
You made enough mistakes tonight.
Fuckin' settle down.
Look at my suit.
That bitch broke my fuckin' nose.
- You can have the girl.
- What do you care?
Holly's mine.
Oh, mate.
She's a fuckin' whore.
She's pissing off.
Her place was empty.
She's coming with me.
No, no, look at her bag.
I saw the ticket.
Whores only love money.
Everything else is an act.
[grunting]
[gunshot]
Back to the car.
He was lying, Michael.
I remember the first time I saw you.
I arrested you just so I could hear your voice.
I'm gonna believe you, Holly.
We're rich enough to disappear.
What about Shay?
It's just you and me now.
She's my friend.
It's just you and me now.
Look in my eyes and say yes.
No.
I can't.
Tell me it wasn't all an act.
[loud bang]
Police!
Police!
Get in the car.
Get in the car!
Move!
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!
Drop the fucking gun!
Drive, or I'll fucking kill you!
Come on!
Step on the fucking peddle.
Come on!
[tires squealing] [distorted audio]
Faster!
[screams] [distorted audio]
Come on!
Come on!
[distorted audio]
Come on!
Faster!
[silence]
Holly.
Okay.
Holly.
[siren wailing in distance]
The case.
[siren wailing in distance] [sirens wailing]
[sirens wailing in distance]
It's just a scratch.
You're still beautiful.
What time's your flight?
I'll never make it now.
You've got to try.
I'll call Harry.
Who?
The taxi driver.
He's also an escape artist.
[coughs]
- It's ringing.
- [coughs]
Oh my God.
Holly?
[gasps]
Holly, lie down.
Lie down.
Just lie down.
Tenir moi.
[distant sirens wailing]
Holly?
Holly?
[sobbing] Somebody help me!
Help me!
Somebody help me!
Help me!
[droning tone]
[foreboding ambient music]
[waves crashing]
[bird squawking]
I usually pull him out of a hat.
You like me, don't you?
Yeah.
I want you to make me disappear.
[waves crashing]
[soft melancholy music]
[woman singing in French]
[music builds]
[woman singing in French]
Un coup du champagne si vous plait.
Garcon, e cafe si vous plait.
T'as destres beaux yeux, je peu t'acheter un verre?
Bonjour, Giles.
Ca va?
You're late.
Ca va bien, merci.
So how's my girl?
Serviced and ready to go.
Papers are in the glove box.
I got you something.
Just a little bon voyage.
You open it.
So you don't get lost.
Maybe I want to.
I'll miss you, Holly.
Come here.
Ladies, I'd like to introduce you to Giles.
As you can see, he's a real peach.
He's quick to learn and eager to please.
He doesn't get tired, and he goes off like a firecracker.
What more could a girl want?
You looking for a lay?
Oi.
You shopping?
How much?
What are you after, handsome?
A handjob.
How much?
50?
Without a condom, and dirty talk.
Well, don't just sit there.
Don't you have any lube?
What?
Lube.
KY.
Um...
- Out.
- What?
I'm not paying top dollar for amateur hour.
I'll be good.
I promise.
Fuck that.
You can do anything.
20 bucks.
Show me your tits.
Gonna be a good girl?
Give me your hand.
Oh, that's better.
Now, what's a sweet face like you doing hawking your fork?
I'm broke.
That's not what I'm paying you for.
Come on.
Now, what's a sweet thing like you doing on the streets?
I love sex.
Yes.
Um, I'm a slut.
I just can't get enough.
Yeah, you fucking whore.
You're all the same.
Oh, baby, I can feel you getting hot.
That's better.
How old are you?
17.
You like us young?
Young and tight.
Come on, dirtier.
Ah, my tight, young pussy's aching for your big juicy cock.
Take it, you bitch.
Make me beg.
I'll teach you.
Teach me a lesson.
Oh, you fucking whore.
Oh, make me scream.
Come on, come on.
That's better.
That's better.
Yes.
Harder!
No!
Where did you get this?
Freedom of Information.
Got mine as well.
Look at you.
The prick made me suck him off then arrested me anyway.
Ligurian arrested me.
His kid had just been born.
Does he know?
I'm meeting him for dinner.
Don't you tell him, Holly.
He'll stop you if he finds out.
I can't just disappear.
Forget the past.
In Paris, it'll be all future.
To the end.
To the beginning.
clink!
Show it to me.
First class.
I'm proud of you, Holly.
A little something to help you stay retired.
Happy birthday.
I don't know what to say.
Say a prayer for me in that hunchback's church.
I never thanked you.
What for?
Giving me a chance.
Why did you pick me?
I needed a blonde.
You looked tough.
You looked like a survivor.
I wasn't wrong.
Be careful, Holly.
Don't forget what he is.
Say something to me in French.
Don't say what it means.
What are you after?
A hand job would be good.
50, up front.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Got a spare ciggie?
Don't smoke.
Nobody smokes anymore.
It's feral, eh?
Stunts your growth.
Puts you in an early grave.
What's your name?
Shay.
I'm Cindy.
Buy me a soft serve, Shay?
I'll pay you back.
Okay.
Can I get a soft serve, small fries, and a Coke?
Don't flash your money around.
There's a lot of eyes, and they're always watching.
You must be starving, eh?
You want some?
This'll fill me up.
I'm a real sweet tooth.
Haven't seen you around here before.
I just got here.
Can you lend me a dollar?
I'll pay you back.
I can get a smoke for a dollar.
You're a real friend.
Don't keep your cash in your pocket either.
Happy birthday, Holly.
Come here.
Ever felt like running away?
Ever felt like changing your life?
What's your dream, Holly?
If you could do anything, go anywhere, what would it be?
Before my mum died, she took me to Paris.
That's what I remember about her.
She was happy.
I've always wanted to go back.
Let's do it.
Let's go to Paris.
I'm getting out.
I'm gonna disappear, and I want you to come with me.
Money won't be a problem.
What about your family?
I don't love them.
Open it.
Put it on.
You have to.
It's bad luck otherwise.
What?
Let's go.
Sorry.
It's all right.
Look me in the eyes and say that.
It's all right, Michael.
Pack your bags.
Tomorrow I'll be rich enough to set us free.
Monkey, be quiet.
Fuck.
I'll give you the group discount.
100 a hole, 50 a hand, that's 350.
That's right boys.
It's real too.
Fuck.
Rocky.
Rock.
I got her.
You fuckin' tryin' to avoid me?
No.
What the fuck you runnin' from, then?
You fuckin' scrote.
Where's my money?
I seen her, Rock, stealing' Karlene's trade.
It's my stretch, you fuckin' slut.
No, no, no, I wasn't.
That's fuckin' bullshit!
Shut up, Karlene.
Thinks she's so fuckin' good.
Do somethin'.
Do somethin'!
- Give us the money.
- I don't have any.
What the fuck did you say?
I spent it.
See that?
See fuckin' that?
Fuckin' lying bitch.
Listen, you fuckin' slut.
Next time, it's a hot shot.
Stay off our fuckin' street, or you're dead, cunt.
You fuckin' bitch.
Bel, hey, it's Holly.
Hi, are you working?
Yeah, now.
No, no, no, just a couple of hours.
Okay.
Yeah, no, that's fine.
Bye.
Um, well I'm swinging by yours, like, in two minutes.
I can come get you.
It's good money.
Yeah, no, that's not gonna help me, so...
No, it's all right.
Okay, bye.
Hey, Monique, it's Holly.
You working?
It's good money.
Come on, Mon, you're my last hope.
Yeah, thanks anyway.
Dramas?
It's the night for it.
Full moon.
Everyone's a little crazy.
Great.
Maybe I can help.
Can you find me a brunette who can fuck and suck?
Look out!
Fuckin' asshole!
Why don't you watch where you're going?
You could've fuckin' killed me!
You fuckin' idiot!
She's perfect.
Wait up.
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Fuck off!
Want a job?
I said piss off, lady.
Don't you understand English?
I need a girl right now, and you're perfect.
Threesome at the Hyatt.
Couple of hours, tops.
It's 300.
When was the last time you made that much?
Nothing weird?
Nothing weird.
Just one bloke?
Just me and the guy.
$400.
Wait.
I need the money.
Just give me a chance.
How old are you?
19.
Don't bullshit me.
17.
You got anything else to wear?
Just this.
Put it on.
What's your name?
Shay.
It's $300, Shay.
Okay.
I'm Holly.
Let's go.
You okay?
Yeah.
Nervous?
No.
Just follow my lead, okay?
Better out than in.
Present company excepted.
You like that?
When I fuck you, when I make you come,
I know it's all an act, an illusion.
It doesn't matter.
I want the illusion.
That's what I'm paying for.
Just for an hour, I've got the biggest dick...
The magic touch.
I can make you come in under a minute.
Prove it.
Oh, yeah.
Mm.
Yeah?
No, no.
You're early.
No problem.
Come up.
Fuck!
I got business.
Get in the bathroom and shut up.
Take your clothes.
Come on, move!
Move!
Hello, Willie.
Lovely night for it.
Yes, top night, Mr. Bennett.
Things went great, I'm happy to say.
Fine.
Well, come on.
Make me happy.
They loved the gear.
You too?
Did you love it too?
Yeah.
I had a taste, Mr. Bennett.
I'm not gonna deny it.
Of course you did, Willie.
Yeah.
A good salesman's got to know his product.
Here.
You better count that.
Do you like bowling, Willie?
Dunno.
Why?
Because now you're a bowling ball.
Drive!
You've rung Holly.
I'm tied up right now, but if you leave your name and number, I'll call you back to arrange an appointment.
Gotcha.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Calm down.
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Shh.
- He shot him in the head!
- Shut up!
I saw it!
I saw it!
Just calm down, all right?
All right?
Oh, shit.
What the fuck are you looking at?
Where to?
Just drive.
He knew we were there.
He didn't see us.
How do you know?
You're safe.
Oh, fuck.
Stop.
Stop!
You don't know me.
I don't know you.
Hey.
Wait!
Where to?
Where can I take you?
Look, give me a destination or get out.
You all right?
Everyone's crazy tonight.
What's that?
Don't worry.
Shh.
Can't leave him at home.
He's part of my act.
Look, can I take you somewhere?
I'm hungry.
How about your favorite restaurant?
Vegas is the place for any serious magician.
My old man used to say that if you conquer Vegas, the world will follow.
If you could work at any casino, which one would it be?
Caesar's.
How come?
It's the coolest.
And he played there once on the same bill as Tom Jones.
Who?
Tom Jones?
The singer.
Forget it.
Your Dad sounds cool.
Yeah, he was.
I used to watch his shows over and over.
My dad was magic too.
He disappeared when I was born.
What, you never saw him?
I got a stepdad.
Aren't you cold?
I left my coat at the hotel.
Here.
So what did you want to be when you grew up?
I never had a dream or anything.
Not like you.
Maybe I could be your...
Your lovely assistant.
Hello, Holly.
I'm Willie's friend.
You going somewhere?
Where's your friend?
Willie was a greedy turd.
He always got a double act.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That was foreplay.
Do you want to fuck with me?
Your friend with the pink lipstick.
She was from the street.
I don't know her name.
Wrong answer.
Look into my eyes and listen to the sound of my voice.
There is nothing but the sound of my voice and my eyes.
I will count backwards from five.
When I reach one, you will be under my spell.
Five.
I want you to completely free your mind.
Four.
All tension flows from your body.
Three.
You feel totally relaxed.
Two.
You're light as a feather.
One.
A deep sleep envelopes you.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Tell me your name.
Shay Maree Ryan.
How old are you, Shay?
17.
Tell me something about yourself.
I never forget a face.
Where are you from?
Up north.
Why are you here?
Mum died, so I ran away.
Sorry.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No.
Look at me.
You're beautiful.
Don't.
Can I see you again?
Do you want to see me or see me?
I want to see you.
"Harry the Impossible."
Will you call?
I don't just hypnotize anyone, you know.
It wouldn't work out.
How do you know if you don't take a chance?
What's in the bag, bitch?
Hand it over, and you won't get hurt.
You're the one'll get hurt.
Aww teach her some manners, Rock.
I'll teach her some fuckin' manners, all right.
Oh, fuck!
My fuckin' eyes!
My fucking head!
You bitch!
I fuckin' hate you people.
Open your mouth!
Open your mouth!
I want a room.
$25 the half, $30 the hour.
Five bucks for the towel.
No, for the...
for the night.
80 bucks for the night.
Room three, first floor, end of the corridor.
Thanks.
Whoo, oh, my God!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, Mum.
Don't you ever be afraid to take a chance, Shay, you know?
We're looking for your friend.
I don't know her.
Yeah, but you know what she looks like, though, don't you?
Huh?
Don't ya?
No.
Ah!
Don't you?
Stop, stop.
All right.
All right!
She didn't see you.
She can't hurt you.
You can't trust women.
Shit just fuckin' flies out of their mouth without them even thinking.

She's the girl from next door.
Well, she can fuck off, because we're fuckin' busy.
I was just seeing if your friend was all right.
He's not my friend.
Hurry.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on!

Fuck.

The back of your hand.
Shut up, bitch!

Ooh.

Bullshit.
Cutie like you.

Give us some money.
I don't have any.
Fuck you.
Hey, open the fucking door.
Come on, sweetheart.
Open the fucking door.
The welcome wagon.
Cunts.
That's the way it is.
They fucked me.
Now it's your turn.
I could tell 'em you're here.
They'd pay me for it.

Get fucked.
Hey.
Pink lipstick.
Run!
Gotcha.

- What?
I'm not paying top dollar for amateur hour.
I'll be good.
I promise.
Fuck that.
You can do anything.
20 bucks.
Show me your tits.
Gonna be a good girl?
Give me your hand.
Oh, that's better.
Now, what's a sweet face like you doing hawking your fork?
I'm broke.
That's not what I'm paying you for.
Come on.
Now, what's a sweet thing like you doing on the streets?
I love sex.
Yes.
Um, I'm a slut.
I just can't get enough.
Yeah, you fucking whore.
You're all the same.
Oh, baby, I can feel you getting hot.
That's better.
How old are you?
17.
You like us young?
Young and tight.
Come on, dirtier.
Ah, my tight, young pussy's aching for your big juicy cock.
Take it, you bitch.
Make me beg.
I'll teach you.
Teach me a lesson.
Oh, you fucking whore.
Oh, make me scream.
Come on, come on.
That's better.
That's better.
Yes.
Harder!
No!
Where did you get this?
Freedom of Information.
Got mine as well.
Look at you.
The prick made me suck him off then arrested me anyway.
Ligurian arrested me.
His kid had just been born.
Does he know?
I'm meeting him for dinner.
Don't you tell him, Holly.
He'll stop you if he finds out.
I can't just disappear.
Forget the past.
In Paris, it'll be all future.
To the end.
To the beginning.
clink!
Show it to me.
First class.
I'm proud of you, Holly.
A little something to help you stay retired.
Happy birthday.
I don't know what to say.
Say a prayer for me in that hunchback's church.
I never thanked you.
What for?
Giving me a chance.
Why did you pick me?
I needed a blonde.
You looked tough.
You looked like a survivor.
I wasn't wrong.
Be careful, Holly.
Don't forget what he is.
Say something to me in French.
Don't say what it means.
What are you after?
A hand job would be good.
50, up front.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Got a spare ciggie?
Don't smoke.
Nobody smokes anymore.
It's feral, eh?
Stunts your growth.
Puts you in an early grave.
What's your name?
Shay.
I'm Cindy.
Buy me a soft serve, Shay?
I'll pay you back.
Okay.
Can I get a soft serve, small fries, and a Coke?
Don't flash your money around.
There's a lot of eyes, and they're always watching.
You must be starving, eh?
You want some?
This'll fill me up.
I'm a real sweet tooth.
Haven't seen you around here before.
I just got here.
Can you lend me a dollar?
I'll pay you back.
I can get a smoke for a dollar.
You're a real friend.
Don't keep your cash in your pocket either.
Happy birthday, Holly.
Come here.
Ever felt like running away?
Ever felt like changing your life?
What's your dream, Holly?
If you could do anything, go anywhere, what would it be?
Before my mum died, she took me to Paris.
That's what I remember about her.
She was happy.
I've always wanted to go back.
Let's do it.
Let's go to Paris.
I'm getting out.
I'm gonna disappear, and I want you to come with me.
Money won't be a problem.
What about your family?
I don't love them.
Open it.
Put it on.
You have to.
It's bad luck otherwise.
What?
Let's go.
Sorry.
It's all right.
Look me in the eyes and say that.
It's all right, Michael.
Pack your bags.
Tomorrow I'll be rich enough to set us free.
Monkey, be quiet.
Fuck.
I'll give you the group discount.
100 a hole, 50 a hand, that's 350.
That's right boys.
It's real too.
Fuck.
Rocky.
Rock.
I got her.
You fuckin' tryin' to avoid me?
No.
What the fuck you runnin' from, then?
You fuckin' scrote.
Where's my money?
I seen her, Rock, stealing' Karlene's trade.
It's my stretch, you fuckin' slut.
No, no, no, I wasn't.
That's fuckin' bullshit!
Shut up, Karlene.
Thinks she's so fuckin' good.
Do somethin'.
Do somethin'!
- Give us the money.
- I don't have any.
What the fuck did you say?
I spent it.
See that?
See fuckin' that?
Fuckin' lying bitch.
Listen, you fuckin' slut.
Next time, it's a hot shot.
Stay off our fuckin' street, or you're dead, cunt.
You fuckin' bitch.
Bel, hey, it's Holly.
Hi, are you working?
Yeah, now.
No, no, no, just a couple of hours.
Okay.
Yeah, no, that's fine.
Bye.
Um, well I'm swinging by yours, like, in two minutes.
I can come get you.
It's good money.
Yeah, no, that's not gonna help me, so...
No, it's all right.
Okay, bye.
Hey, Monique, it's Holly.
You working?
It's good money.
Come on, Mon, you're my last hope.
Yeah, thanks anyway.
Dramas?
It's the night for it.
Full moon.
Everyone's a little crazy.
Great.
Maybe I can help.
Can you find me a brunette who can fuck and suck?
Look out!
Fuckin' asshole!
Why don't you watch where you're going?
You could've fuckin' killed me!
You fuckin' idiot!
She's perfect.
Wait up.
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Fuck off!
Want a job?
I said piss off, lady.
Don't you understand English?
I need a girl right now, and you're perfect.
Threesome at the Hyatt.
Couple of hours, tops.
It's 300.
When was the last time you made that much?
Nothing weird?
Nothing weird.
Just one bloke?
Just me and the guy.
$400.
Wait.
I need the money.
Just give me a chance.
How old are you?
19.
Don't bullshit me.
17.
You got anything else to wear?
Just this.
Put it on.
What's your name?
Shay.
It's $300, Shay.
Okay.
I'm Holly.
Let's go.
You okay?
Yeah.
Nervous?
No.
Just follow my lead, okay?
Better out than in.
Present company excepted.
You like that?
When I fuck you, when I make you come,
I know it's all an act, an illusion.
It doesn't matter.
I want the illusion.
That's what I'm paying for.
Just for an hour, I've got the biggest dick...
The magic touch.
I can make you come in under a minute.
Prove it.
Oh, yeah.
Mm.
Yeah?
No, no.
You're early.
No problem.
Come up.
Fuck!
I got business.
Get in the bathroom and shut up.
Take your clothes.
Come on, move!
Move!
Hello, Willie.
Lovely night for it.
Yes, top night, Mr. Bennett.
Things went great, I'm happy to say.
Fine.
Well, come on.
Make me happy.
They loved the gear.
You too?
Did you love it too?
Yeah.
I had a taste, Mr. Bennett.
I'm not gonna deny it.
Of course you did, Willie.
Yeah.
A good salesman's got to know his product.
Here.
You better count that.
Do you like bowling, Willie?
Dunno.
Why?
Because now you're a bowling ball.
Drive!
You've rung Holly.
I'm tied up right now, but if you leave your name and number, I'll call you back to arrange an appointment.
Gotcha.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Calm down.
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Shh.
- He shot him in the head!
- Shut up!
I saw it!
I saw it!
Just calm down, all right?
All right?
Oh, shit.
What the fuck are you looking at?
Where to?
Just drive.
He knew we were there.
He didn't see us.
How do you know?
You're safe.
Oh, fuck.
Stop.
Stop!
You don't know me.
I don't know you.
Hey.
Wait!
Where to?
Where can I take you?
Look, give me a destination or get out.
You all right?
Everyone's crazy tonight.
What's that?
Don't worry.
Shh.
Can't leave him at home.
He's part of my act.
Look, can I take you somewhere?
I'm hungry.
How about your favorite restaurant?
Vegas is the place for any serious magician.
My old man used to say that if you conquer Vegas, the world will follow.
If you could work at any casino, which one would it be?
Caesar's.
How come?
It's the coolest.
And he played there once on the same bill as Tom Jones.
Who?
Tom Jones?
The singer.
Forget it.
Your Dad sounds cool.
Yeah, he was.
I used to watch his shows over and over.
My dad was magic too.
He disappeared when I was born.
What, you never saw him?
I got a stepdad.
Aren't you cold?
I left my coat at the hotel.
Here.
So what did you want to be when you grew up?
I never had a dream or anything.
Not like you.
Maybe I could be your...
Your lovely assistant.
Hello, Holly.
I'm Willie's friend.
You going somewhere?
Where's your friend?
Willie was a greedy turd.
He always got a double act.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That was foreplay.
Do you want to fuck with me?
Your friend with the pink lipstick.
She was from the street.
I don't know her name.
Wrong answer.
Look into my eyes and listen to the sound of my voice.
There is nothing but the sound of my voice and my eyes.
I will count backwards from five.
When I reach one, you will be under my spell.
Five.
I want you to completely free your mind.
Four.
All tension flows from your body.
Three.
You feel totally relaxed.
Two.
You're light as a feather.
One.
A deep sleep envelopes you.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Tell me your name.
Shay Maree Ryan.
How old are you, Shay?
17.
Tell me something about yourself.
I never forget a face.
Where are you from?
Up north.
Why are you here?
Mum died, so I ran away.
Sorry.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No.
Look at me.
You're beautiful.
Don't.
Can I see you again?
Do you want to see me or see me?
I want to see you.
"Harry the Impossible."
Will you call?
I don't just hypnotize anyone, you know.
It wouldn't work out.
How do you know if you don't take a chance?
What's in the bag, bitch?
Hand it over, and you won't get hurt.
You're the one'll get hurt.
Aww teach her some manners, Rock.
I'll teach her some fuckin' manners, all right.
Oh, fuck!
My fuckin' eyes!
My fucking head!
You bitch!
I fuckin' hate you people.
Open your mouth!
Open your mouth!
I want a room.
$25 the half, $30 the hour.
Five bucks for the towel.
No, for the...
for the night.
80 bucks for the night.
Room three, first floor, end of the corridor.
Thanks.
Whoo, oh, my God!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, Mum.
Don't you ever be afraid to take a chance, Shay, you know?
We're looking for your friend.
I don't know her.
Yeah, but you know what she looks like, though, don't you?
Huh?
Don't ya?
No.
Ah!
Don't you?
Stop, stop.
All right.
All right!
She didn't see you.
She can't hurt you.
You can't trust women.
Shit just fuckin' flies out of their mouth without them even thinking.
It's biological.
It's because they got a cunt hidden away.
It's natural they're gonna be hiding something.
With a bloke, it's all just there, isn't it?
What you see is what you get.
But women are fuckin' liars.
I fuckin' hate women.
Start looking.
Where's Rose?
Don't know.
Who are you?
I heard you from next door.
Have you got anything?
No.
Got a smoke?
Sorry.
Fuck.
What time is it?
It's late.
Where the fuck is she?
I'll get you some water.
Okay?
Sweet.
Here I am, baby.
Who the fuck are you?
She's the girl from next door.
Well, she can fuck off, because we're fuckin' busy.
I was just seeing if your friend was all right.
He's not my friend.
Hurry.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on!
Half.
Half.
Half!
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck.
The back of your hand.
Shut up, bitch!
Shut up.
Fuck!
Ooh.
You got any money?
No.
Bullshit.
Cutie like you.
Come on.
Give us some money.
I don't have any.
Fuck you.
Hey, open the fucking door.
Come on, sweetheart.
Open the fucking door.
The welcome wagon.
Cunts.
That's the way it is.
They fucked me.
Now it's your turn.
I could tell 'em you're here.
They'd pay me for it.
Thanks.
Get fucked.
Hey.
Pink lipstick.
Run!
Gotcha.
Get in!
Are you all right?
What did he do to you?
Police radio.
What?
He's a cop.
Fuck.
You should go home.
I can't.
Somewhere else, then.
There's nowhere else.
I could stay with you.
I'm going to the airport to get on a plane out of here.
That guy'll come after me.
I offered you a job.
No one forced you.
You don't give a shit.
I just saved you.
I don't owe you anything.
You can have the car.
I can't drive.
Get out.
Get out!
Get out!
Hey.
Fuck off!
It's Shay.
Fully didn't recognize you.
Where you going?
Nowhere.
Can I come?
I saw a guy get killed.
You okay?
I think someone's after me.
Who's lookin' out for you?
Rocky will help.
He looks after me.
He'll love you.
Yeah.
I'll go get him.
Lend me some ciggie money?
I'll pay you back.
You're a real friend.
Don't move.
Get in.
I'm waiting for someone.
Shay, get in.
I met my first trick on this street.
I was so scared.
This big old man.
I thought he was gonna have a heart attack on me.
I promised myself, before I turned 30, I'd quit, move to Paris, reinvent myself.
It's my birthday today.
I've been fucking for money since I was 15.
I want a new life.
There's this guy.
He doesn't know that I'm leaving, and I don't want him to.
He can help us.
Who is he?
He's a cop.
Don't worry, ladies.
Safe as houses here.
Take a load off.
This is Bob's place.
No secrets between him and me.
Except where the bodies are buried.
Good one.
- Who's this?
- Shay.
We were on the job together.
You see what happened?
- He shot him in the head.
- Who shot him?
A cop named Bennett.
He tried to kill us.
He's after us, Michael.
Where'd you park his car darlin'?
We didn't say anything about a car.
Gotcha.
Mate, you got more bruises than a Queensland banana.
I reckon your nose looks better on this side.
Fonzie got busted!
Laugh now, you fuckin' dog!
Where's my car, cunt?
Settle down.
Get out of my way.
You made enough mistakes tonight.
Fuckin' settle down.
Look at my suit.
That bitch broke my fuckin' nose.
- You can have the girl.
- What do you care?
Holly's mine.
Oh, mate.
She's a fuckin' whore.
She's pissing off.
Her place was empty.
She's coming with me.
No, no, look at her bag.
I saw the ticket.
Whores only love money.
Everything else is an act.
Back to the car.
He was lying, Michael.
I remember the first time I saw you.
I arrested you just so I could hear your voice.
I'm gonna believe you, Holly.
We're rich enough to disappear.
What about Shay?
It's just you and me now.
She's my friend.
It's just you and me now.
Look in my eyes and say yes.
No.
I can't.
Tell me it wasn't all an act.
Police!
Police!
Get in the car.
Get in the car!
Move!
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!
Drop the fucking gun!
Drive, or I'll fucking kill you!
Come on!
Step on the fucking peddle.
Come on!
Faster!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Faster!
Holly.
Okay.
Holly.
The case.
It's just a scratch.
You're still beautiful.
What time's your flight?
I'll never make it now.
You've got to try.
I'll call Harry.
Who?
The taxi driver.
He's also an escape artist.
It's ringing.
Oh my God.
Holly?
Holly, lie down.
Lie down.
Just lie down.
Tenir moi.
Holly?
Holly?
Somebody help me!
Help me!
Somebody help me!
Help me!
I usually pull him out of a hat.
You like me, don't you?
Yeah.
I want you to make me disappear.

Bonjour, Giles.
Ca va?
You're late.
Ca va bien, merci.
So how's my girl?
Serviced and ready to go.
Papers are in the glove box.
I got you something.
Just a little bon voyage.
You open it.
So you don't get lost.
Maybe I want to.
I'll miss you, Holly.
Come here.
Ladies, I'd like to introduce you to Giles.
As you can see, he's a real peach.
He's quick to learn and eager to please.
He doesn't get tired, and he goes off like a firecracker.

Without a condom, and dirty talk.
Well, don't just sit there.
Don't you have any lube?
What?
Lube.
KY.
Um...

No, no.
You're early.
No problem.
Come up.
Fuck!
I got business.
Get in the bathroom and shut up.
Take your clothes.
Come on, move!
Move!
[hip-hop music playing]
[knocking at door]
Hello, Willie.
Lovely night for it.
Yes, top night, Mr. Bennett.
Things went great, I'm happy to say.
Fine.
[music stops]
Well, come on.
Make me happy.
They loved the gear.
You too?
Did you love it too?
Yeah.
I had a taste, Mr. Bennett.
I'm not gonna deny it.
Of course you did, Willie.
Yeah.
A good salesman's got to know his product.
Here.
You better count that.
[sighs] [belches]
Do you like bowling, Willie?
Dunno.
Why?
[gunshots]
Because now you're a bowling ball.
[elevator dings]
Drive!
You've rung Holly.
I'm tied up right now, but if you leave your name and number, I'll call you back to arrange an appointment.
Gotcha.
[gasping]
Fuck.
Fuck.
Calm down.
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Shh.
- He shot him in the head!
- Shut up!
I saw it!
I saw it!
Just calm down, all right?
All right?
[sobbing]
Oh, shit.
What the fuck are you looking at?
Where to?
Just drive.
He knew we were there.
He didn't see us.
How do you know?
You're safe.
Oh, fuck.
Stop.
Stop!
You don't know me.
I don't know you.
Hey.
Wait!
Where to?
Where can I take you?
Look, give me a destination or get out.
You all right?
Everyone's crazy tonight.
[soft rattling]
What's that?
Don't worry.
Shh.
Can't leave him at home.
He's part of my act.
Look, can I take you somewhere?
I'm hungry.
How about your favorite restaurant?
Vegas is the place for any serious magician.
My old man used to say that if you conquer Vegas, the world will follow.
If you could work at any casino, which one would it be?
Caesar's.
How come?
It's the coolest.
And he played there once on the same bill as Tom Jones.
Who?
Tom Jones?
The singer.
Forget it.
Your Dad sounds cool.
Yeah, he was.
I used to watch his shows over and over.
My dad was magic too.
He disappeared when I was born.
[both laugh]
What, you never saw him?
I got a stepdad.
Aren't you cold?
I left my coat at the hotel.
Here.
So what did you want to be when you grew up?
I never had a dream or anything.
Not like you.
Maybe I could be your...
Your lovely assistant.
Hello, Holly.
I'm Willie's friend.
You going somewhere?
Where's your friend?
Willie was a greedy turd.
He always got a double act.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That was foreplay.
Do you want to fuck with me?
Your friend with the pink lipstick.
She was from the street.
I don't know her name.
Wrong answer.
[screaming]
[gasping]
[distorted audio] [light jangling]
Look into my eyes and listen to the sound of my voice.
There is nothing but the sound of my voice and my eyes.
I will count backwards from five.
When I reach one, you will be under my spell.
Five.
I want you to completely free your mind.
Four.
All tension flows from your body.
Three.
You feel totally relaxed.
Two.
You're light as a feather.
One.
A deep sleep envelopes you.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Tell me your name.
Shay Maree Ryan.
How old are you, Shay?
17.
Tell me something about yourself.
I never forget a face.
Where are you from?
Up north.
Why are you here?
Mum died, so I ran away.
Sorry.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No.
[laughs]
Look at me.
You're beautiful.
Don't.
[phone chimes]
Can I see you again?
Do you want to see me or see me?
I want to see you.
"Harry the Impossible."
Will you call?
I don't just hypnotize anyone, you know.
It wouldn't work out.
How do you know if you don't take a chance?
What's in the bag, bitch?
Hand it over, and you won't get hurt.
You're the one'll get hurt.
Aww teach her some manners, Rock.
I'll teach her some fuckin' manners, all right.
Oh, fuck!
My fuckin' eyes!
[shouting] [screaming]
My fucking head!
You bitch!
[engine revving]
I fuckin' hate you people.
Open your mouth!
Open your mouth!
[wolf whistle]
[loud electronic music playing]
I want a room.
$25 the half, $30 the hour.
Five bucks for the towel.
No, for the...
for the night.
80 bucks for the night.
Room three, first floor, end of the corridor.
Thanks.
[music pounding in distance]
[woman moaning]
Whoo, oh, my God!
[shouting]
[screaming in distance]
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, Mum.
Don't you ever be afraid to take a chance, Shay, you know?
[groans]
We're looking for your friend.
I don't know her.
Yeah, but you know what she looks like, though, don't you?
Huh?
Don't ya?
No.
Ah!
Don't you?
Stop, stop.
[screams]
All right.
All right!
She didn't see you.
She can't hurt you.
You can't trust women.
Shit just fuckin' flies out of their mouth without them even thinking.
It's biological.
It's because they got a cunt hidden away.
It's natural they're gonna be hiding something.
With a bloke, it's all just there, isn't it?
What you see is what you get.
But women are fuckin' liars.
I fuckin' hate women.
Start looking.
[moaning]
[knocking at door]
Where's Rose?
Don't know.
Who are you?
I heard you from next door.
Have you got anything?
No.
Got a smoke?
Sorry.
Fuck.
What time is it?
It's late.
Where the fuck is she?
I'll get you some water.
Okay?
Sweet.
Here I am, baby.
Who the fuck are you?
She's the girl from next door.
Well, she can fuck off, because we're fuckin' busy.
I was just seeing if your friend was all right.
He's not my friend.
Hurry.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on!
Half.
Half.
Half!
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck.
The back of your hand.
Shut up, bitch!
Shut up.
Fuck!
[sighs]
Ooh.
You got any money?
No.
Bullshit.
Cutie like you.
Come on.
Give us some money.
I don't have any.
Fuck you.
[knocking at next door]
Hey, open the fucking door.
Come on, sweetheart.
Open the fucking door.
The welcome wagon.
Cunts.
That's the way it is.
They fucked me.
Now it's your turn.
[men shouting in hallway]
I could tell 'em you're here.
They'd pay me for it.
[footsteps retreating]
Thanks.
Get fucked.
Hey.
Pink lipstick.
Run!
[chaotic dance music]
Gotcha.
[tires screeching]
Get in!
[engine revs] [screams]
Are you all right?
[sighs]
What did he do to you?
[indistinct radio chatter]
Police radio.
What?
He's a cop.
Fuck.
You should go home.
I can't.
Somewhere else, then.
There's nowhere else.
I could stay with you.
I'm going to the airport to get on a plane out of here.
That guy'll come after me.
I offered you a job.
No one forced you.
You don't give a shit.
I just saved you.
I don't owe you anything.
[sobbing]
You can have the car.
I can't drive.
Get out.
Get out!
Get out!
[engine revs]
[melancholy music]
[horns honking]
[retching]
Hey.
Fuck off!
It's Shay.
Fully didn't recognize you.
Where you going?
Nowhere.
Can I come?
I saw a guy get killed.
You okay?
I think someone's after me.
Who's lookin' out for you?
Rocky will help.
He looks after me.
He'll love you.
Yeah.
I'll go get him.
Lend me some ciggie money?
I'll pay you back.
You're a real friend.
Don't move.
Get in.
I'm waiting for someone.
Shay, get in.
I met my first trick on this street.
I was so scared.
This big old man.
I thought he was gonna have a heart attack on me.
I promised myself, before I turned 30, I'd quit, move to Paris, reinvent myself.
It's my birthday today.
I've been fucking for money since I was 15.
I want a new life.
There's this guy.
He doesn't know that I'm leaving, and I don't want him to.
He can help us.
Who is he?
He's a cop.
[harsh electronic music]
[knocking on door]
Don't worry, ladies.
Safe as houses here.
Take a load off.
This is Bob's place.
No secrets between him and me.
Except where the bodies are buried.
[cackling]
Good one.
- Who's this?
- Shay.
We were on the job together.
You see what happened?
- He shot him in the head.
- Who shot him?
A cop named Bennett.
He tried to kill us.
He's after us, Michael.
Where'd you park his car darlin'?
We didn't say anything about a car.
[clattering]
Gotcha.
[laughing]
Mate, you got more bruises than a Queensland banana.
[laughing]
I reckon your nose looks better on this side.
[laughing]
Fonzie got busted!
[laughing] [muffled struggling]
Laugh now, you fuckin' dog!
Where's my car, cunt?
Settle down.
Get out of my way.
You made enough mistakes tonight.
Fuckin' settle down.
Look at my suit.
That bitch broke my fuckin' nose.
- You can have the girl.
- What do you care?
Holly's mine.
Oh, mate.
She's a fuckin' whore.
She's pissing off.
Her place was empty.
She's coming with me.
No, no, look at her bag.
I saw the ticket.
Whores only love money.
Everything else is an act.
[grunting]
[gunshot]
Back to the car.
He was lying, Michael.
I remember the first time I saw you.
I arrested you just so I could hear your voice.
I'm gonna believe you, Holly.
We're rich enough to disappear.
What about Shay?
It's just you and me now.
She's my friend.
It's just you and me now.
Look in my eyes and say yes.
No.
I can't.
Tell me it wasn't all an act.
[loud bang]
Police!
Police!
Get in the car.
Get in the car!
Move!
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!
Drop the fucking gun!
Drive, or I'll fucking kill you!
Come on!
Step on the fucking peddle.
Come on!
[tires squealing] [distorted audio]
Faster!
[screams] [distorted audio]
Come on!
Come on!
[distorted audio]
Come on!
Faster!
[silence]
Holly.
Okay.
Holly.
[siren wailing in distance]
The case.
[siren wailing in distance] [sirens wailing]
[sirens wailing in distance]
It's just a scratch.
You're still beautiful.
What time's your flight?
I'll never make it now.
You've got to try.
I'll call Harry.
Who?
The taxi driver.
He's also an escape artist.
[coughs]
- It's ringing.
- [coughs]
Oh my God.
Holly?
[gasps]
Holly, lie down.
Lie down.
Just lie down.
Tenir moi.
[distant sirens wailing]
Holly?
Holly?
[sobbing] Somebody help me!
Help me!
Somebody help me!
Help me!
[droning tone]
[foreboding ambient music]
[waves crashing]
[bird squawking]
I usually pull him out of a hat.
You like me, don't you?
Yeah.
I want you to make me disappear.
[waves crashing]
[soft melancholy music]
[woman singing in French]
[music builds]
[woman singing in French]
Un coup du champagne si vous plait.
Garcon, e cafe si vous plait.
T'as destres beaux yeux, je peu t'acheter un verre?
Bonjour, Giles.
Ca va?
You're late.
Ca va bien, merci.
So how's my girl?
Serviced and ready to go.
Papers are in the glove box.
I got you something.
Just a little bon voyage.
You open it.
So you don't get lost.
Maybe I want to.
I'll miss you, Holly.
Come here.
Ladies, I'd like to introduce you to Giles.
As you can see, he's a real peach.
He's quick to learn and eager to please.
He doesn't get tired, and he goes off like a firecracker.
What more could a girl want?
You looking for a lay?
Oi.
You shopping?
How much?
What are you after, handsome?
A handjob.
How much?
50?
Without a condom, and dirty talk.
Well, don't just sit there.
Don't you have any lube?
What?
Lube.
KY.
Um...
- Out.
- What?
I'm not paying top dollar for amateur hour.
I'll be good.
I promise.
Fuck that.
You can do anything.
20 bucks.
Show me your tits.
Gonna be a good girl?
Give me your hand.
Oh, that's better.
Now, what's a sweet face like you doing hawking your fork?
I'm broke.
That's not what I'm paying you for.
Come on.
Now, what's a sweet thing like you doing on the streets?
I love sex.
Yes.
Um, I'm a slut.
I just can't get enough.
Yeah, you fucking whore.
You're all the same.
Oh, baby, I can feel you getting hot.
That's better.
How old are you?
17.
You like us young?
Young and tight.
Come on, dirtier.
Ah, my tight, young pussy's aching for your big juicy cock.
Take it, you bitch.
Make me beg.
I'll teach you.
Teach me a lesson.
Oh, you fucking whore.
Oh, make me scream.
Come on, come on.
That's better.
That's better.
Yes.
Harder!
No!
Where did you get this?
Freedom of Information.
Got mine as well.
Look at you.
The prick made me suck him off then arrested me anyway.
Ligurian arrested me.
His kid had just been born.
Does he know?
I'm meeting him for dinner.
Don't you tell him, Holly.
He'll stop you if he finds out.
I can't just disappear.
Forget the past.
In Paris, it'll be all future.
To the end.
To the beginning.
clink!
Show it to me.
First class.
I'm proud of you, Holly.
A little something to help you stay retired.
Happy birthday.
I don't know what to say.
Say a prayer for me in that hunchback's church.
I never thanked you.
What for?
Giving me a chance.
Why did you pick me?
I needed a blonde.
You looked tough.
You looked like a survivor.
I wasn't wrong.
Be careful, Holly.
Don't forget what he is.
Say something to me in French.
Don't say what it means.
What are you after?
A hand job would be good.
50, up front.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Got a spare ciggie?
Don't smoke.
Nobody smokes anymore.
It's feral, eh?
Stunts your growth.
Puts you in an early grave.
What's your name?
Shay.
I'm Cindy.
Buy me a soft serve, Shay?
I'll pay you back.
Okay.
Can I get a soft serve, small fries, and a Coke?
Don't flash your money around.
There's a lot of eyes, and they're always watching.
You must be starving, eh?
You want some?
This'll fill me up.
I'm a real sweet tooth.
Haven't seen you around here before.
I just got here.
Can you lend me a dollar?
I'll pay you back.
I can get a smoke for a dollar.
You're a real friend.
Don't keep your cash in your pocket either.
Happy birthday, Holly.
Come here.
Ever felt like running away?
Ever felt like changing your life?
What's your dream, Holly?
If you could do anything, go anywhere, what would it be?
Before my mum died, she took me to Paris.
That's what I remember about her.
She was happy.
I've always wanted to go back.
Let's do it.
Let's go to Paris.
I'm getting out.
I'm gonna disappear, and I want you to come with me.
Money won't be a problem.
What about your family?
I don't love them.
Open it.
Put it on.
You have to.
It's bad luck otherwise.
What?
Let's go.
Sorry.
It's all right.
Look me in the eyes and say that.
It's all right, Michael.
Pack your bags.
Tomorrow I'll be rich enough to set us free.
Monkey, be quiet.
Fuck.
I'll give you the group discount.
100 a hole, 50 a hand, that's 350.
That's right boys.
It's real too.
Fuck.
Rocky.
Rock.
I got her.
You fuckin' tryin' to avoid me?
No.
What the fuck you runnin' from, then?
You fuckin' scrote.
Where's my money?
I seen her, Rock, stealing' Karlene's trade.
It's my stretch, you fuckin' slut.
No, no, no, I wasn't.
That's fuckin' bullshit!
Shut up, Karlene.
Thinks she's so fuckin' good.
Do somethin'.
Do somethin'!
- Give us the money.
- I don't have any.
What the fuck did you say?
I spent it.
See that?
See fuckin' that?
Fuckin' lying bitch.
Listen, you fuckin' slut.
Next time, it's a hot shot.
Stay off our fuckin' street, or you're dead, cunt.
You fuckin' bitch.
Bel, hey, it's Holly.
Hi, are you working?
Yeah, now.
No, no, no, just a couple of hours.
Okay.
Yeah, no, that's fine.
Bye.
Um, well I'm swinging by yours, like, in two minutes.
I can come get you.
It's good money.
Yeah, no, that's not gonna help me, so...
No, it's all right.
Okay, bye.
Hey, Monique, it's Holly.
You working?
It's good money.
Come on, Mon, you're my last hope.
Yeah, thanks anyway.
Dramas?
It's the night for it.
Full moon.
Everyone's a little crazy.
Great.
Maybe I can help.
Can you find me a brunette who can fuck and suck?
Look out!
Fuckin' asshole!
Why don't you watch where you're going?
You could've fuckin' killed me!
You fuckin' idiot!
She's perfect.
Wait up.
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Fuck off!
Want a job?
I said piss off, lady.
Don't you understand English?
I need a girl right now, and you're perfect.
Threesome at the Hyatt.
Couple of hours, tops.
It's 300.
When was the last time you made that much?
Nothing weird?
Nothing weird.
Just one bloke?
Just me and the guy.
$400.
Wait.
I need the money.
Just give me a chance.
How old are you?
19.
Don't bullshit me.
17.
You got anything else to wear?
Just this.
Put it on.
What's your name?
Shay.
It's $300, Shay.
Okay.
I'm Holly.
Let's go.
You okay?
Yeah.
Nervous?
No.
Just follow my lead, okay?
Better out than in.
Present company excepted.
You like that?
When I fuck you, when I make you come,
I know it's all an act, an illusion.
It doesn't matter.
I want the illusion.
That's what I'm paying for.
Just for an hour, I've got the biggest dick...
The magic touch.
I can make you come in under a minute.
Prove it.
Oh, yeah.
Mm.
Yeah?
No, no.
You're early.
No problem.
Come up.
Fuck!
I got business.
Get in the bathroom and shut up.
Take your clothes.
Come on, move!
Move!
Hello, Willie.
Lovely night for it.
Yes, top night, Mr. Bennett.
Things went great, I'm happy to say.
Fine.

Gotcha.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Calm down.
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Shh.
- He shot him in the head!
- Shut up!
I saw it!
I saw it!
Just calm down, all right?
All right?
Oh, shit.
What the fuck are you looking at?
Where to?
Just drive.
He knew we were there.
He didn't see us.
How do you know?
You're safe.
Oh, fuck.
Stop.

Fuck you.
Hey, open the fucking door.
Come on, sweetheart.
Open the fucking door.
The welcome wagon.
Cunts.
That's the way it is.
They fucked me.
Now it's your turn.
I could tell 'em you're here.
They'd pay me for it.
Thanks.
Get fucked.
Hey.
Pink lipstick.
Run!
Gotcha.
Get in!
Are you all right?
What did he do to you?
Police radio.
What?
He's a cop.
Fuck.
You should go home.
I can't.
Somewhere else, then.
There's nowhere else.
I could stay with you.
I'm going to the airport to get on a plane out of here.
That guy'll come after me.
I offered you a job.
No one forced you.
You don't give a shit.
I just saved you.
I don't owe you anything.
You can have the car.
I can't drive.
Get out.
Get out!
Get out!
Hey.
Fuck off!
It's Shay.
Fully didn't recognize you.
Where you going?
Nowhere.
Can I come?
I saw a guy get killed.
You okay?
I think someone's after me.
Who's lookin' out for you?
Rocky will help.
He looks after me.
He'll love you.
Yeah.
I'll go get him.
Lend me some ciggie money?
I'll pay you back.
You're a real friend.
Don't move.
Get in.
I'm waiting for someone.
Shay, get in.
I met my first trick on this street.
I was so scared.
This big old man.
I thought he was gonna have a heart attack on me.
I promised myself, before I turned 30, I'd quit, move to Paris, reinvent myself.
It's my birthday today.
I've been fucking for money since I was 15.
I want a new life.
There's this guy.
He doesn't know that I'm leaving, and I don't want him to.
He can help us.
Who is he?
He's a cop.
Don't worry, ladies.
Safe as houses here.
Take a load off.
This is Bob's place.
No secrets between him and me.
Except where the bodies are buried.
Good one.
- Who's this?
- Shay.
We were on the job together.
You see what happened?
- He shot him in the head.
- Who shot him?
A cop named Bennett.
He tried to kill us.
He's after us, Michael.
Where'd you park his car darlin'?
We didn't say anything about a car.
Gotcha.
Mate, you got more bruises than a Queensland banana.
I reckon your nose looks better on this side.
Fonzie got busted!
Laugh now, you fuckin' dog!
Where's my car, cunt?
Settle down.
Get out of my way.
You made enough mistakes tonight.
Fuckin' settle down.
Look at my suit.
That bitch broke my fuckin' nose.
- You can have the girl.
- What do you care?
Holly's mine.
Oh, mate.
She's a fuckin' whore.
She's pissing off.
Her place was empty.
She's coming with me.
No, no, look at her bag.
I saw the ticket.
Whores only love money.
Everything else is an act.
Back to the car.
He was lying, Michael.
I remember the first time I saw you.
I arrested you just so I could hear your voice.
I'm gonna believe you, Holly.
We're rich enough to disappear.
What about Shay?
It's just you and me now.
She's my friend.
It's just you and me now.
Look in my eyes and say yes.
No.
I can't.
Tell me it wasn't all an act.
Police!
Police!
Get in the car.
Get in the car!
Move!
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!
Drop the fucking gun!
Drive, or I'll fucking kill you!
Come on!
Step on the fucking peddle.
Come on!
Faster!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Faster!
Holly.
Okay.
Holly.
The case.
It's just a scratch.
You're still beautiful.
What time's your flight?
I'll never make it now.
You've got to try.
I'll call Harry.
Who?
The taxi driver.
He's also an escape artist.
It's ringing.
Oh my God.
Holly?
Holly, lie down.
Lie down.
Just lie down.
Tenir moi.
Holly?
Holly?
Somebody help me!
Help me!
Somebody help me!
Help me!
I usually pull him out of a hat.
You like me, don't you?
Yeah.
I want you to make me disappear.

Bonjour, Giles.
Ca va?
You're late.
Ca va bien, merci.
So how's my girl?
Serviced and ready to go.
Papers are in the glove box.
I got you something.
Just a little bon voyage.
You open it.
So you don't get lost.
Maybe I want to.
I'll miss you, Holly.
Come here.
Ladies, I'd like to introduce you to Giles.
As you can see, he's a real peach.
He's quick to learn and eager to please.
He doesn't get tired, and he goes off like a firecracker.

[champagne fizzing]
[grunting]
[easy electronic music]
You looking for a lay?
[whistling]
Oi.
You shopping?
How much?
What are you after, handsome?
A handjob.
How much?
50?
Without a condom, and dirty talk.
Well, don't just sit there.
Don't you have any lube?
What?
Lube.
KY.
Um...
- Out.
- What?
I'm not paying top dollar for amateur hour.
I'll be good.
I promise.
Fuck that.
You can do anything.
20 bucks.
Show me your tits.
Gonna be a good girl?
Give me your hand.
Oh, that's better.
Now, what's a sweet face like you doing hawking your fork?
I'm broke.
That's not what I'm paying you for.
Come on.
Now, what's a sweet thing like you doing on the streets?
I love sex.
Yes.
Um, I'm a slut.
I just can't get enough.
Yeah, you fucking whore.
You're all the same.
Oh, baby, I can feel you getting hot.
That's better.
How old are you?
17.
You like us young?
Young and tight.
Come on, dirtier.
Ah, my tight, young pussy's aching for your big juicy cock.
Take it, you bitch.
Make me beg.
I'll teach you.
Teach me a lesson.
Oh, you fucking whore.
Oh, make me scream.
Come on, come on.
That's better.
That's better.
Yes.
Harder!
No!
[glass shatters] [men shouting]
Where did you get this?
Freedom of Information.
Got mine as well.
Look at you.
The prick made me suck him off then arrested me anyway.
Ligurian arrested me.
His kid had just been born.
Does he know?
I'm meeting him for dinner.
Don't you tell him, Holly.
He'll stop you if he finds out.
I can't just disappear.
Forget the past.
In Paris, it'll be all future.
To the end.
To the beginning.
clink!
Show it to me.
First class.
I'm proud of you, Holly.
A little something to help you stay retired.
Happy birthday.
I don't know what to say.
Say a prayer for me in that hunchback's church.
I never thanked you.
What for?
Giving me a chance.
Why did you pick me?
I needed a blonde.
You looked tough.
You looked like a survivor.
I wasn't wrong.
Be careful, Holly.
Don't forget what he is.
Say something to me in French.
[speaks French]
Don't say what it means.
What are you after?
A hand job would be good.
50, up front.
[horns honking]
- Hi.
- Hi.
Got a spare ciggie?
Don't smoke.
Nobody smokes anymore.
It's feral, eh?
Stunts your growth.
Puts you in an early grave.
What's your name?
Shay.
I'm Cindy.
Buy me a soft serve, Shay?
I'll pay you back.
Okay.
Can I get a soft serve, small fries, and a Coke?
[horn blares]
Don't flash your money around.
There's a lot of eyes, and they're always watching.
You must be starving, eh?
You want some?
This'll fill me up.
I'm a real sweet tooth.
Haven't seen you around here before.
I just got here.
[coughing]
Can you lend me a dollar?
I'll pay you back.
I can get a smoke for a dollar.
You're a real friend.
Don't keep your cash in your pocket either.
Happy birthday, Holly.
Come here.
Ever felt like running away?
Ever felt like changing your life?
What's your dream, Holly?
If you could do anything, go anywhere, what would it be?
Before my mum died, she took me to Paris.
That's what I remember about her.
She was happy.
I've always wanted to go back.
Let's do it.
Let's go to Paris.
I'm getting out.
I'm gonna disappear, and I want you to come with me.
Money won't be a problem.
What about your family?
I don't love them.
Open it.
Put it on.
You have to.
It's bad luck otherwise.
[cell phone ringing]
What?
Let's go.
[moaning and heavy breathing]
[gasping]
[gasping]
[indistinct voices on police radio]
[traffic humming]
[inhales deeply]
Sorry.
It's all right.
Look me in the eyes and say that.
It's all right, Michael.
Pack your bags.
Tomorrow I'll be rich enough to set us free.
[dog barking]
Monkey, be quiet.
[dog barking]
[doorbell chimes]
[doorbell chimes] [dog barks]
[cell phone chiming]
Fuck.
I'll give you the group discount.
100 a hole, 50 a hand, that's 350.
That's right boys.
It's real too.
Fuck.
Rocky.
Rock.
I got her.
You fuckin' tryin' to avoid me?
No.
What the fuck you runnin' from, then?
You fuckin' scrote.
Where's my money?
I seen her, Rock, stealing' Karlene's trade.
It's my stretch, you fuckin' slut.
No, no, no, I wasn't.
That's fuckin' bullshit!
Shut up, Karlene.
Thinks she's so fuckin' good.
Do somethin'.
Do somethin'!
- Give us the money.
- I don't have any.
What the fuck did you say?
I spent it.
[coughing]
See that?
See fuckin' that?
Fuckin' lying bitch.
Listen, you fuckin' slut.
Next time, it's a hot shot.
Stay off our fuckin' street, or you're dead, cunt.
[crying] [spits] [laughing]
You fuckin' bitch.
[sobbing]
Bel, hey, it's Holly.
Hi, are you working?
Yeah, now.
No, no, no, just a couple of hours.
Okay.
Yeah, no, that's fine.
Bye.
Um, well I'm swinging by yours, like, in two minutes.
I can come get you.
It's good money.
Yeah, no, that's not gonna help me, so...
No, it's all right.
Okay, bye.
Hey, Monique, it's Holly.
You working?
It's good money.
Come on, Mon, you're my last hope.
Yeah, thanks anyway.
Dramas?
It's the night for it.
Full moon.
Everyone's a little crazy.
Great.
Maybe I can help.
Can you find me a brunette who can fuck and suck?
Look out!
Fuckin' asshole!
Why don't you watch where you're going?
You could've fuckin' killed me!
You fuckin' idiot!
She's perfect.
Wait up.
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Fuck off!
Want a job?
I said piss off, lady.
Don't you understand English?
I need a girl right now, and you're perfect.
Threesome at the Hyatt.
Couple of hours, tops.
It's 300.
When was the last time you made that much?
[sighs]
Nothing weird?
Nothing weird.
Just one bloke?
Just me and the guy.
$400.
Wait.
I need the money.
Just give me a chance.
[siren wailing]
How old are you?
19.
Don't bullshit me.
17.
You got anything else to wear?
Just this.
Put it on.
What's your name?
Shay.
It's $300, Shay.
Okay.
I'm Holly.
Let's go.
You okay?
Yeah.
Nervous?
No.
[elevator dings]
Just follow my lead, okay?
[heavy breathing]
[ethereal music]
[belches]
Better out than in.
Present company excepted.
You like that?
[hip-hop music playing]
When I fuck you, when I make you come,
I know it's all an act, an illusion.
It doesn't matter.
I want the illusion.
That's what I'm paying for.
Just for an hour, I've got the biggest dick... [laughs]
The magic touch.
I can make you come in under a minute.
Prove it.
[moaning]
[moaning]
Oh, yeah.
[shouts]
Mm.
[phone ringing]
Yeah?
No, no.
You're early.
No problem.
Come up.
Fuck!
I got business.
Get in the bathroom and shut up.
Take your clothes.
Come on, move!
Move!
[hip-hop music playing]
[knocking at door]
Hello, Willie.
Lovely night for it.
Yes, top night, Mr. Bennett.
Things went great, I'm happy to say.
Fine.
[music stops]
Well, come on.
Make me happy.
They loved the gear.
You too?
Did you love it too?
Yeah.
I had a taste, Mr. Bennett.
I'm not gonna deny it.
Of course you did, Willie.
Yeah.
A good salesman's got to know his product.
Here.
You better count that.
[sighs] [belches]
Do you like bowling, Willie?
Dunno.
Why?
[gunshots]
Because now you're a bowling ball.
[elevator dings]
Drive!
You've rung Holly.
I'm tied up right now, but if you leave your name and number, I'll call you back to arrange an appointment.
Gotcha.
[gasping]
Fuck.
Fuck.
Calm down.
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Shh.
- He shot him in the head!
- Shut up!
I saw it!
I saw it!
Just calm down, all right?
All right?
[sobbing]
Oh, shit.
What the fuck are you looking at?
Where to?
Just drive.
He knew we were there.
He didn't see us.
How do you know?
You're safe.
Oh, fuck.
Stop.
Stop!
You don't know me.
I don't know you.
Hey.
Wait!
Where to?
Where can I take you?
Look, give me a destination or get out.
You all right?
Everyone's crazy tonight.
[soft rattling]
What's that?
Don't worry.
Shh.
Can't leave him at home.
He's part of my act.
Look, can I take you somewhere?
I'm hungry.
How about your favorite restaurant?
Vegas is the place for any serious magician.
My old man used to say that if you conquer Vegas, the world will follow.
If you could work at any casino, which one would it be?
Caesar's.
How come?
It's the coolest.
And he played there once on the same bill as Tom Jones.
Who?
Tom Jones?
The singer.
Forget it.
Your Dad sounds cool.
Yeah, he was.
I used to watch his shows over and over.
My dad was magic too.
He disappeared when I was born.
[both laugh]
What, you never saw him?
I got a stepdad.
Aren't you cold?
I left my coat at the hotel.
Here.
So what did you want to be when you grew up?
I never had a dream or anything.
Not like you.
Maybe I could be your...
Your lovely assistant.
Hello, Holly.
I'm Willie's friend.
You going somewhere?
Where's your friend?
Willie was a greedy turd.
He always got a double act.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That was foreplay.
Do you want to fuck with me?
Your friend with the pink lipstick.
She was from the street.
I don't know her name.
Wrong answer.
[screaming]
[gasping]
[distorted audio] [light jangling]
Look into my eyes and listen to the sound of my voice.
There is nothing but the sound of my voice and my eyes.
I will count backwards from five.
When I reach one, you will be under my spell.
Five.
I want you to completely free your mind.
Four.
All tension flows from your body.
Three.
You feel totally relaxed.
Two.
You're light as a feather.
One.
A deep sleep envelopes you.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Tell me your name.
Shay Maree Ryan.
How old are you, Shay?
17.
Tell me something about yourself.
I never forget a face.
Where are you from?
Up north.
Why are you here?
Mum died, so I ran away.
Sorry.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No.
[laughs]
Look at me.
You're beautiful.
Don't.
[phone chimes]
Can I see you again?
Do you want to see me or see me?
I want to see you.
"Harry the Impossible."
Will you call?
I don't just hypnotize anyone, you know.
It wouldn't work out.
How do you know if you don't take a chance?
What's in the bag, bitch?
Hand it over, and you won't get hurt.
You're the one'll get hurt.
Aww teach her some manners, Rock.
I'll teach her some fuckin' manners, all right.
Oh, fuck!
My fuckin' eyes!
[shouting] [screaming]
My fucking head!
You bitch!
[engine revving]
I fuckin' hate you people.
Open your mouth!
Open your mouth!
[wolf whistle]
[loud electronic music playing]
I want a room.
$25 the half, $30 the hour.
Five bucks for the towel.
No, for the...
for the night.
80 bucks for the night.
Room three, first floor, end of the corridor.
Thanks.
[music pounding in distance]
[woman moaning]
Whoo, oh, my God!
[shouting]
[screaming in distance]
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, Mum.
Don't you ever be afraid to take a chance, Shay, you know?
[groans]
We're looking for your friend.
I don't know her.
Yeah, but you know what she looks like, though, don't you?
Huh?
Don't ya?
No.
Ah!
Don't you?
Stop, stop.
[screams]
All right.
All right!
She didn't see you.
She can't hurt you.
You can't trust women.
Shit just fuckin' flies out of their mouth without them even thinking.
It's biological.
It's because they got a cunt hidden away.
It's natural they're gonna be hiding something.
With a bloke, it's all just there, isn't it?
What you see is what you get.
But women are fuckin' liars.
I fuckin' hate women.
Start looking.
[moaning]
[knocking at door]
Where's Rose?
Don't know.
Who are you?
I heard you from next door.
Have you got anything?
No.
Got a smoke?
Sorry.
Fuck.
What time is it?
It's late.
Where the fuck is she?
I'll get you some water.
Okay?
Sweet.
Here I am, baby.
Who the fuck are you?
She's the girl from next door.
Well, she can fuck off, because we're fuckin' busy.
I was just seeing if your friend was all right.
He's not my friend.
Hurry.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on!
Half.
Half.
Half!
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck.
The back of your hand.
Shut up, bitch!
Shut up.
Fuck!
[sighs]
Ooh.
You got any money?
No.
Bullshit.
Cutie like you.
Come on.
Give us some money.
I don't have any.
Fuck you.
[knocking at next door]
Hey, open the fucking door.
Come on, sweetheart.
Open the fucking door.
The welcome wagon.
Cunts.
That's the way it is.
They fucked me.
Now it's your turn.
[men shouting in hallway]
I could tell 'em you're here.
They'd pay me for it.
[footsteps retreating]
Thanks.
Get fucked.
Hey.
Pink lipstick.
Run!
[chaotic dance music]
Gotcha.
[tires screeching]
Get in!
[engine revs] [screams]
Are you all right?
[sighs]
What did he do to you?
[indistinct radio chatter]
Police radio.
What?
He's a cop.
Fuck.
You should go home.
I can't.
Somewhere else, then.
There's nowhere else.
I could stay with you.
I'm going to the airport to get on a plane out of here.
That guy'll come after me.
I offered you a job.
No one forced you.
You don't give a shit.
I just saved you.
I don't owe you anything.

You can have the car.
I can't drive.
Get out.
Get out!

You okay?
I think someone's after me.
Who's lookin' out for you?
Rocky will help.
He looks after me.
He'll love you.
Yeah.
I'll go get him.
Lend me some ciggie money?
I'll pay you back.
You're a real friend.
Don't move.
Get in.
I'm waiting for someone.
Shay, get in.
I met my first trick on this street.
I was so scared.
This big old man.
I thought he was gonna have a heart attack on me.
I promised myself, before I turned 30, I'd quit, move to Paris, reinvent myself.
It's my birthday today.
I've been fucking for money since I was 15.
I want a new life.

- Who shot him?
A cop named Bennett.
He tried to kill us.
He's after us, Michael.
Where'd you park his car darlin'?
We didn't say anything about a car.
[clattering]
Gotcha.

Mate, you got more bruises than a Queensland banana.

I reckon your nose looks better on this side.

Fonzie got busted!

Laugh now, you fuckin' dog!
Where's my car, cunt?

You made enough mistakes tonight.
Fuckin' settle down.
Look at my suit.

Oh, mate.

Oi.
You shopping?
How much?
What are you after, handsome?
A handjob.
How much?
50?
Without a condom, and dirty talk.
Well, don't just sit there.
Don't you have any lube?
What?
Lube.
KY.
Um...
- Out.
- What?
I'm not paying top dollar for amateur hour.
I'll be good.
I promise.
Fuck that.
You can do anything.
20 bucks.
Show me your tits.
Gonna be a good girl?
Give me your hand.
Oh, that's better.
Now, what's a sweet face like you doing hawking your fork?
I'm broke.
That's not what I'm paying you for.
Come on.
Now, what's a sweet thing like you doing on the streets?
I love sex.
Yes.
Um, I'm a slut.
I just can't get enough.
Yeah, you fucking whore.
You're all the same.
Oh, baby, I can feel you getting hot.
That's better.
How old are you?
17.
You like us young?
Young and tight.
Come on, dirtier.
Ah, my tight, young pussy's aching for your big juicy cock.
Take it, you bitch.
Make me beg.
I'll teach you.
Teach me a lesson.
Oh, you fucking whore.
Oh, make me scream.
Come on, come on.
That's better.
That's better.
Yes.
Harder!
No!
Where did you get this?
Freedom of Information.
Got mine as well.
Look at you.
The prick made me suck him off then arrested me anyway.
Ligurian arrested me.
His kid had just been born.
Does he know?
I'm meeting him for dinner.
Don't you tell him, Holly.
He'll stop you if he finds out.
I can't just disappear.
Forget the past.
In Paris, it'll be all future.
To the end.
To the beginning.
clink!
Show it to me.
First class.
I'm proud of you, Holly.
A little something to help you stay retired.
Happy birthday.
I don't know what to say.
Say a prayer for me in that hunchback's church.
I never thanked you.
What for?
Giving me a chance.
Why did you pick me?
I needed a blonde.
You looked tough.
You looked like a survivor.
I wasn't wrong.
Be careful, Holly.
Don't forget what he is.
Say something to me in French.
Don't say what it means.
What are you after?
A hand job would be good.
50, up front.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Got a spare ciggie?
Don't smoke.
Nobody smokes anymore.
It's feral, eh?
Stunts your growth.
Puts you in an early grave.
What's your name?
Shay.
I'm Cindy.
Buy me a soft serve, Shay?
I'll pay you back.
Okay.
Can I get a soft serve, small fries, and a Coke?
Don't flash your money around.
There's a lot of eyes, and they're always watching.
You must be starving, eh?
You want some?
This'll fill me up.
I'm a real sweet tooth.
Haven't seen you around here before.
I just got here.
Can you lend me a dollar?
I'll pay you back.
I can get a smoke for a dollar.
You're a real friend.
Don't keep your cash in your pocket either.
Happy birthday, Holly.
Come here.
Ever felt like running away?
Ever felt like changing your life?
What's your dream, Holly?
If you could do anything, go anywhere, what would it be?
Before my mum died, she took me to Paris.
That's what I remember about her.
She was happy.
I've always wanted to go back.
Let's do it.
Let's go to Paris.
I'm getting out.
I'm gonna disappear, and I want you to come with me.
Money won't be a problem.
What about your family?
I don't love them.
Open it.
Put it on.
You have to.
It's bad luck otherwise.
What?
Let's go.
Sorry.
It's all right.
Look me in the eyes and say that.
It's all right, Michael.
Pack your bags.
Tomorrow I'll be rich enough to set us free.
Monkey, be quiet.
Fuck.
I'll give you the group discount.
100 a hole, 50 a hand, that's 350.
That's right boys.
It's real too.
Fuck.
Rocky.
Rock.
I got her.
You fuckin' tryin' to avoid me?
No.
What the fuck you runnin' from, then?
You fuckin' scrote.
Where's my money?
I seen her, Rock, stealing' Karlene's trade.
It's my stretch, you fuckin' slut.
No, no, no, I wasn't.
That's fuckin' bullshit!
Shut up, Karlene.
Thinks she's so fuckin' good.
Do somethin'.
Do somethin'!
- Give us the money.
- I don't have any.
What the fuck did you say?
I spent it.
See that?
See fuckin' that?
Fuckin' lying bitch.
Listen, you fuckin' slut.
Next time, it's a hot shot.
Stay off our fuckin' street, or you're dead, cunt.
You fuckin' bitch.
Bel, hey, it's Holly.
Hi, are you working?
Yeah, now.
No, no, no, just a couple of hours.
Okay.
Yeah, no, that's fine.
Bye.
Um, well I'm swinging by yours, like, in two minutes.
I can come get you.
It's good money.
Yeah, no, that's not gonna help me, so...
No, it's all right.
Okay, bye.
Hey, Monique, it's Holly.
You working?
It's good money.
Come on, Mon, you're my last hope.
Yeah, thanks anyway.
Dramas?
It's the night for it.
Full moon.
Everyone's a little crazy.
Great.
Maybe I can help.
Can you find me a brunette who can fuck and suck?
Look out!
Fuckin' asshole!
Why don't you watch where you're going?
You could've fuckin' killed me!
You fuckin' idiot!
She's perfect.
Wait up.
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Fuck off!
Want a job?
I said piss off, lady.
Don't you understand English?
I need a girl right now, and you're perfect.
Threesome at the Hyatt.
Couple of hours, tops.
It's 300.
When was the last time you made that much?
Nothing weird?
Nothing weird.
Just one bloke?
Just me and the guy.
$400.
Wait.
I need the money.
Just give me a chance.
How old are you?
19.
Don't bullshit me.
17.
You got anything else to wear?
Just this.
Put it on.
What's your name?
Shay.
It's $300, Shay.
Okay.
I'm Holly.
Let's go.
You okay?
Yeah.
Nervous?
No.
Just follow my lead, okay?
Better out than in.
Present company excepted.
You like that?
When I fuck you, when I make you come,
I know it's all an act, an illusion.
It doesn't matter.
I want the illusion.
That's what I'm paying for.
Just for an hour, I've got the biggest dick...
The magic touch.
I can make you come in under a minute.
Prove it.
Oh, yeah.
Mm.
Yeah?
No, no.
You're early.
No problem.
Come up.
Fuck!
I got business.
Get in the bathroom and shut up.
Take your clothes.
Come on, move!
Move!
Hello, Willie.
Lovely night for it.
Yes, top night, Mr. Bennett.
Things went great, I'm happy to say.
Fine.
Well, come on.
Make me happy.
They loved the gear.
You too?
Did you love it too?
Yeah.
I had a taste, Mr. Bennett.
I'm not gonna deny it.
Of course you did, Willie.
Yeah.
A good salesman's got to know his product.
Here.
You better count that.
Do you like bowling, Willie?
Dunno.
Why?
Because now you're a bowling ball.
Drive!
You've rung Holly.
I'm tied up right now, but if you leave your name and number, I'll call you back to arrange an appointment.
Gotcha.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Calm down.
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Shh.
- He shot him in the head!
- Shut up!
I saw it!
I saw it!
Just calm down, all right?
All right?
Oh, shit.
What the fuck are you looking at?
Where to?
Just drive.
He knew we were there.
He didn't see us.
How do you know?
You're safe.
Oh, fuck.
Stop.
Stop!
You don't know me.
I don't know you.
Hey.
Wait!
Where to?
Where can I take you?
Look, give me a destination or get out.
You all right?
Everyone's crazy tonight.
What's that?
Don't worry.
Shh.
Can't leave him at home.
He's part of my act.
Look, can I take you somewhere?
I'm hungry.
How about your favorite restaurant?
Vegas is the place for any serious magician.
My old man used to say that if you conquer Vegas, the world will follow.
If you could work at any casino, which one would it be?
Caesar's.
How come?
It's the coolest.
And he played there once on the same bill as Tom Jones.
Who?
Tom Jones?
The singer.
Forget it.
Your Dad sounds cool.
Yeah, he was.
I used to watch his shows over and over.
My dad was magic too.
He disappeared when I was born.
What, you never saw him?
I got a stepdad.
Aren't you cold?
I left my coat at the hotel.
Here.
So what did you want to be when you grew up?
I never had a dream or anything.
Not like you.
Maybe I could be your...
Your lovely assistant.
Hello, Holly.
I'm Willie's friend.
You going somewhere?
Where's your friend?
Willie was a greedy turd.
He always got a double act.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That was foreplay.
Do you want to fuck with me?
Your friend with the pink lipstick.
She was from the street.
I don't know her name.
Wrong answer.
Look into my eyes and listen to the sound of my voice.
There is nothing but the sound of my voice and my eyes.
I will count backwards from five.
When I reach one, you will be under my spell.
Five.
I want you to completely free your mind.
Four.
All tension flows from your body.
Three.
You feel totally relaxed.
Two.
You're light as a feather.
One.
A deep sleep envelopes you.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Tell me your name.
Shay Maree Ryan.
How old are you, Shay?
17.
Tell me something about yourself.
I never forget a face.
Where are you from?
Up north.
Why are you here?
Mum died, so I ran away.
Sorry.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No.
Look at me.
You're beautiful.
Don't.
Can I see you again?
Do you want to see me or see me?
I want to see you.
"Harry the Impossible."
Will you call?
I don't just hypnotize anyone, you know.
It wouldn't work out.
How do you know if you don't take a chance?
What's in the bag, bitch?
Hand it over, and you won't get hurt.
You're the one'll get hurt.
Aww teach her some manners, Rock.
I'll teach her some fuckin' manners, all right.
Oh, fuck!
My fuckin' eyes!
My fucking head!
You bitch!
I fuckin' hate you people.
Open your mouth!
Open your mouth!
I want a room.
$25 the half, $30 the hour.
Five bucks for the towel.
No, for the...
for the night.
80 bucks for the night.
Room three, first floor, end of the corridor.
Thanks.
Whoo, oh, my God!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, Mum.
Don't you ever be afraid to take a chance, Shay, you know?
We're looking for your friend.
I don't know her.
Yeah, but you know what she looks like, though, don't you?
Huh?
Don't ya?
No.
Ah!
Don't you?
Stop, stop.
All right.
All right!
She didn't see you.
She can't hurt you.
You can't trust women.
Shit just fuckin' flies out of their mouth without them even thinking.
It's biological.
It's because they got a cunt hidden away.
It's natural they're gonna be hiding something.
With a bloke, it's all just there, isn't it?
What you see is what you get.
But women are fuckin' liars.
I fuckin' hate women.
Start looking.
Where's Rose?
Don't know.
Who are you?
I heard you from next door.
Have you got anything?
No.
Got a smoke?
Sorry.
Fuck.
What time is it?
It's late.
Where the fuck is she?
I'll get you some water.
Okay?
Sweet.
Here I am, baby.
Who the fuck are you?
She's the girl from next door.
Well, she can fuck off, because we're fuckin' busy.
I was just seeing if your friend was all right.
He's not my friend.
Hurry.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on!
Half.
Half.
Half!
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck.
The back of your hand.
Shut up, bitch!
Shut up.
Fuck!
Ooh.
You got any money?
No.
Bullshit.
Cutie like you.
Come on.
Give us some money.
I don't have any.
Fuck you.
Hey, open the fucking door.
Come on, sweetheart.
Open the fucking door.
The welcome wagon.
Cunts.
That's the way it is.
They fucked me.
Now it's your turn.
I could tell 'em you're here.
They'd pay me for it.
Thanks.
Get fucked.
Hey.
Pink lipstick.
Run!
Gotcha.
Get in!
Are you all right?
What did he do to you?
Police radio.
What?
He's a cop.
Fuck.
You should go home.
I can't.
Somewhere else, then.
There's nowhere else.
I could stay with you.
I'm going to the airport to get on a plane out of here.
That guy'll come after me.
I offered you a job.
No one forced you.
You don't give a shit.
I just saved you.
I don't owe you anything.
You can have the car.
I can't drive.
Get out.
Get out!
Get out!
Hey.
Fuck off!
It's Shay.
Fully didn't recognize you.
Where you going?
Nowhere.
Can I come?
I saw a guy get killed.
You okay?
I think someone's after me.
Who's lookin' out for you?
Rocky will help.
He looks after me.
He'll love you.
Yeah.
I'll go get him.
Lend me some ciggie money?
I'll pay you back.
You're a real friend.
Don't move.
Get in.
I'm waiting for someone.
Shay, get in.
I met my first trick on this street.
I was so scared.
This big old man.
I thought he was gonna have a heart attack on me.
I promised myself, before I turned 30, I'd quit, move to Paris, reinvent myself.
It's my birthday today.
I've been fucking for money since I was 15.
I want a new life.
There's this guy.
He doesn't know that I'm leaving, and I don't want him to.
He can help us.
Who is he?
He's a cop.
Don't worry, ladies.
Safe as houses here.
Take a load off.
This is Bob's place.
No secrets between him and me.
Except where the bodies are buried.
Good one.
- Who's this?
- Shay.
We were on the job together.
You see what happened?
- He shot him in the head.
- Who shot him?
A cop named Bennett.
He tried to kill us.
He's after us, Michael.
Where'd you park his car darlin'?
We didn't say anything about a car.
Gotcha.
Mate, you got more bruises than a Queensland banana.
I reckon your nose looks better on this side.
Fonzie got busted!
Laugh now, you fuckin' dog!
Where's my car, cunt?
Settle down.
Get out of my way.
You made enough mistakes tonight.
Fuckin' settle down.
Look at my suit.
That bitch broke my fuckin' nose.
- You can have the girl.
- What do you care?
Holly's mine.
Oh, mate.
She's a fuckin' whore.
She's pissing off.
Her place was empty.
She's coming with me.
No, no, look at her bag.
I saw the ticket.
Whores only love money.
Everything else is an act.
Back to the car.
He was lying, Michael.
I remember the first time I saw you.
I arrested you just so I could hear your voice.
I'm gonna believe you, Holly.
We're rich enough to disappear.
What about Shay?
It's just you and me now.
She's my friend.
It's just you and me now.
Look in my eyes and say yes.
No.
I can't.
Tell me it wasn't all an act.
Police!
Police!
Get in the car.
Get in the car!
Move!
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!
Drop the fucking gun!
Drive, or I'll fucking kill you!
Come on!
Step on the fucking peddle.
Come on!
Faster!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Faster!
Holly.
Okay.
Holly.
The case.
It's just a scratch.
You're still beautiful.
What time's your flight?
I'll never make it now.
You've got to try.
I'll call Harry.
Who?
The taxi driver.
He's also an escape artist.
It's ringing.
Oh my God.
Holly?
Holly, lie down.
Lie down.
Just lie down.
Tenir moi.
Holly?
Holly?
Somebody help me!
Help me!
Somebody help me!
Help me!
I usually pull him out of a hat.
You like me, don't you?
Yeah.
I want you to make me disappear.

Bonjour, Giles.
Ca va?
You're late.
Ca va bien, merci.
So how's my girl?
Serviced and ready to go.
Papers are in the glove box.
I got you something.
Just a little bon voyage.
You open it.
So you don't get lost.
Maybe I want to.
I'll miss you, Holly.
Come here.
Ladies, I'd like to introduce you to Giles.
As you can see, he's a real peach.
He's quick to learn and eager to please.
He doesn't get tired, and he goes off like a firecracker.

It doesn't matter.
I want the illusion.
That's what I'm paying for.
Just for an hour, I've got the biggest dick... [laughs]
The magic touch.
I can make you come in under a minute.
Prove it.
[moaning]
[moaning]
Oh, yeah.
[shouts]
Mm.
[phone ringing]
Yeah?
No, no.
You're early.
No problem.
Come up.
Fuck!
I got business.
Get in the bathroom and shut up.
Take your clothes.
Come on, move!
Move!
[hip-hop music playing]
[knocking at door]
Hello, Willie.
Lovely night for it.
Yes, top night, Mr. Bennett.
Things went great, I'm happy to say.
Fine.
[music stops]
Well, come on.
Make me happy.
They loved the gear.
You too?
Did you love it too?
Yeah.
I had a taste, Mr. Bennett.
I'm not gonna deny it.
Of course you did, Willie.
Yeah.
A good salesman's got to know his product.
Here.
You better count that.
[sighs] [belches]
Do you like bowling, Willie?
Dunno.
Why?
[gunshots]
Because now you're a bowling ball.
[elevator dings]
Drive!
You've rung Holly.
I'm tied up right now, but if you leave your name and number, I'll call you back to arrange an appointment.
Gotcha.
[gasping]
Fuck.
Fuck.
Calm down.
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Shh.
- He shot him in the head!
- Shut up!
I saw it!
I saw it!
Just calm down, all right?
All right?
[sobbing]
Oh, shit.
What the fuck are you looking at?
Where to?
Just drive.
He knew we were there.
He didn't see us.
How do you know?
You're safe.
Oh, fuck.
Stop.
Stop!
You don't know me.
I don't know you.
Hey.
Wait!
Where to?
Where can I take you?
Look, give me a destination or get out.
You all right?
Everyone's crazy tonight.
[soft rattling]
What's that?
Don't worry.
Shh.
Can't leave him at home.
He's part of my act.
Look, can I take you somewhere?
I'm hungry.
How about your favorite restaurant?
Vegas is the place for any serious magician.
My old man used to say that if you conquer Vegas, the world will follow.
If you could work at any casino, which one would it be?
Caesar's.
How come?
It's the coolest.
And he played there once on the same bill as Tom Jones.
Who?
Tom Jones?
The singer.
Forget it.
Your Dad sounds cool.
Yeah, he was.
I used to watch his shows over and over.
My dad was magic too.
He disappeared when I was born.
[both laugh]
What, you never saw him?
I got a stepdad.
Aren't you cold?
I left my coat at the hotel.
Here.
So what did you want to be when you grew up?
I never had a dream or anything.
Not like you.
Maybe I could be your...
Your lovely assistant.
Hello, Holly.
I'm Willie's friend.
You going somewhere?
Where's your friend?
Willie was a greedy turd.
He always got a double act.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That was foreplay.
Do you want to fuck with me?
Your friend with the pink lipstick.
She was from the street.
I don't know her name.
Wrong answer.
[screaming]
[gasping]
[distorted audio] [light jangling]
Look into my eyes and listen to the sound of my voice.
There is nothing but the sound of my voice and my eyes.
I will count backwards from five.
When I reach one, you will be under my spell.
Five.
I want you to completely free your mind.
Four.
All tension flows from your body.
Three.
You feel totally relaxed.
Two.
You're light as a feather.
One.
A deep sleep envelopes you.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Tell me your name.
Shay Maree Ryan.
How old are you, Shay?
17.
Tell me something about yourself.
I never forget a face.
Where are you from?
Up north.
Why are you here?
Mum died, so I ran away.
Sorry.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No.
[laughs]
Look at me.
You're beautiful.
Don't.
[phone chimes]
Can I see you again?
Do you want to see me or see me?
I want to see you.
"Harry the Impossible."
Will you call?
I don't just hypnotize anyone, you know.
It wouldn't work out.
How do you know if you don't take a chance?
What's in the bag, bitch?
Hand it over, and you won't get hurt.
You're the one'll get hurt.
Aww teach her some manners, Rock.
I'll teach her some fuckin' manners, all right.
Oh, fuck!
My fuckin' eyes!
[shouting] [screaming]
My fucking head!
You bitch!
[engine revving]
I fuckin' hate you people.
Open your mouth!
Open your mouth!
[wolf whistle]
[loud electronic music playing]
I want a room.
$25 the half, $30 the hour.
Five bucks for the towel.
No, for the...
for the night.
80 bucks for the night.
Room three, first floor, end of the corridor.
Thanks.
[music pounding in distance]
[woman moaning]
Whoo, oh, my God!
[shouting]
[screaming in distance]
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, Mum.
Don't you ever be afraid to take a chance, Shay, you know?
[groans]
We're looking for your friend.
I don't know her.
Yeah, but you know what she looks like, though, don't you?
Huh?
Don't ya?
No.
Ah!
Don't you?
Stop, stop.
[screams]
All right.
All right!
She didn't see you.
She can't hurt you.
You can't trust women.
Shit just fuckin' flies out of their mouth without them even thinking.
It's biological.
It's because they got a cunt hidden away.
It's natural they're gonna be hiding something.
With a bloke, it's all just there, isn't it?
What you see is what you get.
But women are fuckin' liars.
I fuckin' hate women.
Start looking.
[moaning]
[knocking at door]
Where's Rose?
Don't know.
Who are you?
I heard you from next door.
Have you got anything?
No.
Got a smoke?
Sorry.
Fuck.
What time is it?
It's late.
Where the fuck is she?
I'll get you some water.
Okay?
Sweet.
Here I am, baby.
Who the fuck are you?
She's the girl from next door.
Well, she can fuck off, because we're fuckin' busy.
I was just seeing if your friend was all right.
He's not my friend.
Hurry.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on!
Half.
Half.
Half!
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck.
The back of your hand.
Shut up, bitch!
Shut up.
Fuck!
[sighs]
Ooh.
You got any money?
No.
Bullshit.
Cutie like you.
Come on.
Give us some money.
I don't have any.
Fuck you.
[knocking at next door]
Hey, open the fucking door.
Come on, sweetheart.
Open the fucking door.
The welcome wagon.
Cunts.
That's the way it is.
They fucked me.
Now it's your turn.
[men shouting in hallway]
I could tell 'em you're here.
They'd pay me for it.
[footsteps retreating]
Thanks.
Get fucked.
Hey.
Pink lipstick.
Run!
[chaotic dance music]
Gotcha.
[tires screeching]
Get in!
[engine revs] [screams]
Are you all right?
[sighs]
What did he do to you?
[indistinct radio chatter]
Police radio.
What?
He's a cop.
Fuck.
You should go home.
I can't.
Somewhere else, then.
There's nowhere else.
I could stay with you.
I'm going to the airport to get on a plane out of here.
That guy'll come after me.
I offered you a job.
No one forced you.
You don't give a shit.
I just saved you.
I don't owe you anything.
[sobbing]
You can have the car.
I can't drive.
Get out.
Get out!
Get out!
[engine revs]
[melancholy music]
[horns honking]
[retching]
Hey.
Fuck off!
It's Shay.
Fully didn't recognize you.
Where you going?
Nowhere.
Can I come?
I saw a guy get killed.
You okay?
I think someone's after me.
Who's lookin' out for you?
Rocky will help.
He looks after me.
He'll love you.
Yeah.
I'll go get him.
Lend me some ciggie money?
I'll pay you back.
You're a real friend.
Don't move.
Get in.
I'm waiting for someone.
Shay, get in.
I met my first trick on this street.
I was so scared.
This big old man.
I thought he was gonna have a heart attack on me.
I promised myself, before I turned 30, I'd quit, move to Paris, reinvent myself.
It's my birthday today.
I've been fucking for money since I was 15.
I want a new life.
There's this guy.
He doesn't know that I'm leaving, and I don't want him to.
He can help us.
Who is he?
He's a cop.
[harsh electronic music]
[knocking on door]
Don't worry, ladies.
Safe as houses here.
Take a load off.
This is Bob's place.
No secrets between him and me.
Except where the bodies are buried.
[cackling]
Good one.
- Who's this?
- Shay.
We were on the job together.
You see what happened?
- He shot him in the head.
- Who shot him?
A cop named Bennett.
He tried to kill us.
He's after us, Michael.
Where'd you park his car darlin'?
We didn't say anything about a car.
[clattering]
Gotcha.
[laughing]
Mate, you got more bruises than a Queensland banana.
[laughing]
I reckon your nose looks better on this side.
[laughing]
Fonzie got busted!
[laughing] [muffled struggling]
Laugh now, you fuckin' dog!
Where's my car, cunt?
Settle down.
Get out of my way.
You made enough mistakes tonight.
Fuckin' settle down.
Look at my suit.
That bitch broke my fuckin' nose.
- You can have the girl.
- What do you care?
Holly's mine.
Oh, mate.
She's a fuckin' whore.
She's pissing off.
Her place was empty.
She's coming with me.
No, no, look at her bag.
I saw the ticket.
Whores only love money.
Everything else is an act.
[grunting]
[gunshot]
Back to the car.
He was lying, Michael.
I remember the first time I saw you.
I arrested you just so I could hear your voice.
I'm gonna believe you, Holly.
We're rich enough to disappear.
What about Shay?
It's just you and me now.
She's my friend.
It's just you and me now.
Look in my eyes and say yes.
No.
I can't.
Tell me it wasn't all an act.
[loud bang]
Police!
Police!
Get in the car.
Get in the car!
Move!
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!
Drop the fucking gun!
Drive, or I'll fucking kill you!
Come on!
Step on the fucking peddle.
Come on!
[tires squealing] [distorted audio]
Faster!
[screams] [distorted audio]
Come on!
Come on!
[distorted audio]
Come on!
Faster!
[silence]
Holly.
Okay.
Holly.
[siren wailing in distance]
The case.
[siren wailing in distance] [sirens wailing]
[sirens wailing in distance]
It's just a scratch.
You're still beautiful.
What time's your flight?
I'll never make it now.
You've got to try.
I'll call Harry.
Who?
The taxi driver.
He's also an escape artist.
[coughs]
- It's ringing.
- [coughs]
Oh my God.
Holly?
[gasps]
Holly, lie down.
Lie down.
Just lie down.
Tenir moi.
[distant sirens wailing]
Holly?
Holly?
[sobbing] Somebody help me!
Help me!
Somebody help me!
Help me!
[droning tone]
[foreboding ambient music]
[waves crashing]
[bird squawking]
I usually pull him out of a hat.
You like me, don't you?
Yeah.
I want you to make me disappear.
[waves crashing]
[soft melancholy music]
[woman singing in French]
[music builds]
[woman singing in French]
Previously on Sanctuary...
All right.
Adam, what are you doing here?
Helen, I'm sorry to intrude.
James.
Burnt down any more laboratories recently?
That was 10 years ago, and it was an accident.
Really?
What do you want, Adam?
It's me daughter, Imogene.
She's gravely ill, a rare blood disease.
I beg of you, help her.
[Magnus]:
We battled until the very end.
We tried everything.
Loss of a daughter, it's a wound that never heals.
[Screaming in anguish]
He told me he intended to use the device to save his daughter.
Time travel?
It's impossible.
But he said he'd found a way.
You would have been altering the course of history.
That was the point.
If Adam succeeds in altering the timeline, then everything about our world, the refugees, the Sanctuary, our very lives will be irreparably damaged.
We may even cease to exist.
Praxis...
It's gone.
What happened here?
Worth.
He must have made another attempt to power up the machine.
[Shoots]
[Magnus]:
Adam, what are you doing?
This is madness.
I have a chance to get my daughter back.
Are you telling me you wouldn't do the same thing?
Not at the expense of everyone on the planet.
You're too late.
[Wagons clattering over cobblestones]
[Horses whinny]
Stay back!
[Gasping in fright]
Adam!
[Firing gun]
[Bullets ricochet]
What was that?
!
[Police whistles trilling distantly]
[Gunshots blast]
[Laser snipes]
Hoping for a quick finish, Helen?
Me too.
Don't make things worse, Adam.
Neither of us can be here.
We both know it.
It's only time travel, Helen.
What's the worst that could happen?
Aside from destroying the natural order of history?
What, by creating a utopia?
[Police whistles blare sharply]
By taking over the world.
[Laser snipes]
[Bricks shatter and crumble]
[Magnus groans]
[Police whistles blare]
Over here!
By the rubble.
She's down the alley, that way!
Call the Bobby!

Hasn't said a word.
Wouldn't let the Doctor near her, neither.
Has she put up any kind of resistance?
Been as gentle as a débutante, despite all the weapons we found on her.
Never seen anything like 'em.
I would say Miss Magnus' reputation as odd remains intact.
It's Dr. Magnus, and I will need everything you took from her.
Look, there are no charges, no evidence to suppress.
I'm just making your life easier, Lestrade, as usual.
Fine, but you owe me for this, Watson.
Are you ready to come home, Helen?
I received a message that you'd been found injured, half dressed, and discharging a weapon in public.
If you had a lead in the case, you could at least have informed me.
I should have, I realize that.
Th-things just got away from me, I'm afraid.
It was him, wasn't it?
I was right.
Helen, how could you face him on your own?
I didn't get a good look at who it was.
I just...
I got overexcited, and I fell, and I...
I should've called you... c-contacted you.
Thank you, James.
"Overexcited"?
That's your explanation for your incredibly strange attire, weapons that I have never seen... and your hair, for God's sake.
When did you do that?
It's late, and it's been a hell of a night.
Helen, at least let me take a look at your head.
You... you've taken a terrible tumble.
I'm fine.
Really.
I can see myself home.
Good night, James.
Helen...
What on earth's come over you?
Dear God, I still have this in my study.
It arrived yesterday from Mozambique.
[Weapons thud heavily]
I would say your father was having a wonderful time on the dark continent.
I believe he's sent a new form of iodine.
Let me, James.
Medicine was always your weak spot.
"Was"?
It's a scalp wound and a mild concussion.
I hardly need a nursemaid.
Will you stop looking at me like that?
How should I be looking at you?
Just...
Leave me alone.
[Guns clattering heavily]
No, no.
Don't do that.
What the devil is that made of?
These numbers, are they significant?
This?
What's the...
The design...
The purpose...
[Chimes as it activates]
How...
How is that powered?
James, ignore all of this.
Ignore me.
"Browning automatic"?
I've never heard of that, and yet, I know every weapons manufacturer in the world.
[Clip slides out, clattering]
Amazing!
The release time...
Leave.
Right now.
Not a chance.
It's my Sanctuary.
Is it?
From the moment you walked in here, you've been behaving as if you were visiting someone's grave.
It may have been your Sanctuary a long time ago, but not anymore.
Business cards made from a substance I can't identify, issued 2010, expires 2015?
Weapons that I have never seen or heard of.
Clothes designed for maximum movement and protection.
I am Helen--
Oh, you definitely are Helen Magnus, just not of this era.
I'm a...
Detective.
Well, then.
Now you understand why you have to leave.
Because by being here, you may disrupt the timeline, change the future as you know it.
But how is this possible?
I came here on a mission.
If I fail, everything that is meant to be, everything that I build from now until my present could be destroyed.
Who were you chasing?
Honestly,
Helen.
Whatever your mission is, it's got off to a very bad start.
You need help, and seeing as I know the truth, what choice do you have but to let me in?
No questions about the future, near or distant?
Adam Worth, that's who I was chasing.
From Oxford?
What on earth...
He's come from the future as well.
I followed him here after John and I were...
John Druitt ?
Dear God, does everyone from our era live on to the 21st century?
Not everyone.
Oh.
I'll tell you only what you need to know to prevent Adam from irrevocably damaging the future, nothing more.
Time travel is actually possible.
H.G. would be ecstatic.
But by simply being here, haven't you already changed things?
I'll not give you a lesson in temporal theory, nice try, but had I arrived a century, or even millennia ago, the effect on my future would likely be more severe.
So the shorter the time scale, the less the effect on the future.
Unless, of course, Adam does something to dramatically alter the course of events.
Or you do.
Do we have a deal?
Everything you brought with you must be destroyed.
And you need to change.
[Exhales in relief]
Don't even think about it.
It's a communication device, isn't it?
Better?
Much.
Good.
No questions.
Imogene?
Imogene...
I need to make another trip to the apothecary,
I'm afraid, love.
I won't be long.
[Kisses her]
[Sighing with emotion]
Oh, it was all worth it.
Papa?
Imogene.
How are you feeling, darling?
Fine.
Just a bit tired.
What did you do to your hair?
No, no... just a little cut.
I've done the most wonderful thing.
I've found a cure for your condition.
But you said there was no...
No, no, no, that's all changed.
For the better, I promise.
Oh no.
What's happened?
No...
Nothing, just...
A little hole.
I can fix that, though.
It's not a problem.
You look good.
Give us a smile.
[Chuckling happily]
All right, let's get a move on.
He should still be in the city, but maybe not for long.
The Adam Worth from your time.
Now, he's come here for what reason?
[Worth]:
Open the door.
Open it now.
I'll throttle ya.
- Sir...
- Look, I'm not joking.
[Cocking guns]
You'll end up in the garden.
- Open the door...
- I can't.
Thank you.
Adam?
Helen, James.
Sorry to intrude.
Burned any laboratories recently?
That was 10 years ago, and it was an accident.
[Whispering] 10 years...
Listen, it's me daughter, Imogene.
She's gravely ill.
It's a rare blood disease.
Now, I've tried every treatment possible, every method and you want my help.
Thank you, Helen, but actually, I- I've come for his help.
You see, she's missing.
Someone's taken her.
I just don't understand who would do this.
I haven't much money.
She's just a child.
Worth, be a good chap and ask the night ward for the visitor manifest, will you?
There's no sign of a struggle.
She went without resistance.
Of course she did.
She thought he was her father.
In the past I remember, Adam came to us for help finding a cure for Imogene two months from now.
This moment never happened.
And now this future Adam has his daughter.
And a cure?
Which means he's already altered the future, forever.
[Sighs in frustration]
[Thunder rumbles]
Please, are there any clues?
Suspects?
We'd know more if you told us what you were working on, Adam.
Well, I told you,
I'm trying to find a cure for her disease.
Which is an expensive proposition.
You'd need money, resources, which means some sort of extortion plot or larcenous act.
What?
No,
I'd never resort to that--
Those lab fires were hardly an accident, and the toxins you were formulating at Oxford,
I know you've created prototypes--
My daughter is missing!
And if you want to find her, you will give us names, places, safehouses, everything you are secretly planning to unleash on this city.
You're mad.
Helen, that's enough.
I thought you understood my situation.
I guess I know better now.
I'll find her myself.
Has society gone back to the Dark Ages?
He's done nothing wrong.
Not yet, but he will, believe me.
And if you interrogate him in this manner, it will be you who has altered the natural order of things.
Helen, you have far too much knowledge about this time and place.
Use that carefully.
We need to find Adam, future-Adam, before too much damage is done.
Finding people is what I do, if you recall...
But I will ask you to curb your temper as we go forward.
Of course.
James, I'm-I'm sorry.
You can see yourself home.
[Glass shattering]
[Druitt screams]:
Don't lie to me!
[Helen]:
Five murders, their throats cut, their bodies desecrated in a manner that few beings can achieve.
Instant escape from the crime scene?
And so it must be me?
You seem flattered.
[Chuckling] Oh, I am.
Deft manner of proving your innocence, threatening my life.
Call it self-preservation.
Why on earth should I let you frame me for crimes I haven't committed?
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to fear [cocking gun]
You sound just like James.
How much time have you been spending together?
And now jealousy.
For whom?
How dare you question my motives?
My...
Feelings?
You...
You hunt me like an animal.
After all we've been through.
My heart... is yours.
[Roars in rage]
[Helen screams]
[Yelps in fright]
Look...
In my face.
Look at my face.
Damn!
[Uncocks gun]
[Sniffling]
[Thunder rumbles]
Helen?
Over here.
Any word on Adam's whereabouts?
What's wrong?
Druitt was here.
John?
Are you...
is she...
We're both fine, thank you.
He's not happy that you like him for the latest Ripper killings, made sure I knew it.
Not happy because I'm right?
Oh, all right, no questions,
I understand.
But you did make a point of letting me know that he paid you a visit, which I will take to mean that I must keep focused on the case.
Adam Worth?
He is expected at the Reformer Club in Pall Mall this evening.
Whether it's the future or the present Adam,
I-I don't know.
Good.
If we hurry, we'll beat him there.
[Magnus]:
James, is that you?
Darling!
Hello.
There you are.
Are you ready to work?
Yes, if you are.
Absolutely.
Now, I've been re-thinking your last theory, and I found a few holes, I'm afraid.
Ah.
You can't come in here.
A woman?
Inconceivable.
Simon, come quick.
May I assist you?
I'm here to see Adam Worth.
I have no record of any guests for Mr. Worth.
I will gladly leave him a message, miss...
Dr. Helen Magnus.
Consider it done.
I'll hail you a cab.
I'll only be a minute.
The club is for members only.
Remove your hand.
Right now-- how dare you?
She's with me.
Whatever took you so long, love?
Shame on you.
She's a lady.
Is that a revolver under your bustle, or are you just happy to see me?
Oh, it's a gun.
Any last words?
Well, "don't shoot!"
Never seems to work with you.
How about,
"kill me here, and alter the future in a most dr... the infamous Helen Magnus, murderer of a patron of a gentleman's club.
Quite the departure from your destiny, I'd say.
Cheers.
I do miss this era.
A simpler, more elegant time.
I will kill you, Adam.
What for?
To save the future?
What makes what we left behind so precious?
With Praxis destroyed,
God knows what threat my people are facing in the present.
Most likely you've created chaos for Hollow Earth and the surface that will take years to clean up.
None of that has happened yet, and guess what?
Maybe it never does.
Move on, I say.
Change the future.
Make it whatever you want it to be.
You know what I find interesting is that you're sitting here, sipping Brandy with these stiffs instead of skipping off into the sunset with Imogene.
I like it here.
There's been a complication.
You haven't cured her yet.
That's why you're here, to borrow money to fund your plan, which I am certain has gone entirely pear-shaped.
It's a matter of time, love, and only that.
Bustle or no,
I'll be out that door before your head hits this table.
Doubtful.
Simon!
The lady is ready to leave now.
Thanks for the offer, ma'am, but I'm a family man, and a gentleman.
[Sighs in perturbation]
Women.
Dr. Magnus?
Message for you.
James, please.
But you have been through all this before.
For God's sake, you could save lives!
We both know I can't interfere.
Then there will be blood on your hands.
Not if you do your job and stop looking for a short cut.
And if your very presence here has changed the course of events, interfered with the investigation, what then?
Can you live with that?
No, please, spare me.
I don't want to know the answer.
Because in the future, emotions, empathy, humanity, ceases to exist... you should have caught him by now.
[Sighs in exasperation]
Yes, my presence here may have altered things, possibly for the worst.
That woman who died tonight should be the last victim.
But she won't be.
Remember the purpose of the Sanctuary.
To find and help unfortunate creatures, to protect them.
To keep the public safe.
Do that, and this case will be solved without any further bloodshed.
And if I can't?
That's an expression I've rarely heard you use.
What are you making?
Arsenic.
Strychnine..?
A toxin.
A last resort.
To mimic the blood disease that kills Imogene.
A fail-safe in case Adam cures her.
Dear God...
I'm not even sure I can finish making it, let alone give it to her.
If there was any other way to stop Adam Worth from completely disrupting the timeline...
Humanity isn't completely dead in the future, just so you know.
You're going out?
Where?
Hunting.
Your hair.
I like it.
I don't have time for this, John.
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear earlier.
[Switchblade snaps]
Hunting me will only make things more difficult for you.
Let me pass.
There's only one way to make you pay attention.
[Blows thud]
You're insane.
Oh, very much so.
Fancy some more?
[Joints crunching]
[Roars in pain]
How on earth did you... ?
[Blow thuds heavily]
[Druitt groans]
[Blows thudding]
[Druitt gasps]
How does it feel?
Cold steel against your jugular?
In the hands of someone who knows how to kill you slowly and has the will to do it?
H-Helen?
Are you paying attention?
Stay away from me.
[Beast growls]
[Snarling]
[Roars]
Hello, Jack.
Know my name, do you?
Yes, I know who you are.
Jack knows you.
You're Gregory's little girl.
My father helped you, years ago.
Saved your life.
You're not a little girl anymore.
Older now.
Much, much older.
Smell like nothing I know.
You promised my father you wouldn't kill again.
That you'd leave London--
Jack did leave!
People hunted me down, like a dog!
This is my hunting ground.
If humans hunt Jack, then Jack hunts humans.
Here!
My ground!
The city's bigger.
You'll be found and killed.
Ah, I'm strong.
I'm too fast for them.
They'll never find me.
I can, and I will.
You can die like an animal or live with my protection.
Be safe from humans.
Humans can go to hell!
With my help.
If you kill again, I can't guarantee your safety.
Stop now, and I'll give you Sanctuary.
You have my word, and my father's.
I'm your friend.
[Roaring]
Spring-heeled Jack.
Thanks, love.
So different.
Such odd looking pieces.
You actually designed these?
Ah...
Some of them, yes.
To help me?
You are all I've been thinking about for a very long time.
Good.
You look tired.
I wish you'd take a rest.
I'm too close here, Imogene.
But once this is done, we'll be able to get all the rest we want.
Go places together, see things you've never seen that'll amaze you.
Soon, not only will we be able to see the world together, it will be ours for the taking.
Anything you want, anything at all, we take it, control it, use it to create whatever future we want.
I've never heard you talk this way before.
You're different.
So confident.
[Chuckles]
Chance of getting a biscuit with me tea?
As his lordship pleases.
This better be good.
I just climbed up six flights of stairs in new boots.
I was thinking about what you said, and I think you're right.
It isn't John doing these murders.
I'm listening.
Another creature, as violent and dangerous as him, with its own unique method of near-instant escape.
As I've been saying, but as you keep pointing out, none of the other possibilities make any sense.
No one can teleport like John.
What about incredible super strength?
The ability to leap quickly to high ground.
Rooftops.
Exactly.
You're certain.
[Girl]:
Yes, ma'am.
Up those stairs with a dark wood door.
Thank you.
Dear God, Adam.
Before you start threatening me, or shooting me, for that matter, we still have that nagging problem of the witnesses.
Hello.
Imogene.
Dr. Helen Magnus, this is my daughter, Imogene.
You must be one of my dad's colleagues.
He said some friends might drop by.
How lovely to meet you, Doctor.
[Worth]:
Dr. Helen here is a ground-breaker, just like you.
What have you done, Adam?
How are you feeling, Imogene?
Better than I have in years.
Thanks to papa here.
No...
[Worth]:
Oh yes.
Healthy as a horse, I'm afraid.
Welcome to the future, Helen.
So, now that the game is over, what say we put away our guns, yes?
Starting with yours.
Unlikely.
Papa?
Are you going to shoot me in front of my own flesh and blood?
That's cold, Helen, even for you.
What's the meaning of this?
I'm sorry, Imogene, but this man is not your father.
Please, leave him alone.
I know it looks like him, but this man has ended millions of innocent lives, caused unimaginable destruction.
Don't listen to her, darling.
All of it lies.
Destroying Praxis?
Altering the timeline?
You have to be stopped, Adam.
Please, leave him alone!
[Electricity crackles]
[Bolts zap]
Papa?
What is that?
Just some insurance.
Stay here.
I won't be long.
Shaming me in front of my daughter, Helen?
Very impolite!
[Weapon blasts]
[Firing gun]
[Police whistles blaring]
[Thunder rumbles]
[Device beeping]
Oh, bloody hell...
[Sonic blast erupts]
[Glass shattering]
[Muffled]:
Drop the gun!
I said, drop the gun!
You just had to get all high and mighty with your amazing future, didn't you?
Couldn't get with the program.
No.
[Knife snaps open]
You stupid, small-minded-- [throws knife]
[Police whistles blare closer]
[Roaring angrily]
[Energy bolt snipes]
Papa?
Adam, no!
[Bolt snipes]
[Bricks crumbling]
Imogene!
No!
[Whistles blaring]
Imogene!
Imogene!
[Sobbing in anguish]
Stay back.
Do it, Adam.
We both go.
Neither of us belongs here.
Everything I've worked for, everything I care about destroyed!
By you.
I'll kill you for this, I swear!
[Fires]
[Police whistle blares nearby]
[Crowd murmuring in concern]
[Helen]:
Please.
Please, make room.
Dear God.
It's Adam's daughter.
The eaves must have collapsed on her.
Imogene?
Get away from her.
I'm so sorry.
Imogene?
Imogene?
Imogene?
Imogene...
No...
What have you done?
Both of you!
Adam-- if you'd have helped, she'd still be alive right now.
Her blood is on your hands.
And your hands!
We'd better be on our way, Helen.
Oh, that poor man.
[Sobbing]
[Roaring in anguish]
Spring-heeled Jack, the Sanctuary's newest resident.
I wish I could've told you earlier.
All that matters is that the streets of London are safe again.
As they should be.
I never meant to burden you, James.
All this knowledge you have to keep secret.
Oh, I love it, you know that.
What, all the deductive reasoning I'll be able to do with the little tidbits you've left me?
It's going to keep me occupied for decades, if I have that long.
In my future you do, many of them.
No, I don't want to know.
Far too much information.
Now that we've cleaned up all evidence of Adam, and the technology he brought with him,
I suppose there's only one thing left undone.
What to do about you.
I can't be here, James.
We both know it.
Everything I touch, everyone I meet...
Could ruin my future.
You'd best kill yourself.
I'm glad we both agree.
Helen, suicide?
[Chuckles]
You're so melodramatic.
Do you have a better idea?
I'm trapped here, and I have no way home.
You can always go home.
It just might take a little while.
It's one of the benefits of your incredibly slow aging.
Disappear.
Go somewhere... remote, with limited contact with the rest of world.
Spend the time thinking about...
All the things you've lived through.
113 years of seclusion?
Then you re-join your timeline just after you've left it.
Unless, of course, you're determined to do yourself in.
A vacation?
From what I gather, you've... rather earned one.

Previously on Sanctuary...
All right.
Adam, what are you doing here?
Helen, I'm sorry to intrude.
James.
Burnt down any more laboratories recently?
That was 10 years ago, and it was an accident.
Really?
What do you want, Adam?
It's me daughter, imogene.
She's gravely ill, a rare blood disease.
I beg of you, help her.
We battled until the very end.
We tried everything.
Loss of a daughter, it's a wound that never heals.
He told me he intended to use the device to save his daughter.
Time travel?
It's impossible.
But he said he'd found a way.
You would have been altering the course of history.
That was the point.
If Adam succeeds in altering the timeline, then everything about our world, the refugees, the Sanctuary, our very lives will be irreparably damaged.
We may even cease to exist.
Praxis...
It's gone.
What happened here?
Worth.
He must have made another attempt to power up the machine.
Adam, what are you doing?
This is madness.
I have a chance to get my daughter back.
Are you telling me you wouldn't do the same thing?
Not at the expense of everyone on the planet.
You're too late.
Stay back!
Adam!
What was that?
!
Hoping for a quick finish, Helen?
Me too.
Don't make things worse, Adam.
Neither of us can be here.
We both know it.
It's only time travel, Helen.
What's the worst that could happen?
Aside from destroying the natural order of history?
What, by creating a utopia?
By taking over the world.
Over here!
By the rubble.
She's down the alley, that way!
Call the Bobby!

♪
Hasn't said a word.
Wouldn't let the Doctor near her, neither.
Has she put up any kind of resistance?
Been as gentle as a debutante, despite all the weapons we found on her.
Never seen anything like 'em.
I would say Miss Magnus' reputation as odd remains intact.
It's Dr. Magnus, and I will need everything you took from her.
Look, there are no charges, no evidence to suppress.
I'm just making your life easier, Lestrade, as usual.
Fine, but you owe me for this, Watson.
Are you ready to come home, Helen?
I received a message that you'd been found injured, half dressed, and discharging a weapon in public.
If you had a lead in the case, you could at least have informed me.
I should have, I realize that.
Th-things just got away from me, I'm afraid.
It was him, wasn't it?
I was right.
Helen, how could you face him on your own?
I didn't get a good look at who it was.
I just...
I got overexcited, and I fell, and I--
I should've called you-- c-contacted you.
Thank you, James.
"Overexcited"?
That's your explanation for your incredibly strange attire, weapons that I have never seen-- and your hair, for God's sake.
When did you do that?
It's late, and it's been a hell of a night.
Helen, at least let me take a look at your head.
You-- you've taken a terrible tumble.
I'm fine.
Really.
I can see myself home.
Good night, James.
Helen...
What on earth's come over you?
Dear God, I still have this in my study.
It arrived yesterday from Mozambique.
I would say your father was having a wonderful time on the dark continent.
I believe he's sent a new form of iodine.
Let me, James.
Medicine was always your weak spot.
"Was"?
It's a scalp wound and a mild concussion.
I hardly need a nursemaid.
Will you stop looking at me like that?
How should I be looking at you?
Just...
Leave me alone.
No, no.
Don't do that.
What the devil is that made of?
These numbers, are they significant?
This?
What's the...
The design...
The purpose...
How...
How is that powered?
James, ignore all of this.
Ignore me.
"Browning automatic"?
I've never heard of that, and yet, I know every weapons manufacturer in the world.
Amazing!
The release time--
Leave.
Right now.
Not a chance.
It's my Sanctuary.
Is it?
From the moment you walked in here, you've been behaving as if you were visiting someone's grave.
It may have been your Sanctuary a long time ago, but not anymore.
Business cards made from a substance I can't identify, issued 2010, expires 2015?
Weapons that I have never seen or heard of.
Clothes designed for maximum movement and protection.
I am Helen--
Oh, you definitely are Helen Magnus, just not of this era.
I'm a...
Detective.
Well, then.
Now you understand why you have to leave.
Because by being here, you may disrupt the timeline, change the future as you know it.
But how is this possible?
I came here on a mission.
If I fail, everything that is meant to be, everything that I build from now until my present could be destroyed.
Who were you chasing?
Honestly,
Helen.
Whatever your mission is, it's got off to a very bad start.
You need help, and seeing as I know the truth, what choice do you have but to let me in?
No questions about the future, near or distant?
Adam Worth, that's who I was chasing.
From Oxford?
What on earth--
He's come from the future as well.
I followed him here after John and I were--
John Druitt ?
Dear God, does everyone from our era live on to the 21st century?
Not everyone.
Oh.
I'll tell you only what you need to know to prevent Adam from irrevocably damaging the future, nothing more.
Time travel is actually possible.
H.G. would be ecstatic.
But by simply being here, haven't you already changed things?
I'll not give you a lesson in temporal theory, nice try, but had I arrived a century, or even millennia ago, the effect on my future would likely be more severe.
So the shorter the time scale, the less the effect on the future.
Unless, of course, Adam does something to dramatically alter the course of events.
Or you do.
Do we have a deal?
Everything you brought with you must be destroyed.
And you need to change.
Don't even think about it.
It's a communication device, isn't it?
Better?
Much.
Good.
No questions.
Imogene?
Imogene...
I need to make another trip to the apothecary,
I'm afraid, love.
I won't be long.
Oh, it was all worth it.
Papa?
Imogene.
How are you feeling, darling?
Fine.
Just a bit tired.
What did you do to your hair?
No, no... just a little cut.
I've done the most wonderful thing.
I've found a cure for your condition.
But you said there was no--
No, no, no, that's all changed.
For the better, I promise.
Oh no.
What's happened?
No...
Nothing, just...
A little hole.
I can fix that, though.
It's not a problem.
You look good.
Give us a smile.
All right, let's get a move on.
He should still be in the city, but maybe not for long.
The Adam Worth from your time.
Now, he's come here for what reason?
Open the door.
Open it now.
I'll throttle ya.
- Sir--
- Look, I'm not joking.
You'll end up in the garden.
- Open the door--
- I can't.
Thank you.
Adam?
Helen, James.
Sorry to intrude.
Burned any laboratories recently?
That was 10 years ago, and it was an accident.
10 years...
Listen, it's me daughter, Imogene.
She's gravely ill.
It's a rare blood disease.
Now, I've tried every treatment possible, every method and you want my help.
Thank you, Helen, but actually, I- I've come for his help.
You see, she's missing.
Someone's taken her.
I just don't understand who would do this.
I haven't much money.
She's just a child.
Worth, be a good chap and ask the night ward for the visitor manifest, will you?
There's no sign of a struggle.
She went without resistance.
Of course she did.
She thought he was her father.
In the past I remember, Adam came to us for help finding a cure for Imogene two months from now.
This moment never happened.
And now this future Adam has his daughter.
And a cure?
Which means he's already altered the future, forever.
Please, are there any clues?
Suspects?
We'd know more if you told us what you were working on, Adam.
Well, I told you,
I'm trying to find a cure for her disease.
Which is an expensive proposition.
You'd need money, resources, which means some sort of extortion plot or larcenous act.
What?
No,
I'd never resort to that--
Those lab fires were hardly an accident, and the toxins you were formulating at Oxford,
I know you've created prototypes--
My daughter is missing!
And if you want to find her, you will give us names, places, safehouses, everything you are secretly planning to unleash on this city.
You're mad.
Helen, that's enough.
I thought you understood my situation.
I guess I know better now.
I'll find her myself.
Has society gone back to the Dark Ages?
He's done nothing wrong.
Not yet, but he will, believe me.
And if you interrogate him in this manner, it will be you who has altered the natural order of things.
Helen, you have far too much knowledge about this time and place.
Use that carefully.
We need to find Adam, future-Adam, before too much damage is done.
Finding people is what I do, if you recall...
But I will ask you to curb your temper as we go forward.
Of course.
James, I'm-I'm sorry.
You can see yourself home.
Don't lie to me!
Five murders, their throats cut, their bodies desecrated in a manner that few beings can achieve.
Instant escape from the crime scene?
And so it must be me?
You seem flattered.
Oh, I am.
Deft manner of proving your innocence, threatening my life.
Call it self-preservation.
Why on earth should I let you frame me for crimes I haven't committed?
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to fear
You sound just like James.
How much time have you been spending together?
And now jealousy.
For whom?
How dare you question my motives?
My...
Feelings?
You...
You hunt me like an animal.
After all we've been through.
My heart... is yours.
Look...
In my face.
Look at my face.
Damn!
Helen?
Over here.
Any word on Adam's whereabouts?
What's wrong?
Druitt was here.
John?
Are you-- is she--
We're both fine, thank you.
He's not happy that you like him for the latest Ripper killings, made sure I knew it.
Not happy because I'm right?
Oh, all right, no questions,
I understand.
But you did make a point of letting me know that he paid you a visit, which I will take to mean that I must keep focused on the case.
Adam Worth?
He is expected at the Reformer Club in Pall Mall this evening.
Whether it's the future or the present Adam,
I-I don't know.
Good.
If we hurry, we'll beat him there.
James, is that you?
Darling!
Hello.
There you are.
Are you ready to work?
Yes, if you are.
Absolutely.
Now, I've been re-thinking your last theory, and I found a few holes, I'm afraid.
Ah.
You can't come in here.
A woman?
Inconceivable.
Simon, come quick.
May I assist you?
I'm here to see Adam Worth.
I have no record of any guests for Mr. Worth.
I will gladly leave him a message, miss...
Dr. Helen Magnus.
Consider it done.
I'll hail you a cab.
I'll only be a minute.
The club is for members only.
Remove your hand.
Right now-- how dare you?
She's with me.
Whatever took you so long, love?
Shame on you.
She's a lady.
Is that a revolver under your bustle, or are you just happy to see me?
Oh, it's a gun.
Any last words?
Well, "don't shoot!"
Never seems to work with you.
How about,
"kill me here, and alter the future in a most dr the infamous Helen Magnus, murderer of a patron of a gentleman's club.
Quite the departure from your destiny, I'd say.
Cheers.
I do miss this era.
A simpler, more elegant time.
I will kill you, Adam.
What for?
To save the future?
What makes what we left behind so precious?
With Praxis destroyed,
God knows what threat my people are facing in the present.
Most likely you've created chaos for Hollow Earth and the surface that will take years to clean up.
None of that has happened yet, and guess what?
Maybe it never does.
Move on, I say.
Change the future.
Make it whatever you want it to be.
You know what I find interesting is that you're sitting here, sipping Brandy with these stiffs instead of skipping off into the sunset with Imogene.
I like it here.
There's been a complication.
You haven't cured her yet.
That's why you're here, to borrow money to fund your plan, which I am certain has gone entirely pear-shaped.
It's a matter of time, love, and only that.
Bustle or no,
I'll be out that door before your head hits this table.
Doubtful.
Simon!
The lady is ready to leave now.
Thanks for the offer, ma'am, but I'm a family man, and a gentleman.
Women.
Dr. Magnus?
Message for you.
James, please.
But you have been through all this before.
For God's sake, you could save lives!
We both know I can't interfere.
Then there will be blood on your hands.
Not if you do your job and stop looking for a short cut.
And if your very presence here has changed the course of events, interfered with the investigation, what then?
Can you live with that?
No, please, spare me.
I don't want to know the answer.
Because in the future, emotions, empathy, humanity, ceases to exist-- you should have caught him by now.
Yes, my presence here may have altered things, possibly for the worst.
That woman who died tonight should be the last victim.
But she won't be.
Remember the purpose of the Sanctuary.
To find and help unfortunate creatures, to protect them.
To keep the public safe.
Do that, and this case will be solved without any further bloodshed.
And if I can't?
That's an expression I've rarely heard you use.
What are you making?
Arsenic.
Strychnine..?
A toxin.
A last resort.
To mimic the blood disease that kills Imogene.
A fail-safe in case Adam cures her.
Dear God...
I'm not even sure I can finish making it, let alone give it to her.
If there was any other way to stop Adam Worth from completely disrupting the timeline...
Humanity isn't completely dead in the future, just so you know.
You're going out?
Where?
Hunting.
Your hair.
I like it.
I don't have time for this, John.
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear earlier.
Hunting me will only make things more difficult for you.
Let me pass.
There's only one way to make you pay attention.
You're insane.
Oh, very much so.
Fancy some more?
How on earth did you-- ?
How does it feel?
Cold steel against your jugular?
In the hands of someone who knows how to kill you slowly and has the will to do it?
H-Helen?
Are you paying attention?
Stay away from me.
Hello, Jack.
Know my name, do you?
Yes, I know who you are.
Jack knows you.
You're Gregory's little girl.
My father helped you, years ago.
Saved your life.
You're not a little girl anymore.
Older now.
Much, much older.
Smell like nothing I know.
You promised my father you wouldn't kill again.
That you'd leave London--
Jack did leave!
People hunted me down, like a dog!
This is my hunting ground.
If humans hunt Jack, then Jack hunts humans.
Here!
My ground!
The city's bigger.
You'll be found and killed.
Ah, I'm strong.
I'm too fast for them.
They'll never find me.
I can, and I will.
You can die like an animal or live with my protection.
Be safe from humans.
Humans can go to hell!
With my help.
If you kill again, I can't guarantee your safety.
Stop now, and I'll give you Sanctuary.
You have my word, and my father's.
I'm your friend.
Spring-heeled Jack.
Thanks, love.
So different.
Such odd looking pieces.
You actually designed these?
Ah...
Some of them, yes.
To help me?
You are all I've been thinking about for a very long time.
Good.

But once this is done, we'll be able to get all the rest we want.
Go places together, see things you've never seen that'll amaze you.
Soon, not only will we be able to see the world together, it will be ours for the taking.
Anything you want, anything at all, we take it, control it, use it to create whatever future we want.
I've never heard you talk this way before.

Very impolite!
Oh, bloody hell...

I said, drop the gun!
You just had to get all high and mighty with your amazing future, didn't you?
Couldn't get with the program.
No.
You stupid, small-minded--
Papa?
Adam, no!
Imogene!
No!
Imogene!
Imogene!
Stay back.
Do it, Adam.
We both go.
Neither of us belongs here.
Everything I've worked for, everything I care about destroyed!
By you.
I'll kill you for this, I swear!
Please.
Please, make room.
Dear God.
It's Adam's daughter.
The eaves must have collapsed on her.
Imogene?
Get away from her.
I'm so sorry.
Imogene?
Imogene?
Imogene?
Imogene...
No...
What have you done?
Both of you!
Adam-- if you'd have helped, she'd still be alive right now.
Her blood is on your hands.
And your hands!
We'd better be on our way, Helen.
Oh, that poor man.
Spring-heeled Jack, the Sanctuary's newest resident.
I wish I could've told you earlier.
All that matters is that the streets of London are safe again.
As they should be.
I never meant to burden you, James.
All this knowledge you have to keep secret.
Oh, I love it, you know that.
What, all the deductive reasoning I'll be able to do with the little tidbits you've left me?
It's going to keep me occupied for decades, if I have that long.
In my future you do, many of them.
No, I don't want to know.
Far too much information.
Now that we've cleaned up all evidence of Adam, and the technology he brought with him,
I suppose there's only one thing left undone.
What to do about you.
I can't be here, James.
We both know it.
Everything I touch, everyone I meet...
Could ruin my future.
You'd best kill yourself.
I'm glad we both agree.
Helen, suicide?
You're so melodramatic.
Do you have a better idea?
I'm trapped here, and I have no way home.
You can always go home.
It just might take a little while.
It's one of the benefits of your incredibly slow aging.
Disappear.
Go somewhere... remote, with limited contact with the rest of world.
Spend the time thinking about...
All the things you've lived through.
113 years of seclusion?
Then you re-join your timeline just after you've left it.
Unless, of course, you're determined to do yourself in.
A vacation?
From what I gather, you've... rather earned one.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Previously on Sanctuary...
All right.
Adam, what are you doing here?
Helen, I'm sorry to intrude.
James.
Burnt down any more laboratories recently?
That was 10 years ago, and it was an accident.
Really?
What do you want, Adam?
It's me daughter, imogene.
She's gravely ill, a rare blood disease.
I beg of you, help her.
[Magnus]:
We battled until the very end.
We tried everything.
Loss of a daughter, it's a wound that never heals.
[Screaming in anguish]
He told me he intended to use the device to save his daughter.
Time travel?
It's impossible.
But he said he'd found a way.
You would have been altering the course of history.
That was the point.
If Adam succeeds in altering the timeline, then everything about our world, the refugees, the Sanctuary, our very lives will be irreparably damaged.
We may even cease to exist.
Praxis...
It's gone.
What happened here?
Worth.
He must have made another attempt to power up the machine.
[Shoots]
[Magnus]:
Adam, what are you doing?
This is madness.
I have a chance to get my daughter back.
Are you telling me you wouldn't do the same thing?
Not at the expense of everyone on the planet.
You're too late.
[Wagons clattering over cobblestones]
[Horses whinny]
Stay back!
[Gasping in fright]
Adam!
[Firing gun]
[Bullets ricochet]
What was that?
!
[Police whistles trilling distantly]
[Gunshots blast]
[Laser snipes]
Hoping for a quick finish, Helen?
Me too.
Don't make things worse, Adam.
Neither of us can be here.
We both know it.
It's only time travel, Helen.
What's the worst that could happen?
Aside from destroying the natural order of history?
What, by creating a utopia?
[Police whistles blare sharply]
By taking over the world.
[Laser snipes]
[Bricks shatter and crumble]
[Magnus groans]
[Police whistles blare]
Over here!
By the rubble.
She's down the alley, that way!

Hasn't said a word.
Wouldn't let the Doctor near her, neither.
Has she put up any kind of resistance?
Been as gentle as a debutante, despite all the weapons we found on her.
Never seen anything like 'em.
I would say Miss Magnus' reputation as odd remains intact.
It's Dr. Magnus, and I will need everything you took from her.
Look, there are no charges, no evidence to suppress.
I'm just making your life easier, Lestrade, as usual.
Fine, but you owe me for this, Watson.
Are you ready to come home, Helen?
I received a message that you'd been found injured, half dressed, and discharging a weapon in public.
If you had a lead in the case, you could at least have informed me.
I should have, I realize that.
Th-things just got away from me, I'm afraid.
It was him, wasn't it?
I was right.
Helen, how could you face him on your own?
I didn't get a good look at who it was.
I just...
I got overexcited, and I fell, and I--
I should've called you-- c-contacted you.
Thank you, James.
"Overexcited"?
That's your explanation for your incredibly strange attire, weapons that I have never seen-- and your hair, for God's sake.
When did you do that?
It's late, and it's been a hell of a night.
Helen, at least let me take a look at your head.
You-- you've taken a terrible tumble.
I'm fine.
Really.
I can see myself home.
Good night, James.
Helen...
What on earth's come over you?
Dear God, I still have this in my study.
It arrived yesterday from Mozambique.
[Weapons thud heavily]
I would say your father was having a wonderful time on the dark continent.
I believe he's sent a new form of iodine.
Let me, James.
Medicine was always your weak spot.
"Was"?
It's a scalp wound and a mild concussion.
I hardly need a nursemaid.
Will you stop looking at me like that?
How should I be looking at you?
Just...
Leave me alone.
[Guns clattering heavily]
No, no.
Don't do that.
What the devil is that made of?
These numbers, are they significant?
This?
What's the...
The design...
The purpose...
[Chimes as it activates]
How...
How is that powered?
James, ignore all of this.
Ignore me.
"Browning automatic"?
I've never heard of that, and yet, I know every weapons manufacturer in the world.
[Clip slides out, clattering]
Amazing!
The release time--
Leave.
Right now.
Not a chance.
It's my Sanctuary.
Is it?
From the moment you walked in here, you've been behaving as if you were visiting someone's grave.
It may have been your Sanctuary a long time ago, but not anymore.
Business cards made from a substance I can't identify, issued 2010, expires 2015?
Weapons that I have never seen or heard of.
Clothes designed for maximum movement and protection.
I am Helen--
Oh, you definitely are Helen Magnus, just not of this era.
I'm a...
Detective.
Well, then.
Now you understand why you have to leave.
Because by being here, you may disrupt the timeline, change the future as you know it.
But how is this possible?
I came here on a mission.
If I fail, everything that is meant to be, everything that I build from now until my present could be destroyed.
Who were you chasing?
Honestly,
Helen.
Whatever your mission is, it's got off to a very bad start.
You need help, and seeing as I know the truth, what choice do you have but to let me in?
No questions about the future, near or distant?
Adam Worth, that's who I was chasing.
From Oxford?
What on earth--
He's come from the future as well.
I followed him here after John and I were--
John Druitt ?
Dear God, does everyone from our era live on to the 21st century?
Not everyone.
Oh.
I'll tell you only what you need to know to prevent Adam from irrevocably damaging the future, nothing more.
Time travel is actually possible.
H.G. would be ecstatic.
But by simply being here, haven't you already changed things?
I'll not give you a lesson in temporal theory, nice try, but had I arrived a century, or even millennia ago, the effect on my future would likely be more severe.
So the shorter the time scale, the less the effect on the future.
Unless, of course, Adam does something to dramatically alter the course of events.
Or you do.
Do we have a deal?
Everything you brought with you must be destroyed.
And you need to change.
[Exhales in relief]
Don't even think about it.
It's a communication device, isn't it?
Better?
Much.
Good.
No questions.
Imogene?
Imogene...
I need to make another trip to the apothecary,
I'm afraid, love.
I won't be long.
[Kisses her]
[Sighing with emotion]
Oh, it was all worth it.
Papa?
Imogene.
How are you feeling, darling?
Fine.
Just a bit tired.
What did you do to your hair?
No, no... just a little cut.
I've done the most wonderful thing.
I've found a cure for your condition.
But you said there was no--
No, no, no, that's all changed.
For the better, I promise.
Oh no.
What's happened?
No...
Nothing, just...
A little hole.
I can fix that, though.
It's not a problem.
You look good.
Give us a smile.
[Chuckling happily]
All right, let's get a move on.
He should still be in the city, but maybe not for long.
The Adam Worth from your time.
Now, he's come here for what reason?
[Worth]:
Open the door.
Open it now.
I'll throttle ya.
- Sir--
- Look, I'm not joking.
[Cocking guns]
You'll end up in the garden.
- Open the door--
- I can't.
Thank you.
Adam?
Helen, James.
Sorry to intrude.
Burned any laboratories recently?
That was 10 years ago, and it was an accident.
[Whispering] 10 years...
Listen, it's me daughter, Imogene.
She's gravely ill.
It's a rare blood disease.
Now, I've tried every treatment possible, every method and you want my help.
Thank you, Helen, but actually, I- I've come for his help.
You see, she's missing.
Someone's taken her.
I just don't understand who would do this.
I haven't much money.
She's just a child.
Worth, be a good chap and ask the night ward for the visitor manifest, will you?
There's no sign of a struggle.
She went without resistance.
Of course she did.
She thought he was her father.
In the past I remember, Adam came to us for help finding a cure for Imogene two months from now.
This moment never happened.
And now this future Adam has his daughter.
And a cure?
Which means he's already altered the future, forever.
[Sighs in frustration]
[Thunder rumbles]
Please, are there any clues?
Suspects?
We'd know more if you told us what you were working on, Adam.
Well, I told you,
I'm trying to find a cure for her disease.
Which is an expensive proposition.
You'd need money, resources, which means some sort of extortion plot or larcenous act.
What?
No,
I'd never resort to that--
Those lab fires were hardly an accident, and the toxins you were formulating at Oxford,
I know you've created prototypes--
My daughter is missing!
And if you want to find her, you will give us names, places, safehouses, everything you are secretly planning to unleash on this city.
You're mad.
Helen, that's enough.
I thought you understood my situation.
I guess I know better now.
I'll find her myself.
Has society gone back to the Dark Ages?
He's done nothing wrong.
Not yet, but he will, believe me.
And if you interrogate him in this manner, it will be you who has altered the natural order of things.
Helen, you have far too much knowledge about this time and place.
Use that carefully.
We need to find Adam, future-Adam, before too much damage is done.
Finding people is what I do, if you recall...
But I will ask you to curb your temper as we go forward.
Of course.
James, I'm-I'm sorry.
You can see yourself home.
[Glass shattering]
[Druitt screams]:
Don't lie to me!
[Helen]:
Five murders, their throats cut, their bodies desecrated in a manner that few beings can achieve.
Instant escape from the crime scene?
And so it must be me?
You seem flattered.
[Chuckling] Oh, I am.
Deft manner of proving your innocence, threatening my life.
Call it self-preservation.
Why on earth should I let you frame me for crimes I haven't committed?
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to fear [cocking gun]
You sound just like James.
How much time have you been spending together?
And now jealousy.
For whom?
How dare you question my motives?
My...
Feelings?
You...
You hunt me like an animal.
After all we've been through.
My heart... is yours.
[Roars in rage]
[Helen screams]
[Yelps in fright]
Look...
In my face.
Look at my face.
Damn!
[Uncocks gun]
[Sniffling]
[Thunder rumbles]
Helen?
Over here.
Any word on Adam's whereabouts?
What's wrong?
Druitt was here.
John?
Are you-- is she--
We're both fine, thank you.
He's not happy that you like him for the latest Ripper killings, made sure I knew it.
Not happy because I'm right?
Oh, all right, no questions,
I understand.
But you did make a point of letting me know that he paid you a visit, which I will take to mean that I must keep focused on the case.
Adam Worth?
He is expected at the Reformer Club in Pall Mall this evening.
Whether it's the future or the present Adam,
I-I don't know.
Good.
If we hurry, we'll beat him there.
[Magnus]:
James, is that you?
Darling!
Hello.
There you are.
Are you ready to work?
Yes, if you are.
Absolutely.
Now, I've been re-thinking your last theory, and I found a few holes, I'm afraid.
Ah.
You can't come in here.
A woman?
Inconceivable.
Simon, come quick.
May I assist you?
I'm here to see Adam Worth.
I have no record of any guests for Mr. Worth.
I will gladly leave him a message, miss...
Dr. Helen Magnus.
Consider it done.
I'll hail you a cab.
I'll only be a minute.
The club is for members only.
Remove your hand.
Right now-- how dare you?
She's with me.
Whatever took you so long, love?
Shame on you.
She's a lady.
Is that a revolver under your bustle, or are you just happy to see me?
Oh, it's a gun.
Any last words?
Well, "don't shoot!"
Never seems to work with you.
How about,
"kill me here, and alter the future in a most dr the infamous Helen Magnus, murderer of a patron of a gentleman's club.
Quite the departure from your destiny, I'd say.
Cheers.
I do miss this era.
A simpler, more elegant time.
I will kill you, Adam.
What for?
To save the future?
What makes what we left behind so precious?
With Praxis destroyed,
God knows what threat my people are facing in the present.
Most likely you've created chaos for Hollow Earth and the surface that will take years to clean up.
None of that has happened yet, and guess what?
Maybe it never does.
Move on, I say.
Change the future.
Make it whatever you want it to be.
You know what I find interesting is that you're sitting here, sipping Brandy with these stiffs instead of skipping off into the sunset with Imogene.
I like it here.
There's been a complication.
You haven't cured her yet.
That's why you're here, to borrow money to fund your plan, which I am certain has gone entirely pear-shaped.
It's a matter of time, love, and only that.
Bustle or no,
I'll be out that door before your head hits this table.
Doubtful.
Simon!
The lady is ready to leave now.
Thanks for the offer, ma'am, but I'm a family man, and a gentleman.
[Sighs in perturbation]
Women.
Dr. Magnus?
Message for you.
James, please.
But you have been through all this before.
For God's sake, you could save lives!
We both know I can't interfere.
Then there will be blood on your hands.
Not if you do your job and stop looking for a short cut.
And if your very presence here has changed the course of events, interfered with the investigation, what then?
Can you live with that?
No, please, spare me.
I don't want to know the answer.
Because in the future, emotions, empathy, humanity, ceases to exist-- you should have caught him by now.
[Sighs in exasperation]
Yes, my presence here may have altered things, possibly for the worst.
That woman who died tonight should be the last victim.
But she won't be.
Remember the purpose of the Sanctuary.
To find and help unfortunate creatures, to protect them.
To keep the public safe.
Do that, and this case will be solved without any further bloodshed.
And if I can't?
That's an expression I've rarely heard you use.
What are you making?
Arsenic.
Strychnine..?
A toxin.
A last resort.
To mimic the blood disease that kills Imogene.
A fail-safe in case Adam cures her.
Dear God...
I'm not even sure I can finish making it, let alone give it to her.
If there was any other way to stop Adam Worth from completely disrupting the timeline...
Humanity isn't completely dead in the future, just so you know.
You're going out?
Where?
Hunting.
Your hair.
I like it.
I don't have time for this, John.
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear earlier.
[Switchblade snaps]
Hunting me will only make things more difficult for you.
Let me pass.
There's only one way to make you pay attention.
[Blows thud]
You're insane.
Oh, very much so.
Fancy some more?
[Joints crunching]
[Roars in pain]
How on earth did you-- ?
[Blow thuds heavily]
[Druitt groans]
[Blows thudding]
[Druitt gasps]
How does it feel?
Cold steel against your jugular?
In the hands of someone who knows how to kill you slowly and has the will to do it?
H-Helen?
Are you paying attention?
Stay away from me.
[Beast growls]
[Snarling]
[Roars]
Hello, Jack.
Know my name, do you?
Yes, I know who you are.
Jack knows you.
You're Gregory's little girl.
My father helped you, years ago.
Saved your life.
You're not a little girl anymore.
Older now.
Much, much older.
Smell like nothing I know.
You promised my father you wouldn't kill again.
That you'd leave London--
Jack did leave!
People hunted me down, like a dog!
This is my hunting ground.
If humans hunt Jack, then Jack hunts humans.
Here!
My ground!
The city's bigger.
You'll be found and killed.
Ah, I'm strong.
I'm too fast for them.
They'll never find me.
I can, and I will.
You can die like an animal or live with my protection.
Be safe from humans.
Humans can go to hell!
With my help.
If you kill again, I can't guarantee your safety.
Stop now, and I'll give you Sanctuary.
You have my word, and my father's.
I'm your friend.
[Roaring]
Spring-heeled Jack.
Thanks, love.
So different.
Such odd looking pieces.
You actually designed these?
Ah...
Some of them, yes.
To help me?
You are all I've been thinking about for a very long time.
Good.
You look tired.
I wish you'd take a rest.
I'm too close here, Imogene.
But once this is done, we'll be able to get all the rest we want.
Go places together, see things you've never seen that'll amaze you.
Soon, not only will we be able to see the world together, it will be ours for the taking.
Anything you want, anything at all, we take it, control it, use it to create whatever future we want.
I've never heard you talk this way before.
You're different.
So confident.
[Chuckles]
Chance of getting a biscuit with me tea?
As his lordship pleases.
This better be good.
I just climbed up six flights of stairs in new boots.
I was thinking about what you said, and I think you're right.
It isn't John doing these murders.
I'm listening.
Another creature, as violent and dangerous as him, with its own unique method of near-instant escape.
As I've been saying, but as you keep pointing out, none of the other possibilities make any sense.
No one can teleport like John.
What about incredible super strength?
The ability to leap quickly to high ground.
Rooftops.
Exactly.
You're certain.
[Girl]:
Yes, ma'am.
Up those stairs with a dark wood door.
Thank you.
Dear God, Adam.
Before you start threatening me, or shooting me, for that matter, we still have that nagging problem of the witnesses.
Hello.
Imogene.
Dr. Helen Magnus, this is my daughter, Imogene.
You must be one of my dad's colleagues.
He said some friends might drop by.
How lovely to meet you, Doctor.
[Worth]:
Dr. Helen here is a ground-breaker, just like you.
What have you done, Adam?
How are you feeling, Imogene?
Better than I have in years.
Thanks to papa here.
No...
[Worth]:
Oh yes.
Healthy as a horse, I'm afraid.
Welcome to the future, Helen.
So, now that the game is over, what say we put away our guns, yes?
Starting with yours.
Unlikely.
Papa?
Are you going to shoot me in front of my own flesh and blood?
That's cold, Helen, even for you.
What's the meaning of this?
I'm sorry, Imogene, but this man is not your father.
Please, leave him alone.
I know it looks like him, but this man has ended millions of innocent lives, caused unimaginable destruction.
Don't listen to her, darling.
All of it lies.
Destroying Praxis?
Altering the timeline?
You have to be stopped, Adam.
Please, leave him alone!
[Electricity crackles]
[Bolts zap]
Papa?
What is that?
Just some insurance.
Stay here.
I won't be long.

By you.
I'll kill you for this, I swear!

Please.
Please, make room.
Dear God.
It's Adam's daughter.
The eaves must have collapsed on her.
Imogene?
Get away from her.
I'm so sorry.
Imogene?
Imogene?
Imogene?
Imogene...
No...
What have you done?
Both of you!
Adam-- if you'd have helped, she'd still be alive right now.
Her blood is on your hands.
And your hands!
We'd better be on our way, Helen.

It's Dr. Magnus, and I will need everything you took from her.
Look, there are no charges, no evidence to suppress.
I'm just making your life easier, Lestrade, as usual.
Fine, but you owe me for this, Watson.
Are you ready to come home, Helen?
I received a message that you'd been found injured, half dressed, and discharging a weapon in public.
If you had a lead in the case, you could at least have informed me.
I should have, I realize that.
Th-things just got away from me, I'm afraid.
It was him, wasn't it?
I was right.
Helen, how could you face him on your own?
I didn't get a good look at who it was.
I just...
I got overexcited, and I fell, and I--
I should've called you-- c-contacted you.
Thank you, James.
"Overexcited"?
That's your explanation for your incredibly strange attire, weapons that I have never seen-- and your hair, for God's sake.
When did you do that?
It's late, and it's been a hell of a night.
Helen, at least let me take a look at your head.
You-- you've taken a terrible tumble.
I'm fine.
Really.
I can see myself home.
Good night, James.
Helen...
What on earth's come over you?
Dear God, I still have this in my study.
It arrived yesterday from Mozambique.
I would say your father was having a wonderful time on the dark continent.
I believe he's sent a new form of iodine.
Let me, James.
Medicine was always your weak spot.
"Was"?
It's a scalp wound and a mild concussion.
I hardly need a nursemaid.
Will you stop looking at me like that?
How should I be looking at you?
Just...
Leave me alone.
No, no.
Don't do that.
What the devil is that made of?
These numbers, are they significant?
This?
What's the...
The design...
The purpose...
How...
How is that powered?
James, ignore all of this.
Ignore me.
"Browning automatic"?
I've never heard of that, and yet, I know every weapons manufacturer in the world.
Amazing!
The release time--
Leave.
Right now.
Not a chance.
It's my Sanctuary.
Is it?
From the moment you walked in here, you've been behaving as if you were visiting someone's grave.
It may have been your Sanctuary a long time ago, but not anymore.
Business cards made from a substance I can't identify, issued 2010, expires 2015?
Weapons that I have never seen or heard of.
Clothes designed for maximum movement and protection.
I am Helen--
Oh, you definitely are Helen Magnus, just not of this era.
I'm a...
Detective.
Well, then.
Now you understand why you have to leave.
Because by being here, you may disrupt the timeline, change the future as you know it.
But how is this possible?
I came here on a mission.
If I fail, everything that is meant to be, everything that I build from now until my present could be destroyed.
Who were you chasing?
Honestly,
Helen.
Whatever your mission is, it's got off to a very bad start.
You need help, and seeing as I know the truth, what choice do you have but to let me in?
No questions about the future, near or distant?
Adam Worth, that's who I was chasing.
From Oxford?
What on earth--
He's come from the future as well.
I followed him here after John and I were--
John Druitt ?
Dear God, does everyone from our era live on to the 21st century?
Not everyone.
Oh.
I'll tell you only what you need to know to prevent Adam from irrevocably damaging the future, nothing more.
Time travel is actually possible.
H.G. would be ecstatic.
But by simply being here, haven't you already changed things?
I'll not give you a lesson in temporal theory, nice try, but had I arrived a century, or even millennia ago, the effect on my future would likely be more severe.
So the shorter the time scale, the less the effect on the future.
Unless, of course, Adam does something to dramatically alter the course of events.
Or you do.
Do we have a deal?
Everything you brought with you must be destroyed.
And you need to change.
Don't even think about it.
It's a communication device, isn't it?
Better?
Much.
Good.
No questions.
Imogene?
Imogene...
I need to make another trip to the apothecary,
I'm afraid, love.
I won't be long.
Oh, it was all worth it.
Papa?
Imogene.
How are you feeling, darling?
Fine.
Just a bit tired.
What did you do to your hair?
No, no... just a little cut.
I've done the most wonderful thing.
I've found a cure for your condition.
But you said there was no--
No, no, no, that's all changed.
For the better, I promise.
Oh no.
What's happened?
No...
Nothing, just...
A little hole.
I can fix that, though.
It's not a problem.
You look good.
Give us a smile.
All right, let's get a move on.
He should still be in the city, but maybe not for long.
The Adam Worth from your time.
Now, he's come here for what reason?
Open the door.
Open it now.
I'll throttle ya.
- Sir--
- Look, I'm not joking.
You'll end up in the garden.
- Open the door--
- I can't.
Thank you.
Adam?
Helen, James.
Sorry to intrude.
Burned any laboratories recently?
That was 10 years ago, and it was an accident.
10 years...
Listen, it's me daughter, Imogene.
She's gravely ill.
It's a rare blood disease.
Now, I've tried every treatment possible, every method and you want my help.
Thank you, Helen, but actually, I- I've come for his help.
You see, she's missing.
Someone's taken her.
I just don't understand who would do this.
I haven't much money.
She's just a child.
Worth, be a good chap and ask the night ward for the visitor manifest, will you?
There's no sign of a struggle.
She went without resistance.
Of course she did.
She thought he was her father.
In the past I remember, Adam came to us for help finding a cure for Imogene two months from now.
This moment never happened.
And now this future Adam has his daughter.
And a cure?
Which means he's already altered the future, forever.
Please, are there any clues?
Suspects?
We'd know more if you told us what you were working on, Adam.
Well, I told you,
I'm trying to find a cure for her disease.
Which is an expensive proposition.
You'd need money, resources, which means some sort of extortion plot or larcenous act.
What?
No,
I'd never resort to that--
Those lab fires were hardly an accident, and the toxins you were formulating at Oxford,
I know you've created prototypes--
My daughter is missing!
And if you want to find her, you will give us names, places, safehouses, everything you are secretly planning to unleash on this city.
You're mad.
Helen, that's enough.
I thought you understood my situation.
I guess I know better now.
I'll find her myself.
Has society gone back to the Dark Ages?
He's done nothing wrong.
Not yet, but he will, believe me.
And if you interrogate him in this manner, it will be you who has altered the natural order of things.
Helen, you have far too much knowledge about this time and place.
Use that carefully.
We need to find Adam, future-Adam, before too much damage is done.
Finding people is what I do, if you recall...
But I will ask you to curb your temper as we go forward.
Of course.
James, I'm-I'm sorry.
You can see yourself home.
Don't lie to me!
Five murders, their throats cut, their bodies desecrated in a manner that few beings can achieve.
Instant escape from the crime scene?
And so it must be me?
You seem flattered.
Oh, I am.
Deft manner of proving your innocence, threatening my life.
Call it self-preservation.
Why on earth should I let you frame me for crimes I haven't committed?
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to fear
You sound just like James.
How much time have you been spending together?
And now jealousy.
For whom?
How dare you question my motives?
My...
Feelings?
You...
You hunt me like an animal.
After all we've been through.
My heart... is yours.
Look...
In my face.
Look at my face.
Damn!
Helen?
Over here.
Any word on Adam's whereabouts?
What's wrong?
Druitt was here.
John?
Are you-- is she--
We're both fine, thank you.
He's not happy that you like him for the latest Ripper killings, made sure I knew it.
Not happy because I'm right?
Oh, all right, no questions,
I understand.
But you did make a point of letting me know that he paid you a visit, which I will take to mean that I must keep focused on the case.
Adam Worth?
He is expected at the Reformer Club in Pall Mall this evening.
Whether it's the future or the present Adam,
I-I don't know.
Good.
If we hurry, we'll beat him there.
James, is that you?
Darling!
Hello.
There you are.
Are you ready to work?
Yes, if you are.
Absolutely.
Now, I've been re-thinking your last theory, and I found a few holes, I'm afraid.
Ah.
You can't come in here.
A woman?
Inconceivable.
Simon, come quick.
May I assist you?
I'm here to see Adam Worth.
I have no record of any guests for Mr. Worth.
I will gladly leave him a message, miss...
Dr. Helen Magnus.
Consider it done.
I'll hail you a cab.
I'll only be a minute.
The club is for members only.
Remove your hand.
Right now-- how dare you?
She's with me.
Whatever took you so long, love?
Shame on you.
She's a lady.
Is that a revolver under your bustle, or are you just happy to see me?
Oh, it's a gun.
Any last words?
Well, "don't shoot!"
Never seems to work with you.
How about,
"kill me here, and alter the future in a most dr the infamous Helen Magnus, murderer of a patron of a gentleman's club.
Quite the departure from your destiny, I'd say.
Cheers.
I do miss this era.
A simpler, more elegant time.
I will kill you, Adam.
What for?
To save the future?
What makes what we left behind so precious?
With Praxis destroyed,
God knows what threat my people are facing in the present.
Most likely you've created chaos for Hollow Earth and the surface that will take years to clean up.
None of that has happened yet, and guess what?
Maybe it never does.
Move on, I say.
Change the future.
Make it whatever you want it to be.
You know what I find interesting is that you're sitting here, sipping Brandy with these stiffs instead of skipping off into the sunset with Imogene.
I like it here.
There's been a complication.
You haven't cured her yet.
That's why you're here, to borrow money to fund your plan, which I am certain has gone entirely pear-shaped.
It's a matter of time, love, and only that.
Bustle or no,
I'll be out that door before your head hits this table.
Doubtful.
Simon!
The lady is ready to leave now.
Thanks for the offer, ma'am, but I'm a family man, and a gentleman.
Women.
Dr. Magnus?
Message for you.
James, please.
But you have been through all this before.
For God's sake, you could save lives!
We both know I can't interfere.
Then there will be blood on your hands.
Not if you do your job and stop looking for a short cut.
And if your very presence here has changed the course of events, interfered with the investigation, what then?
Can you live with that?
No, please, spare me.
I don't want to know the answer.
Because in the future, emotions, empathy, humanity, ceases to exist-- you should have caught him by now.
Yes, my presence here may have altered things, possibly for the worst.
That woman who died tonight should be the last victim.
But she won't be.
Remember the purpose of the Sanctuary.
To find and help unfortunate creatures, to protect them.
To keep the public safe.
Do that, and this case will be solved without any further bloodshed.
And if I can't?
That's an expression I've rarely heard you use.
What are you making?
Arsenic.
Strychnine..?
A toxin.
A last resort.
To mimic the blood disease that kills Imogene.
A fail-safe in case Adam cures her.
Dear God...
I'm not even sure I can finish making it, let alone give it to her.
If there was any other way to stop Adam Worth from completely disrupting the timeline...
Humanity isn't completely dead in the future, just so you know.
You're going out?
Where?
Hunting.
Your hair.
I like it.
I don't have time for this, John.
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear earlier.
Hunting me will only make things more difficult for you.
Let me pass.
There's only one way to make you pay attention.
You're insane.
Oh, very much so.
Fancy some more?
How on earth did you-- ?
How does it feel?
Cold steel against your jugular?
In the hands of someone who knows how to kill you slowly and has the will to do it?
H-Helen?
Are you paying attention?
Stay away from me.
Hello, Jack.
Know my name, do you?
Yes, I know who you are.
Jack knows you.
You're Gregory's little girl.
My father helped you, years ago.
Saved your life.
You're not a little girl anymore.
Older now.
Much, much older.
Smell like nothing I know.
You promised my father you wouldn't kill again.
That you'd leave London--
Jack did leave!
People hunted me down, like a dog!
This is my hunting ground.
If humans hunt Jack, then Jack hunts humans.
Here!
My ground!
The city's bigger.
You'll be found and killed.
Ah, I'm strong.
I'm too fast for them.
They'll never find me.
I can, and I will.
You can die like an animal or live with my protection.
Be safe from humans.
Humans can go to hell!
With my help.
If you kill again, I can't guarantee your safety.
Stop now, and I'll give you Sanctuary.
You have my word, and my father's.
I'm your friend.
Spring-heeled Jack.
Thanks, love.
So different.
Such odd looking pieces.
You actually designed these?
Ah...
Some of them, yes.
To help me?
You are all I've been thinking about for a very long time.
Good.
You look tired.
I wish you'd take a rest.
I'm too close here, Imogene.
But once this is done, we'll be able to get all the rest we want.
Go places together, see things you've never seen that'll amaze you.
Soon, not only will we be able to see the world together, it will be ours for the taking.
Anything you want, anything at all, we take it, control it, use it to create whatever future we want.
I've never heard you talk this way before.
You're different.
So confident.
Chance of getting a biscuit with me tea?
As his lordship pleases.
This better be good.
I just climbed up six flights of stairs in new boots.
I was thinking about what you said, and I think you're right.
It isn't John doing these murders.
I'm listening.
Another creature, as violent and dangerous as him, with its own unique method of near-instant escape.
As I've been saying, but as you keep pointing out, none of the other possibilities make any sense.
No one can teleport like John.
What about incredible super strength?
The ability to leap quickly to high ground.
Rooftops.
Exactly.
You're certain.
Yes, ma'am.
Up those stairs with a dark wood door.
Thank you.
Dear God, Adam.
Before you start threatening me, or shooting me, for that matter, we still have that nagging problem of the witnesses.
Hello.
Imogene.
Dr. Helen Magnus, this is my daughter, Imogene.
You must be one of my dad's colleagues.
He said some friends might drop by.
How lovely to meet you, Doctor.
Dr. Helen here is a ground-breaker, just like you.
What have you done, Adam?
How are you feeling, Imogene?
Better than I have in years.
Thanks to papa here.
No...
Oh yes.
Healthy as a horse, I'm afraid.
Welcome to the future, Helen.
So, now that the game is over, what say we put away our guns, yes?
Starting with yours.
Unlikely.
Papa?
Are you going to shoot me in front of my own flesh and blood?
That's cold, Helen, even for you.
What's the meaning of this?
I'm sorry, Imogene, but this man is not your father.
Please, leave him alone.
I know it looks like him, but this man has ended millions of innocent lives, caused unimaginable destruction.
Don't listen to her, darling.
All of it lies.
Destroying Praxis?
Altering the timeline?
You have to be stopped, Adam.
Please, leave him alone!
Papa?
What is that?
Just some insurance.
Stay here.
I won't be long.
Shaming me in front of my daughter, Helen?
Very impolite!
Oh, bloody hell...
Drop the gun!
I said, drop the gun!
You just had to get all high and mighty with your amazing future, didn't you?
Couldn't get with the program.
No.
You stupid, small-minded--
Papa?
Adam, no!
Imogene!
No!
Imogene!
Imogene!
Stay back.
Do it, Adam.
We both go.
Neither of us belongs here.
Everything I've worked for, everything I care about destroyed!
By you.
I'll kill you for this, I swear!
Please.
Please, make room.
Dear God.
It's Adam's daughter.
The eaves must have collapsed on her.
Imogene?
Get away from her.
I'm so sorry.
Imogene?
Imogene?
Imogene?
Imogene...
No...
What have you done?
Both of you!
Adam-- if you'd have helped, she'd still be alive right now.
Her blood is on your hands.
And your hands!
We'd better be on our way, Helen.
Oh, that poor man.
Spring-heeled Jack, the Sanctuary's newest resident.
I wish I could've told you earlier.
All that matters is that the streets of London are safe again.
As they should be.
I never meant to burden you, James.
All this knowledge you have to keep secret.
Oh, I love it, you know that.
What, all the deductive reasoning I'll be able to do with the little tidbits you've left me?
It's going to keep me occupied for decades, if I have that long.
In my future you do, many of them.
No, I don't want to know.
Far too much information.
Now that we've cleaned up all evidence of Adam, and the technology he brought with him,
I suppose there's only one thing left undone.
What to do about you.
I can't be here, James.
We both know it.
Everything I touch, everyone I meet...
Could ruin my future.
You'd best kill yourself.
I'm glad we both agree.
Helen, suicide?
You're so melodramatic.
Do you have a better idea?
I'm trapped here, and I have no way home.
You can always go home.
It just might take a little while.
It's one of the benefits of your incredibly slow aging.
Disappear.
Go somewhere... remote, with limited contact with the rest of world.
Spend the time thinking about...
All the things you've lived through.
113 years of seclusion?
Then you re-join your timeline just after you've left it.
Unless, of course, you're determined to do yourself in.
A vacation?
From what I gather, you've... rather earned one.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Previously on Sanctuary...
All right.
Adam, what are you doing here?
Helen, I'm sorry to intrude.
James.
Burnt down any more laboratories recently?
That was 10 years ago, and it was an accident.
Really?
What do you want, Adam?
It's me daughter, imogene.
She's gravely ill, a rare blood disease.
I beg of you, help her.
We battled until the very end.
We tried everything.
Loss of a daughter, it's a wound that never heals.
He told me he intended to use the device to save his daughter.
Time travel?
It's impossible.
But he said he'd found a way.
You would have been altering the course of history.
That was the point.
If Adam succeeds in altering the timeline, then everything about our world, the refugees, the Sanctuary, our very lives will be irreparably damaged.
We may even cease to exist.
Praxis...
It's gone.
What happened here?
Worth.
He must have made another attempt to power up the machine.
Adam, what are you doing?
This is madness.
I have a chance to get my daughter back.
Are you telling me you wouldn't do the same thing?
Not at the expense of everyone on the planet.
You're too late.
Stay back!
Adam!
What was that?
!
Hoping for a quick finish, Helen?
Me too.
Don't make things worse, Adam.
Neither of us can be here.
We both know it.
It's only time travel, Helen.
What's the worst that could happen?
Aside from destroying the natural order of history?
What, by creating a utopia?
By taking over the world.
Over here!
By the rubble.
She's down the alley, that way!
Call the Bobby!

Hasn't said a word.
Wouldn't let the Doctor near her, neither.
Has she put up any kind of resistance?
Been as gentle as a debutante, despite all the weapons we found on her.
Never seen anything like 'em.
I would say Miss Magnus' reputation as odd remains intact.
It's Dr. Magnus, and I will need everything you took from her.

What?
No,
I'd never resort to that--
Those lab fires were hardly an accident, and the toxins you were formulating at Oxford,
I know you've created prototypes--
My daughter is missing!
And if you want to find her, you will give us names, places, safehouses, everything you are secretly planning to unleash on this city.
You're mad.
Helen, that's enough.
I thought you understood my situation.
I guess I know better now.
I'll find her myself.
Has society gone back to the Dark Ages?
He's done nothing wrong.
Not yet, but he will, believe me.
And if you interrogate him in this manner, it will be you who has altered the natural order of things.
Helen, you have far too much knowledge about this time and place.
Use that carefully.
We need to find Adam, future-Adam, before too much damage is done.
Finding people is what I do, if you recall...
But I will ask you to curb your temper as we go forward.
Of course.
James, I'm-I'm sorry.
You can see yourself home.
Don't lie to me!
Five murders, their throats cut, their bodies desecrated in a manner that few beings can achieve.
Instant escape from the crime scene?
And so it must be me?
You seem flattered.
Oh, I am.
Deft manner of proving your innocence, threatening my life.
Call it self-preservation.
Why on earth should I let you frame me for crimes I haven't committed?
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to fear
You sound just like James.
How much time have you been spending together?
And now jealousy.
For whom?
How dare you question my motives?
My...
Feelings?
You...
You hunt me like an animal.
After all we've been through.
My heart... is yours.
Look...
In my face.
Look at my face.
Damn!
Helen?
Over here.
Any word on Adam's whereabouts?
What's wrong?
Druitt was here.
John?
Are you-- is she--
We're both fine, thank you.
He's not happy that you like him for the latest Ripper killings, made sure I knew it.
Not happy because I'm right?
Oh, all right, no questions,
I understand.
But you did make a point of letting me know that he paid you a visit, which I will take to mean that I must keep focused on the case.
Adam Worth?
He is expected at the Reformer Club in Pall Mall this evening.
Whether it's the future or the present Adam,
I-I don't know.
Good.
If we hurry, we'll beat him there.
James, is that you?
Darling!
Hello.
There you are.
Are you ready to work?
Yes, if you are.
Absolutely.
Now, I've been re-thinking your last theory, and I found a few holes, I'm afraid.
Ah.
You can't come in here.
A woman?
Inconceivable.
Simon, come quick.
May I assist you?
I'm here to see Adam Worth.
I have no record of any guests for Mr. Worth.
I will gladly leave him a message, miss...
Dr. Helen Magnus.
Consider it done.
I'll hail you a cab.
I'll only be a minute.
The club is for members only.
Remove your hand.
Right now-- how dare you?
She's with me.
Whatever took you so long, love?
Shame on you.
She's a lady.
Is that a revolver under your bustle, or are you just happy to see me?
Oh, it's a gun.
Any last words?
Well, "don't shoot!"
Never seems to work with you.
How about,
"kill me here, and alter the future in a most dramatic fashion".
The infamous Helen Magnus, murderer of a patron of a gentleman's club.
Quite the departure from your destiny, I'd say.
Cheers.
I do miss this era.
A simpler, more elegant time.
I will kill you, Adam.
What for?
To save the future?
What makes what we left behind so precious?
With Praxis destroyed,
God knows what threat my people are facing in the present.
Most likely you've created chaos for Hollow Earth and the surface that will take years to clean up.
None of that has happened yet, and guess what?
Maybe it never does.
Move on, I say.
Change the future.
Make it whatever you want it to be.
You know what I find interesting is that you're sitting here, sipping Brandy with these stiffs instead of skipping off into the sunset with Imogene.
I like it here.
There's been a complication.
You haven't cured her yet.
That's why you're here, to borrow money to fund your plan, which I am certain has gone entirely pear-shaped.
It's a matter of time, love, and only that.
Bustle or no,
I'll be out that door before your head hits this table.
Doubtful.
Simon!
The lady is ready to leave now.
Thanks for the offer, ma'am, but I'm a family man, and a gentleman.
Women.
Dr. Magnus?
Message for you.
James, please.
But you have been through all this before.
For God's sake, you could save lives!
We both know I can't interfere.
Then there will be blood on your hands.
Not if you do your job and stop looking for a short cut.
And if your very presence here has changed the course of events, interfered with the investigation, what then?
Can you live with that?
No, please, spare me.
I don't want to know the answer.
Because in the future, emotions, empathy, humanity, ceases to exist-- you should have caught him by now.
Yes, my presence here may have altered things, possibly for the worst.
That woman who died tonight should be the last victim.
But she won't be.
Remember the purpose of the Sanctuary.
To find and help unfortunate creatures, to protect them.
To keep the public safe.
Do that, and this case will be solved without any further bloodshed.
And if I can't?
That's an expression I've rarely heard you use.
What are you making?
Arsenic.
Strychnine..?
A toxin.
A last resort.
To mimic the blood disease that kills Imogene.
A fail-safe in case Adam cures her.
Dear God...
I'm not even sure I can finish making it, let alone give it to her.
If there was any other way to stop Adam Worth from completely disrupting the timeline...
Humanity isn't completely dead in the future, just so you know.
You're going out?
Where?
Hunting.
Your hair.
I like it.
I don't have time for this, John.
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear earlier.
Hunting me will only make things more difficult for you.
Let me pass.
There's only one way to make you pay attention.
You're insane.
Oh, very much so.
Fancy some more?
How on earth did you-- ?
How does it feel?
Cold steel against your jugular?
In the hands of someone who knows how to kill you slowly and has the will to do it?
H-Helen?
Are you paying attention?
Stay away from me.
Hello, Jack.
Know my name, do you?
Yes, I know who you are.
Jack knows you.
You're Gregory's little girl.
My father helped you, years ago.
Saved your life.
You're not a little girl anymore.
Older now.
Much, much older.
Smell like nothing I know.
You promised my father you wouldn't kill again.
That you'd leave London--
Jack did leave!
People hunted me down, like a dog!
This is my hunting ground.
If humans hunt Jack, then Jack hunts humans.
Here!
My ground!
The city's bigger.
You'll be found and killed.
Ah, I'm strong.
I'm too fast for them.
They'll never find me.
I can, and I will.
You can die like an animal or live with my protection.
Be safe from humans.
Humans can go to hell!
With my help.
If you kill again, I can't guarantee your safety.
Stop now, and I'll give you Sanctuary.
You have my word, and my father's.
I'm your friend.
Spring-heeled Jack.
Thanks, love.
So different.
Such odd looking pieces.
You actually designed these?
Ah...
Some of them, yes.
To help me?
You are all I've been thinking about for a very long time.
Good.
You look tired.
I wish you'd take a rest.
I'm too close here, Imogene.
But once this is done, we'll be able to get all the rest we want.
Go places together, see things you've never seen that'll amaze you.
Soon, not only will we be able to see the world together, it will be ours for the taking.
Anything you want, anything at all, we take it, control it, use it to create whatever future we want.
I've never heard you talk this way before.
You're different.
So confident.
Chance of getting a biscuit with me tea?
As his lordship pleases.
This better be good.
I just climbed up six flights of stairs in new boots.
I was thinking about what you said, and I think you're right.
It isn't John doing these murders.
I'm listening.
Another creature, as violent and dangerous as him, with its own unique method of near-instant escape.
As I've been saying, but as you keep pointing out, none of the other possibilities make any sense.
No one can teleport like John.
What about incredible super strength?
The ability to leap quickly to high ground.
Rooftops.
Exactly.
You're certain.
Yes, ma'am.
Up those stairs with a dark wood door.
Thank you.
Dear God, Adam.
Before you start threatening me, or shooting me, for that matter, we still have that nagging problem of the witnesses.
Hello.
Imogene.
Dr. Helen Magnus, this is my daughter, Imogene.
You must be one of my dad's colleagues.
He said some friends might drop by.
How lovely to meet you, Doctor.
Dr. Helen here is a ground-breaker, just like you.
What have you done, Adam?
How are you feeling, Imogene?
Better than I have in years.
Thanks to papa here.
No...
Oh yes.
Healthy as a horse, I'm afraid.
Welcome to the future, Helen.
So, now that the game is over, what say we put away our guns, yes?
Starting with yours.
Unlikely.
Papa?
Are you going to shoot me in front of my own flesh and blood?
That's cold, Helen, even for you.
What's the meaning of this?
I'm sorry, Imogene, but this man is not your father.
Please, leave him alone.
I know it looks like him, but this man has ended millions of innocent lives, caused unimaginable destruction.
Don't listen to her, darling.
All of it lies.
Destroying Praxis?
Altering the timeline?
You have to be stopped, Adam.
Please, leave him alone!
Papa?
What is that?
Just some insurance.
Stay here.
I won't be long.
Shaming me in front of my daughter, Helen?
Very impolite!
Oh, bloody hell...
Drop the gun!
I said, drop the gun!
You just had to get all high and mighty with your amazing future, didn't you?
Couldn't get with the program.
No.
You stupid, small-minded--
Papa?
Adam, no!
Imogene!
No!
Imogene!
Imogene!
Stay back.
Do it, Adam.
We both go.
Neither of us belongs here.
Everything I've worked for, everything I care about destroyed!
By you.
I'll kill you for this, I swear!
Please.
Please, make room.
Dear God.
It's Adam's daughter.
The eaves must have collapsed on her.
Imogene?
Get away from her.
I'm so sorry.
Imogene?
Imogene?
Imogene?
Imogene...
No...
What have you done?
Both of you!
Adam-- if you'd have helped, she'd still be alive right now.
Her blood is on your hands.
And your hands!
We'd better be on our way, Helen.
Oh, that poor man.
Spring-heeled Jack, the Sanctuary's newest resident.
I wish I could've told you earlier.
All that matters is that the streets of London are safe again.
As they should be.
I never meant to burden you, James.
All this knowledge you have to keep secret.
Oh, I love it, you know that.
What, all the deductive reasoning I'll be able to do with the little tidbits you've left me?
It's going to keep me occupied for decades, if I have that long.
In my future you do, many of them.
No, I don't want to know.
Far too much information.
Now that we've cleaned up all evidence of Adam, and the technology he brought with him,
I suppose there's only one thing left undone.
What to do about you.
I can't be here, James.
We both know it.
Everything I touch, everyone I meet...
Could ruin my future.
You'd best kill yourself.
I'm glad we both agree.
Helen, suicide?
You're so melodramatic.
Do you have a better idea?
I'm trapped here, and I have no way home.
You can always go home.
It just might take a little while.
It's one of the benefits of your incredibly slow aging.
Disappear.
Go somewhere... remote, with limited contact with the rest of world.
Spend the time thinking about...
All the things you've lived through.
113 years of seclusion?
Then you re-join your timeline just after you've left it.
Unless, of course, you're determined to do yourself in.
A vacation?
From what I gather, you've... rather earned one.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Previously on Sanctuary...
All right.
Adam, what are you doing here?
Helen, I'm sorry to intrude.
James.
Burnt down any more laboratories recently?
That was 10 years ago, and it was an accident.
Really?
What do you want, Adam?
It's me daughter, imogene.
She's gravely ill, a rare blood disease.
I beg of you, help her.
We battled until the very end.
We tried everything.
Loss of a daughter, it's a wound that never heals.
He told me he intended to use the device to save his daughter.
Time travel?
It's impossible.
But he said he'd found a way.
You would have been altering the course of history.
That was the point.
If Adam succeeds in altering the timeline, then everything about our world, the refugees, the Sanctuary, our very lives will be irreparably damaged.
We may even cease to exist.
Praxis...
It's gone.
What happened here?
Worth.
He must have made another attempt to power up the machine.
Adam, what are you doing?
This is madness.
I have a chance to get my daughter back.
Are you telling me you wouldn't do the same thing?
Not at the expense of everyone on the planet.
You're too late.
Stay back!
Adam!
What was that?
!
Hoping for a quick finish, Helen?
Me too.
Don't make things worse, Adam.
Neither of us can be here.
We both know it.
It's only time travel, Helen.
What's the worst that could happen?
Aside from destroying the natural order of history?
What, by creating a utopia?
By taking over the world.
Over here!
By the rubble.
She's down the alley, that way!
Call the Bobby!

♪
Hasn't said a word.
Wouldn't let the Doctor near her, neither.
Has she put up any kind of resistance?
Been as gentle as a debutante, despite all the weapons we found on her.
Never seen anything like 'em.
I would say Miss Magnus' reputation as odd remains intact.
It's Dr. Magnus, and I will need everything you took from her.
Look, there are no charges, no evidence to suppress.
I'm just making your life easier, Lestrade, as usual.
Fine, but you owe me for this, Watson.
Are you ready to come home, Helen?
I received a message that you'd been found injured, half dressed, and discharging a weapon in public.
If you had a lead in the case, you could at least have informed me.
I should have, I realize that.
Th-things just got away from me, I'm afraid.
It was him, wasn't it?
I was right.
Helen, how could you face him on your own?
I didn't get a good look at who it was.
I just...
I got overexcited, and I fell, and I--
I should've called you-- c-contacted you.
Thank you, James.
"Overexcited"?
That's your explanation for your incredibly strange attire, weapons that I have never seen-- and your hair, for God's sake.
When did you do that?
It's late, and it's been a hell of a night.
Helen, at least let me take a look at your head.
You-- you've taken a terrible tumble.
I'm fine.
Really.
I can see myself home.
Good night, James.
Helen...
What on earth's come over you?
Dear God, I still have this in my study.
It arrived yesterday from Mozambique.
I would say your father was having a wonderful time on the dark continent.
I believe he's sent a new form of iodine.
Let me, James.
Medicine was always your weak spot.
"Was"?
It's a scalp wound and a mild concussion.
I hardly need a nursemaid.
Will you stop looking at me like that?
How should I be looking at you?
Just...
Leave me alone.
No, no.
Don't do that.
What the devil is that made of?
These numbers, are they significant?
This?
What's the...
The design...
The purpose...
How...
How is that powered?
James, ignore all of this.
Ignore me.
"Browning automatic"?
I've never heard of that, and yet, I know every weapons manufacturer in the world.
Amazing!
The release time--
Leave.
Right now.
Not a chance.
It's my Sanctuary.
Is it?
From the moment you walked in here, you've been behaving as if you were visiting someone's grave.
It may have been your Sanctuary a long time ago, but not anymore.
Business cards made from a substance I can't identify, issued 2010, expires 2015?
Weapons that I have never seen or heard of.
Clothes designed for maximum movement and protection.
I am Helen--
Oh, you definitely are Helen Magnus, just not of this era.
I'm a...
Detective.
Well, then.
Now you understand why you have to leave.
Because by being here, you may disrupt the timeline, change the future as you know it.
But how is this possible?
I came here on a mission.
If I fail, everything that is meant to be, everything that I build from now until my present could be destroyed.
Who were you chasing?
Honestly,
Helen.
Whatever your mission is, it's got off to a very bad start.
You need help, and seeing as I know the truth, what choice do you have but to let me in?
No questions about the future, near or distant?
Adam Worth, that's who I was chasing.
From Oxford?
What on earth--
He's come from the future as well.
I followed him here after John and I were--
John Druitt ?
Dear God, does everyone from our era live on to the 21st century?
Not everyone.
Oh.
I'll tell you only what you need to know to prevent Adam from irrevocably damaging the future, nothing more.
Time travel is actually possible.
H.G. would be ecstatic.
But by simply being here, haven't you already changed things?
I'll not give you a lesson in temporal theory, nice try, but had I arrived a century, or even millennia ago, the effect on my future would likely be more severe.
So the shorter the time scale, the less the effect on the future.
Unless, of course, Adam does something to dramatically alter the course of events.
Or you do.
Do we have a deal?
Everything you brought with you must be destroyed.
And you need to change.
Don't even think about it.
It's a communication device, isn't it?
Better?
Much.
Good.
No questions.
Imogene?
Imogene...
I need to make another trip to the apothecary,
I'm afraid, love.
I won't be long.
Oh, it was all worth it.
Papa?
Imogene.
How are you feeling, darling?
Fine.
Just a bit tired.
What did you do to your hair?
No, no... just a little cut.
I've done the most wonderful thing.
I've found a cure for your condition.
But you said there was no--
No, no, no, that's all changed.
For the better, I promise.
Oh no.
What's happened?
No...
Nothing, just...
A little hole.
I can fix that, though.
It's not a problem.
You look good.
Give us a smile.
All right, let's get a move on.
He should still be in the city, but maybe not for long.
The Adam Worth from your time.
Now, he's come here for what reason?
Open the door.
Open it now.
I'll throttle ya.
- Sir--
- Look, I'm not joking.
You'll end up in the garden.
- Open the door--
- I can't.
Thank you.
Adam?
Helen, James.
Sorry to intrude.
Burned any laboratories recently?
That was 10 years ago, and it was an accident.
10 years...
Listen, it's me daughter, Imogene.
She's gravely ill.
It's a rare blood disease.
Now, I've tried every treatment possible, every method and you want my help.
Thank you, Helen, but actually, I- I've come for his help.
You see, she's missing.
Someone's taken her.
I just don't understand who would do this.
I haven't much money.
She's just a child.
Worth, be a good chap and ask the night ward for the visitor manifest, will you?
There's no sign of a struggle.
She went without resistance.
Of course she did.
She thought he was her father.
In the past I remember, Adam came to us for help finding a cure for Imogene two months from now.
This moment never happened.
And now this future Adam has his daughter.
And a cure?
Which means he's already altered the future, forever.
Please, are there any clues?
Suspects?
We'd know more if you told us what you were working on, Adam.
Well, I told you,
I'm trying to find a cure for her disease.
Which is an expensive proposition.
You'd need money, resources, which means some sort of extortion plot or larcenous act.
What?
No,
I'd never resort to that--
Those lab fires were hardly an accident, and the toxins you were formulating at Oxford,
I know you've created prototypes--
My daughter is missing!
And if you want to find her, you will give us names, places, safehouses, everything you are secretly planning to unleash on this city.
You're mad.
Helen, that's enough.
I thought you understood my situation.
I guess I know better now.
I'll find her myself.
Has society gone back to the Dark Ages?
He's done nothing wrong.
Not yet, but he will, believe me.
And if you interrogate him in this manner, it will be you who has altered the natural order of things.

My father helped you, years ago.
Saved your life.
You're not a little girl anymore.
Older now.
Much, much older.
Smell like nothing I know.
You promised my father you wouldn't kill again.
That you'd leave London--
Jack did leave!
People hunted me down, like a dog!
This is my hunting ground.
If humans hunt Jack, then Jack hunts humans.
Here!
My ground!
The city's bigger.
You'll be found and killed.
Ah, I'm strong.
I'm too fast for them.
They'll never find me.
I can, and I will.
You can die like an animal or live with my protection.
Be safe from humans.
Humans can go to hell!
With my help.
If you kill again, I can't guarantee your safety.
Stop now, and I'll give you Sanctuary.
You have my word, and my father's.
I'm your friend.
Spring-heeled Jack.
Thanks, love.
So different.
Such odd looking pieces.
You actually designed these?
Ah...
Some of them, yes.
To help me?
You are all I've been thinking about for a very long time.
Good.
You look tired.
I wish you'd take a rest.
I'm too close here, Imogene.
But once this is done, we'll be able to get all the rest we want.
Go places together, see things you've never seen that'll amaze you.
Soon, not only will we be able to see the world together, it will be ours for the taking.
Anything you want, anything at all, we take it, control it, use it to create whatever future we want.
I've never heard you talk this way before.
You're different.
So confident.
Chance of getting a biscuit with me tea?
As his lordship pleases.
This better be good.
I just climbed up six flights of stairs in new boots.
I was thinking about what you said, and I think you're right.
It isn't John doing these murders.
I'm listening.
Another creature, as violent and dangerous as him, with its own unique method of near-instant escape.
As I've been saying, but as you keep pointing out, none of the other possibilities make any sense.
No one can teleport like John.
What about incredible super strength?
The ability to leap quickly to high ground.
Rooftops.
Exactly.
You're certain.
Yes, ma'am.
Up those stairs with a dark wood door.
Thank you.
Dear God, Adam.
Before you start threatening me, or shooting me, for that matter, we still have that nagging problem of the witnesses.
Hello.
Imogene.
Dr. Helen Magnus, this is my daughter, Imogene.
You must be one of my dad's colleagues.
He said some friends might drop by.
How lovely to meet you, Doctor.
Dr. Helen here is a ground-breaker, just like you.
What have you done, Adam?
How are you feeling, Imogene?
Better than I have in years.
Thanks to papa here.
No...
Oh yes.
Healthy as a horse, I'm afraid.
Welcome to the future, Helen.
So, now that the game is over, what say we put away our guns, yes?
Starting with yours.
Unlikely.
Papa?
Are you going to shoot me in front of my own flesh and blood?
That's cold, Helen, even for you.
What's the meaning of this?
I'm sorry, Imogene, but this man is not your father.
Please, leave him alone.
I know it looks like him, but this man has ended millions of innocent lives, caused unimaginable destruction.
Don't listen to her, darling.
All of it lies.
Destroying Praxis?
Altering the timeline?
You have to be stopped, Adam.
Please, leave him alone!
Papa?
What is that?
Just some insurance.
Stay here.
I won't be long.
Shaming me in front of my daughter, Helen?
Very impolite!
Oh, bloody hell...
Drop the gun!
I said, drop the gun!
You just had to get all high and mighty with your amazing future, didn't you?
Couldn't get with the program.
No.
You stupid, small-minded--
Papa?
Adam, no!
Imogene!
No!
Imogene!
Imogene!
Stay back.
Do it, Adam.
We both go.
Neither of us belongs here.
Everything I've worked for, everything I care about destroyed!
By you.
I'll kill you for this, I swear!
Please.
Please, make room.
Dear God.
It's Adam's daughter.
The eaves must have collapsed on her.
Imogene?
Get away from her.
I'm so sorry.
Imogene?
Imogene?
Imogene?
Imogene...
No...
What have you done?
Both of you!
Adam-- if you'd have helped, she'd still be alive right now.
Her blood is on your hands.
And your hands!
We'd better be on our way, Helen.
Oh, that poor man.
Spring-heeled Jack, the Sanctuary's newest resident.
I wish I could've told you earlier.
All that matters is that the streets of London are safe again.
As they should be.
I never meant to burden you, James.
All this knowledge you have to keep secret.
Oh, I love it, you know that.
What, all the deductive reasoning I'll be able to do with the little tidbits you've left me?
It's going to keep me occupied for decades, if I have that long.
In my future you do, many of them.
No, I don't want to know.
Far too much information.
Now that we've cleaned up all evidence of Adam, and the technology he brought with him,
I suppose there's only one thing left undone.
What to do about you.
I can't be here, James.
We both know it.
Everything I touch, everyone I meet...
Could ruin my future.
You'd best kill yourself.
I'm glad we both agree.
Helen, suicide?
You're so melodramatic.
Do you have a better idea?
I'm trapped here, and I have no way home.
You can always go home.
It just might take a little while.
It's one of the benefits of your incredibly slow aging.
Disappear.
Go somewhere... remote, with limited contact with the rest of world.
Spend the time thinking about...
All the things you've lived through.
113 years of seclusion?
Then you re-join your timeline just after you've left it.
Unless, of course, you're determined to do yourself in.
A vacation?
From what I gather, you've... rather earned one.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Previously on Sanctuary...
All right.
Adam, what are you doing here?
Helen, I'm sorry to intrude.
James.
Burnt down any more laboratories recently?
That was 10 years ago, and it was an accident.
Really?
What do you want, Adam?
It's me daughter, imogene.
She's gravely ill, a rare blood disease.
I beg of you, help her.
[Magnus]:
We battled until the very end.
We tried everything.
Loss of a daughter, it's a wound that never heals.
[Screaming in anguish]
He told me he intended to use the device to save his daughter.
Time travel?
It's impossible.
But he said he'd found a way.
You would have been altering the course of history.
That was the point.
If Adam succeeds in altering the timeline, then everything about our world, the refugees, the Sanctuary, our very lives will be irreparably damaged.
We may even cease to exist.
Praxis...
It's gone.
What happened here?
Worth.
He must have made another attempt to power up the machine.
[Shoots]
[Magnus]:
Adam, what are you doing?
This is madness.
I have a chance to get my daughter back.
Are you telling me you wouldn't do the same thing?
Not at the expense of everyone on the planet.
You're too late.
[Wagons clattering over cobblestones]
[Horses whinny]
Stay back!
[Gasping in fright]
Adam!
[Firing gun]
[Bullets ricochet]
What was that?
!
[Police whistles trilling distantly]
[Gunshots blast]
[Laser snipes]
Hoping for a quick finish, Helen?
Me too.
Don't make things worse, Adam.
Neither of us can be here.
We both know it.
It's only time travel, Helen.
What's the worst that could happen?
Aside from destroying the natural order of history?
What, by creating a utopia?
[Police whistles blare sharply]
By taking over the world.
[Laser snipes]
[Bricks shatter and crumble]
[Magnus groans]
[Police whistles blare]
Over here!
By the rubble.
She's down the alley, that way!
Call the Bobby!
[Crowd murmuring in concern]

== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Hasn't said a word.
Wouldn't let the Doctor near her, neither.
Has she put up any kind of resistance?
Been as gentle as a debutante, despite all the weapons we found on her.
Never seen anything like 'em.
I would say Miss Magnus' reputation as odd remains intact.
It's Dr. Magnus, and I will need everything you took from her.
Look, there are no charges, no evidence to suppress.
I'm just making your life easier, Lestrade, as usual.
Fine, but you owe me for this, Watson.
Are you ready to come home, Helen?
I received a message that you'd been found injured, half dressed, and discharging a weapon in public.
If you had a lead in the case, you could at least have informed me.
I should have, I realize that.
Th-things just got away from me, I'm afraid.
It was him, wasn't it?
I was right.
Helen, how could you face him on your own?
I didn't get a good look at who it was.
I just...
I got overexcited, and I fell, and I--
I should've called you-- c-contacted you.
Thank you, James.
"Overexcited"?
That's your explanation for your incredibly strange attire, weapons that I have never seen-- and your hair, for God's sake.
When did you do that?
It's late, and it's been a hell of a night.
Helen, at least let me take a look at your head.
You-- you've taken a terrible tumble.
I'm fine.
Really.
I can see myself home.
Good night, James.
Helen...
What on earth's come over you?
Dear God, I still have this in my study.
It arrived yesterday from Mozambique.
[Weapons thud heavily]
I would say your father was having a wonderful time on the dark continent.
I believe he's sent a new form of iodine.
Let me, James.
Medicine was always your weak spot.
"Was"?
It's a scalp wound and a mild concussion.
I hardly need a nursemaid.
Will you stop looking at me like that?
How should I be looking at you?
Just...
Leave me alone.
[Guns clattering heavily]
No, no.
Don't do that.
What the devil is that made of?
These numbers, are they significant?
This?
What's the...
The design...
The purpose...
[Chimes as it activates]
How...
How is that powered?
James, ignore all of this.
Ignore me.
"Browning automatic"?
I've never heard of that, and yet, I know every weapons manufacturer in the world.
[Clip slides out, clattering]
Amazing!
The release time--
Leave.
Right now.
Not a chance.
It's my Sanctuary.
Is it?
From the moment you walked in here, you've been behaving as if you were visiting someone's grave.
It may have been your Sanctuary a long time ago, but not anymore.
Business cards made from a substance I can't identify, issued 2010, expires 2015?
Weapons that I have never seen or heard of.
Clothes designed for maximum movement and protection.
I am Helen--
Oh, you definitely are Helen Magnus, just not of this era.
I'm a...
Detective.
Well, then.
Now you understand why you have to leave.
Because by being here, you may disrupt the timeline, change the future as you know it.
But how is this possible?
I came here on a mission.
If I fail, everything that is meant to be, everything that I build from now until my present could be destroyed.
Who were you chasing?
Honestly,
Helen.
Whatever your mission is, it's got off to a very bad start.
You need help, and seeing as I know the truth, what choice do you have but to let me in?
No questions about the future, near or distant?
Adam Worth, that's who I was chasing.
From Oxford?
What on earth--
He's come from the future as well.
I followed him here after John and I were--
John Druitt ?
Dear God, does everyone from our era live on to the 21st century?
Not everyone.
Oh.
I'll tell you only what you need to know to prevent Adam from irrevocably damaging the future, nothing more.
Time travel is actually possible.
H.G. would be ecstatic.
But by simply being here, haven't you already changed things?
I'll not give you a lesson in temporal theory, nice try, but had I arrived a century, or even millennia ago, the effect on my future would likely be more severe.
So the shorter the time scale, the less the effect on the future.
Unless, of course, Adam does something to dramatically alter the course of events.
Or you do.
Do we have a deal?
Everything you brought with you must be destroyed.
And you need to change.
[Exhales in relief]
Don't even think about it.
It's a communication device, isn't it?
Better?
Much.
Good.
No questions.
Imogene?
Imogene...
I need to make another trip to the apothecary,
I'm afraid, love.
I won't be long.
[Kisses her]
[Sighing with emotion]
Oh, it was all worth it.
Papa?
Imogene.
How are you feeling, darling?
Fine.
Just a bit tired.
What did you do to your hair?
No, no... just a little cut.
I've done the most wonderful thing.
I've found a cure for your condition.
But you said there was no--
No, no, no, that's all changed.
For the better, I promise.
Oh no.
What's happened?
No...
Nothing, just...
A little hole.
I can fix that, though.
It's not a problem.
You look good.
Give us a smile.
[Chuckling happily]
All right, let's get a move on.
He should still be in the city, but maybe not for long.
The Adam Worth from your time.
Now, he's come here for what reason?
[Worth]:
Open the door.
Open it now.
I'll throttle ya.
- Sir--
- Look, I'm not joking.
[Cocking guns]
You'll end up in the garden.
- Open the door--
- I can't.
Thank you.
Adam?
Helen, James.
Sorry to intrude.
Burned any laboratories recently?
That was 10 years ago, and it was an accident.
[Whispering] 10 years...
Listen, it's me daughter, Imogene.
She's gravely ill.
It's a rare blood disease.
Now, I've tried every treatment possible, every method and you want my help.
Thank you, Helen, but actually, I- I've come for his help.
You see, she's missing.
Someone's taken her.
I just don't understand who would do this.
I haven't much money.
She's just a child.
Worth, be a good chap and ask the night ward for the visitor manifest, will you?
There's no sign of a struggle.
She went without resistance.
Of course she did.
She thought he was her father.
In the past I remember, Adam came to us for help finding a cure for Imogene two months from now.
This moment never happened.
And now this future Adam has his daughter.
And a cure?
Which means he's already altered the future, forever.
[Sighs in frustration]
[Thunder rumbles]
Please, are there any clues?
Suspects?
We'd know more if you told us what you were working on, Adam.
Well, I told you,
I'm trying to find a cure for her disease.
Which is an expensive proposition.
You'd need money, resources, which means some sort of extortion plot or larcenous act.
What?
No,
I'd never resort to that--
Those lab fires were hardly an accident, and the toxins you were formulating at Oxford,
I know you've created prototypes--
My daughter is missing!
And if you want to find her, you will give us names, places, safehouses, everything you are secretly planning to unleash on this city.
You're mad.
Helen, that's enough.
I thought you understood my situation.
I guess I know better now.
I'll find her myself.
Has society gone back to the Dark Ages?
He's done nothing wrong.
Not yet, but he will, believe me.
And if you interrogate him in this manner, it will be you who has altered the natural order of things.
Helen, you have far too much knowledge about this time and place.
Use that carefully.
We need to find Adam, future-Adam, before too much damage is done.
Finding people is what I do, if you recall...
But I will ask you to curb your temper as we go forward.
Of course.
James, I'm-I'm sorry.
You can see yourself home.
[Glass shattering]
[Druitt screams]:
Don't lie to me!
[Helen]:
Five murders, their throats cut, their bodies desecrated in a manner that few beings can achieve.
Instant escape from the crime scene?
And so it must be me?
You seem flattered.
[Chuckling] Oh, I am.
Deft manner of proving your innocence, threatening my life.
Call it self-preservation.
Why on earth should I let you frame me for crimes I haven't committed?
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to fear [cocking gun]
You sound just like James.
How much time have you been spending together?
And now jealousy.
For whom?
How dare you question my motives?
My...
Feelings?
You...
You hunt me like an animal.
After all we've been through.
My heart... is yours.
[Roars in rage]
[Helen screams]
[Yelps in fright]
Look...
In my face.
Look at my face.
Damn!
[Uncocks gun]
[Sniffling]
[Thunder rumbles]
Helen?
Over here.
Any word on Adam's whereabouts?
What's wrong?
Druitt was here.
John?
Are you-- is she--
We're both fine, thank you.
He's not happy that you like him for the latest Ripper killings, made sure I knew it.
Not happy because I'm right?
Oh, all right, no questions,
I understand.
But you did make a point of letting me know that he paid you a visit, which I will take to mean that I must keep focused on the case.
Adam Worth?
He is expected at the Reformer Club in Pall Mall this evening.
Whether it's the future or the present Adam,
I-I don't know.
Good.
If we hurry, we'll beat him there.
[Magnus]:
James, is that you?
Darling!
Hello.
There you are.
Are you ready to work?
Yes, if you are.
Absolutely.
Now, I've been re-thinking your last theory, and I found a few holes, I'm afraid.
Ah.
You can't come in here.
A woman?
Inconceivable.
Simon, come quick.
May I assist you?
I'm here to see Adam Worth.
I have no record of any guests for Mr. Worth.
I will gladly leave him a message, miss...
Dr. Helen Magnus.
Consider it done.
I'll hail you a cab.
I'll only be a minute.
The club is for members only.
Remove your hand.
Right now-- how dare you?
She's with me.
Whatever took you so long, love?
Shame on you.
She's a lady.
Is that a revolver under your bustle, or are you just happy to see me?
Oh, it's a gun.
Any last words?
Well, "don't shoot!"
Never seems to work with you.
How about,
"kill me here, and alter the future in a most dr the infamous Helen Magnus, murderer of a patron of a gentleman's club.
Quite the departure from your destiny, I'd say.
Cheers.
I do miss this era.
A simpler, more elegant time.
I will kill you, Adam.
What for?
To save the future?
What makes what we left behind so precious?
With Praxis destroyed,
God knows what threat my people are facing in the present.
Most likely you've created chaos for Hollow Earth and the surface that will take years to clean up.
None of that has happened yet, and guess what?
Maybe it never does.
Move on, I say.
Change the future.
Make it whatever you want it to be.
You know what I find interesting is that you're sitting here, sipping Brandy with these stiffs instead of skipping off into the sunset with Imogene.
I like it here.
There's been a complication.
You haven't cured her yet.
That's why you're here, to borrow money to fund your plan, which I am certain has gone entirely pear-shaped.
It's a matter of time, love, and only that.
Bustle or no,
I'll be out that door before your head hits this table.
Doubtful.
Simon!
The lady is ready to leave now.
Thanks for the offer, ma'am, but I'm a family man, and a gentleman.
[Sighs in perturbation]
Women.
Dr. Magnus?
Message for you.
James, please.
But you have been through all this before.
For God's sake, you could save lives!
We both know I can't interfere.
Then there will be blood on your hands.
Not if you do your job and stop looking for a short cut.
And if your very presence here has changed the course of events, interfered with the investigation, what then?
Can you live with that?
No, please, spare me.
I don't want to know the answer.
Because in the future, emotions, empathy, humanity, ceases to exist-- you should have caught him by now.
[Sighs in exasperation]
Yes, my presence here may have altered things, possibly for the worst.
That woman who died tonight should be the last victim.
But she won't be.
Remember the purpose of the Sanctuary.
To find and help unfortunate creatures, to protect them.
To keep the public safe.
Do that, and this case will be solved without any further bloodshed.
And if I can't?
That's an expression I've rarely heard you use.
What are you making?
Arsenic.
Strychnine..?
A toxin.
A last resort.
To mimic the blood disease that kills Imogene.
A fail-safe in case Adam cures her.
Dear God...
I'm not even sure I can finish making it, let alone give it to her.
If there was any other way to stop Adam Worth from completely disrupting the timeline...
Humanity isn't completely dead in the future, just so you know.
You're going out?
Where?
Hunting.
Your hair.
I like it.
I don't have time for this, John.
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear earlier.
[Switchblade snaps]
Hunting me will only make things more difficult for you.
Let me pass.
There's only one way to make you pay attention.
[Blows thud]
You're insane.
Oh, very much so.
Fancy some more?
[Joints crunching]
[Roars in pain]
How on earth did you-- ?
[Blow thuds heavily]
[Druitt groans]
[Blows thudding]
[Druitt gasps]
How does it feel?
Cold steel against your jugular?
In the hands of someone who knows how to kill you slowly and has the will to do it?
H-Helen?
Are you paying attention?
Stay away from me.
[Beast growls]
[Snarling]
[Roars]
Hello, Jack.
Know my name, do you?
Yes, I know who you are.
Jack knows you.
You're Gregory's little girl.
My father helped you, years ago.
Saved your life.
You're not a little girl anymore.
Older now.
Much, much older.
Smell like nothing I know.
You promised my father you wouldn't kill again.
That you'd leave London--
Jack did leave!
People hunted me down, like a dog!
This is my hunting ground.
If humans hunt Jack, then Jack hunts humans.
Here!
My ground!
The city's bigger.
You'll be found and killed.
Ah, I'm strong.
I'm too fast for them.
They'll never find me.
I can, and I will.
You can die like an animal or live with my protection.
Be safe from humans.
Humans can go to hell!
With my help.
If you kill again, I can't guarantee your safety.
Stop now, and I'll give you Sanctuary.
You have my word, and my father's.
I'm your friend.
[Roaring]
Spring-heeled Jack.
Thanks, love.
So different.
Such odd looking pieces.
You actually designed these?
Ah...
Some of them, yes.
To help me?
You are all I've been thinking about for a very long time.
Good.
You look tired.
I wish you'd take a rest.
I'm too close here, Imogene.
But once this is done, we'll be able to get all the rest we want.
Go places together, see things you've never seen that'll amaze you.
Soon, not only will we be able to see the world together, it will be ours for the taking.
Anything you want, anything at all, we take it, control it, use it to create whatever future we want.
I've never heard you talk this way before.
You're different.
So confident.
[Chuckles]
Chance of getting a biscuit with me tea?
As his lordship pleases.
This better be good.
I just climbed up six flights of stairs in new boots.
I was thinking about what you said, and I think you're right.
It isn't John doing these murders.
I'm listening.
Another creature, as violent and dangerous as him, with its own unique method of near-instant escape.
As I've been saying, but as you keep pointing out, none of the other possibilities make any sense.
No one can teleport like John.
What about incredible super strength?
The ability to leap quickly to high ground.
Rooftops.
Exactly.
You're certain.
[Girl]:
Yes, ma'am.

Before you start threatening me, or shooting me, for that matter, we still have that nagging problem of the witnesses.
Hello.
Imogene.
Dr. Helen Magnus, this is my daughter, Imogene.
You must be one of my dad's colleagues.
He said some friends might drop by.
How lovely to meet you, Doctor.
[Worth]:
Dr. Helen here is a ground-breaker, just like you.
What have you done, Adam?
How are you feeling, Imogene?
Better than I have in years.
Thanks to papa here.
No...
[Worth]:
Oh yes.
Healthy as a horse, I'm afraid.
Welcome to the future, Helen.
So, now that the game is over, what say we put away our guns, yes?
Starting with yours.
Unlikely.
Papa?
Are you going to shoot me in front of my own flesh and blood?
That's cold, Helen, even for you.
What's the meaning of this?
I'm sorry, Imogene, but this man is not your father.
Please, leave him alone.
I know it looks like him, but this man has ended millions of innocent lives, caused unimaginable destruction.
Don't listen to her, darling.
All of it lies.
Destroying Praxis?
Altering the timeline?
You have to be stopped, Adam.
Please, leave him alone!
[Electricity crackles]
[Bolts zap]
Papa?
What is that?
Just some insurance.
Stay here.
I won't be long.
Shaming me in front of my daughter, Helen?
Very impolite!

[Police whistles blaring]
[Thunder rumbles]
[Device beeping]
Oh, bloody hell...
[Sonic blast erupts]
[Glass shattering]
[Muffled]:
Drop the gun!
I said, drop the gun!
You just had to get all high and mighty with your amazing future, didn't you?
Couldn't get with the program.
No.
[Knife snaps open]
You stupid, small-minded-- [throws knife]

Papa?
Adam, no!
[Bolt snipes]
[Bricks crumbling]
Imogene!
No!
[Whistles blaring]
Imogene!
Imogene!
[Sobbing in anguish]
Stay back.
Do it, Adam.
We both go.
Neither of us belongs here.
Everything I've worked for, everything I care about destroyed!
By you.
I'll kill you for this, I swear!
[Fires]
[Police whistle blares nearby]
[Crowd murmuring in concern]
[Helen]:
Please.
Please, make room.
Dear God.
It's Adam's daughter.
The eaves must have collapsed on her.
Imogene?
Get away from her.
I'm so sorry.
Imogene?
Imogene?
Imogene?
Imogene...
No...
What have you done?
Both of you!
Adam-- if you'd have helped, she'd still be alive right now.
Her blood is on your hands.
And your hands!
We'd better be on our way, Helen.
Oh, that poor man.
[Sobbing]
[Roaring in anguish]
Spring-heeled Jack, the Sanctuary's newest resident.
I wish I could've told you earlier.
All that matters is that the streets of London are safe again.
As they should be.
I never meant to burden you, James.
All this knowledge you have to keep secret.
Oh, I love it, you know that.
What, all the deductive reasoning I'll be able to do with the little tidbits you've left me?
It's going to keep me occupied for decades, if I have that long.
In my future you do, many of them.
No, I don't want to know.
Far too much information.
Now that we've cleaned up all evidence of Adam, and the technology he brought with him,
I suppose there's only one thing left undone.
What to do about you.
I can't be here, James.
We both know it.
Everything I touch, everyone I meet...
Could ruin my future.
You'd best kill yourself.
I'm glad we both agree.
Helen, suicide?
[Chuckles]
You're so melodramatic.
Do you have a better idea?
I'm trapped here, and I have no way home.
You can always go home.
It just might take a little while.
It's one of the benefits of your incredibly slow aging.
Disappear.
Go somewhere... remote, with limited contact with the rest of world.
Spend the time thinking about...
All the things you've lived through.
113 years of seclusion?
Then you re-join your timeline just after you've left it.
Unless, of course, you're determined to do yourself in.
A vacation?
From what I gather, you've... rather earned one.

CENTURIES AGO IN JAPAN,
NIGHLOK MONSTERS INVADED OUR WORLD,
BUT SAMURAI WARRIORS DEFEATED THEM WITH POWER SYMBOLS
PASSED DOWN FROM PARENT TO CHILD.
TODAY THE EVIL NIGHLOK HAVE RISEN ONCE AGAIN
AND PLAN TO FLOOD THE EARTH.
LUCKILY, A NEW GENERATION OF HEROES STAND IN THEIR WAY.
THEY ARE THE POWER RANGERS SAMURAI.
[both shouting]
- WAH!
- EMILY'S USUALLY THE ONE FALLING OVER,
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN SHE HAS A SWORD IN HER HAND.
- MAYBE SHE CAN TEACH MIKE A FEW THINGS.
- HMM...
- DID YOU HURT YOURSELF?
LET ME SEE.
- NO, THANKS.
I'M FINE.
- HMM...
- HERE YOU GO.
- FROZEN PEAS?
- IT'S LIKE AN ICE PACK.
I WAS ACCIDENT-PRONE AS A KID,
AND IT ALWAYS HEALED ME RIGHT UP.
LET ME.
- NO, THANKS.
- YOU REALLY SHOULD.
MIKE!
COME ON.
IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER!
AHH!
- EMILY, ARE YOU OKAY?
- THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.
I'M SUCH A DISASTER.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.
YOU WERE DOING A NICE THING.
- I'M SO SORRY.
- NO, IT WAS ALL MY FAULT.
I WAS BEING SILLY.
I'M ALWAYS MESSING THINGS UP.
I'M SORRY.
I'LL CLEAN IT UP.
AH!

I'D BETTER GO VENT SOMEWHERE ELSE.
- YEAH, GO AHEAD AND RUN, YOU LOUDMOUTH!
I'VE GOT A FEELING
WE HAVEN'T HEARD THE LAST FROM THAT CREEP.
- THAT NIGHLOK IS A BULLY.
HE LIKES TO HURT PEOPLE'S FEELINGS.
HE CHANNELS MENTAL PAIN
AND TURNS IT INTO PHYSICAL PAIN.
- HE CAUGHT ME OFF-GUARD.
IT WON'T WORK AGAIN.
- LISTEN, I MAY HAVE HAD TRAINING WHEELS,
BUT I DIDN'T NEED 'EM.
- AND I'M A GOOD COOK, RIGHT?
- YEAH.
- YEAH.
- AM I BORING TO YOU GUYS?
- YOU'RE EXTREMELY DISCIPLINED AND ORDERLY, KEVIN.
IT'S A GREAT QUALITY FOR A SAMURAI.
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT IS.
- EMILY WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO WASN'T AFFECTED.
THAT NIGHLOK KNEW EXACTLY HOW TO HURT US,
BUT WHY COULDN'T HE HURT HER?
- PERHAPS EMILY HAS SOME SPECIAL POWER.
- IT'S NOTHING GREAT LIKE THAT.
I WAS TEASED AND CALLED NAMES AS A KID.
IT MADE ME SAD.
BUT MY SISTER TOLD ME TO JUST PRETEND
LIKE THE PERSON TEASING ME DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL,
AND IT REALLY WORKED.
SO WHEN THE NIGHLOK SAID THOSE THINGS TO ME,
IT WAS LIKE HE DIDN'T EVEN SAY THEM.
- THEN WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS PUTTING YOURSELF DOWN?
IT MAKES NO SENSE,
UNLESS THAT'S WHAT YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT YOURSELF.
- WELL, NO, BUT...
- MIKE...
- I'M SORRY.
I...
- MIKE, THE NIGHLOK CAN'T HURT HER FEELINGS, BUT YOU CAN.
- OH, MAN.
- UGH!
- THIS IS TO REMIND US

- UNCLE BULK, CAN WE REALLY BE SAMURAI WARRIORS?
I MEAN, TODAY WAS PRETTY SCARY.

WE'RE JUST TESTING TO SEE IF MEGATRON'S POWER STILL WORKS.
- YEAH, I KNEW I HADN'T LOST IT.

The South African tokoloshe.
- Let's not forget the tokoloshe.
Myths.
Legends.
Yes.
In almost every culture around the globe, there are references to 'little people'.
Now, are we to dismiss it as mere coincidence that separate cultures individually dreamt up the same myth, or is it not more likely that there is in fact truth behind that myth?
Look, I've had complaints.
Drop it from the course.
I'm no longer asking.
What a total chomp.
Worry not, Jennifer, the inquisition may have forced Galileo to recant his notion that the Earth revolves around the sun, but I am not so easily turned.

I had a word with your dad about taking you upstairs.
Really?
Yeah.
Don't get ahead of yourself, though, you've got a lot to learn.
I'll be able to do it.
You're just as cocky as your dad was.
I'm nothing like him.
You'd better hope that's not true.
Why?
- Because great Borrowers have an instinct.
They know what's going to happen before it... actually does, sense a bean before they're seen.
Do you have it?
Yeah.
I just like to let your dad take most of the glory.
You don't, do you?
No, I don't have it.
But your dad does.
As did his father and his father before him.
So I might have it?
I thought you didn't want to be like him.
I don't.
CLOCK TICKS
Hello.
We haven't got much time.
Why, what's happening?
I've been seen.
Get your things.
Come on, come on!
Can you give me a hand?
James?
What are you doing with those?
You're not to touch your mum's dolls' house!
Ever!
Sorry, I wasn't...
What's the clock doing like that?
Who did this?
- Look, leave it, Gran, I'll get it out.
What are you...?
No, Gran, don't!
Don't!
Gran!
Gran, would you please stop?
- Not until I see what's down there.
There isn't anything.
Gran, please!
You're tearing the house to pieces!
Dad...?
The table, now!
- Gran!
No!
Please!
Gran!
Stop!
Gran!
My things.
My compact, my old wristwatch.
I was just playing.
That looks like your grandfather's gold sovereign.
Aaargh!
Something just moved down there.
I didn't see anything.
BORROWERS SCREAM
Ugh!
They're everywhere!
They've got your grandfather's gold coin.
Thieving little pickpockets!
Run, Arrietty!
Run!
Don't hurt them!
- Vermin!
Gran, stop, please!
- Arrietty!
Arrietty!
- Come on!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Gran, stop!
- Vermin!
Through there.
Please!
- Ow, get off!
What's going on?
- It was them!
Little thieves, with their little hands, little faces.
He saw them, too.
Tell him!
I didn't see anything.
Liar!
- Carol.
I'm not crazy, Robert.
I know what I saw, and so does he.
Go, go, go!
Come on!
Go!
Jump!
Go!
What was all that about?
I built a den under there for my toys.
You OK?
I'm used to it by now.
Come here.
Try not to let it upset you, OK?
Your gran's still getting used to having us here.
Leave this lot.
I'll sort it out when I get back.
Where are you going?
I've taken a night job, just to tide us over.
You look after your gran for me.
Want a house left to come home to.
ARRIETTY SCREAMS
Aaaargh!
Aaargh!
Help!
Help!
Help!
OK?
He called you Arrietty.
What?
- The boy, he knew your name!
Look, if you'd have let me go up with you...
How could you be so stupid?
- I'm sorry!
I made sure he didn't see... see where we lived.
You should never have spoken to him in the first place.
You should never have been upstairs.
He could've killed you.
- Pod, breathe!
This isn't funny!
I know it's not, but you're turning purple and you're scaring her.
Maybe if we wait a while, they'll, they'll forget.
We could go back.
No.
Now that we've been seen, it's over.
All that work and what I did on the house - gone!
Yeah, but shouting at her isn't going to bring it back.
We're alive, that's all that matters.
Where will we live?
Somewhere new.
I've looked outside.
There's hundreds of houses, thousands.
You know, we might even find some other Borrowers.
Too many beans.
We'll emigrate.
We'll move somewhere far from here.
Somewhere safe.
Come on.
OK.
Let's go.
Move, move, move!
So, um, if I can ask, how exactly did you find out about my particular area of expertise?
On the internet.
- Ah, a silver surfer, eh?
Well, platinum blonde, if you will.
Naturally.
Ahem.
Oh, I'm sorry, this is Jennifer, my international research student.
She has a rare and inquisitive mind.
Rest assured, Carol, anything you wish to say to me, you can say in front of her.
So, how can I help you?
I've seen one of them.
One of what, exactly?
One of the little people.
We should have been honest with her.
You said that there weren't any others!
You said we'd have to travel for months.
You lied to me!
Your dad had his reasons.
- Homily.
Stay with your mother.
Oh, where are you going?
To find someone to get us out of here.
Pod?
It's been a while.
It certainly has.
How do people know Dad?
There's a nest of them under the floor.
It makes my skin crawl thinking about it.
You are certain it was here?
Where's it gone?
It was there.
My wristwatch was on the wall.
They took my husband's half sovereign, the thieves.
No-one stole anything.
I was only borrowing it.
This watch went missing long before you and your father moved here.
Tell me the truth now, and I won't be cross.
Well, that's not true.
I will be cross, but not as much as if you lie.
I took it.
Young man, have you any idea of the scientific value of these creatures?
A species so similar to our own, we could learn so much from Homo sapiens redactus!
Huh?
From the little people.
What little people?
Are you for real?
Oh, yes, I most assuredly am for real.
Professor?
Check this.
Tweezers.
Well, now, if you were planning to set a trap for Homo sapiens redactus, what would be the most irresistible bait, do you think?
Liquorice shoelaces!
Liquorice shoelaces!
Mum, please don't embarrass me!
What do you mean?
What can be embarrassing about this?
It's...
No, Arrietty, you...no.
Watch out!
Are you OK?
- Yeah.
All right, boys, I still got the top score, yeah?
Mum, where are you going?
You with the hair!
I'm talking to you!
Hi.
Hi?
Don't 'hi' me.
Didn't you see my daughter there?
Mum, it's OK.
I'm fine.
- Hi.
Hi.
- My name's Spiller.
She doesn't care what your name is!
Have you ever been on the back of a motorbike?
No.
No, and you won't either.
Take it from me, they're not worth the risk.
You've been on a motorbike?
We're not talking about me!
- Well, maybe we should be.
Oh, you keep rubbing me up the wrong way, see what happens.
I won't rub you up any way.
Apologise!
- For what?
For running her over.
OK, OK!
I'm sorry.
Were you hurt?
No, no...
I just grazed my hand.
- Oh, well, let me kiss it better.
I don't think so.
Where else are you hurt?
I've got plenty more kisses.
Right, right, let's just get out of here.
You never told me your name.
So close, so close.
And you wonder why your father kept you under the floorboards.
BEEPING
It's really changed here.
It's bigger.
Blimey, Pod, that's insightful.
Well, it is.
You've got a fight on your hands just walking down the street.
Yeah, but it's...it's fun to be at the heart of it all again.
I found a guide.
He's going to take us to a house far away from here.
Outside the city.
Only one bean.
Plenty of borrowings.
I was thinking maybe we could stay here?
We leave tomorrow.
Yeah, but I think it might be better for Arrietty.
I mean, down here, we are far from any beans.
I wouldn't be able to keep me eye on her.
Maybe that's a good thing.
We leave tomorrow.
# We are all made of air
# There's stars in my eyes and there's sun in my hair
# And I'm running away It makes me feel better
# It's just like you told me it'd be
# It's nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' at all
# When it comes down to this
# I'm neither sorry nor coarse nor unfit
# And I'm running away There's smoke on my sweater
# It's just like you told me it'd be
# It's nothin', nothin', nothin' Nothin' at all... #
'I'm sorry!
I had no idea you'd fly so well.'
'Can we try it again?
'
# I had some brand new shoes
# They were all red, but they gave me the blues
# And they're runnin' away They left me a letter
# It's just like you told me it'd be
# It's nothin', nothin', nothin' Nothin' at all. #
Throw a handful.
You might stand a chance of hitting something.
Let's see.
No, wait, don't!
You nearly had my eye out!
It serves you right for nearly running me over.
Why are you staring at me like that?
Cos you never told me your name.
Arrietty.
Hey, I didn't know she was your daughter.
Not that I'd dream of doing anything.
I see you've met our guide.
We were only getting to know one another.
Not too well, I hope.
I know your reputation, but I have to ask.
Payment on arrival, as agreed.
- Can I at least see it?
How do you know my dad?
He doesn't.
Do you want some rat?
It's good.
I hope you've got something else for us to eat.
Got some hedgehog.
- You're really quite grubby, aren't you?
Don't know how you mean.
Everything all right, Jennifer?
Yes, Prof. Just, there's quite a funk down here.
Is there any sign of our quarry?
I can't see any...
Wait...
I can see some footprints.
Looks like two.
Three, maybe.
Set the trap.
And make sure that the mechanism is well camouflaged.
What are you doing with those?
Oh, hello, um... .. boy.
Er, well, we're trying to ensnare your unwanted guests.
Er, alive preferably, but if not, well, a dead specimen is as much a proof of the existence of the species as a live one, isn't it?
I'm going to lower down another trap now.
You're wasting your time.
Oh, really?
They don't exist.
I think I'd rather believe your grandmother on that score, thank you.
By the way, I was wondering, is there a Mr Driver?
No, Grandad died years ago.
Excellent.
I mean, isn't it...isn't it excellent how your grandmother copes?
She's so alive, she's so, so vital.
You won't find anything down there.
- Ah, that's what you think.
Give my warmest regards to your grandmother.
Tell her we won't rest till we've captured all of these creatures.
Rob, it's really dark down here.
Oh, don't be such a cry-baby.
Arrietty!
It runs all the way out of the city.
Beans never come down here, so it's safe to travel, night and day.
Well, how do we get down?
I'll show you.
Argh!
Oh!
You are such a pig!
Now who's grubby, huh?
Whoa!
Come on, these are the only clothes I've got.
I'm not doing anything.
You've got that look.
- What look?
What?
- Oh, Homily...
Aaargh!
You are such an idiot!
You're the one who can't stand up straight.
I really don't like you.
That's because you haven't got to know me.
Right.
You're dead!
Hey, hey!
Not the face!
Come on, you know you love it, Dad!
What's all this?
Nothing, really.
Clearing out some old junk.
But this is your favourite game.
No, it's Daniel Wickes' favourite game, only bid, 3.50.
These are your toys, you can't!
Well, I hardly play with them any more.
James, you don't have to do this.
Garth Woods, 2.50.
Didn't your mum get you this?
She'd understand.
Right, better get going.
No, wait, Dad.
Your tie's wonky.
So what does 'shortlist' actually mean?
Two, maybe three other candidates.
- So you've got a good chance, then?
Oh, yeah.
Don't suppose you've seen my keys anywhere, have you?
Where's my key-ring?
Jeremy Harris, 70 pence.
Just...don't sell Gran, OK?
I'll be cleaning myself for a week.
God, you're such a princess.
She made a mistake.
It's called snow.
I know.
You know, no matter how much you think you know about something, until you've actually experienced it, you've no idea.
I was trying to do right by you.
By keeping me under the floorboards?
- You're still young.
I'm 16!
If you'd shown me how to borrow, I'd have... been more careful.
I wouldn't have been seen.
You went upstairs once, and look what happened.
I didn't know what I was doing!
If you'd've taught me...!
It was too dangerous!
- You're as bad as each other!
No, Mum!
I'm sorry, but no.
Arrietty!
What is it?
Proper food.
You be careful.
You're never happier than when you're telling me what to do.
Listen to him.
Arrietty!
Mum?
Dad?
HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYS
Yeah!
I totally rock on!
In your face, Axeman 95!
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING FROM SCREEN
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
COMPUTER BEEPS
Prof. Trap 501 has been deployed.
It's no use.
It's too heavy.
The candle!
Maybe we could melt the frame.
It's worth a try.
NOISES IN DISTANCE
What is it?
- Pod...
Give them here.
- I can do it!
GROANING
You've got to keep her safe.
The coin's still in my pack.
Dad?
You promise me you'll keep her safe.
- I promise.
I don't understand.
The matches will dry, we'll get you out.
It's too late.
- They're here.
Beans.
Go with Spiller.
No, I'm not leaving you.
You've got to.
- I won't.
Go with him to the Underground.
No!
I won't leave you here.
- You've got to listen to your father.
No!
- Just listen to him.
Don't be.
Take her, Spiller.
Come on.
- No!
Get off me!
We've got to go.
- I love you so much.
Mum!
Dad!
We'll be fine.
- Mum!
Oh!
Aren't you gorgeous?
How did it go?
Er, they said I had too much experience.
Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?
- It means he's too old.
What're you doing with those?
I thought we could put them up on the roof.
Gran's got a ladder in the garden.
I'm sorry.
We'll do it another time, yeah?
Come on.
I made you a sandwich.
I cut the crusts off so your hair won't go curly.
Let me.
You're making a right mess.
Your dad doesn't want to be out all hours, you know.
Feels like he does.
He's got job interviews, and the only reason he's working every night humping meat around is so we can afford a nice Christmas.
I don't care about Christmas.
Thanks for giving back the watch and the mirror.
I thought they'd gone for ever.
There's just one thing still missing.
Your grandfather's gold sovereign.
Is it worth a lot of money?
Your grandfather always said so.
Still, it's gone...
Isn't it?
Why are you asking me?
Because you took...sorry, 'borrowed', the other things.
Come on, James, you can talk to me.
I'm your grandmother.
I haven't got your stupid coin!
Hey!
Where are you going?
Huh?
Look, there's nothing we could've done.
- We could've tried!
And we'd have been taken too!
Come back.
Get off of me!
Get off!
Look, you can't go after them.
They're gone!
Don't you say that!
OK, OK, I'm sorry.
Getting yourself killed isn't going to bring them back.
Go back to the Underground, Spiller!
There's no way out.
What are they going to do to us?
I dread to think.
I'm just glad Etty's safe.
For now.
What do you mean?
There's no way she's going to let Spiller take her to the Underground.
She's far too stubborn for that.
- Oh, she gets that from you.
From me?
!
She doesn't just get the bad bits from you, she gets the good stuff too.
Your cleverness, your courage, your warmth.
Rugged good looks?
I wouldn't go that far.
But you should be proud, you should be pleased she wants to travel the world, that she's got the same sense of adventure as you.
I am.
I've been an idiot, haven't I?
- Yes, you have.
But you're my idiot, so you're forgiven.
Hello?
Spiller, is that you?
'Th...
This is a message for Carol, my platinum blonde bombshell.
'Anyway, I wanted you to be the first to hear the good news.
'We have them - 'the little thieves that have been terrorising you for so long.'

COUGHS
STRAINS
Jump!
Come on, I got you!
Phew!
A woman's heart is a curious thing.
An enigma wrapped in a quandary - a cryptic conundrum secretly scrawled on a scroll of finest woven papyrus and locked in a cyrus cylinder of the utmost complexity - it's unfathomable.
Utterly unfathomable.
I suppose that's why we find it so alluring, isn't it, Clive?
Oh, Clive.
I understand the creatures of the world at a cellular level, molecular, even, yet the secrets of a woman's heart are a mystery that I've never been able to solve.
Until now!
Ha!
Now, now, I can play the part of the conquering hero, the triumphant warrior returning, having slain the beast...
.. and I can lay my heart open at the homestead of my love.
Professor?
How long have you been standing there listening to me?
Not long...
Seconds.
Good.
Very good.
Excellent, so, how can I help you?
There's a problem with the specimens.
Sorry, I mean, 'the beasts'.
Do we get to slay them now?
Be quiet, Jennifer!
We should be safe here.
What is this place?
Hey, you're shivering.
We need to get you dry.
How?
Come on.
Hmm, I think I'll use ultrasound... see if I can detect a heartbeat.
What happened?
Well, it could be any number of causes, really.
Proximal factors, close human contact, airborne diseases, shock.
Does this mean I get to dissect the little skebangas?
I have to say, I find it a little disconcerting that you had that quite so readily to hand.
Jenny?
Yes, Prof?
Where have they gone?
Seriously, where are they?
What?
That's impossible.
And do I get a thank you?
What for?
For saving your life!
I'd have thought of something.
I should've let you get sucked up by that machine.
So why didn't you?
Don't think it's because I like you.
I don't.
- So why did you come back, then?
Because I want that coin.
And I need to keep you safe to get it.
So you're going to help me?
Don't look at me like that.
I meant what I said.
I still don't like you.
That's because you haven't got to know me yet.
Is that an offer?
Oh!
You move fast!
Not that I'm complaining.
Beans are coming!
- What?
No, they're not.
DOOR OPENS
Beginner's luck.
Which way?
Pod?
- I'm thinking.
Ah, how wonderful!
You can talk!
Run!
Got you!
# With the angelic host proclaim
# Christ is born in Bethlehem
# Hark, the herald angels sing
# Glory to the newborn king!
#
How do you know the words to this?
I picked it up.
They sing it every borrowing season.
You know the beans don't call it that.
They call it Christmas.
Who cares?
All I know is that for three weeks every year, the beans leave rich pickings for us Borrowers.
Hmm.
Strawberry cream for dessert every night.
Nuts.
Chocolate...
I could tell you were spoilt.
I lived in a hole.
Yeah, your dad's a bit of a nutter, isn't he?
Don't call him that.
You've changed your tune.
How do you know my dad?
You may not think to look at him now, but your old man's a hero.
What?
!
He stopped the beans from finding the Underground, and risked his life to do it too.
I don't believe you.
Fair enough.
Spiller, what happened?
Your dad wasn't able to save everyone.
There was a girl - she didn't make it.
Why?
He had to make a choice.
What was she called?
Eggletina.
My cousin!
Yeah, well, after that he wasn't seen around the Underground again.
Even though he saved the town, everyone blamed him for her death?
No, no, but he did.
That probably explains why you had it so good - if you didn't want for nothing, there'd be no reason for you to go getting into trouble, would there?
Nuts, chocolate, strawberry cream!
I haven't got close to strawberry cream in years, and you've been getting them every night!
Do you really think we'll be able to find them?
Yeah.
Of course we will.
No idea how yet, but...
REVEREND:.. whom in the Lord Jesus...
Can you get us back home - to my old home, I mean?
There's someone there who I think can help.
Who?
No, you can't be serious.
Not one of them.
They can't be trusted!
This one can be.
Well, I'm very sorry to hear about your grandmother -
I hope it's nothing too serious.
No.
Just a cold.
Rhinitis acuta catarrhalis.
Well, make sure you give her my very best wishes.
Yeah.
Now then, young man, do you remember telling me that this was from one of your dolls?
I suppose I must've been wrong.
Indeed.
Behold.
Can I have a closer look?
Don't touch.
They're wily little weasels.
Who are you calling a weasel?
I thought we agreed not to speak to them!
I'm not putting up with her insults - calling us names like that!
It's fascinating, isn't it?
Their domestic constructs are not so different from our own.
We demand food and water and to be released immediately!
Sustenance will naturally be provided.
We want you in the rudest possible health before you're presented to the world.
You'll be the scientific discovery of the age.
You know what you can do with your scientific discovery, you can stick that right up your...
MUFFLED SPEECH
You're going to put them on display?
Only for a very short period before we get down to the serious business of... anatomical analysis - physical tests, blood work.
Dissection.
- Obviously dissection.
You're going to cut them up?
!
- It's not as bad as it sounds.
We'll gas them first.
We're not monsters, you know.
Were there any others?
These were the only two we captured.
Why?
Have you see any more?
No.
I just saw those two.
- Oh.
Now, this exquisite grandmother of yours, do you think she's a bunch of flowers or a box of chocolates sort of person, hm?
Is James in?
Do you think he'll like it?
I think he'd rather his dad was around than some swish toy.
I wanted it to be special.
Well, what a stupid waste of money!
I thought I'd done something right for a change!
That would've been a change!
Yeah, I know, and how many more times are you going to let him down?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
It's all right.
- It's not.
You distract yourself with the little things, and you end up forgetting about what's really important.
I'm sorry.
What's this?
We didn't have enough to get by.
I thought you would get a job soon and I thought I could keep up the repayments.
They're taking the house.
Keep out of sight and let me do the talking.
'Thanks for getting me back, Spiller!
'Without you, I wouldn't have had a clue where I was going, Spiller'!
The attention of the scientific community will tomorrow be focused on the zoological department of a London University.
Professor Jonathan Mildeye...
That's him!
- You're alive!
Argh!
- Arrietty, run!
Argh!
You're pulling my face off!
- Let him go!
JAMES GROANS
He was going to squash you.
- No, he wasn't!
Are you all right?
This is Spiller.
He's an idiot.
Hey!
- That...
Who is he?
His name's Professor Mildeye.
He has them in his laboratory.
So they're still alive, then?
- For now.
.. and if it's true, it will be one of if not THE greatest discovery in natural history we've ever known.
Here, I got you this.
It should be comfortable.
The mattress has real springs and everything.
Wow, it's beautiful.
SPILLER SIGHS
I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but is this the only one you have?
What's up with it?
- Oh, nothing!
It's perfect, it's just that there's only one of it.
What's the problem?
There's plenty of room for both of us.
Well, Gran's upstairs now and I can't risk taking another.
Do you really think we're going to be able to pull it off?
I guess we'll find out tomorrow.
DOOR OPENS
I'd better get to bed.
Night, James.
- Night.
Hold on tight.
Come on.
Saved you a spot.
I knew I'd win you round in the end.
WOAH!

SIGHS
All these years, I've wanted to get away.
I miss them.
REPORTER: '.. where the lecture is due to begin.
'We're hearing from a reliable source that Professor Mildeye has in fact 'managed to capture one of the creatures, and... there's speculation he'll reveal it to us.
'The interest is huge and scientists from all over the country 'have descended upon the university 'eagerly awaiting this morning's presentation.'
LAUGHS AND HUMS TO HIMSELF
Ah, are we primed?
The camera's set up, ready to broadcast across the net.
We've already had over a million hits on the site.
I've been waiting for this moment all my life.
Years of ridicule, ostracised for expounding a theory that has turned out to be correct.
I've always been solid behind you.
And soon they all will be.
I shall join the pantheon of scientific greats
- Darwin, Mendel.
Crick, Watson.
Mildeye.
Are you OK?
Hold on tight.
If you want to get out, this is your last chance.
Nah, you'd miss me too much.

Oh, no!
This doesn't feel good!
Come on, climb!
We're not going to make it!
Climb!
SCREAM
BREATHES A SIGH OF RELIEF
You nervous?
It's OK to admit it.
Even I am a little bit.
You can do this.
You know, Spiller, you're a complete idiot!
So you've said.
And...and quite annoying.
Actually, very.
And arrogant!
Completely and utterly.
But I'm glad you're here.
You know, despite, you being you.
If I wasn't, you wouldn't like me.
Probably not.
So you DO like me?
SCREAM
Pull the cord!
Pull it!
There's the air vent.
Wait!
Arrietty!
- What?

So?
Do you?
Do I what?
You know.
Spiller, we haven't got time for any of your stupid games!
SCOFFS
- Unbelievable!
CHATTER

- The penmanship and enthusiasm.
They're almost childlike.
Well, she's getting on now.
Her hands are a bit shaky.
So what would you suggest I give her next?
Erm, silk stockings, perhaps?
But there is something else you could do to get my gran's attention.
Go on?
- Those creatures of yours.
Homo sapiens redactus?
Yeah.
She hates them, wants them all wiped out and I know where you can find a whole load more of them.
Keep back!
That's my husband you're molesting.
Homily, don't start!
The Professor wants them to get a good look at your anatomy.
I don't care what you call it, you're not getting your hands on my husband's!
Come here.
Dad's in his underpants and Mum's shouting.
So I guess they're OK.
PHONE RINGS
Prof...
I'm on my way now.
I want those clothes off by the time I get back.
Oh, Pod, I don't know how much more I can take of this.
It's going to be all right.
How?
How is it going to be all right?
!
How can you say that?
!
Because Arrietty's just about to save us.
- What?
!
Arrietty.
- Yes!
Now grab the thread!
We haven't much time!
OK, grab it.
- OK.
You first.
- But I...
.. get inside and see whether the organs are...
Pull!
That's it, that's it!
GASP AND GROAN
The boy made the most extraordinary suggestion.
He claims that there are whole communities of these Borrowers living underground.
Hey, I've got the car.
I'll be waiting for you.
Thanks!
You're amazing!
'Thanks, you're amazing!
'
Are you jealous?
!
- Hey, I don't do jealous.
Right, if anything, he's probably jealous of me...if anything.
Come on!
I thought I'd never see you again!
Pull!
.. great warrens of them beneath our very feet as we speak.
The implications of them are extreme...
Thank you.
Where are you going, boy?
Pull!
You gotta keep going!
- I'm trying!
You have secured the specimens?
What is it?
Why've you stopped pulling?
- He's about to be seen!
The beans are coming!
- Are you sure?
If she says so, I believe her.
- Hurry!
Pull!
Oh!
Where's my card?
!
Come on!
- Oh, come on!
Ah, it's no use!
Hold him steady!
GROAN
What are you doing?
!
We can't give up now!
We haven't got a choice!
- Spiller!
Hold him!
Hold him!
- Pull!
SNIGGERS
So you thought you'd get away, did you?
See you around some time.
- No, wait!
Spiller!
Get him, get him!
Spiller!
- Go!
I'll be fine!
Run!
We'll be caught if we go back for him now.
Run.
We've got to go!
Run!
- No.
This way, this way!
Ha!
Have you found him?
!
He's got to be there somewhere!
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Homily, just let her get on with it.
TYRES SCREECH
Relax, stay calm.
- Get us out of here now!
Come on, you little beggars!
Etty?
No, I...
I can't...
I can't just leave him.
He risked his life to save you.
- We'll go back for him.
But now, we really need to get out of here.
The little swine.
I suggest we get moving now!
Etty, trust me, please.
Right!
TYRES SCREECH
What?
It's...
They're getting away!
Get that specimen!
THE CAR BANGS ALONG THE VENT
Oh, no!
Disperse!
Disperse!
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way.
Come on, get out of the way!
Oh, no!
SCREAM
Watch out!
Get out the way!
Ah!
Stop that infernal contraption!
No!
MUZAK PLAYS
What?
!
Arrietty, I think you've done really well, but I think your mother's right, and I think I should drive now.
You two worry too much.
LIFT DINGS
SCREAM
Someone stamp on it!
Stop it!
Somebody stop that!
Somebody stop those wretched little creatures!
Please!
Stop, they're getting away!
Oh!
Somebody, please!
Don't let them escape!
No!
No!
Don't just jump out of the way!
Stop that car!
Etty!
- It's all right, we'll fit underneath them.
I don't think that's what your father's worried about!
SCREAM
No, no!
Boy, stop!
Stop, stop that boy!
He's got...
SIGHS
If anything's happened to Spiller...
- He'll be fine.
If Mildeye's got him, we're going back.
Wait, something's happening.
Thank you...
Thank you all for your patience.
Today, ladies and gentlemen, you're going to witness something truly remarkable.
In years to come, this will be regarded as one of... the greatest discoveries in scientific history.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...
Homo sapiens redactus...
.. Jacket.
- CAMERAS CLICK
LAUGHTER
Yes, yes, I know, I know it looks like a doll's... jacket.
Well, that's because it is a doll's jacket...
Erm, I, I, I...
I believe these creatures to be scavengers.
Where...
Where are you going?
!
Wait!
The truth frightens you, does it!
?
You're scared of the truth!
Well, I'm not surprised, because Homo sapiens redactus lives amongst us!
You Philistines!
Well, don't blame me, you go home and check your crawl spaces and skirting boards and your...and your attics, and when things go missing, don't come running to me because these people are watching us.
And they're laughing at us.
But I'll have the last laugh.
I'll be vindicated!
I will be vindicated!
I will!
These creatures do...ex...
You really thought those clumsy beans had any chance of catching me?
Spiller!
I really thought you were dead.
- No, not even close.
HOMILY:
AHEM!
Sorry, I, um, just obviously, I'm glad you're safe.
So you DO like me.
- Thanks, Spiller.
Just returning the favour.
- If you hadn't done what you did...
Maybe I had another reason.
If I didn't do it, I wasn't going to get my reward, was I?
What?
Well, that was the deal, right?
I get the coin.
What, so that's the only reason that you did what you did?
Well, no, but...
I thought you were doing something noble, something brave.
Hang on a minute, it was brave!
Wait...
Here, take your stupid coin.
Excuse me, would you mind if I have a look at that?
You know that was your mother's favourite toy?
She used to play with it for hours.
She used to talk to her dolls as if they were real people.
I miss her.
Yeah.
So do I.
Come here.
It'll get easier.
- Yeah, I know.
Now all we need is somewhere to live.
Yeah, I found the letter.
You sneaky child!
Sorry, we should've told you.
Try not to worry, we'll sort something out.
Not sure what yet.
Might end up sleeping in a tent.
Still, it'll be an adventure, won't it?
What's that?
How did this get here?
A tie with an electric guitar on it!
Just what I've always wanted!
You're lucky I didn't knit you a sweater!
Socks!
You haven't even opened it yet.
How do you know?
I don't need to.
Aunty Julie always gets me socks.
Maybe this year it'll be something different.
Pants!
She bought me a pair of pants!
- Ooh.
Lucky old you.
Ooh, choco-lattes.
LAUGHS More chocolate.
I just don't understand...
How is it possible?
I wonder where they've gone.
There's no wrappers.
It's like they've disappeared.
What have?
The strawberry creams.
Every one of them's been eaten.
Well, don't look at me.
I like the purple ones.
Penny toffee.
Right, so if it wasn't either of you two and it wasn't me, who else could it be?
You said I could have that coin.
It wasn't ours to give...
Remember, we don't take things.
We borrow.
Which means sometimes you have to give them back.
No, it doesn't.
That's a stupid idea.
And keep her safe, I was told, and I get the coin!
I kept her safe!
Rubbish!
I was the one looking after you!
- What?
!
If it wasn't for me you'd have been sucked up into that machine.
I'd have thought of something.
Yeah, you'd have been shredded to pieces.
It really wasn't as bad as it sounds.
- Arrietty...
Please, don't say I'm can't go out again.
- I'm not going to.
What?
I was wrong.
You've got a gift.
We think you should be allowed to go out and use it.
What?
Go, go where?
Anywhere you want.
Back to the Underground, wherever you choose.
But I've only just found you.
We'll always be here.
See you, squirt.
- Thanks for everything, James!
Take care.
I'll see you soon.
- Make sure you look after Spiller.
Laters.
I love you, Dad.
Wooh!
Try and be careful.
- You know me.
Woo-hoooo!

Whoa!
Aaaargh!
Oof!
Gran?
Oh, no!
I take it Dad's not home.
What's up with Henry?
Shut the door, quick.
We can't let it escape.
- Let what escape?
One of them.
The little people!
The little people?
Aaargh!
There we go!
Get it, Henry!
It's under the sofa.
Quick, hold this.
Me and Henry will herd them towards you.
You're our net man.
Don't just stand there!
- Your net man?
That's it, Henry, don't let him escape.
Tuck your shirt in, James.
Mum!
Did you hear that?
- Hear what, Etty?
There were beans, and a cat, and then I heard a loud thump.
Nonsense, you're letting your imagination run away with you.
Phe-ew!
Dad's in trouble!
- He'll be fine.
Aaargh!
Aaaargh!
Aaargh!
What are you doing?
- I was going to ask you the same thing.
Switch it back on, it'll escape!
What will?
- There it is!
What?
- It was one of them.
It was right there.
I'm sure of it.
Yeah.
All right, Gran.
You really expect me to believe nothing happened?
Yeah.
Well, what about the banging?
The cat?
The hoover?
Hoover?
What hoover?
- I could hear through the floorboards.
Don't be silly, Etty, your dad's far too clever to get mixed up with those creatures.
You'd have to be an idiot to go upstairs when there's beans about.
That's right.
You've got to realise that borrowing is boring.
Well, let me come with you next time, so I can see for myself.
Why?
Everything you need, I provide.
- Not everything.
there aren't other Borrowers round here.
You'd have to walk for miles.
It'd take weeks, months even.
What about my aunt and uncle?
My cousin Eggletina?
We can't.
We could go visit them.
You must know where they are.
We are not visiting anyone.
Why not?
- Because I said so.
It's so unfair!
I hate you!
'Thank you, Dad, for the beautiful strawberry cream...' What's that for?
I was worried sick.
I had it under control.
Yeah.
Sounded like it, too.
You know, you weren't much older than her when you got your first pickings.
Down here, she's safe.
Down here, we can take care of her.
Yeah, and having the time of her life!
Well, she has it better than most.
- It's not enough for her!
She's like you.
Borrowing's in her blood.
Arrietty?
# Black turns beamy bright
# Turning on the light
# Today is gonna be the day
# You hear somebody say
# We need you wide awake
# Tiptoe over the floor
# What are you waiting for?
# So so and no more
# That's all to be sorry for
# Today is gonna be the day
# You hear somebody say
# We need you wide awake
# No time for tea or lemonade
# Someone has set the date
# We're only half the way
# Drink a toast to the sun
# To the things that never come
# To the break of the day
# That is all I say... #
Aaargh!
Aaarghh!
- Aaargh!
Get away from me!
Ow!
If that's someone breaking in, I suggest you break back out again.
Gran, you won't believe this.
You can't let her see me.
- But...
What is it?
What are you hiding in there?
Nothing.
My paint pots.
Well, which is it?
Both.
It's nothing.
Well, no, it's not nothing, it's my paint pots, which is nothing.
I'm not hiding anything.
Have a look if you like.
Well, keep it down.
You might not need your beauty sleep, but I do.
You're telling me.
I can't believe she was right.
My own little person!
Who are you calling little?
Well, you are quite small.
No, I'm not.
It's you who's...too big, a great big overgrown giant.
We're just the right size.
We?
There's more of you?
I didn't say that.
Get back!
- Ow!
I was only going to help you out.
You aren't going to eat me?
Eat you?
What would be the point?
My name's James.
Arrietty.
You want a hand?
Yes, please.
Oh...!
If that was supposed to be funny...!
Well, it serves you right for stealing my gun.
We don't steal, we borrow.
So there ARE more of you?
What's that?
How about I show you?
So what exactly does this thing do...aaargh!
Arrietty, are you all right?
Look, I'm so sorry.
I had no idea you'd fly so...well.
Can we do it again?
That was the furthest yet!
What shall we do now?
What's out there?
How about I show you?
I've tried to imagine what it looked like, the sky, the houses.
It's amazing.
We call it Hackney.
Right, you must promise not to tell anyone.
I promise.
Who's that?
My mum.
She died last year.
Sorry.
We don't talk about her in case it upsets me.
I'll see you soon.
Well, go on.
Don't just sit there gawping.
Go.
See ya.
Cebuella pygmaea, the pygmy marmoset.
The pygmy hippo, Choeropsis liberiensis.
Microcebus myoxinus, the pygmy mouse lemur, which let us not forget, is, like you and me, a primate.
And, er, Atelerix albiventris, the African dwarf hedgehog, so called because of its white stomach.
Countless times, we come across these examples of, of life in miniature...and yet, and yet, the very notion of miniaturisation in the Homo genus is dismissed...
.. as absurd.
Despite clear photographic evidence.
Hmm?
Yes?
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Homo sapiens redactus, wise man reduced.
Well, thank you all for your attention.
Evidence, Jonathan, you need evidence.
There are photos.
- As there are of the Loch Ness monster.
Fairies, pixies, leprechauns, the Hawaiian Menehune, the Yunwi Tsunsdi of Cherokee legend, the Scandinavian Smallfolk.
The South African tokoloshe.
- Let's not forget the tokoloshe.
Myths.
Legends.
Yes.
In almost every culture around the globe, there are references to 'little people'.
Now, are we to dismiss it as mere coincidence that separate cultures individually dreamt up the same myth, or is it not more likely that there is in fact truth behind that myth?
Look, I've had complaints.
Drop it from the course.
I'm no longer asking.
What a total chomp.
Worry not, Jennifer, the inquisition may have forced Galileo to recant his notion that the Earth revolves around the sun, but I am not so easily turned.
For breakfast?
I had a word with your dad about taking you upstairs.
Really?
Yeah.
Don't get ahead of yourself, though, you've got a lot to learn.
I'll be able to do it.
You're just as cocky as your dad was.
I'm nothing like him.
You'd better hope that's not true.
Why?
- Because great Borrowers have an instinct.
They know what's going to happen before it... actually does, sense a bean before they're seen.
Do you have it?
Yeah.
I just like to let your dad take most of the glory.
You don't, do you?
No, I don't have it.
But your dad does.
As did his father and his father before him.
So I might have it?
I thought you didn't want to be like him.
I don't.
Hello.
We haven't got much time.
Why, what's happening?
I've been seen.
Get your things.
Come on, come on!
Can you give me a hand?
James?
What are you doing with those?
You're not to touch your mum's dolls' house!
Ever!
Sorry, I wasn't...
What's the clock doing like that?
Who did this?
- Look, leave it, Gran, I'll get it out.
What are you...?
No, Gran, don't!
Don't!
Gran!
Gran, would you please stop?
- Not until I see what's down there.
There isn't anything.
Gran, please!
You're tearing the house to pieces!
Dad...?
The table, now!
- Gran!
No!
Please!
Gran!
Stop!
Gran!
My things.
My compact, my old wristwatch.
I was just playing.
That looks like your grandfather's gold sovereign.
Aaargh!
Something just moved down there.
I didn't see anything.
Ugh!
They're everywhere!
They've got your grandfather's gold coin.
Thieving little pickpockets!
Run, Arrietty!
Run!
Don't hurt them!
- Vermin!
Gran, stop, please!
- Arrietty!
Arrietty!
- Come on!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Gran, stop!
- Vermin!
Through there.
Please!
- Ow, get off!
What's going on?
- It was them!
Little thieves, with their little hands, little faces.
He saw them, too.
Tell him!
I didn't see anything.
Liar!
- Carol.
I'm not crazy, Robert.
I know what I saw, and so does he.
Go, go, go!
Come on!
Go!
Jump!
Go!
What was all that about?
I built a den under there for my toys.
You OK?
I'm used to it by now.
Come here.
Try not to let it upset you, OK?
Your gran's still getting used to having us here.
Leave this lot.
I'll sort it out when I get back.
Where are you going?
I've taken a night job, just to tide us over.
You look after your gran for me.
Want a house left to come home to.
Aaaargh!
Aaargh!
Help!
Help!
Help!
He called you Arrietty.
What?
- The boy, he knew your name!
Look, if you'd have let me go up with you...
How could you be so stupid?
- I'm sorry!
I made sure he didn't see... see where we lived.
You should never have spoken to him in the first place.
You should never have been upstairs.
He could've killed you.
- Pod, breathe!
This isn't funny!
I know it's not, but you're turning purple and you're scaring her.
Maybe if we wait a while, they'll, they'll forget.
We could go back.
No.
Now that we've been seen, it's over.
All that work and what I did on the house - gone!
Yeah, but shouting at her isn't going to bring it back.
We're alive, that's all that matters.
Where will we live?
Somewhere new.
I've looked outside.
There's hundreds of houses, thousands.
You know, we might even find some other Borrowers.
Too many beans.
We'll emigrate.
We'll move somewhere far from here.
Somewhere safe.
Come on.
Let's go.
Move, move, move!
So, um, if I can ask, how exactly did you find out about my particular area of expertise?
On the internet.
- Ah, a silver surfer, eh?
Well, platinum blonde, if you will.
Naturally.
Ahem.
Oh, I'm sorry, this is Jennifer, my international research student.
She has a rare and inquisitive mind.
Rest assured, Carol, anything you wish to say to me, you can say in front of her.
So, how can I help you?
I've seen one of them.
One of what, exactly?
One of the little people.
We should have been honest with her.
You said that there weren't any others!
You said we'd have to travel for months.
You lied to me!
Your dad had his reasons.
- Homily.
Stay with your mother.
Oh, where are you going?
To find someone to get us out of here.
Pod?
It's been a while.
It certainly has.
How do people know Dad?
There's a nest of them under the floor.
It makes my skin crawl thinking about it.
You are certain it was here?
Where's it gone?
It was there.
My wristwatch was on the wall.
They took my husband's half sovereign, the thieves.
No-one stole anything.
I was only borrowing it.
This watch went missing long before you and your father moved here.
Tell me the truth now, and I won't be cross.
Well, that's not true.
I will be cross, but not as much as if you lie.
I took it.
Young man, have you any idea of the scientific value of these creatures?
A species so similar to our own, we could learn so much from Homo sapiens redactus!
Huh?
From the little people.
What little people?
Are you for real?
Oh, yes, I most assuredly am for real.
Professor?
Check this.
Tweezers.
Well, now, if you were planning to set a trap for Homo sapiens redactus, what would be the most irresistible bait, do you think?
Liquorice shoelaces!
Liquorice shoelaces!
Mum, please don't embarrass me!
What do you mean?
What can be embarrassing about this?
It's...
No, Arrietty, you...no.
Watch out!
Are you OK?
- Yeah.
All right, boys, I still got the top score, yeah?
Mum, where are you going?
You with the hair!
I'm talking to you!
Hi.
Hi?
Don't 'hi' me.
Didn't you see my daughter there?
Mum, it's OK.
I'm fine.
- Hi.
Hi.
- My name's Spiller.
She doesn't care what your name is!
Have you ever been on the back of a motorbike?
No.
No, and you won't either.
Take it from me, they're not worth the risk.
You've been on a motorbike?
We're not talking about me!
- Well, maybe we should be.
Oh, you keep rubbing me up the wrong way, see what happens.
I won't rub you up any way.
Apologise!
- For what?
For running her over.
OK, OK!
I'm sorry.
Were you hurt?
No, no...
I just grazed my hand.
- Oh, well, let me kiss it better.
I don't think so.
Where else are you hurt?
I've got plenty more kisses.
Right, right, let's just get out of here.
You never told me your name.
So close, so close.
And you wonder why your father kept you under the floorboards.
It's really changed here.
It's bigger.
Blimey, Pod, that's insightful.
Well, it is.
You've got a fight on your hands just walking down the street.
Yeah, but it's...it's fun to be at the heart of it all again.
I found a guide.
He's going to take us to a house far away from here.
Outside the city.
Only one bean.
Plenty of borrowings.
I was thinking maybe we could stay here?
We leave tomorrow.
Yeah, but I think it might be better for Arrietty.
I mean, down here, we are far from any beans.
I wouldn't be able to keep me eye on her.
Maybe that's a good thing.
We leave tomorrow.
# We are all made of air
# There's stars in my eyes and there's sun in my hair
# And I'm running away It makes me feel better
# It's just like you told me it'd be
# It's nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' at all
# When it comes down to this
# I'm neither sorry nor coarse nor unfit
# And I'm running away There's smoke on my sweater
# It's just like you told me it'd be
# It's nothin', nothin', nothin' Nothin' at all... #
'I'm sorry!
I had no idea you'd fly so well.'
'Can we try it again?
'
# I had some brand new shoes
# They were all red, but they gave me the blues
# And they're runnin' away They left me a letter
# It's just like you told me it'd be
# It's nothin', nothin', nothin' Nothin' at all. #
Throw a handful.
You might stand a chance of hitting something.
Let's see.
No, wait, don't!
You nearly had my eye out!
It serves you right for nearly running me over.
Why are you staring at me like that?
Cos you never told me your name.
Arrietty.
Hey, I didn't know she was your daughter.
Not that I'd dream of doing anything.
I see you've met our guide.
We were only getting to know one another.
Not too well, I hope.
I know your reputation, but I have to ask.
Payment on arrival, as agreed.
- Can I at least see it?
How do you know my dad?
He doesn't.
Do you want some rat?
It's good.
I hope you've got something else for us to eat.
Got some hedgehog.
- You're really quite grubby, aren't you?
Don't know how you mean.
Everything all right, Jennifer?
Yes, Prof. Just, there's quite a funk down here.
Is there any sign of our quarry?
I can't see any...
Wait...
I can see some footprints.
Looks like two.
Three, maybe.
Set the trap.
And make sure that the mechanism is well camouflaged.
What are you doing with those?
Oh, hello, um... .. boy.
Er, well, we're trying to ensnare your unwanted guests.
Er, alive preferably, but if not, well, a dead specimen is as much a proof of the existence of the species as a live one, isn't it?
I'm going to lower down another trap now.
You're wasting your time.
Oh, really?
They don't exist.
I think I'd rather believe your grandmother on that score, thank you.
By the way, I was wondering, is there a Mr Driver?
No, Grandad died years ago.
Excellent.
I mean, isn't it...isn't it excellent how your grandmother copes?
She's so alive, she's so, so vital.
You won't find anything down there.
- Ah, that's what you think.
Give my warmest regards to your grandmother.
Tell her we won't rest till we've captured all of these creatures.
Rob, it's really dark down here.
Oh, don't be such a cry-baby.
Arrietty!
It runs all the way out of the city.
Beans never come down here, so it's safe to travel, night and day.
Well, how do we get down?
I'll show you.
Argh!
Oh!
You are such a pig!
Now who's grubby, huh?
Whoa!
Come on, these are the only clothes I've got.
I'm not doing anything.
You've got that look.
- What look?
What?
- Oh, Homily...
Aaargh!
You are such an idiot!
You're the one who can't stand up straight.
I really don't like you.
That's because you haven't got to know me.
Right.
You're dead!
Hey, hey!
Not the face!
Come on, you know you love it, Dad!
What's all this?
Nothing, really.
Clearing out some old junk.
But this is your favourite game.
No, it's Daniel Wickes' favourite game, only bid, 3.50.
These are your toys, you can't!
Well, I hardly play with them any more.
James, you don't have to do this.
Garth Woods, 2.50.
Didn't your mum get you this?
She'd understand.
Right, better get going.
No, wait, Dad.
Your tie's wonky.
So what does 'shortlist' actually mean?
Two, maybe three other candidates.
- So you've got a good chance, then?
Oh, yeah.
Don't suppose you've seen my keys anywhere, have you?
Where's my key-ring?
Jeremy Harris, 70 pence.
Just...don't sell Gran, OK?
I'll be cleaning myself for a week.
God, you're such a princess.
She made a mistake.
It's called snow.
I know.
You know, no matter how much you think you know about something, until you've actually experienced it, you've no idea.
I was trying to do right by you.
By keeping me under the floorboards?
- You're still young.
I'm 16!
If you'd shown me how to borrow, I'd have... been more careful.
I wouldn't have been seen.
You went upstairs once, and look what happened.
I didn't know what I was doing!
If you'd've taught me...!
It was too dangerous!
- You're as bad as each other!
No, Mum!
I'm sorry, but no.
Arrietty!
What is it?
Proper food.
You be careful.
You're never happier than when you're telling me what to do.
Listen to him.
Arrietty!
Mum?
Dad?
Yeah!
I totally rock on!
In your face, Axeman 95!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Prof. Trap 501 has been deployed.
It's no use.
It's too heavy.
The candle!
Maybe we could melt the frame.
It's worth a try.
What is it?
- Pod...
Give them here.
- I can do it!
You've got to keep her safe.
The coin's still in my pack.
Dad?
You promise me you'll keep her safe.
- I promise.
I don't understand.
The matches will dry, we'll get you out.
It's too late.
- They're here.
Beans.
Go with Spiller.
No, I'm not leaving you.
You've got to.
- I won't.
Go with him to the Underground.
No!
I won't leave you here.
- You've got to listen to your father.
No!
- Just listen to him.
Don't be.
Take her, Spiller.
Come on.
- No!
Get off me!
We've got to go.
- I love you so much.
Mum!
Dad!
We'll be fine.
- Mum!
Oh!
Aren't you gorgeous?
How did it go?
Er, they said I had too much experience.
Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?
- It means he's too old.
What're you doing with those?
I thought we could put them up on the roof.
Gran's got a ladder in the garden.
I'm sorry.
We'll do it another time, yeah?
Come on.
I made you a sandwich.
I cut the crusts off so your hair won't go curly.
Let me.
You're making a right mess.
Your dad doesn't want to be out all hours, you know.
Feels like he does.
He's got job interviews, and the only reason he's working every night humping meat around is so we can afford a nice Christmas.
I don't care about Christmas.
Thanks for giving back the watch and the mirror.
I thought they'd gone for ever.
There's just one thing still missing.
Your grandfather's gold sovereign.
Is it worth a lot of money?
Your grandfather always said so.
Still, it's gone...
Isn't it?
Why are you asking me?
Because you took...sorry, 'borrowed', the other things.
Come on, James, you can talk to me.
I'm your grandmother.
I haven't got your stupid coin!
Hey!
Where are you going?
Huh?
Look, there's nothing we could've done.
- We could've tried!
And we'd have been taken too!
Come back.
Get off of me!
Get off!
Look, you can't go after them.
They're gone!
Don't you say that!
OK, OK, I'm sorry.
Getting yourself killed isn't going to bring them back.
Go back to the Underground, Spiller!
There's no way out.
What are they going to do to us?
I dread to think.
I'm just glad Etty's safe.
For now.
What do you mean?
There's no way she's going to let Spiller take her to the Underground.
She's far too stubborn for that.
- Oh, she gets that from you.
From me?
!
She doesn't just get the bad bits from you, she gets the good stuff too.
Your cleverness, your courage, your warmth.
Rugged good looks?
I wouldn't go that far.
But you should be proud, you should be pleased she wants to travel the world, that she's got the same sense of adventure as you.
I am.
I've been an idiot, haven't I?
- Yes, you have.
But you're my idiot, so you're forgiven.
Hello?
Spiller, is that you?
'Th...
This is a message for Carol, my platinum blonde bombshell.
'Anyway, I wanted you to be the first to hear the good news.
'We have them - 'the little thieves that have been terrorising you for so long.'
'Message deleted.'
Jump!
Come on, I got you!
Phew!
A woman's heart is a curious thing.
An enigma wrapped in a quandary - a cryptic conundrum secretly scrawled on a scroll of finest woven papyrus and locked in a cyrus cylinder of the utmost complexity - it's unfathomable.
Utterly unfathomable.
I suppose that's why we find it so alluring, isn't it, Clive?
Oh, Clive.
I understand the creatures of the world at a cellular level, molecular, even, yet the secrets of a woman's heart are a mystery that I've never been able to solve.
Until now!
Ha!
Now, now, I can play the part of the conquering hero, the triumphant warrior returning, having slain the beast...
.. and I can lay my heart open at the homestead of my love.
Professor?
How long have you been standing there listening to me?
Not long...
Seconds.
Good.
Very good.
Excellent, so, how can I help you?
There's a problem with the specimens.
Sorry, I mean, 'the beasts'.
Do we get to slay them now?
Be quiet, Jennifer!
We should be safe here.
What is this place?
Hey, you're shivering.
We need to get you dry.
How?
Come on.
Hmm, I think I'll use ultrasound... see if I can detect a heartbeat.
What happened?
Well, it could be any number of causes, really.
Proximal factors, close human contact, airborne diseases, shock.
Does this mean I get to dissect the little skebangas?
I have to say, I find it a little disconcerting that you had that quite so readily to hand.
Jenny?
Yes, Prof?
Where have they gone?
Seriously, where are they?
What?
That's impossible.
And do I get a thank you?
What for?
For saving your life!
I'd have thought of something.
I should've let you get sucked up by that machine.
So why didn't you?
Don't think it's because I like you.
I don't.
- So why did you come back, then?
Because I want that coin.
And I need to keep you safe to get it.
So you're going to help me?
Don't look at me like that.
I meant what I said.
I still don't like you.
That's because you haven't got to know me yet.
Is that an offer?
Oh!
You move fast!
Not that I'm complaining.
Beans are coming!
- What?
No, they're not.
Beginner's luck.
Which way?
Pod?
- I'm thinking.
Ah, how wonderful!
You can talk!
Run!
Got you!
# With the angelic host proclaim
# Christ is born in Bethlehem
# Hark, the herald angels sing
# Glory to the newborn king!
#
How do you know the words to this?
I picked it up.
They sing it every borrowing season.
You know the beans don't call it that.
They call it Christmas.
Who cares?
All I know is that for three weeks every year, the beans leave rich pickings for us Borrowers.
Hmm.
Strawberry cream for dessert every night.
Nuts.
Chocolate...
I could tell you were spoilt.
I lived in a hole.
Yeah, your dad's a bit of a nutter, isn't he?
Don't call him that.
You've changed your tune.
How do you know my dad?
You may not think to look at him now, but your old man's a hero.
What?
!
He stopped the beans from finding the Underground, and risked his life to do it too.
I don't believe you.
Fair enough.
Spiller, what happened?
Your dad wasn't able to save everyone.
There was a girl - she didn't make it.
Why?
He had to make a choice.
What was she called?
Eggletina.
My cousin!
Yeah, well, after that he wasn't seen around the Underground again.
Even though he saved the town, everyone blamed him for her death?
No, no, but he did.
That probably explains why you had it so good - if you didn't want for nothing, there'd be no reason for you to go getting into trouble, would there?
Nuts, chocolate, strawberry cream!
I haven't got close to strawberry cream in years, and you've been getting them every night!
Do you really think we'll be able to find them?
Yeah.
Of course we will.
No idea how yet, but...
.. whom in the Lord Jesus...
Can you get us back home - to my old home, I mean?
There's someone there who I think can help.
Who?
No, you can't be serious.
Not one of them.
They can't be trusted!
This one can be.
Well, I'm very sorry to hear about your grandmother -
I hope it's nothing too serious.
No.
Just a cold.
Rhinitis acuta catarrhalis.
Well, make sure you give her my very best wishes.
Yeah.
Now then, young man, do you remember telling me that this was from one of your dolls?
I suppose I must've been wrong.
Indeed.
Behold.
Can I have a closer look?
Don't touch.
They're wily little weasels.
Who are you calling a weasel?
I thought we agreed not to speak to them!
I'm not putting up with her insults - calling us names like that!
It's fascinating, isn't it?
Their domestic constructs are not so different from our own.
We demand food and water and to be released immediately!
Sustenance will naturally be provided.
We want you in the rudest possible health before you're presented to the world.
You'll be the scientific discovery of the age.
You know what you can do with your scientific discovery, you can stick that right up your...
You're going to put them on display?
Only for a very short period before we get down to the serious business of... anatomical analysis - physical tests, blood work.
Dissection.
- Obviously dissection.
You're going to cut them up?
!
- It's not as bad as it sounds.
We'll gas them first.
We're not monsters, you know.
Were there any others?
These were the only two we captured.
Why?
Have you see any more?
No.
I just saw those two.
- Oh.
Now, this exquisite grandmother of yours, do you think she's a bunch of flowers or a box of chocolates sort of person, hm?
Is James in?
Do you think he'll like it?
I think he'd rather his dad was around than some swish toy.
I wanted it to be special.
Well, what a stupid waste of money!
I thought I'd done something right for a change!
That would've been a change!
Yeah, I know, and how many more times are you going to let him down?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
It's all right.
- It's not.
You distract yourself with the little things, and you end up forgetting about what's really important.
I'm sorry.
What's this?
We didn't have enough to get by.
I thought you would get a job soon and I thought I could keep up the repayments.
They're taking the house.
Keep out of sight and let me do the talking.
'Thanks for getting me back, Spiller!
'Without you, I wouldn't have had a clue where I was going, Spiller'!
The attention of the scientific community will tomorrow be focused on the zoological department of a London University.
Professor Jonathan Mildeye...
That's him!
- You're alive!
Argh!
- Arrietty, run!
Argh!
You're pulling my face off!
- Let him go!
He was going to squash you.
- No, he wasn't!
Are you all right?
This is Spiller.
He's an idiot.
Hey!
- That...
Who is he?
His name's Professor Mildeye.
He has them in his laboratory.
So they're still alive, then?
- For now.
.. and if it's true, it will be one of if not THE greatest discovery in natural history we've ever known.
Here, I got you this.
It should be comfortable.
The mattress has real springs and everything.
Wow, it's beautiful.
I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but is this the only one you have?
What's up with it?
- Oh, nothing!
It's perfect, it's just that there's only one of it.
What's the problem?
There's plenty of room for both of us.
Well, Gran's upstairs now and I can't risk taking another.
Do you really think we're going to be able to pull it off?
I guess we'll find out tomorrow.
I'd better get to bed.
Night, James.
- Night.
Hold on tight.
Come on.
Saved you a spot.
I knew I'd win you round in the end.
All these years, I've wanted to get away.
I miss them.
'.. where the lecture is due to begin.
'We're hearing from a reliable source that Professor Mildeye has in fact 'managed to capture one of the creatures, and... there's speculation he'll reveal it to us.
'The interest is huge and scientists from all over the country 'have descended upon the university 'eagerly awaiting this morning's presentation.'
Ah, are we primed?
The camera's set up, ready to broadcast across the net.
We've already had over a million hits on the site.
I've been waiting for this moment all my life.
Years of ridicule, ostracised for expounding a theory that has turned out to be correct.
I've always been solid behind you.
And soon they all will be.
I shall join the pantheon of scientific greats
- Darwin, Mendel.
Crick, Watson.
Mildeye.
Are you OK?
Hold on tight.
If you want to get out, this is your last chance.
Nah, you'd miss me too much.
Oh, no!
This doesn't feel good!
Come on, climb!
We're not going to make it!
Climb!
You nervous?
It's OK to admit it.
Even I am a little bit.
You can do this.
You know, Spiller, you're a complete idiot!
So you've said.
And...and quite annoying.
Actually, very.
And arrogant!
Completely and utterly.
But I'm glad you're here.
You know, despite, you being you.
If I wasn't, you wouldn't like me.
Probably not.
So you DO like me?
Pull the cord!
Pull it!
There's the air vent.
Wait!
Arrietty!
- What?
!
So?
Do you?
Do I what?
You know.
Spiller, we haven't got time for any of your stupid games!
- Unbelievable!
- The penmanship and enthusiasm.
They're almost childlike.
Well, she's getting on now.
Her hands are a bit shaky.
So what would you suggest I give her next?
Erm, silk stockings, perhaps?
But there is something else you could do to get my gran's attention.
Go on?
- Those creatures of yours.
Homo sapiens redactus?
Yeah.
She hates them, wants them all wiped out and I know where you can find a whole load more of them.
Keep back!
That's my husband you're molesting.
Homily, don't start!
The Professor wants them to get a good look at your anatomy.
I don't care what you call it, you're not getting your hands on my husband's!
Come here.
Dad's in his underpants and Mum's shouting.
So I guess they're OK.
Prof...
I'm on my way now.
I want those clothes off by the time I get back.
Oh, Pod, I don't know how much more I can take of this.
It's going to be all right.
How?
How is it going to be all right?
!
How can you say that?
!
Because Arrietty's just about to save us.
- What?
!
Arrietty.
- Yes!
Now grab the thread!
We haven't much time!
OK, grab it.
You first.
- But I...
.. get inside and see whether the organs are...
Pull!
That's it, that's it!
The boy made the most extraordinary suggestion.
He claims that there are whole communities of these Borrowers living underground.
Hey, I've got the car.
I'll be waiting for you.
Thanks!
You're amazing!
'Thanks, you're amazing!
'
Are you jealous?
!
- Hey, I don't do jealous.
Right, if anything, he's probably jealous of me...if anything.
Come on!
I thought I'd never see you again!
Pull!
.. great warrens of them beneath our very feet as we speak.
The implications of them are extreme...
Thank you.
Where are you going, boy?
Pull!
You gotta keep going!
- I'm trying!
You have secured the specimens?
What is it?
Why've you stopped pulling?
- He's about to be seen!
The beans are coming!
- Are you sure?
If she says so, I believe her.
- Hurry!
Pull!
Oh!
Where's my card?
!
Come on!
- Oh, come on!
Ah, it's no use!
Hold him steady!
What are you doing?
!
We can't give up now!
We haven't got a choice!
- Spiller!
Hold him!
Hold him!
- Pull!
So you thought you'd get away, did you?
See you around some time.
- No, wait!
Spiller!
Get him, get him!
Spiller!
- Go!
I'll be fine!
Run!
We'll be caught if we go back for him now.
Run.
We've got to go!
Run!
- No.
This way, this way!
Ha!
Have you found him?
!
He's got to be there somewhere!
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Homily, just let her get on with it.
Relax, stay calm.
- Get us out of here now!
Come on, you little beggars!
Etty?
No, I...
I can't...
I can't just leave him.
He risked his life to save you.
- We'll go back for him.
But now, we really need to get out of here.
The little swine.
I suggest we get moving now!
Etty, trust me, please.
Right!
What?
It's...
They're getting away!
Get that specimen!
Oh, no!
Disperse!
Disperse!
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way.
Come on, get out of the way!
Oh, no!
Watch out!
Get out the way!
Ah!
Stop that infernal contraption!
No!
What?
!
Arrietty, I think you've done really well, but I think your mother's right, and I think I should drive now.
You two worry too much.
Someone stamp on it!
Stop it!
Somebody stop that!
Somebody stop those wretched little creatures!
Please!
Stop, they're getting away!
Oh!
Somebody, please!
Don't let them escape!
No!
No!
Don't just jump out of the way!
Stop that car!
Etty!
- It's all right, we'll fit underneath them.
I don't think that's what your father's worried about!
No, no!
Boy, stop!
Stop, stop that boy!
He's got...
If anything's happened to Spiller...
- He'll be fine.
If Mildeye's got him, we're going back.
Wait, something's happening.
Thank you...
Thank you all for your patience.
Today, ladies and gentlemen, you're going to witness something truly remarkable.
In years to come, this will be regarded as one of... the greatest discoveries in scientific history.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...
Homo sapiens redactus...
.. Jacket.
Yes, yes, I know, I know it looks like a doll's... jacket.
Well, that's because it is a doll's jacket...
Erm, I, I, I...
I believe these creatures to be scavengers.
Where...
Where are you going?
!
Wait!
The truth frightens you, does it!
?
You're scared of the truth!
Well, I'm not surprised, because Homo sapiens redactus lives amongst us!
You Philistines!
Well, don't blame me, you go home and check your crawl spaces and skirting boards and your...and your attics, and when things go missing, don't come running to me because these people are watching us.
And they're laughing at us.
But I'll have the last laugh.
I'll be vindicated!
I will be vindicated!
I will!
These creatures do...ex...
You really thought those clumsy beans had any chance of catching me?
Spiller!
I really thought you were dead.
- No, not even close.
Sorry, I, um, just obviously, I'm glad you're safe.
So you DO like me.
- Thanks, Spiller.
Just returning the favour.
- If you hadn't done what you did...
Maybe I had another reason.
If I didn't do it, I wasn't going to get my reward, was I?
What?
Well, that was the deal, right?
I get the coin.
What, so that's the only reason that you did what you did?
Well, no, but...
I thought you were doing something noble, something brave.
Hang on a minute, it was brave!
Wait...
Here, take your stupid coin.
Excuse me, would you mind if I have a look at that?
You know that was your mother's favourite toy?
She used to play with it for hours.
She used to talk to her dolls as if they were real people.
I miss her.
Yeah.
So do I.
Come here.
It'll get easier.
- Yeah, I know.
Now all we need is somewhere to live.
Yeah, I found the letter.
You sneaky child!
Sorry, we should've told you.
Try not to worry, we'll sort something out.
Not sure what yet.
Might end up sleeping in a tent.
Still, it'll be an adventure, won't it?
What's that?
How did this get here?
A tie with an electric guitar on it!
Just what I've always wanted!
You're lucky I didn't knit you a sweater!
Socks!
You haven't even opened it yet.
How do you know?
I don't need to.
Aunty Julie always gets me socks.
Maybe this year it'll be something different.
Pants!
She bought me a pair of pants!
- Ooh.
Lucky old you.
Ooh, choco-lattes.
LAUGHS More chocolate.
I just don't understand...
How is it possible?
I wonder where they've gone.
There's no wrappers.
It's like they've disappeared.
What have?
The strawberry creams.
Every one of them's been eaten.
Well, don't look at me.
I like the purple ones.
Penny toffee.
Right, so if it wasn't either of you two and it wasn't me, who else could it be?
You said I could have that coin.
It wasn't ours to give...
Remember, we don't take things.
We borrow.
Which means sometimes you have to give them back.
No, it doesn't.
That's a stupid idea.
And keep her safe, I was told, and I get the coin!
I kept her safe!
Rubbish!
I was the one looking after you!
- What?
!
If it wasn't for me you'd have been sucked up into that machine.
I'd have thought of something.
Yeah, you'd have been shredded to pieces.
It really wasn't as bad as it sounds.
- Arrietty...
Please, don't say I'm can't go out again.
- I'm not going to.
What?
I was wrong.
You've got a gift.
We think you should be allowed to go out and use it.
What?
Go, go where?
Anywhere you want.
Back to the Underground, wherever you choose.
But I've only just found you.
We'll always be here.
See you, squirt.
- Thanks for everything, James!
Take care.
I'll see you soon.
- Make sure you look after Spiller.
Laters.
I love you, Dad.
Wooh!
Try and be careful.
- You know me.
Woo-hoooo!
