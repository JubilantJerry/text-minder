Dominick Decocco.
Well, my two cameraman friends need to find their seats.
Let me see your tickets.
I suppose you getting premiere tickets for your friends wouldn't be the most difficult thing for a star of your status.
0023 and 0024.
That shouldn't be too difficult to find, goodbye.
Ooh la la, Danielle Darrieux.
I have to go down and socialize with these Hun pigs.
Let's go over it again.
Reel one is on the first projector.
Reel two is on the second.
The third one is on the spool.
And the fourth one is ready to go.
Okay, the big sniper battle in the film begins around the middle of the third reel.
Our film comes in on the fourth reel.
Somewhere towards the end of the third reel go down and lock the doors of the auditorium.
Then take your place behind the screen and wait for my cue.
Then burn it down.
Take your seats.
The show is about to begin.
Everybody, please take your seats.
The show is about to begin.
We'll see you later.
Not so fast.
A glass of champagne to toast "Nation's Pride."
My fräulein, may I have a word with you in private?
Certainly.
Excuse us.
Have a seat, my fräulein.
May I?
Mademoiselle Mimieux allowed me to set up camp in her office for the time being.
Let me see your foot.
I beg your pardon?
Put your foot in my lap.
Hans, you embarrass me.
Could you please reach into the right pocket of my coat and give me what you find in there.
May I?
What's that American expression?
"If the shoe fits, you must wear it. "
What now, Colonel?
The guy in the white smoking jacket.
Fucking shithead.
Faggot fuck.
Fuck you!
Bunch of shithead fuck.
Fuck you, too!
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches!
Get your hands off me.
You fucking bratwurst-smelling...
Goddamn you!
Get off!
Hmm.
Clever.
I informed the Führer that the audience has taken their seats.
He should arrive any minute.
Thank you, Hans.
You Jerry-banging, Limburg-smelling...
Let go.
As Stanley said to Livingstone,
Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?
Hans Landa.
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.
My hands to be exact.
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you.
Caught you flinching.
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.
Utivich?
Is that you, Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?
The woman?
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot. " Yeah, I was just thinking that.
You may leave us.
But stay alert outside.
So you're Aldo the Apache.
So you're The Jew Hunter.
I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?
J ust a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on Ice?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it?
"That's a bingo. "
You just say, "Bingo. "
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
U p there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999.999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?
I implore you.
We must destroy that tower.
Sarge, that tower...
The tower stands!
Gum?
Psst!
Psst!
It's time.
I should go lock the auditorium and take my place behind the screen.
So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
I informed the Führer that the audience has taken their seats.
He should arrive any minute.
Thank you, Hans.
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.
Is that clear, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
Over and out.
Herr Dr, Goebbels, excuse me.
Could I go out for a moment?
Perfectly understandable, my boy.
You go now, and we'll see you after the show.
Who is it?
Fredrick!
Shit.
Are you the manager of this cinema?
I want my money back.
That actor in the movie stinks.
What are you doing here?
I came to visit you.
Can't you see how busy I am?
Then allow me to lend an assist.
Fredrick, it's not funny, you can't be here.
This is your premiere, you need to be out there with them.
Normally, you would be right.
And for all the other films I do I intend to endure evenings like tonight, in the proper spirit.
However, the fact remains this film is based on my military exploits.
And in this case, my exploits consisted of killing many men.
Consequently, the part of the film that's playing now I don't like watching this part.
- I am sorry, Fredrick, but...
- So, I thought I'd come up here and do what I do best annoy you.
And from the look on your face, it would appear I haven't lost my touch.
Are you so used to the Nazis kissing your ass you've forgotten what the word "no" means?
No...you can't be here!
Now go away!
Fredrick, you hurt me.
Well, it's nice to know you can feel something.
Even if it's just physical pain.
I'm not a man you say, "go away" to.
There's over three hundred dead bodies in Italy, that if they could, would testify to that!
After what I've done for you you disrespect me at your peril!
Lock the door.
What?
Lock the door.
We don't have much time.
Time for what?
Forget it!
No, no, no...wait.
You want me to...
lock the door?
For the fifty-seventh time, yes.
When I kill that guy, you got 30 feet to get to that guard.
Can you do it?
I have to.
Champagne?
Extraordinary my dear, simply extraordinary!
This is your finest film yet.
Thank you, my Führer.
Thank you.
Who wants to send a message to Germany?
I have a message for Germany.
That you are all going to die.
Enough!
Stop it!
Turn off the projector!
And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who's going to do it!
I don't know what's going on.
That does not belong in my movie!
Marcel, burn it down.
Oui, Shosanna.
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face
of Jewish vengeance.
These are the American lines, Colonel sir.
Excellent, Hermann.
Hermann, uncuff them.
I'm officially surrendering myself over to you, Lieutenant Raine.
We're your prisoners.
How about my knife?
Thank you very much, Colonel.
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back.
Is that really necessary?
I'm a slave to appearances.
Scalp Hermann.
Are you mad?
What have you done?
I made a deal with your general for that man's life!
Yeah, they made that deal.
But they don't give a fuck about him.
They need you.
You'll be shot for this!
Nah, I don't think so.
More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.
You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?
I'd make that deal.
I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole H igh Command,
I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island,
I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know something, Utivich?
I think this just might be my masterpiece.
(DISTANT RUMBLING)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
(MEN SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am .
Are you aware of my existence?
Yes.
This is good .
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard .
I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile .
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing .
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite .
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation , there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel , would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
(CH UCKLES) Please , monsieur LaPadite , this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished .
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them .
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
Only rumors .
I love rumors !
Facts could be so misleading , where rumors, true or false, are often revealing .
So , monsieur LaPadite , what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
(CLEARS TH ROAT)
Again , this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain .
(MATCHSTlCKS SCRAPING)
So , the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
(AGREES IN FRENCH)
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
(CLEARS TH ROAT)
There were five of them .
The father, Jacob .
Wife, Miram .
And her brother, Bob .
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31 .
Continue .
And the children ,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
(SIGHS)
Amos was nine or 1 0 .
And Shosanna?
And Shosanna was
18 or 19 .
I'm not really sure.
Well , I guess that should do it.
(ZIPPER CLOSING)
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite , are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
(SIGHS)
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
(THAN KING IN FRENCH)
That they call you "The Jew H unter."
Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him .
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I , on the other hand , love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers ,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German .
(CHUCKLING) More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing .
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in .
It's a hostile world , indeed .
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would .
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread , a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
(AGREES IN FRENCH)
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail , they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel .
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel .
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them .
You don't really know why you don't like them .
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn , he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please , Herr Colonel , make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found , rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add , also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward .
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding .
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening , they don't speak English .
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
ls that clear?
(SN I FFLES)
Yes.

Au revoir, Shosanna !
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
ALDO:
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team , and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon .
Well , we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all , but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains , cross 5 , 000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating , mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed .
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform , they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man J im Bridger.
That means I got a little lndian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans .
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled , dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with .
Sound good?
ALL:
Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command , you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 1 00 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 1 00 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 1 00 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying !

Pleased to meet you .
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
Yes.
Then sit down .
How is your English , Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good .
Became American , got drafted , come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with .
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of H ugo Stiglitz.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
MALE NARRATOR:
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man , he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall , the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say , once the Basterds heard about him , he never got there.
(GASPING)
Sergeant H ugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis...
(MAN GROANING)
... I thinkyoushow great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
(BASTERDS WHOOPING)
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and , cousin , business is a-booming .
HIRSCHBERG :
(LAUGHING) Oh , yeah .
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you .
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard .
Besides you , we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again , you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them .
(SCOFFING)
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well , now, Werner, that's where you're wrong , because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees .
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held , how many is coming and what they brought to play with .
I respectfully refuse, sir.
(BATTAPPING)
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club .
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And , Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse,
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you .
And your Jew dogs.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)

MAN :
Right this way, Lieutenant.
(CLEARS TH ROAT)
Lieutenant Archie H icox reporting , sir.
General Ed Fenech .
At ease, H icox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap , will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid .
And your occupation before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well , sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published .
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G .W.
Pabst.
What should we drink to, sir?
Well ...
Down with H itier.
All the way down , sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes .
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon , sir?
Well , this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich .
Explain to me U FA under Goebbels .
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood .
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well , compared to, say, Louis B .
Mayer, how's he doing?
Quite well , actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B .
Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O .
Selznick.
Brief him .
Lieutenant H icox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino .
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film , sir?
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels , Goring , Bormann , and most of the German H igh Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo , as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino , blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth .
Jolly good , sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them .
Whole point of the Secret Service , old boy, you not hearing of them .
But the Jerries have heard of them , because these Yanks have been them the devil .
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you .
First thing , you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there .
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you , her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need .
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you .
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
Bridget von Hammersmark?
(CH UCKLING) The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild .
Indeed .
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was in a tavern .
It is a tavern .
Yeah , in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
N umber one being , you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous .
Stiglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful .
However, the off chance I'm wrong , things prove eventful ,
I need to know we can all remain calm .
I don't look calm to you?
(LAUGHS)
Well , now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
ls that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen , we need you to make damn sure no Germans , or French , for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised , the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress .
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans .

They're the ones that came in shooting and killing .
It's not my fault!
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm .
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
No.
I'm alive !

What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm , here's my deal .
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you .
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi .
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willi .
I want to trust you .
But...
But how can l?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you .
Come down .
(SN I FFLES)
Hey, Willi , what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal .
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal , we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead .
U p top , they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead .
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal .
No trust, no deal .
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
J ust take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
(VON HAMMERSMARK G ROANING)
Not so goddamn fast, doc.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)
(DOGS BARKING)
Before we yank that slug out you , you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John , why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd .
Yeah , we got a word for that kind of odd in English .
It's called suspicious.
(EXCLAIMING)
Everybody needs to calm down .
You're letting your imagination get the better of you .
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi .
You remember him , don't you?
Yeah , I remember him .
H is wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
H is commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
(GROANS)
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both .
(GRUNTING)
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three .
The other looks odd .
Germans would and did notice it.
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant H icox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes !
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon .
Least of all , by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino .
One , the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Fuck a duck !
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old U ncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg .
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted .
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
(SNORTS)
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam .
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg- mountain-climbing story.
That's German , ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking , drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian .
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib .
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian .
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good .
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good .
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building .
Who does what?
Well , I speak the most Italian , so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman .
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian .
Like I said , third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?

Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?

Nope.

(SPEAKING GERMAN)
So you're Aldo the Apache .
So you're The Jew H unter.
I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And , yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew H unter?
(SNORTS)
J ust a name that stuck.
Well , you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you .
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean , you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well , let's just say, she got what she deserved .
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed .
No, I guess not.
Well , back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in .
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24 , if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission , some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on lce?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And , yes, some Germans will die .
Yes, it will ruin the evening .
And , yes , Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get H itier, you won't get Goebbels , you won't get Goring , and you won't get Bormann .
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So , gentlemen , let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So , the way I see it, since H itier's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction , if I do nothing , it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you , Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen , I have no intention of killing H itier and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann , not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal .
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal .
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general .
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess .
(EXCLAlMS)
That's a bingo !
Is that the way you say it?
"That's a bingo."
You just say, "Bingo."
Bingo !
How fun .
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah !
Make a deal .
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann .
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down .
You know, where I'm from ...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging .
U p there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing , and 999 . 999 times out of a million , you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand .
What shall the history books read?

So when the military history of this night is written , it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans .
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in H itier and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich .
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well , that goes without saying .
And I would like the U nited States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end .
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well , sir.

Yes, sir.
GENERAL:
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you .

How about you , Utivich , can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean , if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical .
I mean , at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So ,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
(HANS SCREAMING)
You know something , Utivich?
I think this just might be my masterpiece.
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
Yes.
This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
Only rumors.
I love rumors!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31.
Continue.
And the children,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
Amos was nine or 10.
And Shosanna?
And Shosanna was
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
That they call you "The Jew Hunter."
Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
- Now
- My job dictates..... that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
Yes.
It's the girl.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5, 000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got a little Indian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!
Hey, Hirschberg.
Send that Kraut sarge over.
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
Yes.
Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse,
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
Donny!
Yeah?
Got us a German here who wants to die for country.
Oblige him.
Did you get that for killing Jews?
Bravery.
Yeah!
Oh, no!
- Oh, no!
Donny!
Yeah, Donny!
About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you.
Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park!
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!
He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street!
You!
Damn it, Hirschberg!
Donny, bring that other one over here.
Alive!
Get the fuck up!
Batter up.
You're on deck!
Two hits.
I hit you, you hit the ground.
English?
Wicki.
Ask him if he wants to live.
Tell him to point out on this map the German position.
Ask him how many Germans.
Around about 12.
What kind of artillery?
Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
He's going to hug his mother.
Well, ain't that nice?
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that.
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?
Practice.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
At that time, 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar.
Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle.
They're films, ain't they?
- Yes.
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.
Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper.
Shosanna has a collection of over 350 nitrate film prints.
Right this way, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
And your occupation before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
What should we drink to, sir?
Well...
Down with Hitler.
All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer, how's he doing?
Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film, sir?
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
Bridget von Hammersmark?
The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
Indeed.
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was in a tavern.
It is a tavern.
Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
Stiglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.
Mmm.
Well, if this is it, old boy,
I hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's.
By all means, Captain.
There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch.
Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily,
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
Now, about this pickle we find ourselves in.
It would appear there's only one thing left for you to do.
And what would that be?
Stiglitz.
Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls.
You outside.
Who are you?
British?
American?
What?
We're American.
What are you?
I'm a German, you idiot.
Speak English pretty good for a German.
I agree.
So let's talk.
Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
His name is Max.
We were in here drinking, celebrating.
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
It's not my fault!
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
No.
I'm alive!
Who's that?
Is the girl on your side?
Which girl?
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.
Yeah, she's ours.
Is she okay?
Wilhelm!
She's been shot.
But she's alive.
Okay, Wilhelm.
What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can I?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg- mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian.
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian.
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian.
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?
Yes.
Gorlomi?
Gorlomi.
Gorlomi.
Antonio Margheriti.
Margheriti.
Margheriti.
Dominick Decocco.
Dominick Decocco.
What's that American expression?
"If the shoe fits, you must wear it."
Fucking shithead.
Faggot fuck.
Fuck you!
Bunch of shithead fuck.
Fuck you, too!
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches!
Get your hands off me.
You fucking bratwurst-smelling...
Goddamn you!
Get off!
Hmm.
You Jerry-banging, Limburg-smelling......
As Stanley said to Livingstone,
Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?
Hans Landa.
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.
My hands to be exact.
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you.
Caught you flinching.
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.
Utivich?
Is that you, Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?
The woman?
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot."
- Yeah, I was just thinking that.
So you're Aldo the Apache.
So you're The Jew Hunter.
I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on Ice?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it?
"That's a bingo."
You just say, "Bingo."
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
Up there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999. 999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?
I implore you.
We must destroy that tower.
Sarge, that tower...
The tower stands!
Psst!
Psst!
So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.
Is that clear, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
Over and out.
When I kill that guy, you got 30 feet to get to that guard.
Can you do it?
I have to.
Champagne?
Who wants to send a message to Germany?
I have a message for Germany.
That you are all going to die.
And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who's going to do it!
Marcel, burn it down.
Oui, Shosanna.
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face
of Jewish vengeance.
Hermann, uncuff them.
I'm officially surrendering myself over to you, Lieutenant Raine.
We're your prisoners.
How about my knife?
Thank you very much, Colonel.
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back.
Is that really necessary?
I'm a slave to appearances.
Scalp Hermann.
Are you mad?
What have you done?
I made a deal with your general for that man's life!
Yeah, they made that deal.
But they don't give a fuck about him.
They need you.
You'll be shot for this!
Nah, I don't think so.
More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.
You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?
I'd make that deal.
I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command,
I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island,
I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know something, Utivich?
I think this just might be my masterpiece.

Nazi Occupied France"
Pappa
Go back inside and shut the door.
Julie, get me some water from the pump to wash up with, then get inside with your mother.
Ready Pappa.
Thank you darling, now go inside and take care of your mother.
Don't run.
This is the property of Perrier LaPadite?
Yes heer Colonel.
Herman, until I summon you, I am to be left alone.
As you wish Heer Col.
Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?
I am Perrier LaPadite.
It is a pleasure to meet you Monsieur LaPadite,
I am Colonel Hans Landa of the S.S.
How may I help you?
I was hoping you could invite me inside your home and we may have a discussion.
Follow Me
Colonel Landa, this is my family.
Col Hans Landa of the S.S. madame, at your service.
Please excuse my rude intrusion on your routine.
Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have heard in the village about your family are all true.
Your wife is a beautiful woman.
And each of your daughters is more lovely then the last.
Merci.
Please have a seat.
Charlotte, would you be so good as to get The Colonel some wine?
No, no
Merci be coupe Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine.
This being a dairy farm one would be safe in assuming you have milk?
Oui.
Then milk is what I prefer.
Very Well.
Could you please close the window?
Merci.
Monsieur, to both your family, and your cows,
I say;
Bravo.
Merci.
Please, join me at your table.
Very well.
Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to discuss,' would be better discussed in private.
You'll notice, I left my men outdoors- if it wouldn't offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies to step outside.
You are right.
Charlotte, would you take the girls outside.
The Colonel and I need to have a few words.
Monsieur LaPadite,
I regret to inform you I've exhausted the extent of my French.
To continue to speak it so inadequately, would only serve to embarrass me.
However, I've been lead to believe you speak English quite well?
Oui.
Well, it just so happens, I do as well.
This being your house, I ask your permission to switch to English, for the remainder of the conversation?
By all means.
Monsieur LaPadite,
I thank you for milk, and your hospitality.
I do believe our business here is done.
Mademoiselle LaPadite,
I thank you for your time, we shant be bothering your family any longer.
So, Monsieur and Madame LaPadite I bid you adieu.
Till we meet again!
Au revoir, Shosanna!
Chapter TWO "Inglorious Basterds"
No, no, no, no...
How much more of these jew swine must I endure?
I have heard the rumors myself!
Solders of The Third Reich, who have brought the world to their knee`s, now pecking and clucking like chickens.
Do you know the latest rumor they've conjured up, in their fear induced delirium?
The one that beats my boys with a bat.
The one they call "The Bear Jew"...is a Golem.
Mine Fuhrer, this is just soldiers gossip, no one really believes The Bear Jew is a golem.
Why not?
They seem to be able to elude capture like a aberration.
They seem to be able to appear and disappear at will.
You want to prove their flesh and blood?
Then BRING THEM TO ME!
I will hang them naked, by their heels, from the eiffel tower!
And then throw their bodies in the sewers, for the rats of Paris to feast!
KLIEST
Year mine Fuhrer.
I have a order I want relayed to all German soldiers stationed in France.
The Jew degenerate known as The Bear Jew, hence forth, is never to be referred to as The Bear Jew again.
Yes mine Fubrer.
Do you still wish to see Private Butz?
Who and what is a private Butz?
He's the soldier you wanted to see personally.
His squad was ambushed by Lt.Raines Jews.
He was it's only survivor.
Indeed I do want to see him, thank you for reminding me.
Send him in.
Werner and I were the only ones left alive after the ambush.
While one man guarded us, the rest removed the hair.
Hugo Stiglitz
How did you survived this ordel?
They let me go.
You are not to tell anybody anything!
Not one word of detail!
Your outfit was ambushed, and you got a away.
Not one word more.
Yes mine Fuhrer.
Did they mark you like they did the other survivors?
Yes mine Fuhrer.
Chapter THREE "German Night in Paris"
Paris
WHITE HELL OF PIZA PALU
GERMAN NIGHT LENI REFENSHTAL in PABST WHITE HELL OF PIZA PALU
What starts tomorrow?
A Max Linder festival.
Ummmm, I always preferred Linder to Chaplin.
Except Linder never made a film as good as "The Rid".
The chase climax of "The Kid", superb.
- I adore your cinema very much
- Merci
Is it yours?
- Do I own it?
- Oui
Oui
How does a young girl, such as yourself, own a cinema?
My aunt left it to me.
Merci for hosting a German night.
I don't have a choice, but your welcome.
I love the Refensthal mountain films, especially, "Pizu Palu".
It's nice to see a French girl who's a admirer of Refensthal.
"Admire", would not be the adjective I would use to describe my feelings towards Fraulein Refensthal.
But you do admire the director.
Pabst, don't you?
That's why you included his name on the marquee.
I'm French.
We respect directors in our country.
Apparently even Germans.
Even Germans.
Merci for assistance, Private.
Adieu.
Your not finished?
I'll finish in the morning.
May I ask your name?
You wish to see my papers?
Emmanuelle Mimieux.
That's a very pretty name.
Merci.
Are you finished with my papers?
Mademoiselle.
My name is Fredrick Zoller.
It's been a pleasure chatting with a fellow cinema lover.
Sweet dreams, Mademoiselle.
May I join you?
Look Fredrick -
You remember my name?
- Yes...
Look, you seem a pleasant enough fellow -
- Merci.
Your welcome.
- regardless, I want you to stop pestering me.
I apologize mademoiselle, I wasn't trying to be a pest.
I was simply trying to be friendly.
I don't wish to be your friend.
- Why not?
- Don't act like a infant.
You know why.
I'm more then just a uniform.
Not to me.
If you are so desperate for a French girlfriend, I suggest you try Vichy?
Who are you?
I thought I was just a uniform?
Your not just a German soldier, are you somebodies son?
Most German soldiers are somebodies son.
So your a war hero?
What did you do?
I was alone in a bell tower in a walled off city in Russia.
It was myself, and a thousand rounds of ammo, in a bird's nest, against three hundred Soviet soldiers.
What's a bird's nest?
A bird's nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower.
It's a high structure, offering a three hundred and sixty degree view.
Very advantageous for marksmen.
How many Russian's did you kill?
Sixty - eight.
The first day.
A hundred and fifty the second day.
Thirty
- two, the third day.
On the forth day, they exited the city.
Naturally my war story received alot of attention in Germany, that's why they all recognize me.
They call me the German Sgt.York.
Maybe they'll make a film about your exploits.
Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels thought.
So he did.
It's called "Nation's Pride", and guess what, they wanted me to play myself, so I did.
They have posters for it in kiosks all over Paris.
That's another reason for all the attention.
"Nation's Pride" is about you?
"Nation's Pride" is starring you?
I know, comical, huh?
Well, good luck with your premier Private.
I hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself.
Au revoir.
Mademoiselle Nimieux?
Oui?
- Ask her if this is her cinema?
- is this your cinema?
Oui
- Tell her to come down.
- Come down please.
I don't understand, what have I done?
She wants to know what she's done?
- Who says she's done anything?
- Who says you've done anything?
it's only the off spring of slaves that allows America to be competitive athletically.
America olympic gold can measured in Negro sweat.
DOCTOR JOSEPH GOEBBELS Second Top man in charge of the Third Reich
Good you came.
I wasn't sure weather or not you'd except my invitation.
Invitation?
- Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick?
- Yes it is, Heer Goebbels.
Emmanuelle, there is somebody I want you to meet.
Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to introduce you to the minister of propaganda, the leader of the entire German film industry, and now I'm a actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels.
Your reputation precedes you Fraulein Mimieux.
And normally, this is Heer Goebbels French interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.
Bon jour.
Bon jour.
And you've met the Major.
Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
Major Deiter Helistrom of the Gestapo, at your service mademoiselle.
Please allow me, have a seat.
Try the wine mademoiselle, it's quite good.
well I must say, you've made quite a impression on our boy.
I must say fraulein, I should be rather annoyed with you.
I arrive in France, and I wish to have lunch with my star...
Little do I know Be's become the toast of paris, and now he must find time for me.
People wait in line hours, day's, to see me.
For the Fuhrer and Private Zoller, I wait.
So finally, I'm granted a audience with the young Private, and he spends the entire lunch speaking of you and your cinema.
- So Fraulein Mimieux, let's get down to business.
... Heer Goebbels, I haven't informed her yet.
Unless the girls a simpleton, I'm sure she's figured it out by now, after all she does operate a cinema.
Francesca, tell her.
What they're trying to tell you Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has spent the last hour at lunch, trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels to abandon previous plans for
Private Zollers film premier, and change the venue to your cinema.
- What?
- I wanted to inform her.
- Shit.
I apologize Private, of course you did.
- What's the issue?
The Private wanted to inform the mademoiselle himself.
Nonsense.
Until I ask a few questions, he has nothing to inform.
Let the record state, I have not agreed to a venue change.
Duly noted.
- You have opera boxes?
- Oui
- How Many?
- Two
More would be better.
How many seats in your auditorium?
Three hundred and fifty.
But Heer Goebbels, that's not such a terrible thing.
You said yourself you didn't want to indulge every two faced french bourgeois taking up space currying favor.
With less seat's it makes the event more exclusive.
Your not trying to fill the house, they're fighting for seats.
Besides, to hell with the French.
This is a German night, a German event, a German celebration.
This night is for you, me, the German military, the high command, their family and friends.
The only people who should be allowed in the room, are people who will be moved by the exploits on screen.
I see your public speaking has improved.
It appears I've created a monster.
A strangely persuasive monster.
When the war's over, politics awaits.
Well Private, though it is true,
I'm inclined to indulge you anything.
I must watch a film in this young ladies cinema before I can say, yes or no.
So young lady, you are to close your cinema tonight, and have a private screening for me.
What German films do you have?
Ah Landa, your here.
Emmanuelle, this is Col Hans Landa of the SS., he'll be running security for the premier.
Charmed Mademoiselle.
And now I must get Reich Minister Goebbels to his next appointment.
Slave driver!
French slave driver!
Actually, in my role as security chief of this joyous German occasion, I'm afraid I must have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux.
What sort of discussion?
That sounded suspiciously like a Private questioning the order of a Colonel?
Or am I just being sensitive?
Nothing could be further from the truth Colonel.
Your authority is beyond question.
But your reputation does proceed you.
Should Mademoiselle Mimieux or myself be concerned?
Hans, the boy means no harm, he's simply smitten.
And he's correct.
Your reputation does proceed you.
No need for concern, you two.
As security chief, I simply need to have a chat with the possible new venue's property owner.
Have you tried the strudel here?
No.
It's not so terrible.
So how is it the young Private and yourself came to be acquainted?
Yes, two strudels, one for myself, and one for the mademoiselle.
A cup of espresso, with a container of steamed milk, on the side.
For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk.
So Mademoiselle, you were beginning to explain...?
Up untill a couple of days ago, I had no knowledge of Private Zoller, or his exploits.
To me, the Private was simply just a patron of my cinema.
We spoke a few times, but -
Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.
This is a simple formality, no reason for you to feel anxious.
- I apologize, I forgot to order the cream fresh.
One moment.
Wait for the cream.
So Emmanuelle
- May I call you Emmanuelle?
Oui.
So Emmanuelle, explain to me how does it happen, that a young lady such as your self, comes to own a cinema?
After you.
Success?
Like I said, not so terrible.
So you were explaining the origin of your cinema ownership?
The cinema originally belonged to my aunt and uncle -
What is there names?
Jean
- Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
Where are they now?
My uncle was killed during blitzkrieg.
Pity...
Continue.
Aunt Ada passed away from fever last spring.
Regrettable.
It's come to my attention you have a negro in your employ, is that true?
Yes, he's a Frenchman.
His name is Marcel.
He worked with my aunt and uncle since they opened the cinema.
He's the only other one who works with me.
- Doing What?
- Projectonist.
- Is he any good?
- The best
Actually one could see where that might be a good trade for them.
Can you operate the projectors?
Of course I can.
Knowing the Reich Minister as I do,
I'm quite positive he wouldn't want the success or failure of his illustrious evening, dependent on the prowess of a negro.
So if it comes to pass we hold this event at your venue, talented no doubt, as your negro may be, you will operate the projectors.
Is that exceptable?
Oui
Cigarette?
There not French, there German.
I did have some thing else I wanted to ask you,
but right now, I can't remember what it is.
Oh well, must not of been important.
Till tonight.
I must say, I appreciate the modesty of this auditorium.
Your Cinema has real respect, almost church like.
Not to say we couldn't spruce the place up a bit.
In Versailles there's a crystal chandelier hanging in the banquet hall that is extraordinary.
we're going to get it, and hang it from the very middle of auditorium roof.
Also I want to go to Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes, and just scatter them about the lobby.
What the fuck are we suppose to do?
It looks like we're suppose to have a Nazi premier.
Like I said, what the fuck are we suppose to do?
- Well, when I was watching the bosch I got a idea.
- I'm confused, what are we talking about?
- Filling the cinema with Nazi's and their whores, and burning it down to the ground.
- I'm not talking about that, your talking about that.
No, Marcel, just for sake of argument, if we wanted to burn down the cinema, for any number of reasons, you and I could physically accomplish that, no?
Oui Shosanna, we could do that.
And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate film print collection, we wouldn't even need explosives, would we?
You mean we wouldn't need any more explosives?
I am going to burn down the cinema on Nazi night.
And if I'm going to burn down the cinema, which I am, we both know, your not going to let me do it by myself.
Because you love me.
And I love you.
And your the only person on this earth I can trust.
But that's not all we're going to do.
Does the filmmaking equipment in the attic still work?
I know the film camera does.
How about the sound recorder?
Quite well, actually.
I recorded a new guitarist I met in a cafe last week.
It works superb.
Why do we need filmmaking equipment?
Because Marcel, my sweet, we're going to make a film.
Just for the Nazi's.
Chapter FOUR "Operation Kino"
The Village of NADINE, FRANCE
My honor - loyalty
Okay, I'm a fictional, literary character, from the past, I'm American, and that's controversial.
No it's not controversial.
The nationally of the author, has nothing to do with the nationally of the character.
The Character is the character.
Hamlet's not British, he's Danish.
So yes, this character was born in America.
- Schnapps, please.
- Sure, I'll be right back
- If I had a wife, would she be called a squaw?
- He's got it.
- Is my bloodbrother, Old Shatterhand?
- Yes!
- Did Karl May write me?
- Yes!
I am WINNETOU, CHIEF of the APACHES!
Hello, my lovelies,
I will join you in moments.
I'm finishing up a game with my five new friends here.
No hurry, Frau Von Hammersmark.
Take your time, enjoy yourself.
I Would like to get my friends some drinks, could you ask them what they want?
Of course.
- Gentlemen, courtesy of the frauline, what can I get you to drink?
Whiskey.
Three Whiskys
Well gentlemen, I need to excuse myself for a moment.
So what's on your card?
Oh, yes.
Let's see.
Gengus Khaun!
I would have never gotten that.
I thought this place was suppose to have more French then Germans?
Normally that's true.
The Sgt over there's wife, just had a baby.
His commanding officer gave him, and his mates the night off to celebrate.
We should leave.
No, we should stay.
For one drink at least.
I've been waiting for you in a bar, it would look strange if we left before we had a drink.
She's right, just be calm, and enjoy your booze.
- Eric, Merci
- Your welcome
You should come and play with us, it'll be fun.
But I'm working
Merci, but part of your job is entertaining the guests, so sit down with them.
Here she is.
Just remember, no funny bussines.
I'll show him some funny business, because this guy here is having a baby. just look at this.
I propose a toast to the happy father of Maximilian.
Cheers!
There's been some new developments.
The cinema venue has changed.
Why?
No one knows.
But that in itself shouldn't be a problem.
The cinema it's been changed to is considerably smaller then The Ritz.
So whatever materials you brought for The Ritz, should be doubly effective here.
Now this next piece of information is colossal, try not to over react.
The Fuhrer, will be attending tomorrow.
Frau Von Hammersmark, I was just thinking, could you sign a autograph to my son on his birthday?
I'd love to Wilhelm.
This handsome happy Sgt, just became a father today.
- Congratulations
- Thank you
So Wilhelm, do you know the name of this progeny yet?
I most certainly do, fraulein.
His name is Maximilian.
Maximilian, What a wonderful name, Sgt.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.
Thank you fraulein, thank you.
Max may not know who you are now.
But he will.
I will show him all of your movies.
He will grow up with your films, and this napkin on his wall.
Then, to the whole tavern...
I purpose a toast to the greatest actress in Germany!
There is no Dietrich, there is no Riefenstahl, only Von Hammersmark!
There's much to discuss and...
So, Frau Von Hammersmark, what brings you to France?
None of your business,Sgt.
You might not have worn out your welcome with the fraulein, with your drunken boorish behavior, but you have wore out your welcome with me.
Might I remind you Sgt.,you're an enlisted man.
This is a officers table.
I suggest you stop pestering the fraulein, and rejoin your table.
Excuse me Cap't, but your accent is very unusual.
Where are you from?
Sgt.!
You must be ether drunk or mad, to speak to a superior officer with such impertinentness!
I'm making YOU,...and YOU,...responsible, for him.
I suggest you take hold of your friend, or he'll spend
Max's first birthday in jail for public drunkenness!
Then might I inquire?
Like the young newly christened father, I too have a acute ear for accents.
And like him, I too find yours odd.
From where do you hail, Cap't?
Major, this is highly inappr -
I wasn't speaking to you Lt.Saltzberg, or you ether, Lt.Berlin.
I was speaking to Cap't I...don't- know- what.
I was born in the village that rests in the shadow of Piz Palu.
The mountain?
Yes.
In that village we all speak like this.
Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?
Yes.
Then you saw me.
You remember the skiing torch scene?
Yes I do.
In that scene was myself, my father, my sister, and my two brothers.
My brother is so handsome, the director Pabst, gave him a Close Up.
Major, if my word means anything, I can vouch for everything the Young Cap't has just said.
He does hail from the bottom of Piz Palu, he was in the film, and his brother is far more handsome then he.
You should rejoin your friends.
- May I join you?
- By all means Major
- Wonderful
So that's the source of your bazaar accent?
Extraordinary.
So what are you doing here Cap't?
Aside from having a drink with the lovely fraulein?
Well that pleasure requires no explanation.
I mean in country.
Your obviously not stationed in France, or I'd know who you are.
You know every German in France?
Worth knowing.
Well, there in lies the problem.
We never claimed to be worth knowing.
All levity aside, what are you doing in France?
Attending Goebbels film premiere as the frauleins escort.
Your the frauleins escort?
Somebody has to carry the lighter.
The Captain is my date, but all three are my guests.
We're old friends Major, who go back along time.
Longer then a actress would care to admit.
Well, in that case, let me raise a glass to the three luckiest men in the room.
I'll drink to that.
I must say, that game their playing looks like a good bit of fun.
I didn't join them, because your quite right Cap't, officers and enlisted men shouldn't fraternize.
But seeing as we're all officers here, and sophisticated lady friends of officers.
What say we play the game?
- okay, one game.
- wonderful
So the object of the game, is to write the name of a famous person on your card.
Real or fictitious, doesn't matter.
For instance, you could write Confucius or Fu Manchu.
Eric' More pens.
And they must be famous.
No Aunt Inga's.
When you finish writing, put the card face down on the table, and move it to the person to your left.
The person to your right, will move their card in front of you.
You pick up the card without looking at it, lick the back, and stick it on your forehead like so.
And in ten yes or no questions, you must guess who you are...
So let's give it a try, shall we?
I'll start, give you the idea.
Am I German?
No.
- Am I a American?
- No
Wait a minute, he goes to
Don't be ridiculous, obviously he wasn't born in America.
- So...
I visited America, aye?
- Yes
- Was this vist...fortuitous?
Not for you.
- My native land, is it what one would call, exotic?
Yes
That could be ether a reference to the jungle, or the Orient.
I'm going to let my first instinct take over, and ask, am I from the jungle?
Yes you are
Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask, whether your real or fictitious.
I however, think that's too easy, so I won't ask that, yet.
Okay, my native land is the jungle?
I visited America, but my visit was not fortuitous to me, but the implication is that it was to somebody else.
When I went from the jungle to America,...
- Did I go by boat?
- Yes
- Did I go against my will?
- Yes
- On this boat ride,...
Was I in chains?
- Yes
- When I arrived in America,...
Was I displayed in chains?
- Yes
- Am I the story of the Negro in America?
- No
Well then I must be King Kong.
Bravo, that was impressive.
Now since I answered correctly, you all need to finnish your drinks.
Now, who's next?
Major, I don't mean to be rude.
But... the four of us are very good friends.
And the four of us haven't seen each other in quite a while.
So...
Major, I'm afraid, you are intruding.
I beg to differ Cap't.
It's only if the fraulein considers my presence a intrusion, that I become a intruder.
How about it fraulein?
Am I intruding?
Of course not, Major.
I didn't think so.
It's simply the young Cap't is immune to my charms.
I'm just joking, of course I'm intruding.
Allow me to refill your glasses gentlemen, and I will bid you and the fraulein adieu.
Eric has a bottle of thirty
- three year old single malt scotch whisky from the Scottish highlands.
What do you say gentlemen?
Your most gracious, sir.
Eric, the thirty - three, and new glasses!
You don't want to contaminate the thirty - three with the swill you were drinking.
- How many glasses?
- Five glasses
- Not me.
I like scotch, scotch doesn't like me.
- Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly.
Three glasses
To a thousand year Reich!
Did you hear that?
That's the sound of my Luger pointed right at your testicles.
Why do you have a Luger pointed at my testicles?
Because you've just given yourself away, Cap't.
Your no more German then that scotch.
- Well,
- Major - -
- Major-
Shut up slut.
You were saying?
I was saying that makes two of us.
I've had a gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.
That makes three of us.
And at this range, I'm a real Fredrick Zoller.
Looks like we have a bit of a sticky situation here.
What's going to happen, Major, is you're going to stand up, and walk out that door with us.
No no no no no no, I don't think so.
I'm afraid you and I both know, no matter what happens to anybody else in this room, the two of us aren't going anywhere.
Too bad about them though.
They seem like a likeable bunch
You two will have to shoot them.
I thought so.
So you run with the American's now, huh?
Now times are bad?
You despicable traitor.
For now.
Willhelm, think of Maximillian.
I've been rethinking my position in regards to your Paris premiere of "Nations Pride".
As the weeks have gone on, and the Americans are on the beach,
I do find myself thinking more and more about this Private Zoller.
This boy has done something tremendous for us.
And I'm beginning to think my participation in this event could be meaningful.
Ahhh Hugo, you've moved up in the world I see.
Lieutenant.
And with your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.
And that ones name is Weiheim Wicki.
He's an Austrian born jew, who immigrated to the United
States when things began turning sour for the Israelites.
They are the two German born members of The Basterds.
They've been known to don german uniforms, to ambush squads.
But that doesnt look like this.
This is odd.
It would appear somebodies missing.
Somebody fashionable.
Chapter FIVE "Revenge of the Giant Face"
NIGHT OF "NATION'S PRIDE" PREMIERE
- Ooh lala, this is so exciting
- Shut up fool
- Sorry
You know this is a brilliant idea.
But do you really think we'll pull it off?
We don't have any other choice
Quickly, get him on the table.
- I should just kill you
- No please don't
- What are we gonna do with him now?
I'd like to know what you were doing here in the first place
Hermann Goering
- No, no look...
Won the gold for germany in the olympics
Not as big of a deal as this boy.
- Yeah, this is a great deal for germany. the premiere of a true hero
And let me present the owner of this cinema and our host
Nice to meet you madame. beautiful set - up you have here...
Fraulein Von Hammersmark
Colonel Landa, it's been years.
Dashing as ever I see.
So what's happened to your lovely leg, a by product of kicking ass in the German cinema, no doubt.
Save your flattery, you old dog.
I know too many of your former conquests, to fall into that honey pot.
Seriously, what happened?
Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I might add, at mountain climbing.
And this was the result.
Mountain climbing?
That's how you injured your leg, mountain climbing?
Believe it or not, yes it is.
Forgive me, fraulein.
I don't mean laugh at your misfortune.
It's just mountain climbing?
I'm curious fraulein, what could of ever compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor?
Well, I chant be doing it again, I can tell you that.
That cast looks as fresh as my old Uncle Gustave, when were you climbing this mountain, last night?
Very good eye, Colonel.
It happened yesterday morning.
And where exactly in Paris is this mountain?
I'm just teasing you, fraulein.
You know me, I tease rough.
So who are your three handsome escorts?
I'm afraid neither three speak a word of German.
They're friends of mine from Italy.
This is a wonderful Italian stuntman, Enzo Gorlomi
A very talented cameraman, Antonio Margheriti
And Antonio's camera assistant, Dominick Decocco
Gentlemen, this is a old friend, Col. Sans Landa of the S.S.
Good evening
Welcome gentlemen.
Friends of our beloved stars, which we all admire, the true gems of our culture will naturally be under my personal protection
Thank you
Did I pronounce that properly?
Yes, yes, it's correct.
Repeat once more
Excuse me, how?
Once again, I ask
And your name is?
Again
One more time, but let me really hear the music in it.
and you?
Well, my two cameraman friends need to find there seats.
These are your tickets
0023 and 0024 your places are easy to find. see you later
Martin Bormann
Ooh lala, Danielle Darrieux
I have to go down and socialize with these Hun pigs.
Let's go over it again?
Reel one is on the first projector.
Reel two is on the second.
Three and four are ready to go.
Okay, the big sniper battle in the film begins around the middle of the third reel.
Our film, comes on in the forth reel, so Somewhere towards the end of the third reel, go down and lock the doors of the auditorium.
Then take your place behind the screen, and wait for my CUE, when I give it to you,
BURN IT DOWN!
Take your seats!
The show is about to begin!
Everybody take your seatsl
Its starting
- Yes, but let's enjoy a glass of champagne first
- I need to speak with you alone for a moment
- Of course
Excuse us
Have a seat fraulein.
Let me see your foot.
I beg your pardon?
Put your foot in my lap.
Colonel, you embarrass me.
Now, to your right, in the bag, there's a shoe. get it
Can I have it please?
What now Colonel?
Clever
- The Fuhrer will be here in a moment and we can start
- Thank you
It's time.
I should go lock the auditorium, and take my place behind the screen.
Perfectly understandable, dear boy.
You go now, and we'll see you after the show.
- Who is it?
- Fredrick
Are you the manager, of this cinema?
I want my money back.
That actor in the movie stinks.
- What are you doing here?
- I came to visit you
- Can't you see how busy I am?
- Then allow me to lend a assist.
Fredrick it's not funny, you can't be here.
This is your premiere, you need to be out there with them.
Normally, you would be right.
And for all the other films I do, I intend to endure evenings like tonight, in the proper sprit.
However the fact remains, this film, is based on my military exploits.
And in this case, my exploits consisted of me killing many men.
Consequently, the part of the film that's playing now, I don't like watching this part.
Fredrick, I am sorry, but -
- So, I thought, I'd come up here and do what I do best, annoy you.
And from the look on your face, it would appear I haven't lost my touch.
Are you so use to the Nazi's kissing your ass, you've forgotten what the word, "No" means?
No Fredrick, you can't come in here, now go away!
Well, it's nice to know you can feel something.
Even if it's just physical pain.
I'm not a man you say, "Go away" to.
There's over three hundred dead bodies in Russia, that if they could, would testify to that.
After what I've done for you, you disrespect me at your peril.
I have to get prepared for the reel change.
- What
- I have to get prepared for the reel change
- Let me do it
- No
Oh, please, it's been two years since i've done a reel change.
I said no
Fabulous, just fabulous.
The best movie this year
Thank you, Fuhrer...
Thank you

Once upon a time... in Nazi-occupied France
(DISTANT RUMBLING)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Retourne à l'intérieur|et fermez la porte.
Julie, prends-moi de l'eau à la pompe|pour que je me nettoie,.
et rentre à l'intérieur|avec tes soeurs.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Ca y est, papa.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Merci ma chérie
Maintenant tu rentres à|
I'intérieur et tu t'occupes de tes soeurs.
Ne cours pas.
(MEN SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Eest-ce la propriété de Perrier LaPadite?
Je suis Perrier LaPadite.
C'est un plaisir de vous rencontrer,|monsieur LaPadite,
Je suis le colonel S.S. Hans Landa.
Que puis-je faire pour vous?
J'espérais que vous m'inviteriez à rentrer chez que nous puissions avoir une discussion.
Certainement.
Je vous en prie.
Colonel Landa, voici ma famille.
Colonel Hans Landa of the SS Mademoiselle à votre service.
Les rumeurs qui circulent dans le village...|au sujet de votre families|sont tout à fait toutes fondées.
Monsieur LaPadite, vos filles sont|toutes plus jolies les unes que les autres.
Merci.
Je vous en prie asseyez-vous.
Suzanne, tu veux bien aller|chercher du vin pour le colonel.
But no.
Merci beaucoup, Monsieur LaPadite,|pas de vin.
Puisque nous sommes sur une exploitation laitière|je suppose sans risque de me tromper que vous avez du lait...
Oui.
- Alors je préfère du lait.
Très bien.
Tu veux bien aller fermer|
la fenêtre s'il-te-plaît.
Merci.
Monsieur, à votre famille et à vos vaches je dis bravo.
Merci.
- Je vous en prie, venez me rejoindre à votre table.
- Certainement.
Monsieur LaPadite...
Monsieur LaPadite,|vu ce que nous avons à discuter
Vous avez vu que j'ai laissé mes hommes|à l'extérieur, si cela ne les offense pas, pourriez-vous|demander à vos filles de sortir?
Vous avez raison
Charlotte, tu veux|bien amener tes soeurs dehors?
Le colonel et moi|on a deux-trois mots à se dire.
Monsieur LaPadite...
Monsieur LaPadite, je suis au|regret de vous informer que j'ai épuisé I'étendue|de mon français.
Continuer à le parler|si peu convenablement|ne ferait que me gêner.
Cependant, je crois savoir que vous parlez|un anglais tout à fait correct, n'est-ce pas?
Yes.
Ma foi, il se trouve que moi aussi.|
Puisque nous sommes ici chez vous, je vous demande la permission de passer|à l'anglais pour le reste de la conversation.
Certainement.
While I'm very familiar|with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing|if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
-Yes.|
-This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been|ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard that the Fϋhrer has put you in charge|of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Fϋhrer couldn't have|said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house|nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise,|when under new management, there is always|a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time,|but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions,|monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close|the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation,|there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families|among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel,|would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
(CHUCKLES) Please,|monsieur LaPadite, this is your house,|make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families|in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year|it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion|that they've either made good their escape or someone|is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about|the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
-Only rumors.|
-I love rumors!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false,|are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard|regarding the Dreyfuses?
(CLEARS THROAT)
Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses|had made their way into Spain.
(MATCHSTICKS SCRAPING)
So, the rumors you've heard|have been of escape?
(AGREES IN FRENCH)
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses,|would you confirm for me the exact members of the household|and their names?
(CLEARS THROAT)
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31 .
Continue.
And the children,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
(SIGHS)
Amos was nine or 1 0.
-And Shosanna?
|
-And Shosanna was
1 8 or 1 9.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
(ZIPPER CLOSING)
However, before I go, could I have|another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname|the people of France have given me?
(SIGHS)
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
(THANKING IN FRENCH)
-That they call you "The Jew Hunter."|
-Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague|have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name|"the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done|everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand,|
love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me|such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
(CHUCKLING) More precisely,|a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute|the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning|and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes|the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Fϋhrer and Goebbels' propaganda|have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment|the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper|through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create|this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague,|but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease|a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
(AGREES IN FRENCH)
Yet, I assume you don't share|the same animosity with squirrels
-that you do with rats, do you?
|
-No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail,|they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference|to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now,|as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer|of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know|why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier|conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic,|he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places|it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Fϋhrer|has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today|is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats|human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross|your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities|to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting|of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty|easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.|
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease|to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest|of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state,|are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath|your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas|where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening,|they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now,|and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
(SNIFFLES)
Yes.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Monsieur LaPadite... je vous remercie pour le lait
et votre hospitalité.
Je crois que notre travail ici est terminé.
Mesdames,
je vous remercie pour le temps|que vous m'avez consacré, je ne vais pas plus déranger votre famille.
Donc, monsieur mesdames LaPadite, je prends congé de vous et je vous dis ...adieu.
(SHUSHING)
It's the girl.
(SOBBING)
(EXCLAIMS)
(PANTING)
Au revoir, Shosanna!
Chapter Two
INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
ALDO:
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team,|and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors|about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France|dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing|and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down|from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5,000 miles of water,|fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane|to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating,|mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch|we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent|of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got a little Indian in me.
And our battle plan|will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty,|they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence|of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers|we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able|to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers|endured at our hands, and our boot heels|and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German|closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious|for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us|that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
-ALL:
Yes, sir!
|
-Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning|for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command,|you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command|owes me 1 00 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 1 00 Nazi scalps|taken from the heads of 1 00 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!
(SHOUTING IN GERMAN)
Nein, nein, nein, nein, nein, nein!
Was alles soil ich von diesen|
Judenschweinen noch ertragen?
Schlachten meine Männer ab wie Fliegen.
Kennen Sie schon|das neuste Gerücht, das sie in ihrem angstgetriebenen Wahn verbreiten?
Der, der meine Männer|mit einem Prügel totschlägt, der, den man "Bärenjude" nennt, soll ein Golem sein.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Das ist doch Soldatentratsch.
Kein Mensch glaubt wirklich,|dass der "Bärenjude" ein Golem ist.
Und wenn doch?
Die schlüpfen uns doch|ständig durch die Finger wie Gespenster, die nach Belieben erscheinen|und verschwinden können!
Sie wollen beweisen,|dass sie aus Fleisch und Blut sind?
Dann bringen Sie sie mir!
Ich werde sie nackt an ihren Füßen|am Eiffelturm aufhängen!
Und ihre Leichen|in die Kanalisation werfen lassen,
.dass die Ratten von Paris|sich an ihnen mästen!
(INTERCOM BUZZING)
Kliest!
(KLIEST SPEAKING GERMAN|
ON INTERCOM)
Yes, my Fϋhrer!
Befehl an alle in Frankreich|stationierten deutschen Soldaten!
Der jüdisch Entartete,|bekannt als Bärenjude, ist von jetzt an nie mehr|als Bärenjude zu bezeichnen.
Yes, my Fϋhrer!
Wünschen Sie noch|den Gefreiten Butz zu sehen?
Wer oder was ist ein Gefreiter Butz?
Der Soldat,|den Sie persönlich treffen wollten.
Sein Trupp ist in einen Hinterhalt|der Juden von Leutnant Raine geraten.
Er hat als Einziger überlebt.
Selbstverständlich will ich ihn sehen!
|
Danke, dass Sie mich erinnern.
Schicken Sie ihn rein.
(BUTZ speaking GERMAN)
Feldwebel Rachtmann, Ludwig und ich waren die einzigen|
Überlebenden des Angriffs.
Ein Mann hat uns bewacht,|die anderen entfernten die Haare.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
Hey, Hirschberg.
Send that Kraut sarge over.
HIRSCHBERG:
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
-Yes.|
-Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got|a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out|of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted,|come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there|you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army|has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
MALE NARRATOR:
The reason|for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enIisted man,|he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command|decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say,|once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
(GASPING)
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.|
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say|we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis,
(MAN GROANING)
I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye|for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer|is still amateur.
We all come here to see|if you want to go pro.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
(BASTERDS WHOOPING)
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't|in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business,|and, cousin, business is a-booming.
HIRSCHBERG:|(LAUGHING) Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways|we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going|to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut|patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be|a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat|a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on|this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are,|and you got to tell me what kind of artillery|they're carrying with them.
(SCOFFING)
You can't expect me to divulge information|that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're|wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about|
Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.|
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map|where this party is being held, how many is coming|and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
(BAT TAPPING)
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard ofAldo the Apache,|you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
-I heard of The Bear Jew.|
-What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in|with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you|one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse,|
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to|beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your|
Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map|what I want to know.
Fuck you.

(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
(BASTERDS APPLAUDING)
Actually, Werner,|we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny|beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get|to going to the movies.
Donny!
DONNY:
Yeah?
Got us a German here|who wants to die for country.
Oblige him.
(BAT TAPPING)

Did you get that for killing Jews?

Oh, no!
Donny!
BASTERD:
Yeah, Donny!
About now I'd be shitting|my pants if I was you.

Teddy Fucking Williams|knocks it out of the park!
Fenway Park is on its feet|for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!
He went yard on that one,|on to fucking Lansdowne Street!
You!
Damn it, Hirschberg!

Alive!
Get the fuck up!

I hit you, you hit the ground.

Ask him if he wants to live.
(BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN)
Tell him to point out on this map|the German position.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
Ask him how many Germans.
Ungefähr zwölf.
Around about 1 2.
What kind of artillery?
Welche Art Waffen?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Wie haben Sie diese Tortur denn überlebt?
Sie haben mich gehen lassen.
Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us|what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know|why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could|spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen|to every Nazi we find.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Sie werden kein Wort darüber verlieren!
|
Kein einziges Detail!
Ihre Einheit geriet in einen Hinterhalt,|
Sie konnten fliehen.
Kein weiteres Wort!
Ja, mein Führer.
Hat man Sie ebenso gebrandmarkt|wie die anderen Überlebenden?
Ja, mein Führer.
Now that you've survived the war,|when you get home, what you going to do?
Was machst du, wenn du wieder nach Hause kommst?
Ich werde meine Mutter umarmen wie nie zuvor in meinem Leben.
WICKI:
He's going to hug his mother.
(SNIFFS)
Well, ain't that nice?
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
Frag, ob er seine Uniform auszieht.
(BUTZ SPEAKING GERMAN)
Ich werde sie nicht nur ausziehen, ich werde sie verbrennen.
WICKI:
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.|
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.|
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
Wir mögen unsere Nazis nämlich in Uniform.
So erkennt man sie.Blitzschnell.
But you take off that uniform,|ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
Aber wenn du sie ablegst, erkennt dich keiner mehr als Nazi.
Und das passt uns nicht.
So I'm going to give you|a little something you can't take off.
You know, Lieutenant,|you're getting pretty good at that.
You know how you|get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?
Practice.

GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS 1 944
JUNE
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a à partir de demain ?
- Un festival Max Linder.
(EXCLAIMS)
J'ai toujours préféré Linder à Chaplin.
Si ce n'est que Linder n'a jamais fait|un film aussi bon que "Le Kid".
Le grand moment de la poursuite du "Kid"...|
Superbe.
J'adore votre cinéma.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Merci.
- Il est à vous ?
- S'il m'appartient ?
-Oui.
Oui.
Comment se fait-il qu'une jeune fille|comme vous possède un cinéma ?
Ma tante me I'a cédé.
Merci d'organiser une soirée allemande.
- J'ai pas vraiment le choix.
De rien.
J'adore les films de montagne de Leni Riefenstahl surtout "Piz Palu".
C'est agréable de voir une jeune française admiratrice de Riefenstahl.
"Admiratrice" n'est pas vraiment le mot|que j'utiliserais pour décrire mes sentiments vis-à-vis de Fraulein Riefenstahl.
Mais vous admirez le réalisateur Pabst ?
C'est pour ça que vous avez mis son nom sur le fronton.
Alors que vous n'étiez pas obligée.
Je suis française.
Nous respectons|
les réalisateurs, dans notre pays.
Y compris les allemands.

Merci.
Je vous en prie.
J'aimerais que vous cessiez de m'ennuyer.
Je vous présente mes excuses, mademoiselle, je ne voulais pas vous ennuyer.
J'essayais simplement d'être amical.
Je ne souhaite pas être votre amie.
Pourquoi ?
Ne faites pas l'enfant, vous savez pourquoi.
Je suis plus que juste un uniforme.

Je me suis retrouvé dans le clocher d'une ville fortifiée.
Moi tout seul et un millier de munitions,|dans un perchoir, face à 300 soldats ennemis.
Qu'est-ce que vous appelez un perchoir ?
Un perchoir c'est comme ça qu'un|tireur embusqué appellerait un clocher.
Une structure haute|offrant une vue à 360°.
Très avantageux pour un tireur d'élite.
Combien vous en avez tué ?
68.
Le premier jour.

Et le quatrième jour|ils ont quitté la ville.
(CHUCKLES)
Naturellement mon histoire de guerre...|.a attiré beaucoup d'attention en Allemagne, c'est pour ça que tous me reconnaissent,
Ils m'appellent le "sergent York" allemand.
Ils feront peut-être un film sur vos exploits.
(LAUGHS)
Eh bien, c'est exactement|ce que Joseph Goebbels a pensé.
Il s'intitule "La fierté de la Nation".
Et je vous le donne en mille, ils ont voulu que j'interprète mon propre rôle, et je l'ai fai
Joseph pense que|ce film sera son chef-d'oeuvre.
et que je serai le vengeur de ses allemands.
"La fierté de la Nation"" c'est vous ?
Vous êtes la vedette de "La fierté de la Nation" ?
Je sais, comique.
Bonne chance pour la première, soldat.|
J'espère que tout ira bien|pour Joseph et vous-même.

Bonjour.
(PANTING)
(BRAYING)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Hello.
Et vous avez rencontré le major.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Ja, aber ich habe mich|noch gar nicht vorgestellt.|
Sturmbannführer Dieter Hellstrom,|
GESTAPO.
Zu lhren Diensten, Mademoiselle.
Darf ich?
Bitte nehmen Sie Platz.
Probieren Sie den Champagner,|
Mademoiselle.
Der ist wirklich ganz gut.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Aber eigentlich müsste ich|böse mit lhnen sein, Fräulein.
Je dois vous dire, mademoiselle, que vous|avez fait une grande impression à notre fils.
Ich reise in Frankreich an und möchte|mit meinem Star zu Mittag essen,
Je suis arrivé en France|et je voulais déjeuner avec ma vedette ... aber nichts da.
Er ist zum gesellschaftlichen Ereignis|von Paris geworden und jetzt muss er Zeit für mich einräumen.
Je ne savais pas qu'il était devenu la coqueluche de Paris|maintenant il doit faire un effort|pour trouver du temps pour moi.
Andere Leute warten Stunden oder tagelang,|um mich zu sehen.
Les gens font la queue pendant des heures,|pendant des jours pour me voir.
Ich warte auf den Führer
Moi, j'attends le Führer und den Schützen Zoller.
et le soldat Zoller.
Endlich nun gewährt mir|der junge Herr Schütze eine Audienz j'obtiens finalement une audience avec le jeune soldat,
und spricht dann während des gesamten|
Essens nur von lhnen und ihrem Kino.
et il passe tout le repas à ne parler que de vous et de votre cinéma.
Also, Fräulein Mimieux,|kommen wir zum Geschäft.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
--Herr Minister Doctor Goebbels... ich hab sie noch nicht eingeweiht.
Wenn das Mädel nicht allzu blöde ist,|dann hat sie's doch längst begriffen.
Schließlich ist sie eine Kinobetreiberin.
Francesca, bitte.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Ce qu'il essaie de vous dire,|
Emmanuelle, c'est que le soldat Zoller a passé I'heure du déjeuner à essayer|de convaincre monsieur Goebbels d'abandonner ses projets pour l'avant-première de son film, et de changer d'endroit afin|qu'elle ait lieu dans votre cinéma.
(COUGHS)
Quoi ?
Je voulais lui annoncer.
Je voulais lui annoncer.
Scheiße.
Natürlich.
Verzeihen Sie, Soldat.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Worum geht es denn?
Der Schütze wollte Mademoiselle|selbst einweihen.
Unsinn!
Bevor ich meine Fragen gestellt habe,|hat er gar nichts einzuweihen.
Bitte nehmen Sie zur Kenntnis,ich habe einem Wechsel|des Veranstaltungsortes nicht zugestimmt.
Ist notiert.
Sie haben Logen?
Vous avez des loges ?
Oui.
Wie viele?
- Combien ?
Deux.
Zwei.
Mehr wäre besser.
Davantage ce serait mieux.
Wie viele Plätze hat der Zuschauerraum?
Combien de places dans la salle ?
Three hundred and fifty.
(TRANSLATING IN GERMAN)
(SCOFFS)
Das sind fast 400 weniger als im Ritz.
Aber gestatten Sie, Dr. Goebbels, das ist doch gar nicht so schlimm.
Sie haben selbst gesagt, Sie wollen nicht,dass jeder|scheinheilige Franzosen-Bourgeois sich breitmachen kann.
Mit weniger Plätzen|wird der Abend viel exklusiver.
Sie werden sich gar nicht|drum kümmern müssen, den Saal zu füllen.|
Man wird sich um die Plätze reißen.
Außerdem, zum Teufel mit den Franzosen.
Das ist ein deutscher Abend.
Eine deutsche|
Veranstaltung, ein deutsches Fest.
Dieser Abend ist für Sie gedacht.
Für mich.
Für das deutsche Militär, den Führungsstab, ihre Familien und Freunde.
Man sollte nur diejenigen reinlassen, die sich vom Geschehen auf der Leinwand|auch wirklich bewegen lassen.
Wie ich sehe, hat sich|
Ihr öffentliches Reden verbessert.
Mir scheint,|ich habe ein Monstrum geschaffen.
(CHUCKLES)
(LAUGHING)
Ein überaus überzeugendes Monstrum.
Wenn der Krieg vorbei ist,|da wartet die Politik.
Und trotzdem, Schütze..
Selbst wenn ich geneigt bin,|
lhnen jeden Wunsch zu erfüllen, muss ich mir doch zunächst mal|im Kino der jungen Frau einen Film ansehen,|bevor ich "ja" oder "nein" sagen kann.
Also gut, Fräulein,Sie werden ihr Kino heute Abend|für eine Privatvorführung schließen.
Jeune demoiselle, vous allez fermer votre cinéma ce soir, et organiser une projection privée pour moi.
Welche deutschen Filme|haben Sie denn da?
Quels films allemands avez-vous ?
Ah, Landa!
Da sind Sie ja!
(FREDRICK SPEAKING FRENCH)
Emmanuelle, voici le|colonel S.S. Landa qui sera chargé de la sécurité pour la première.

Oh.

Französische Sklaventreiberin!
(LAUGHING)
(HANS SPEAKING GERMAN)
Wie auch immer,|ich fürchte, als Sicherheitschef dieses freudigen|deutschen Ereignisses muss ich ein paar Worte mit|
Mademoiselle Mimieux wechseln.
(FREDRICK SPEAKING GERMAN)
Was für Worte?
(HANS SPEAKING GERMAN)
Das klang ja verdächtig|nach einem Schützen,der den Befehl|eines Standartenführers in Frage stellt.
Oder bin ich da jetzt nur sensibel?
(FREDRICK SPEAKING GERMAN)
Nichts läge mir ferner, Herr Standartenführer.
Ihre Autorität steht außer Frage.
Aber lhnen elit ein Ruf voraus.
Müssen Mademoiselle Mimieux|oder ich uns Sorgen machen?
(GOEBBELS SPEAKING GERMAN)
Hans, der Junge meint's nicht böse.
Er hat sich vergafft in die Kleine.
Und er hat recht:
Ihr Ruf elit lhnen voraus.
(HANS SPEAKING GERMAN)
Keine Sorge, ihr zwei.|
Als Sicherheitschef muss ich einfach mit der
Besitzerin des möglichen neuen|
Veranstaltungsortes a bissel plaudern.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
- Avez-goûté le strudel ici ?
- Non.
Il n'est pas si mauvais.
(CHUCKLES)
Alors, comment se fait-il que le jeune soldat|et vous avez fait connaissance ?
Deux strudels, un pour moi|et un pour la demoiselle.
Pour moi un café serré,|et pour la demoiselle un verre de lait.
un verre de lait.
Donc, Mademoiselle,|vous commenciez à expliquer..
Il y a encore 2 jours,|j'ignorais I'existence du soldat Zoller et... de ses exploits.
Pour moi le soldat n'était qu'un client de mon cinéma...|
Nous avons discuté quelques fois, mais...
Mademoiselle, permettez-moi de vous interrompre,
Ceci est une simple formalité, aucune raison de vous inquiéter.
Veuillez m'excuser, j'ai oublié|de commander la crème.
Un instant.
Attendez la crème.
Alors, Emmanuelle...|
Puis-je vous appeler Emmanuelle?
Oui.
Et donc, Emmanuelle expliquez-moi,comment se fait-il... qu'une jeune fille comme vous|en arrive à posséder un cinéma ?
Après vous.
Verdict ?
Comme je disais,|pas si mauvais.
Vous commenciez à expliquer I'origine|de votre possession du cinéma.
A I'origine, le cinéma appartenait|à ma tante et à mon oncle.
- Comment s'appelaient-ils ?
- Jean-Pierre et Ada Mimieux.
Où sont-ils à présent ?
Mon oncle a été tué pendant la Blitzkrieg.
oh, navré...
Continuez.
Tante Ada est morte de fièvre|au printemps dernier.
Regrettable.
Il m'a été signalé que vous employiez un nègre, est-ce vrai ?
Oui, c'est un français.
Il s'appelle Marcel.
Il travaillait avec mon oncle et ma tante|depuis l'ouverture du cinéma.
C'est la seule personne qui travaille avec moi.
- Pour faire quoi ?
- Projectionniste.
- Il est valable ?
- C'est le meilleur.
En fait,on peut voir en quoi|ce peut être un bon métier pour eux.
- Savez-vous faire marcher un projecteur ?
|
- Bien sûr.
- Bien sûr.
Connaissant le ministre du Reich comme je le connais, je suis en mesure d'affirmer je suis en mesure d'affirmer qu'il ne voudrait pas|que la réussite ou l'échec de son illustre soirée... dépende de la prouesse d'un nègre.
Donci s'il est admis que l'évènement se tiendra effectivement dans votre établissement
talentueux sans doute|comme votre nègre peut I'être, c'est vous qui
actionnerez le projecteur.
- Est-ce acceptable ?
Oui.
Cigarette?
Elles ne sont pas françaises.
elles sont allemandes.
Il y avait une autre chose|que je voulais vous demander,
mais maintenant, sur ma vie,|impossible de m'en souvenir.
Enfin, bon, ça ne devait pas être important.
A ce soir.
(GASPING)
(GOEBBELS SPEAKING GERMAN)
Ich muss sagen, mir gefällt die Bescheidenheit dieses Ladens.
Ihr Kino respektiert die Filmkunst fast wie eine Kirche.
Was nicht heißt, dass wir den Laden nicht ein bisschen aufmöbeln sollten.
Vielleicht wie im Louvre.
Wir suchen uns ein paar nackte Griechen aus, und dann verteilen wir sie über das Foyer.
(LAUGHS)
So, Emmanuelle, wie hat lhnen "Glückskinder" gefallen?
Emmanuelle, vous avez aimé "Glückskinder"
J'ai plutôt aimé Lillian Harvey.
J'ai plutôt aimé Lillian Harvey.
(GOEBBELS SPEAKING GERMAN)
Lilian Harvey!
Verwenden Sie den Namen nie in meiner Gegenwart!
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Hey Putain, on est censé faire quoi, là ?
Apparemment, on est censé|accueillir une première nazie.
Comme je viens de dire,|putain, on est censé faire quoi ?
Eh ben, il faut que je parle de ça avec toi.
Je te suis pas.|
De quoi parlons-nous ?
De remplir le cinéma de nazis|et de le détruire par le feu.
Moi je ne parle pas de ça, c'est toi qui parle de ça.
Non, nous parlons de ça, là maintenant.
Si on est capables à nous deux d'empêcher|que cet endroit soit détruit par le feu, on est capables à nous deux|de le détruire par le feu.
Oui, Shoshanna, nous pourrions.
et avec la collection de 350 filmes|nitrate de madame Mimieux, on n'aurait même pas besoin d'explosifs, si?
...would we?
(SCOFFS)
Tu veux dire on n'aurait pas|besoin d'explosifs en plus.
MALE NARRATOR:
At that time,|35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable that you couldn't even|bring a reel onto a streetcar.
Hey, you can't bring those here|on a public vehicle.
-They're films, ain't they?
|
-Yes.
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.
MALE NARRATOR:
Because nitrate film|burns three times faster than paper.
Shosanna has a collection of over 350 nitrate film prints.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Je vais détruire par le feu le cinéma|à la soirée nazie.
et si je fais ça, et je vais le faire,
on sait très bien tous les deux que|tu me laisseras pas le faire toute seule.
Parce que tu m'aimes et que je t'aime et que t'es la seule personne|au monde en qui j'ai confiance.
Mais on va pas se contenter de ça.
Est-ce que le matériel de tournage|du grenier fonctionne encore ?
Je sais que la caméra est en état, mais...|
le magnétophone ?
J'ai enregistré un nouveau guitaristeIl fonctionne plutôt bien
, en|
J'ai enregistré un nouveau guitariste
Impeccable.
Pourquoi avons-nous|besoin de matériel de tournage ?
Parce que, Marcel, mon cher nous allons|faire un film.
Uniquement pour les nazis.
Chapter Four
OPERATION KINO
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
MAN:
Right this way, Lieutenant.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water,|
I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.|
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
-And your occupation before the war?
|
-I'm a film critic.
-List your accomplishments.|
-Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for|a publication called films and filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.|
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:|
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called|
Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a sub textual film criticism study|of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
-What should we drink to, sir?
|
-Well...
-Down with Hitler.|
-All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema|under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any|of the films made in the last three years,
-but I'm familiar with it.|
-Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires|a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.|
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era|in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema|of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma|of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews|at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer,
-how's he doing?
|
-Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen|in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be|
Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself|closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time|
I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala|premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
-What film, sir?
|
-The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance|at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Göring, Bormann,|and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers|of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries|of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs|in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear,|gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit|that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy,|you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because|these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France,|about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village|called Nadine.
In Nadine,|there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with|our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you|into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born|members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements|you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect|that won't be too much trouble for you.
-Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.|
-Bridget von Hammersmark?
(CHUCKLING) The German movie star|is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino|was her brainchild.
-Indeed.|
-Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
The village of|
Nadine
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous|is in a fucking basement.
-I didn't know.|
-You said it was in a tavern.
-It is a tavern.|
-Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement|offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being,|you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there|and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.|
She'll make the rendezvous.
-Stiglitz, right?
|
-That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking|for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.|
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong,|things prove eventful,
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
(LAUGHS)
Well, now that you put it like that,|
I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz,|not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man you need?
|
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there,|what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen,|we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter,|escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover|is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose|idea was it for the death-trap rendezvous?
-She chose the spot.|
-Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.|
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to|know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated|and without Germans.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Also, ich bin männlich, ich bin eine literarische Figur, ich bin aus Amerika,|aber darüber lässt sich streiten.
Ja, ja.
Ja, da lässt sich|überhaupt nicht drüber streiten.

Die Figur ist die Figur.
Hamlet ist kein Brite, er war Däne.

Eric, mon chéri, das sind die Freunde,|auf die ich gewartet habe.
Bitte gib ihnen alles, was sie möchten.

Frau von Hammersmark,|
Ihr Wunsch ist mir Befehl.
Meine Herren, wie es aussieht,|geht die Runde auf das Fräulein.
-Was hätten Sie denn gern?

-Whisky.
Zwei Whisky.
-Drei Whisky.|
-Drei Whisky, gern.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
-Ich wünsche Ihnen noch|einen wunderschönen guten Abend.
-lhnen auch.|-lch bedanke mich.
Hey, ihre Karte, ihre Karte!
Ja.
Stimmt.
Wollen wir mal sehen...
Dschingis Khan?
Das hätt ich nie erraten!
Aber natürlich doch.
Mein Liebling.
Wie geht es dir?
Wie schön, dich zu sehen.
(PEOPLE LAUGHING)
(SPEAKING GERMAN SOFTLY)
Ich dachte, hier kommen|mehr Franzosen als Deutsche hin.
Ja.
Normalerweise ist das auch so.
Aber die Frau des Oberfeldwebels da drüben|hat gerade ein Kind bekommen.
Und sein vorgesetzter Offizier hat ihm und|seinen Freunden den Abend freigegeben,damit sie feiern können.
Wir sollten gehen.
Nein.
Wir sollten bleiben.
Zumindest für ein Getränk.
Ich habe in einer Bar auf euch gewartet,
(CORK POPPING) da würde es doch seltsam aussehen,|wenn wir gehen würden,ohne etwas getrunken zu haben.
Sie hat recht.|
Bleibt ganz ruhig und genießt euren Whisky.
Mmm.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Mathilda... (SPEAKING GERMAN)
Komm, spiel mit uns.|
Nimm Frau von Hammersmarks Platz.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Sie spielt liebend gern mit lhnen!
(ALL CHEERING)
Ich werde übersetzen und beschützen.
Keine Sorge, meine Hübsche.
Wenn einer von diesen Wölfen hier|aus der Reihe tanzt,
Schau.
Beiß ihm die Nase ab!
Beiß ihm die Nase ab!
Schluss jetzt!
Schnaps!
Schnaps!

Den Schnaps in die Hand, Kameraden!
Bevor wir weiterspielen, trinken wir.
Wir trinken auf unseren Freund Wilhelm.
Und seinen kleinen Sohn
Maximilian.
(ALL TOASTING IN GERMAN)
-Auf Max!

Es hat sich was Neues ergeben.
Das Kino ist ausgetauscht worden.
Warum?
Das weiß niemand.|
Sollte aber kein wirkliches Problem sein.
Das neue Kino ist|wesentlich kleiner als das Ritz.
Welchen Sprengstoff ihr also|für das Ritz mitgebracht habt, müsste dort doppelte Wirkung haben.
Die andere Neuigkeit ist kolossal.
Also lasst euch nichts anmerken.
Der Führer wird dazu... (STAMMERING)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Ob Sie wohl gerade vielleicht...
Würden, würden Sie meinem Sohn|zum Geburtstag ein Autogramm geben?
Aber natürlich.
Gerne, Wilhelm.
Dieser fesche Oberfeldwebel|ist heute glücklicher Vater geworden.
Glückwunsch!
Gratuliere!
(LAUGHING)
Danke.
Kennen Sie den Namen|des Sprösslings denn schon?
Jawohl, Fräulein.
Sein Name ist Maximilian.
Maximilian!
Das ist aber 'n schöner Name.
Danke, Obersturmführer.
Für den kleinen Maximilian nur das Beste.
(THANKING IN GERMAN)
Max weiß zwar noch nicht, wer Sie sind, aber er wird es wissen.|
Ich werde ihm alle lhre Filme zeigen.
Gut.
Er wird mit lhren Filmen aufwachsen und mit dieser Serviette über seinem Bett!
Ich erhebe mein Glas|auf die größte Schauspielerin Deutschlands!
Es gibt keine Dietrich,|es gibt keine Riefenstahl!
|
Es gibt nur eine von Hammersmark!
-Prost!
|
-Prost!
Prost!
Fräulein von Hammersmark!
Prost!
So, jetzt nochmal.
(EXHALING)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Von Hammersmark,|was führt Sie nach Frankreich?
Das geht Sie nichts an,
Oberfeldwebel!
Sie haben vielleicht nicht die|
Gastfreundschaft des Fräuleins mit lhrem betrunkenen, rüpelhaften|
Benehmen strapaziert, aber sehr wohl die meine!
Darf ich Sie erinnern, Oberfeldwebel,|
Sie sind Soldat!
Das ist ein Offizierstisch!
Ich schlage vor, dass Sie das Fräulein|nicht weiter belästigen.
Und an lhren Tisch zurückkehren!
Entschuldigen Sie, Herr Hauptsturmführer.|
Sie haben einen sehr|ungewöhnlichen Akzent.
Woher kommen Sie?
Sie müssen entweder betrunken sein|oder völlig verrückt, dass Sie es wagen, mit einem Vorgesetzten|so unverschämt zu sprechen,
Oberfeldwebel!
Ich mache Sie und Sie verantwortlich!
Sie greifen jetzt Ihren Freund oder er wird Max' ersten Geburtstag|wegen Trunkenheit in der Öffentlichkeit|im Gefängnis verbringen!
Dürfte ich mich vielleicht erkundigen?
Dürfte ich mich vielleicht erkundigen?
(PHONOGRAPH CRACKLING)
Wie unser frischgebackener Vater hier.
habe auch ich ein sehr genaues Ohr|für Akzente.
Und wie er finde ich lhren äußerst seltsam.
Woher stammen Sie, Hauptsturmführer?
Sturmbannführer, ich finde es|höchst unpassend, dass...
Ich habe nicht mit lhnen gesprochen,|
Obersturmführer München!
Und auch nicht mit lhnen,|
Oberstürmführer Frankfurt.
Ich spreche mit dem|"Hauptsturmführer Heimatlos" hier.
Ich bin in einem Dorf geboren,|das im Schatten des Piz Palü liegt.
-Dem Berg?
|
-Ja.
In dem Dorf sprechen alle so.
Haben Sie den Riefenstahl-Film gesehen?
-Ja.|
-Dann haben Sie mich gesehen.
Erinnern Sie sich|an die Ski-Szene mit der Fackel?
Ja.
In dieser Szene spielen ich, mein Vater,|meine Schwester und meine zwei Brüder.
Mein Bruder sieht so gut aus, dass der Regisseur Pabst|eine Großaufnahme von ihm gedreht hat.
Herr Major, wenn mein Wort etwas gilt, ich kann mich voll|und ganz dafür verbürgen,|was der junge Hauptmann hier behauptet.
Er stammt wirklich vom Fuße des Piz Palü.
Er war in dem Film und sein Bruder|sieht wesentlich besser aus als er.
(LAUGHING)
(ALL LAUGHING)
Sie sollten mal besser|zu lhren Freunden zurückkehren.
Meine Herrschaften,|darf ich mich zu lhnen setzen?
Gerne.
Wunderbar!
Das ist der Grund für Ihren|bizarren Akzent, ja?
Das ist ungewöhnlich.
Was tun Sie hier?
Außer mit diesem reizenden Fräulein|ein Getränk zu nehmen?
Nun, dieses Vergnügens|bedarf es keiner weiteren Erklärung.
Nein.
Ich mein, hier in diesem Land?
Ja, Sie sind ja wohl kaum in Frankreich|stationiert: sonst wüsste ich, wer Sie sind.
Oh, Sie kennen|jeden Deutschen in Frankreich?
Jeden, der es wert ist.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Tja, das ist vielleicht das Problem.
Wir haben diesen Wert nie beansprucht.
Spaß beiseite.
Was tun Sie in Frankreich?
Ich begleite die Dame|zu Minister Goebbels' Filmpremiere.
Ach.
Sie sind der Begleiter|von Fräulein von Hammersmark?
Irgendjemand muss ja ihr Feuerzeug tragen.
(CHUCKLING)
(LAUGHING)
Der Hauptmann ist mein Begleiter.|
Aber alle drei sind meine Gäste.
Wir sind alte Freunde.
Wir kennen uns schon
(SIGHS) seit Jahren!
Eigentlich viel länger,|als eine Schauspielerin zugeben möchte.
Nun, gut.
In diesem Fall
Iassen Sie mich mein Glas erheben|auf die drei glücklichsten Männer im Raum!
Darauf trinke ich!
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Königin Christina?
(HUMMING EXOTIC MELODY)
Mata Hari!
Ich muss schon sagen, was die da drüben spielen,|das scheint mir sehr amüsant zu sein.
Ich wollte mich nicht dazusetzen,|denn Sie haben recht, Hauptsturmführer:.
Ein Offizier sollte sich|nicht mit einfachen Soldaten verbrüdern.
Aber, äh, da wir ja hier alle Offiziere sind
oder kultivierte Bekannte von Offizieren, wie wär's, wir spielen das auch?
Ja.
Gerne!
Ein Spiel!
Wunderbar.
Soldaten, die Karten.
Danke.
Also, Herrschaften:
Die Idee des Spiels ist es, den Namen einer berühmten Person|auf eine Karte zu schreiben.
Fiktiv oder real spielt dabei keine Rolle.
Sie können zum Beispiel "Konfuzius"|schreiben oder "Dr. Fu Manchu".
Eric?
Mehr Stifte!
Nur berühmt muss sie sein,|nicht Tante Frieda.
Wenn Sie fertig sind,|
legen Sie die Karte verdeckt auf den Tisch und schieben Sie|der Person ihrer Rechten zu.
Die...
Danke.
Die Person lhrer Linken|schiebt lhnen Ihre Karte zu.
Sie nehmen die Karte auf,|ohne sie umzudrehen, befeuchten sie mit der Zunge, so,
und kleben sie sich vorne an die Stirn.

Ich fange an, damit Sie sich|einen Begriff machen können.
Bin ich Deutscher?
--Nein.|
-Nein.
Bin ich Amerikaner?
-Nein.|
-Nein.
Na ja, der geht nach...
Ich bitte dich!
Er ist doch eindeutig|nicht in Amerika geboren worden.
Aber ich habe Amerika besucht, richtig?
-Ja.|
-Ja.
War dieser Besuch erfreulich?
Nicht für Sie.
Könnte man mein Geburtsland|als exotisch beschreiben?
(VON HAMMERSMARK AND HICOX|
SPEAKING GERMAN)
--Ja.|
-Ja.
Das könnte ein Hinweis sein|auf den Urwald oder auf den Orient.
Ich folge meinem ersten lmpuls und frage:|
Komm ich aus dem Urwald?
-Yes.|
-Yes.
Also, Herrschaften, an dieser Stelle könnte|man fragen, ob mal real oder erfunden ist.
Ich finde diese Frage aber|zu einfach und frage noch nicht danach.
Okay ich bin also im Urwald geboren,
ich habe Amerika besucht.
Der Besuch war für mich nicht von Vorteil, aber die Schlussfolgerung liegt nahe,|dass es für jemand anderen von Vorteil war.
Als ich aus dem Urwald nach Amerika kam,
fuhr ich da mit dem Schiff?
-Ja.|
-Ja.
Geschah die Reise gegen meinen Willen?
-Ja.|
-Ja.
Auf der Schiffsreise, lag ich da in Ketten?
Yes.
Als ich in Amerika ankam, wurde ich da|in Ketten zur Schau gestellt?
-Yes.|
-Yes.
Bin ich die Geschichte|des Negers in Amerika?
(HICOX SPEAKING GERMAN)
Nein.
Also, dann muss ich King Kong sein.
(LAUGHING)
Bravo!
Wirklich beeindruckend!
Und weil ich die richtige Antwort gefunden|habe, müssen Sie jetzt alle austrinken.
Prost!
Also, wer ist der Nächste?
Sturmbannführer.
Ich möchte nicht unhöflich sein,|aber wir vier sind sehr gute Freunde.
Und wir haben uns lange nicht gesehen.
Also, Sturmbannführer, ich fürchte,
Sie stören.
Ich bitte um Nachsicht, Hauptsturmführer.
Aber nur, wenn das Fräulein hier|meine Gegenwart als störend empfindet, bin ich auch ein Störenfried.
Wie ist es, Fräulein von Hammersmark?
|
Störe ich Sie?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Das hab ich mir nämlich gedacht.
Der Hauptsturmführer scheint einfach nur|immun gegen meinen Charme zu sein.
(LAUGHING)
Das war 'n Scherz.
Ein Scherz!
|
Nein, natürlich stör ich.
Natürlich stör ich.
Meine Herrschaften, gestatten Sie,|dass ich lhnen nachschenke?
|
Und dann werd ich lhnen|und dem Fräulein "adieu" sagen.
Eric hat eine Flasche 33 Jahre alten Whisky aus dem schottischen Hochland.
Was sagen Sie, meine Herrschaften?
Das ist sehr freundlich, Sturmbannführer.
Eric!
Der 33er!
Und frische Gläser!
Wir wollen ja nicht, dass Sie den 33er|hier mit lhrem Gesöff da verseuchen.
Wie viele Gläser?
-Fünf.|
-Für mich nicht.

Weil Sie sich eben|verraten haben, Hauptsturmführer.
Sie sind so deutsch wie dieser Scotch.

-Herr Major...|
-Schnauze, du Schlampe!
Sie wollten was sagen?
Ich wollte sagen, dann sind wir zu zweit.
Ich hab eine Pistole|auf lhre Eier gerichtet, seit Sie hier sitzen.
Und ab jetzt sind wir zu dritt.
Und auf die Entfernung|bin ich ein richtiger Fredrick Zoller.
Scheint mir 'n bisschen heikel zu sein,|unsere Lage.
Was jetzt passieren wird, Sturmbannführer...
Sie werden aufstehen|und mit uns durch diese Tür hinausgehen.
Nein, nein, nein.
Nein, nein, nein, nein,|das glaub ich nicht.
Ich glaube, Sie und ich, wir beide wissen, Hauptsturmführer, dass, egal, was mit den anderen Leuten|hier in diesem Raum passiert, wir zwei nirgendwo hingehen.
Es ist wirklich schade um Oberfeldwebel|
Wilhelm und seine berühmten Freunde.
Falls einer von euch vorhat,|am Leben zu bleiben,|werdet ihr sie auch erschießen müssen.
Sieht so aus,|als ob Klein Max als Waise aufwächst.
Wie traurig.
Well, if this is it, old boy,
I hope you don't mind if I go out|speaking the King's.
By all means, Captain.
There's a special rung in hell reserved|for people who waste good Scotch.

I'm a father.

In Frankfurt.

His name is Max.|
We were in here drinking, celebrating.
They're the ones that came in shooting|and killing.
It's not my fault!

Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
-No.|
-I'm alive!

Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men|come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.|
It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up|playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?

I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can I?

What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.

Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?

I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.|
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me|for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.|
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.|
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff,|and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.

Before we yank that slug out you,|you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us|what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act|and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous|in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see|what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word|for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
(EXCLAIMING)
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination|get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.|
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
His commanding officer gave him|and his mates the night off to celebrate.
(GROANS)
The Germans being there was either|a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
(GRUNTING)
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
(VON HAMMERSMARK BREATHING DEEPLY)
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly|the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere|wearing military uniforms with all the military there|would've been suicide.
But going as members|of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos|and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor|to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them|in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going|as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German|better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique|up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
(DOGS BARKING)
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments|regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed|from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
|
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff|so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do|with the second development.
Which is?
DerFϋhrer is attending the premiere.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Ich habe meine Einstellung bezüglich ihrer Pariser Uraufführung|von "Stolz der Nation" überdacht.
Und während die letzten Wochen verstrichen und der Amerikaner|an der Küste gelandet ist,
musste ich wieder und immer wieder an den Schützen Zoller denken.
Der Junge hat Erstaunliches|für uns geleistet.
Und ich beginne zu glauben, dass meine Teilnahme an der Veranstaltung|von einiger Bedeutung sein könnte.
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack|at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me|to walk the red carpet?
(SNORTS)
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug|out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good|how-I-broke-my-leg-mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it?
|
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking, drinking|and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine|till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass|up that rouge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak|any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian.
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian.
So you mumble Italian|and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.|
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that,|
I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian,|so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most,|so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian.
Like I said, third best.|
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact,|why don't you start practicing right now?

ALDO:
Fucking shithead.|
Faggot fuck.
Fuck you!
Bunch of shithead fuck.
Fuck you, too!
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches!
|
Get your hands off me.
You fucking bratwurst-smelling...|
God damn you!
Get off!
Hmm.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Clever.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Ich hab den Führer informiert, dass das Publikum Platz genommen hat.
Er sollte jeden Moment eintreffen.
Danke, Hans.
ALDO:
You Jerry-banging,|
Limburg-smelling... (SPEAKING GERMAN)
Let go.
As Stanley said to Livingstone,|
Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?
Hans Landa.
(TRUCK ENGINE STARTING)
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.
My hands to be exact.
And they've been waiting a long time|to touch you.
Caught you flinching.
ALDO:
Touch me again,|
Kraut-burger.
ALDO:
Utivich?
|
UTIVICH:
Is that you, Lieutenant?
ALDO:
Yeah.
UTIVICH:
Do you know|what happened to Donny?
Omar?
-The woman?
|
-ALDO:
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo,|if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression|about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot."|
Yeah, I was just thinking that.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
You may leave us.
But stay alert outside.
So you're Aldo the Apache.
-So you're The Jew Hunter.|
-I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis|finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.|
But Jew Hunter?
(SNORTS)
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames|your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me|is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little|surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow,|but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say,|she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like|
Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos,|
Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your|swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level|of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts|of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting|in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24,|if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles,|still ready to explode.
And your mission,|some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.|
What's next?
EIiza on Ice?
However, all I have to do is pick up|this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive,|and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take|them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.|
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be|very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler,|you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Göring,|and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect|of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue|rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more|than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels|and killing Göring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war|single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing|before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't|have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours|has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
(EXCLAIMS)
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it? "That's a bingo."
You just say, "Bingo."
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
|
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable|two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator|named Hermann.
Get me someone|on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms|of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
Up there, if you engage in what the federal|government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying|to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor,|it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear|a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair,|
I would probably say the same thing, and 999.999 times out of a million,|you would be correct.
But in the pages of history,|every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?

HANS:
So when the military history|of this night is written, it will be recorded that I|was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise|as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS|as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement|of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box|that assured their demise.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Ich hab den Führer informiert, dass das Publikum Platz genommen hat.
Er sollte jeden Moment eintreffen.
Danke, Hans.
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension|and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive|the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance|in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members|of Operation Kino to receive the|
Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.|
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like|the United States ofAmerica to purchase property for me|on Nantucket Island as a reward for all|the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny|of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.|
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you|face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
GENERAL:
Colonel Landa will put you|and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will|get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa|and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.|
Is that clear, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
Over and out.

C'est qui ?

Merde !
Vous êtes la gérante de ce cinéma ?
Remboursez.
L'acteur de ce film ne vaut pas un clou.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ici ?
Je suis venu vous voir.
Vous voyez pas que je suis occupée ?
Alors, acceptez que je vous aide.
Ecoutez, Fredrick, c'est pas drôle.
Vous pouvez pas rester ici.
C'est votre première, vous devriez être en bas, avec eux.
En temps normal vous auriez raison... pour tous les autres films je le fais.
J'ai I'intention de supporter des soirées comme celle-ci dans l'esprit qui convient.
Mais cependant il n'en reste pas moins que ce film s'inspire de mes exploits militaires.
et en l'occurence, mes exploits consistent...
en fait j'ai tué beaucoup d'hommes.
Par conséquent, la partie du film projeté maintenant... je n'aime pas regarder cette partie.
Je suis désolée, Fredrick...

-Donc je me suis dit que j'allais monter et faire ce que je fais de mieux:
vous embêter.
et à voir la tête que vous faites, il semblerait que je n'ai pas perdu la main.
Vous vous êtes tellement habitué à ce que les nazis vous lèchent les bottes... que vous avez oublié ce que signifie le mot "non" ?
Non, vous ne pouvez pas rester ici !
Maintenant allez-vous-en !
Fredrick, Vous m'avez fait mal !
Ca fait plaisir de voir que vous pouvez ressentir quelque chose.
Même si c'est juste de la douleur physique.
Je ne suis pas un homme à qui on dit "allez-vous-en" !
Il y a plus de 300 cadavres en Italie... qui, s'ils le pouvaient, en témoigneraient.
Après tout ce que j'ai fait pour vous, vous me manquez de respect à vos risques et périls.
Fermez la porte.
Quoi ?
Fermez la porte à clé, on n'a pas beacoup de temps.
De temps pour quoi ?

I'm officially surrendering myself|over to you, Lieutenant Raine.
We're your prisoners.
How about my knife?
(CHUCKLES)
Thank you very much, Colonel.
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands|behind his back.
Is that really necessary?
I'm a slave to appearances.
(GUNSHOT)
Scalp Hermann.
Are you mad?
What have you done?
I made a deal with your general|for that man's life!
Yeah, they made that deal.
But they don't|give a fuck about him.
They need you.
You'll be shot for this!
Nah, I don't think so.
More like chewed out.|
I've been chewed out before.
You know, Utivich and myself heard|that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Utivich?
|
You make that deal?
-I'd make that deal.|
-I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest|you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue|the whole High Command,
I suppose that's worth|certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place|on Nantucket Island,
I imagine you are going to take off|that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform|for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point,|you're going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you|a little something you can't take off.
(HANS SCREAMING)
You know something, Utivich?
I think this just might be my masterpiece.
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
Yes.
This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
Only rumors.
I love rumors!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31.
Continue.
And the children,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
Amos was nine or 10.
And Shosanna?
And Shosanna was
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
That they call you "The Jew Hunter. "
Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
Yes.
It's the girl.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5, 000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got a little Indian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!
Hey, Hirschberg.
Send that Kraut sarge over.
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
Yes.
Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse,
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
Donny!
Yeah?
Got us a German here who wants to die for country.
Oblige him.
Did you get that for killing Jews?
Bravery.
Yeah!
Oh, no!
- Oh, no!
Donny!
Yeah, Donny!
About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you.
Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park!
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!
He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street!
You!
Damn it, Hirschberg!
Donny, bring that other one over here.
Alive!
Get the fuck up!
Batter up.
You're on deck!
Two hits.
I hit you, you hit the ground.
English?
Wicki.
Ask him if he wants to live.
Tell him to point out on this map the German position.
Ask him how many Germans.
Around about 12.
What kind of artillery?
Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
He's going to hug his mother.
Well, ain't that nice?
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that.
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?
Practice.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
At that time, 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar.
Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle.
They're films, ain't they?
- Yes.
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.
Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper.
Shosanna has a collection of over 350 nitrate film prints.
Right this way, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
And your occupation before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
What should we drink to, sir?
Well...
Down with Hitler.
All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer, how's he doing?
Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film, sir?
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
Bridget von Hammersmark?
The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
Indeed.
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was in a tavern.
It is a tavern.
Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
Stiglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.
Mmm.
Well, if this is it, old boy,
I hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's.
By all means, Captain.
There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch.
Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily,
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
Now, about this pickle we find ourselves in.
It would appear there's only one thing left for you to do.
And what would that be?
Stiglitz.
Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls.
You outside.
Who are you?
British?
American?
What?
We're American.
What are you?
I'm a German, you idiot.
Speak English pretty good for a German.
I agree.
So let's talk.
Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
His name is Max.
We were in here drinking, celebrating.
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
It's not my fault!
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
No.
I'm alive!
Who's that?
Is the girl on your side?
Which girl?
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.
Yeah, she's ours.
Is she okay?
Wilhelm!
She's been shot.
But she's alive.
Okay, Wilhelm.
What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can I?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-I-broke-my-leg- mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian.
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian.
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian.
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?
Yes.
Gorlomi?
Gorlomi.
Gorlomi.
Antonio Margheriti.
Margheriti.
Margheriti.
Dominick Decocco.
Dominick Decocco.
What's that American expression?
"If the shoe fits, you must wear it. "
Fucking shithead.
Faggot fuck.
Fuck you!
Bunch of shithead fuck.
Fuck you, too!
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches!
Get your hands off me.
You fucking bratwurst-smelling...
Goddamn you!
Get off!
Hmm.
You Jerry-banging, Limburg-smelling...
As Stanley said to Livingstone,
Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?
Hans Landa.
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.
My hands to be exact.
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you.
Caught you flinching.
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.
Utivich?
Is that you, Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?
The woman?
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot. "
- Yeah, I was just thinking that.
So you're Aldo the Apache.
So you're The Jew Hunter.
I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on Ice?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it?
"That's a bingo. "
You just say, "Bingo. "
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
Up there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999. 999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?
I implore you.
We must destroy that tower.
Sarge, that tower...
The tower stands!
Psst!
Psst!
So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.
Is that clear, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
Over and out.
When I kill that guy, you got 30 feet to get to that guard.
Can you do it?
I have to.
Champagne?
Who wants to send a message to Germany?
I have a message for Germany.
That you are all going to die.
And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who's going to do it!
Marcel, burn it down.
Oui, Shosanna.
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face
of Jewish vengeance.
Hermann, uncuff them.
I'm officially surrendering myself over to you, Lieutenant Raine.
We're your prisoners.
How about my knife?
Thank you very much, Colonel.
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back.
Is that really necessary?
I'm a slave to appearances.
Scalp Hermann.
Are you mad?
What have you done?
I made a deal with your general for that man's life!
Yeah, they made that deal.
But they don't give a fuck about him.
They need you.
You'll be shot for this!
Nah, I don't think so.
More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.
You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?
I'd make that deal.
I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command,
I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island,
I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know something, Utivich?
I think this just might be my masterpiece.
(distant rumbling)
(speaking FRENCH)
(speaking FRENCH)
(speaking FRENCH)
(speaking FRENCH)
(MEN speaking GERMAN)
(speaking FRENCH)
(speaking FRENCH)
While I'm very familiar with you and your family, I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
Yes.
This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
(CHUCKLES) Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
Only rumors.
I love rumors!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
(CLEARS THROAT)
Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
(MATCHSTlCKS scraping)
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
(AGREES in FRENCH)
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
(CLEARS THROAT)
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31 .
Continue.
And the children,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
(sighs)
Amos was nine or 10.
And Shosanna?
And Shosanna was
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
(zipper closing)
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
(sighs) I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
(THANKlNG in FRENCH)
That they call you "The Jew Hunter.' '
Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers, I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
(chuckling) More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
(AGREES in FRENCH)
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance, I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
is that clear?
(SNlFFLES)
Yes.
(speaking FRENCH)
(SHUSHlNG)
It's the girl.
(sobbing)
(exclaims)
(panting)
Au revoir, Shosanna!
(FOOTSTEPS approaching)
ALDO:
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5,000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got a little lndian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
ALL:
Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!

Hey, Hirschberg.
Send that Kraut sarge over.
HlRSCHBERG:
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
Yes.
Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
(BASTERDS laughing)
MALE NARRATOR/ The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
(gasping)
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis.. .
(MAN groaning) ...I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
(BASTERDS laughing)
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
(BASTERDS whooping)
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
HlRSCHBERG:
(laughing) Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
(SCOFFlNG)
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
(BAT tapping)
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse, I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
(BASTERDS laughing)
(BASTERDS APPLAUDlNG)
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
Donny!
DONNY:
Yeah?
Got us a German here who wants to die for country.
Oblige him.
(BAT tapping)
(continues tapping)
(BASTERDS cheering)
Did you get that for killing Jews?
Bravery.
(BASTERDS EXCLAlMlNG)
Yeah!
BASTERD 1 :
Oh, no!
BASTERD 2:
Oh, no!
Donny!
BASTERD:
Yeah, Donny!
About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you.
(laughing)
Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park!
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!
He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street!
You!
Damn it, Hirschberg!
Donny, bring that other one over here.
Alive!
Get the fuck up!
Batter up.
You're on deck!
Two hits. I hit you, you hit the ground.
English?
(speaking GERMAN)
ALDO:
Wicki.
Ask him if he wants to live.
(BOTH speaking GERMAN)
Tell him to point out on this map the German position.
(speaking GERMAN)
(BASTERDS laughing)
Ask him how many Germans.
(BOTH speaking GERMAN)
Around about 1 2.
What kind of artillery?
(BOTH speaking GERMAN)
(speaking GERMAN)
(speaking GERMAN)
Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
(speaking GERMAN)
(speaking GERMAN)
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
(speaking GERMAN)

(WlCKl speaking GERMAN)
(BUTZ speaking GERMAN)
WlCKl:
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
(speaking GERMAN)
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
(speaking GERMAN)
So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that.
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?

Right this way, Lieutenant.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
And your occupation before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well, sir, such as they are, I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind/ A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W .
Pabst.
What should we drink to, sir?
Well.. .
Down with Hitler.
All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer, how's he doing?
Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film, sir?
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
Bridget von Hammersmark?
(chuckling) The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
Indeed.
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was in a tavern.
It is a tavern.
Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
Stiglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful, I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
(LAUGHS)
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.

I must say, damn good stuff, sir.

Stiglitz.

I'm a German, you idiot.
ALDO:
Speak English pretty good for a German.
I agree.
So let's talk.
Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
His name is Max.
We were in here drinking, celebrating.
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
It's not my fault!
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
No.
I'm alive!
(shouting in GERMAN)
ALDO:
Who's that?
(GRUNTS) ls the girl on your side?
Which girl?
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.
Yeah, she's ours.
is she okay?
(speaking GERMAN)
Wilhelm!
(shouting in GERMAN)
She's been shot.
But she's alive.
(speaking GERMAN)
ALDO:
Okay, Wilhelm.
What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But.. .
But how can I?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo, I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
(SNlFFLES)
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.
(speaking GERMAN)
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
(VON HAMMERSMARK groaning)
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
(speaking FRENCH)
(DOGS barking)
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
(EXCLAlMlNG)
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a.. .
He had just become a father!
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
(GROANS)
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
(GRUNTlNG)
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
(breathing DEEPLY)
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Führer is attending the premiere.
(speaking GERMAN)
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
(SNORTS)
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg- mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't. I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that rouge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian.
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian.
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian.
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?

Omar?

Nope.

"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot.' ' Yeah, I was just thinking that.
(speaking GERMAN)
So you're Aldo the Apache.
So you're The Jew Hunter.
I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?
(SNORTS)
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar.. .
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on lce?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for.. .
OSS would be my guess.
(exclaims)
That's a bingo!
is that the way you say it?
"That's a bingo.' '
You just say, "Bingo.' '
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where l'm from.. .
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
Up there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999.999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?

HANS:
So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
(speaking GERMAN)
(speaking GERMAN)
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
GENERAL/ Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.

I made a deal with your general for that man's life!

But they don't give a fuck about him.
They need you.
You'll be shot for this!
Nah, I don't think so.

I've been chewed out before.
You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?
I'd make that deal.
I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command, I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island, I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So, I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.

Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
H is name is Max.
We were in here drinking , celebrating .
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing .
It's not my fault!
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm .
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
No.
I'm alive !
(SHOUTING IN GERMAN)
ALDO:
Who's that?
(G RU NTS) ls the girl on your side?

But she's alive.

Okay, Wilhelm .
What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm , here's my deal .
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you .
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi .
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willi .
I want to trust you .
But...
But how can I?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you .
Come down .
(SN I FFLES)
Hey, Willi , what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal .
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal , we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead .
U p top , they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead .
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal .
No trust, no deal .
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
J ust take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
(VON HAMMERSMARK G ROANING)
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
(DOGS BARKING)
Before we yank that slug out you , you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John , why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd .
Yeah , we got a word for that kind of odd in English .
It's called suspicious.
(EXCLAIMING)
Everybody needs to calm down .
You're letting your imagination get the better of you .
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi .
You remember him , don't you?
Yeah , I remember him .
H is wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
H is commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
(GROANS)
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both .
(GRUNTING)
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three .
The other looks odd .
Germans would and did notice it.
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant H icox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes !
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon .
Least of all , by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino .
One , the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Fuck a duck !
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old U ncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg .
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted .
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
(SNORTS)
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam .
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg- mountain-climbing story.
That's German , ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking , drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian .
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib .
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian .
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good .
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good .
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building .
Who does what?
Well , I speak the most Italian , so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman .
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian .
Like I said , third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?

It is a pleasure to meet you, Monsieur LaPadite I am Colonel Hans Landa of the SS
What can I do for you?
I was hoping you could invite me inside your home and we may have a discussion.
Certainly.
After you.
Colonel Landa, this is my family.
Colonel Hans Landa of the SS Mademoiselle at your service.
The rumours I have heard in the village about your family are all true.
Each one of your daughters is more lovely than the last.
Merci.
Please have a seat.
Suzanne, would you be so good as to get the Colonel some wine?
But no.
Merci beaucoup, Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine.
This being a dairy farm, one would be safe in assuming you have milk?
Oui.
Then milk is what I prefer.
Very well.
Julie, would you mind closing the window?
Merci.
Monsieur, to both your family and your cows I say, "Bravo."
Thank you.
Please join me at your table.
Very well.
Monsieur LaPadite what we have to discuss would be better discussed in private.
You'll notice I left my men outdoors.
If it wouldn't offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies to step outside?
You are right.
Charlotte, would you take the girls outside?
The Colonel and I need to have a few words.
Monsieur LaPadite I regret to inform you I've exhausted the extent of my French.
To continue to speak it so inadequately would only serve to embarrass me.
However, I've been led to believe you speak English quite well.
Yes.
Well, it just so happens, I do as well.
This being your house I ask your permission to switch to English for the remainder of the conversation.
By all means.
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
- Yes.
- This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, Monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
Please, Monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, Monsieur LaPadite?
- Only rumours.
- I love rumours!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumours, true or false, are often revealing.
So, Monsieur LaPadite, what rumours have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
Again, this is just a rumour, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
So, the rumours you've heard have been of escape?
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31.
Continue.
And the children,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
Amos was nine or 10.
- And Shosanna?
- And Shosanna was
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
- That they call you "The Jew Hunter."
- Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels
- that you do with rats, do you?
- No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
Yes.
Monsieur LaPadite I thank you for the milk and your hospitality.
I do believe our business here is done.
Ah, ladies.
I thank you for your time.
We shan't be bothering your family any longer.
So, Monsieur Mademoiselle.
I bid farewell to you and say adieu.
It's the girl.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
CHAPTER TWO
INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumours about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5,000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got a little Indian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disembowelled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
How much more of these Jew swine must I endure?
They butcher my men like they were flies!
Do you know the latest rumour they've conjured up in their fear-induced delirium?
The one that beats my boys with a bat!
The one they call "The Bear Jew" is a Golem!
My Führer, this is just soldiers' gossip.
No one really believes "The Bear Jew" is a Golem.
Why not?
They seem to be able to elude capture like an apparition.
They seem to be able to appear and disappear at will.
You want to prove they're flesh and blood?
Then bring them to me!
I will hang them naked, by their heels, from the Eiffel Tower!
And then throw their bodies in the sewers for the rats of Paris to feast!
Kliest!
Yes, my Führer!
I have an order I want relayed to all German soldiers stationed in France.
The Jew degenerate known as "The Bear Jew", henceforth, is never to be referred to as The Bear Jew again.
Yes, my Führer!
Do you still wish to see Private Butz?
Who and what is a Private Butz?
He's the soldier you wanted to see personally.
His squad was ambushed by Lt. Raine's Jews.
He was its only survivor.
Indeed, I do want to see him.
Thank you for reminding me.
Send him in.
Sergeant Rachtmann, Ludwig and I were the only ones left alive after the ambush.
While one man guarded us, the rest removed the hair.
Hey, Hirschberg.
Send that Kraut sarge over.
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
- Yes.
- Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis,
I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
- I heard of The Bear Jew.
- What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse, I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
Donny!
Yeah?
Got us a German here who wants to die for country.
Oblige him.
Did you get that for killing Jews?
Bravery.
Yeah!
Oh, no!
Donny!
Yeah, Donny!
About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you.
Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park!
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!
He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street!
You!
Damn it, Hirschberg!
Donny, bring that other one over here.
Alive!
Get the fuck up!
Batter up.
You're on deck!
Two hits.
I hit you, you hit the ground.
English?
Wicki.
Ask him if he wants to live.
Tell him to point out on this map the German position.
Ask him how many Germans.
Around about 12.
What kind of artillery?
How did you survive this ordeal?
They let me go.
Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
You are not to tell anybody anything.
Not one word of detail!
Your outfit was ambushed, and you got away!
Not one word more!
Yes, my Führer.
Did they mark you like they did the other survivors?
Yes, my Führer.
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
I will hug my mother like I've never hugged her before.
He's going to hug his mother.
Well, ain't that nice?
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
Not only shall I remove it, but I intend to burn it.
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that.
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?
Practice.
CHAPTER THREE
GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS
JUNE
What starts tomorrow?
A Max Linder festival.
I always preferred Linder to Chaplin.
Except Linder never made a film as good as "The Kid."
The chase climax of "The Kid", superb.
I adore your cinema very much.
Merci.
Is it yours?
Do I own it?
Oui.
Oui.
How is it a girl as young as you owns a cinema?
My aunt left it to me.
Merci for hosting a German night.
I don't have a choice but you're welcome.
I love the Riefenstahl mountain films especially Piz Palü.
It's nice to see a French girl who's an admirer of Riefenstahl.
"Admire" would not really be the word I would use to describe my feelings towards Fräulein Riefenstahl.
But you do admire the director Pabst, don't you?
That's why you include his name on the marquee when you didn't have to.
I'm French.
We respect directors in our country.
Even Germans.
Even Germans, oui.
Merci for your assistance, soldier.
Adieu.
You're not finished.
I'll finish in the morning.
May I ask your name?
You wish to see my papers?
Emmanuelle Mimieux.
That's a very pretty name.
Merci.
Are you finished with my papers?
Mademoiselle, may I introduce myself Fredrick Zoller.
Well it's been a pleasure chatting with a fellow cinema lover.
Sweet dreams, mademoiselle.
Adieu.
Hello, mademoiselle.
May I join you?
Look, Fredrick...
You remember my name?
Yes.
Look, you seem a pleasant enough fellow...
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Regardless, I want you to stop pestering me.
I apologize, mademoiselle I wasn't trying to be a pest.
I was simply trying to be friendly.
I don't wish to be your friend.
Why not?
Don't act like an infant.
You know why.
I'm more than just a uniform.
Not to me.
If you are so desperate for a French girlfriend I suggest you try Vichy.
Who are you?
I thought I was just a uniform.
You're not just a German soldier.
Are you somebody's son?
Most German soldiers are somebody's son.
You're a very lucky girl, catching a brave war hero.
No, no, no, no, the mademoiselle is not my girlfriend.
Can you write "Amour Babette"?
So you're a war hero.
What did you do?
I was alone in a bell tower in a walled off city.
It was myself and a thousand rounds of ammo, in a bird's nest against three hundred enemy soldiers.
What's a bird's nest?
A bird's nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower.
It's a high structure, offering a three hundred and sixty degree view.
Very advantageous for marksmen.
How many did you kill?
Sixty-eight.
The first day.
A hundred and fifty the second day.
Thirty-two the third day.
On the fourth day they exited the city.
Naturally, my war story received a lot of attention in Germany that's why they all recognize me.
They call me the German Sergeant York.
Maybe they'll make a film about your exploits.
Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels thought.
So he did and called it "Nation's Pride".
And they wanted me to play myself so I did.
Joseph thinks this movie will be proven to be his masterpiece.
And I will be the German Van Johnson.
"Nation's Pride" is about you?
"Nation's Pride" is starring you?
I know.
Comical?
Well, good luck with your movie, Private.
I hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself.
Goodbye!
- Do you need help?
- No, it's okay.
If you need me, I'll be in the storage room.
Okay, my love.
Mademoiselle Mimieux?
Yes?
Is this your cinema?
Yes.
Come down!
Please.
I don't understand.
What have I done?
She wants to know what she's done.
Get your ass in that car.
It's only the offspring of slaves that allows America to be competitive athletically.
American Olympic gold can be measured in Negro sweat.
Good, you came.
I wasn't sure whether or not you'd accept my invitation.
Invitation?
Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick?
Yes, it is, Dr. Goebbels.
Emmanuelle, there is somebody I want you to meet.
Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to introduce you to the minister of propaganda the leader of the entire German film industry and now that I'm an actor, my boss, Dr. Joseph Goebbels.
Your reputation precedes you, Fräulein Mimieux.
And normally, this is Herr Goebbels' French interpreter Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.
Hello.
Hello.
And you've met the Major.
Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
Major Dieter Hellstrom of the Gestapo.
At your service, mademoiselle.
Please allow me have a seat, please.
Try the champagne, mademoiselle, it's quite good.
I must say, Fräulein, I should be rather annoyed with you.
I arrive in France and I wish to have lunch with my star.
Little do I know he's become the toast of Paris.
And now he must find time for me.
People wait in line hours, days to see me.
For the Führer and Private Zoller, I wait.
So finally, I'm granted an audience with the young Private.
And he spends the entire lunch speaking of you and your cinema.
So Fräulein Mimieux, let's get down to business.
Herr Minister Doctor Goebbels...
I haven't informed her yet.
Unless the girl's a simpleton, I'm sure she's figured it out by now.
After all, she does operate a cinema.
Francesca, tell her.
What they are trying to tell you, Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has spent the last hour at lunch trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels to abandon previous plans for Private Zoller's film premiere and change the venue to your cinema.
What?
I wanted to inform her.
Shit!
I apologize, Private, of course you did.
What's the issue?
The Private wanted to inform the mademoiselle himself.
Nonsense!
Until I ask my questions, he has nothing to inform.
Let the record state, I have not agreed to switch cinemas for my premiere.
Duly noted.
You have opera boxes?
Yes.
How many?
Two.
More would be better.
How many seats in your auditorium?
Three hundred and fifty.
That's almost four hundred less than The Ritz.
But Dr. Goebbels that's not such a terrible thing.
You said yourself you didn't want to indulge every two-faced French bourgeois taking up space, currying favour.
With less seats, it makes the event more exclusive.
You're not trying to fill the house, they're fighting for seats.
Besides, to hell with the French.
This is a German night, a German event, a German celebration.
This night is for you, me for the German military, the high command their family and friends.
The only people who should be allowed in the room are people who will be moved by the exploits on the screen.
I see your public speaking has improved.
It appears I've created a monster.
A strangely persuasive monster.
When the war is over, politics await.
Well, Private though it is true, I'm inclined to indulge you anything...
I must watch a film in this young lady's cinema before I can say, yes or no.
So young lady, you are to close your cinema for a private screening tonight.
What German films do you have?
Ah, Landa, you are here.
Emmanuelle, this is Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
He'll be running the security for the premiere.
Charmed, mademoiselle.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
And now I must get the Reich Minister to his next appointment.
Slave driver.
French slave driver.
Actually, in my role as security chief of this joyous
German occasion, I'm afraid I must have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux.
What sort of discussion?
That sounded suspiciously like a Private questioning the order of a Colonel.
Or am I just being sensitive?
Nothing could be further from the truth, Colonel.
Your authority is beyond question.
But your reputation does precede you.
Should Mademoiselle Mimieux or myself be concerned?
Hans, the boy means no harm he's simply smitten.
And he's correct.
Your reputation does precede you.
No need for concern, you two.
As security chief, I simply need to have a chat with the possible new venue's property owner.
Have you tried the strudel here?
No, no.
It's not so terrible.
So how is it the young Private and yourself came to be acquainted?
Yes, two strudels.
One for myself and one for the mademoiselle.
For me a cup of espresso and for the mademoiselle a glass of milk.
So, mademoiselle, you were beginning to explain...?
Up until a couple of days ago, I had no knowledge of Private Zoller or his exploits.
To me the Private was simply just a patron of my cinema.
We spoke a few times but-
Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.
This is a simple formality.
No reason for you to feel anxious.
I apologize, I forgot to order the cream.
One moment.
Wait for the cream.
So, Emmanuelle.
May I call you Emmanuelle?
Oui.
So, Emmanuelle explain to me how does it happen, that a young lady such as yourself, comes to own a cinema?
After you.
Verdict?
Like I said, not so terrible.
You were explaining the origin of your cinema ownership.
The cinema originally belonged to my aunt and uncle.
What are their names?
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
Where are they now?
My uncle was killed during Blitzkrieg.
Pity.
Continue.
Aunt Ada passed away from fever last spring.
Regrettable.
It's come to my attention you have a Negro in your employ.
Is that true?
Oui.
He is a Frenchman.
His name is Marcel.
He worked with my aunt and uncle since they opened the cinema.
He's the only other one who works with me.
Doing what?
Projectionist.
Is he any good?
The best.
Actually, one could see where that might be a good trade for them.
Can you operate the projectors?
Of course I can.
Knowing the Reich Minister as I do...
I'm quite positive he wouldn't want the success or failure of his illustrious evening dependent on the prowess of a Negro.
So if it comes to pass we hold this event at your venue talented no doubt, as your Negro may be you will operate the projectors.
Is that acceptable?
Oui.
Cigarette?
They are not French.
They are German.
I did have something else I wanted to ask you.
But right now, for the life of me, I can't remember what it is.
Oh, well, must not have been important.
'Til tonight.
I must say, I appreciate the modesty of this cinema.
Your cinema has real respect, almost church like.
Not to say we couldn't spruce the place up a bit.
Maybe I'll go to the Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes, and scatter them about the lobby.
So, Emmanuelle, how did you like "Lucky Kids"?
I quite like Lilian Harvey.
Lilian Harvey!
Never mention that name again in my presence!
Hey what the fuck are we supposed to do?
It looks like we're supposed to have a Nazi premiere.
Like I said, what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Well, I need to talk with you about that.
I'm confused, what are we talking about?
Filling the cinema with Nazis and burning it down to the ground.
I'm not talking about that.
You are talking about that.
No, we're talking about that, right now.
If we can keep this place from burning down by ourselves we can burn it down by ourselves?
Oui, Shosanna, we could do that.
And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate film print collection we wouldn't even need explosives would we?
You mean we wouldn't need any more explosives?
At that time, 35 millimetre nitrate film was so flammable that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar.
Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle.
- They're films, ain't they?
- Yes.
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.
Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper.
Shosanna has a collection of over 350 nitrate film prints.
I am going to burn down the cinema on Nazi night.
And if I'm going to burn down the cinema which I am we both know, you're not going to let me do it by myself.
Because you love me.
And I love you.
And you're the only person on this earth I can trust.
But that's not all we're going to do.
Does the filmmaking equipment in the attic still work?
I know the film camera does.
How about the sound recorder?
Quite well, actually.
I recorded a new guitarist I met in a cafe last week.
It works superb.
Why do we need filmmaking equipment?
Because Marcel, my sweet we're going to make a film.
Just for the Nazis.
CHAPTER FOUR
OPERATION KINO
Right this way, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
- And your occupation before the war?
- I'm a film critic.
- List your accomplishments.
- Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a sub textual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
- What should we drink to, sir?
- Well...
- Down with Hitler.
- All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years,
- but I'm familiar with it.
- Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer,
- how's he doing?
- Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
- What film, sir?
- The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germanic occasion will be Goebbels, Göring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometres outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
- Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
- Bridget von Hammersmark?
The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
- Indeed.
- Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
The village of Nadine
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
- I didn't know.
- You said it was in a tavern.
- It is a tavern.
- Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
- Stiglitz, right?
- That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the death-trap rendezvous?
- She chose the spot.
- Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.
So, I'm male I'm a fictional, literary character from the past I'm American, and that's controversial.
No, it's not controversial at all.
The nationality of the author has nothing to do with the nationality of the character.
The character is the character.
Hamlet is not British.
He is Danish.
So yes, this character was born in America.
Well then.
Mathilda.
Schnapps?
Schnapps?
Schnapps...
Schnapps...
Schnapps.
Five schnapps, please.
If I had a wife would she be called a squaw?
Yes!
He's got it.
Three more questions!
Is my blood brother Old Shatterhand?
Yes!
Did Karl May write me?
Yes!
So who are you?
!
I am "Winnetou", chief of the Apaches!
Yes!
That was good!
That was good!
That was good!
Now down with the glasses!
Cheers.
Attention!
Hello, my lovelies.
Take a seat.
I will join you in moments.
I'm just saying goodbye to my five new friends here.
No hurry, Frau von Hammersmark.
Take your time.
Enjoy yourself.
We'll be just over here waiting.
Eric, my love.
Those are the friends I've been waiting for.
Please treat them to anything they like.
Frau von Hammersmark.
Your wish is my command.
Officers it would appear the drinks are on the fräulein.
- What would you like?
- Whiskey.
Two whiskeys.
- Three whiskeys.
- Three whiskeys, very well.
I wish you a wonderful evening.
- Same to you.
- I thank you.
Your card!
Yes, you're right.
Let's see.
Genghis Khan!
I would never have gotten that.
But of course you would have!
Hello, darling.
How are you?
So good to see you.
I thought this place was supposed to have more French than Germans?
Yes, normally that's true.
The Sergeant over there's wife just had a baby.
And his commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
We should leave.
No.
We should stay.
For one drink at least.
I've been waiting for you in a bar.
It would look strange if we left before we had a drink.
She's right.
Just be calm and enjoy your whiskey.
Mmm.
Mathilda...
She would love to play the game.
I will translate... and protect.
Don't worry, pretty little thing.
If any of these wolves gets out of line, I'll kick their ass in.
Watch.
Rip off his nose.
Stop it!
Schnapps, schnapps, take your schnapps in hand, comrades.
Before we go on playing we will drink.
We drink to our friend Wilhelm.
And his little boy Maximilian.
- To Max!
- To Max!
There's some new development.
The cinema venue has changed.
Why?
No one knows but that should not be a real problem.
The cinema it's been changed to is considerably smaller than The Ritz.
So whatever explosives you brought for The Ritz should be doubly effective here.
Now the next piece of information is colossal.
Try not to overreact.
The Führer-
...I was just thinking could you sign an autograph to my son on his birthday?
Of course.
I'd love to, Wilhelm.
This handsome Staff Sergeant just became a father today.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Do you know the name of this progeny yet?
I most certainly do, fräulein.
His name is Maximilian.
Maximilian, wonderful name.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.
Max may not know who you are now but he will.
I will show him all of your movies.
Good.
He will grow up with your films and this napkin on his wall.
I propose a toast to the greatest actress in Germany!
There is no Dietrich!
There is no Riefenstahl!
Only Von Hammersmark!
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Cheers!
Once again-
Frau Hammersmark, what brings you to France?
None of your business!
Staff Sergeant.
You might not have worn out your welcome with the fräulein with your drunken boorish behaviour but you have worn out your welcome with me.
Might I remind you, Staff Sergeant, you are an enlisted man.
This is an officer's table!
I suggest you stop pestering the fräulein and rejoin your table.
Excuse me, Captain, but your accent is very unusual.
Where are you from?
You must be either completely drunk or mad to dare to speak to a superior officer with such impertinentness!
Staff Sergeant.
I'm making you and you responsible for him.
I suggest you take hold of your friend or he'll spend Max's first birthday in jail for public drunkenness.
Might I inquire?
Like our young newly christened father here I, too, have an acute ear for accents.
And like him I, too, find yours odd.
From where do you hail, Captain?
Major, this is highly-
- I wasn't speaking to you, Lieutenant Munich.
Or you either, Lieutenant Frankfurt.
I was speaking to Captain I-don't-know-what.
I was born in a village that rests in the shadow of the Piz Palü.
- The mountain?
- Yes.
In that village, we all speak like this.
Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?
- Yes.
- Then you saw me.
You remember the skiing torch scene?
Yes.
In that scene was myself, my father, my sister and my two brothers.
My brother is so handsome the director Pabst, gave him a Close-Up.
Herr Major, if my word means anything I can vouch for everything the young captain has just said.
He does hail from the bottom of the Piz Palü.
He was in the film and his brother is far more handsome than he.
You should rejoin your friends.
May I join you?
By all means.
Wunderbar!
So that's the source of your bizarre accent.
That's extraordinary.
What are you doing here?
Aside from having a drink with the lovely fräulein?
Well, that pleasure requires no explanation.
I mean in country.
You're obviously not stationed in France or I'd know who you are.
You know every German in France?
Worth knowing.
Well, there lies the problem.
We never claimed to be worth knowing.
All levity aside, what are you doing in France?
Attending Minister Goebbels' film premiere as the fräulein's escort.
You are the Fräulein Hammersmark's escort.
Someone has to carry her lighter.
The captain is my date, but all three are my guests.
We are old friends who go back a long time.
Actually, longer than an actress would care to admit.
Well, in that case let me raise my glass to the three luckiest men in the room.
I'll drink to that.
Queen Christina.
Mata Hari.
I must say that game they're playing looks like a good bit of fun.
I didn't join them because you're quite right, Captain.
An officer should not fraternize with enlisted men.
But seeing as we are all officers and sophisticated lady friends of officers.
What say we play the game?
Yes, great, one game.
Wunderbar.
Soldiers the cards.
Thank you.
So gentlemen the object of the game is to write the name of a famous person on your card.
Real or fictitious, doesn't matter.
For instance, you could write, Confucius or Doctor Fu Manchu.
Eric!
More pens.
And they must be famous, not aunt Frida.
When you finish writing, put the card face down on the table.
And move it to the person on your right-
Thanks.
- the person to your left moves his card to you.
You pick up the card without looking at it lick the back and stick it on your forehead.
Write!
Write.
I'll start, give you the idea.
Am I German?
- No.
- No.
Am I American?
- No.
- No.
Wait a minute, he goes to -
Obviously, he wasn't born in America.
So...
I visited America, aye?
Yes.
Was this visit fortuitous?
Not for you.
My native land, is it what one would call, exotic?
- Yes.
- Yes.
That could be either a reference to the jungle or the Orient.
I'm going to let my first instinct take over and ask.
Am I from the jungle?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask whether you're real or fictitious.
I, however, think that's too easy, so I won't ask that yet.
Okay my native land is the jungle I visited America but my visit was not fortuitous to me but the implication is that it was to somebody else.
When I went from the jungle to America did I go by boat?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Did I go against my will?
- Yes.
- Yes.
On this boat ride, was I in chains?
Yes.
When I arrived in America, was I displayed in chains?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Am I the story of the Negro in America?
No.
Well then I must be King Kong.
Bravo!
Impressive.
Now, since I answered correctly, you all need to finish your drinks.
Cheers.
Now, who is next?
Well, Major I don't mean to be rude.
But the four of us are very good friends.
And we haven't seen each other in quite a while.
So, Major I am afraid you are intruding.
I beg to differ, Captain.
It's only if the fräulein considers my presence an intrusion that I become an intruder.
How about it, Fräulein von Hammersmark?
Am I intruding?
I didn't think so.
It's simply the captain is immune to my charms.
I am just joking.
Just joking.
Of course I'm intruding.
Allow me to refill your glasses, gentlemen, and I will bid you and the fräulein adieu.
Eric has a bottle of thirty-three-year-old whiskey.
From the Scottish Highlands.
What do you say, gentlemen?
You're most gracious, Major.
Eric!
The thirty-three.
And new glasses!
You don't want to contaminate the thirty-three with the swill you were drinking.
How many glasses?
- Five.
- Not for me.
I like scotch, scotch doesn't like me.
Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly.
Three glasses.
Frau von Hammersmark.
Thank you.
A thousand year German Reich!
- A thousand year Reich!
- A thousand year Reich!
I must say I grow weary of these monkeyshines.
Did you hear that?
That was the sound of my Walther.
Pointed right at your testicles.
Why do you have your Walther pointed at my testicles?
Because you've just given yourself away, Captain.
You're no more German than that scotch.
- Well, Major.
- Shut up slut.
You were saying?
I was saying that makes two of us.
I've had a gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.
That makes three of us.
And at this range, I'm a real Fredrick Zoller.
Looks like we have a bit of a sticky situation here.
What's going to happen, Major you're going to stand up and walk out that door with us.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't think so.
I'm afraid you and I we both know, Captain no matter what happens to anybody else in this room the two of us aren't going anywhere.
Too bad about Sergeant Wilhelm and his famous friends.
If any of you expect to live, you'll have to shoot them too.
Looks like little Max will grow up an orphan.
How sad.
Well, if this is it, old boy,
I hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's.
By all means, Captain.
There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch.
Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily,
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
Now, about this pickle we find ourselves in.
It would appear there's only one thing left for you to do.
And what would that be?
- Stiglitz.
- Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls.
You outside.
Who are you?
British?
American?
What?
We're American.
What are you?
I'm a German, you idiot.
Speak English pretty good for a German.
I agree.
So let's talk.
Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
His name is Max.
We were in here drinking, celebrating.
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
It's not my fault!
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
- No.
- I'm alive!
Who's that?
Is the girl on your side?
Which girl?
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.
Yeah, she's ours.
Is she okay?
Wilhelm!
She's been shot.
But she's alive.
Okay, Wilhelm.
What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can I?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germanic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Führer is attending the premiere.
I've been rethinking my position in regards to your Paris premiere of "Nation's Pride".
As the weeks have gone on and the Americans are on the beach I do find myself thinking more and more about this Private Zoller.
This boy has done something tremendous for us.
And I'm beginning to think my participation in this event could be meaningful.
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different colour.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-I-broke-my-leg-mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that rouge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian.
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian.
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian.
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?
You've moved up in the world.
Look at you, Lieutenant First Class.
And with your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.
And that one's name is Wilhelm Wicki.
He's an Austrian-born Jew, who immigrated to the United States when things began turning sour for the Israelites.
They are the two German-born members of the Basterds.
They've been known to don German uniforms, to ambush squads.
What brings you all the way out here?
But that doesn't look like this.
This is odd.
It would appear somebody's missing.
Somebody fashionable.
Everybody out!
"To Max, with love".
Bridget von Hammersmark.
CHAPTER FIVE
REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE
Night of "NATION'S PRIDE" premiere
Remember... in English.
Yes.
Action.
But how do we get it developed?
Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop that footage.
And suppose someone would develop the footage how do we get a 35mm print with a soundtrack?
We find somebody who can develop and process a 35mm print with a soundtrack.
And we make them do it or we kill them.
Bring that fucker over here!
Put his head down on that table.
You either do what the fuck we tell you or I'll bury this axe in your collaborating skull.
I'm not a collaborator.
Marcel, do his wife and children know you?
Yes.
Then after we kill this dog for the Germans we'll go and silence them.
Jannings, come on, show the ring.
Come on, come on.
There you go!
Fredrick, have a look at it.
This is the highest artistic honour that I give.
- Herr Doctor, I'm also feeling very honoured.
- You deserve it, my dear Jannings!
But I believe after the premiere today, we have a new candidate.
Ah, Emmanuelle I'd like you to meet the greatest actor in the world Emil Jannings.
Mademoiselle, I'm pleased to meet you.
You have a beautiful cinema.
Thank you, Hermann.
Fräulein von Hammersmark.
Colonel Landa, it's been years.
Dashing as ever, I see.
So what's happened to your lovely leg?
A by-product of kicking ass in the German cinema, no doubt.
Save your flattery, you old dog.
I know too many of your former conquests to fall into that honey pot.
Seriously, what happened?
Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I might add at mountain climbing.
And this is the result.
Mountain climbing?
That's how you injured your leg -mountain climbing?
Believe it or not, yes it is.
Forgive me, fräulein.
I don't mean to laugh at your misfortune.
It's just -mountain climbing?
I'm curious, fräulein, what could have ever compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavour?
Well, I shan't be doing it again, I can tell you that.
That cast looks as fresh as my old Uncle Gustav.
When were you climbing this mountain, last night?
Very good eye, Colonel.
It happened yesterday morning.
And where in Paris is this mountain?
No, I'm just teasing you, fräulein.
You know me, I tease rough.
So, who are your three handsome escorts?
I'm afraid neither three speak a word of German.
They're friends of mine from Italy.
This is a wonderful Italian stuntman, Enzo Gorlomi.
A very talented cameraman, Antonio Margheriti.
And Antonio's camera assistant Dominick Decocco.
Gentlemen, this is an old friend, Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
Hello.
Gentlemen, it's a pleasure the friends of our cherished star, admired by all of us, this outright jewel of our culture are naturally going to be under my personal protection for the duration of their stay.
Thank you.
Gorlomi?
Am I saying it correctly?
Yes - 'er, correct.
Gorlomi?
Say it for me once please...?
Gorlomi.
I'm sorry, again...?
Gorlomi.
Once more...?
Gorlomi.
What's your name again...?
Antonio Margheriti.
Again...?
Margheriti.
One more time, but let me really hear the music in it!
Margheriti.
Margheriti.
And you...?
Dominick Decocco.
Dominick Decocco.
Well, my two cameraman friends need to find their seats.
Let me see your tickets.
I suppose you getting premiere tickets for your friends wouldn't be the most difficult thing for a star of your status.
0023 and 0024.
That shouldn't be too difficult to find, goodbye.
Ooh la la, Danielle Darrieux.
I have to go down and socialize with these Hun pigs.
Let's go over it again.
Reel one is on the first projector.
Reel two is on the second.
The third one is on the spool.
And the fourth one is ready to go.
Okay, the big sniper battle in the film begins around the middle of the third reel.
Our film comes in on the fourth reel.
Somewhere towards the end of the third reel go down and lock the doors of the auditorium.
Then take your place behind the screen and wait for my cue.
Then burn it down.
Take your seats.
The show is about to begin.
Everybody, please take your seats.
The show is about to begin.
We'll see you later.
Not so fast.
A glass of champagne to toast "Nation's Pride".
My fräulein, may I have a word with you in private?
Certainly.
Excuse us.
Have a seat, my fräulein.
May I?
Mademoiselle Mimieux allowed me to set up camp in her office for the time being.
Let me see your foot.
I beg your pardon?
Put your foot in my lap.
Hans, you embarrass me.
Could you please reach into the right pocket of my coat and give me what you find in there.
May I?
What's that American expression?
"If the shoe fits, you must wear it."
What now, Colonel?
The guy in the white smoking jacket.
Fucking shithead.
Faggot fuck.
Fuck you!
Bunch of shithead fuck.
Fuck you, too!
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches!
Get your hands off me.
You fucking bratwurst-smelling...
God damn you!
Get off!
Hmm.
Clever.
I informed the Führer that the audience has taken their seats.
He should arrive any minute.
Thank you, Hans.
You Jerry-banging, Limburg-smelling...
Let go.
As Stanley said to Livingstone, Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?
Hans Landa.
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.
My hands to be exact.
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you.
Caught you flinching.
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.
Utivich?
Is that you, Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?
The woman?
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot." Yeah, I was just thinking that.
You may leave us.
But stay alert outside.
So you're Aldo the Apache.
- So you're The Jew Hunter.
- I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on Ice?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Göring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Göring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it? "That's a bingo".
You just say, "Bingo".
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
Up there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999.999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?
I implore you.
We must destroy that tower.
Sarge, that tower...
The tower stands!
Gum?
Psst!
Psst!
It's time.
I should go lock the auditorium and take my place behind the screen.
So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
I informed the Führer that the audience has taken their seats.
He should arrive any minute.
Thank you, Hans.
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honour for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honour.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.
Is that clear, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
Over and out.
Herr Dr. Goebbels, excuse me.
Could I go out for a moment?
Perfectly understandable, my boy.
You go now, and we'll see you after the show.
Who is it?
Fredrick!
Shit.
Are you the manager of this cinema?
I want my money back.
That actor in the movie stinks.
What are you doing here?
I came to visit you.
Can't you see how busy I am?
Then allow me to lend an assist.
Fredrick, it's not funny, you can't be here.
This is your premiere, you need to be out there with them.
Normally, you would be right.
And for all the other films I do I intend to endure evenings like tonight, in the proper spirit.
However, the fact remains this film is based on my military exploits.
And in this case, my exploits consisted of killing many men.
Consequently, the part of the film that's playing now I don't like watching this part.
- I am sorry, Fredrick, but...
- So, I thought I'd come up here and do what I do best annoy you.
And from the look on your face, it would appear I haven't lost my touch.
Are you so used to the Nazis kissing your ass you've forgotten what the word "no" means?
No... you can't be here!
Now go away!
Fredrick, you hurt me.
Well, it's nice to know you can feel something.
Even if it's just physical pain.
I'm not a man you say, "go away" to.
There's over three hundred dead bodies in Italy, that if they could, would testify to that!
After what I've done for you you disrespect me at your peril!
Lock the door.
What?
Lock the door.
We don't have much time.
Time for what?
Forget it!
No, no, no... wait.
You want me to...
lock the door?
For the fifty-seventh time, yes.
When I kill that guy, you got 30 feet to get to that guard.
- Can you do it?
- I have to.
Champagne?
Extraordinary my dear, simply extraordinary!
This is your finest film yet.
Thank you, my Führer.
Thank you.
Who wants to send a message to Germany?
I have a message for Germany.
That you are all going to die.
Enough!
Stop it!
Turn off the projector!
And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who's going to do it!
I don't know what's going on.
That does not belong in my movie!
Marcel, burn it down.
Oui, Shosanna.
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face
of Jewish vengeance.
These are the American lines, Colonel sir.
Excellent, Hermann.
Hermann, uncuff them.
I'm officially surrendering myself over to you, Lieutenant Raine.
We're your prisoners.
How about my knife?
Thank you very much, Colonel.
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back.
Is that really necessary?
I'm a slave to appearances.
Scalp Hermann.
Are you mad?
What have you done?
I made a deal with your general for that man's life!
Yeah, they made that deal.
But they don't give a fuck about him.
They need you.
You'll be shot for this!
Nah, I don't think so.
More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.
You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?
- I'd make that deal.
- I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command,
I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island,
I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know something, Utivich?
I think this just might be my masterpiece.
Go back inside and shut the door.
Julie, get me some water for my wash up then get inside with your sisters.
Ready, Papa.
Thank you, my darling now you go inside with your sisters.
Don't run.
Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?
I am Perrier LaPadite.
It is a pleasure to meet you, Monsieur LaPadite I am Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
What can I do for you?
I was hoping you could invite me inside your home and we may have a discussion.
Certainly.
After you.
Colonel Landa, this is my family.
Colonel Hans Landa of the SS Mademoiselle at your service.
The rumors I have heard in the village about your family are all true.
Each one of your daughters is more lovely than the last.
Merci.
Please have a seat.
Suzanne, would you be so good as to get the Colonel some wine?
But no.
Merci beaucoup, Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine.
This being a dairy farm, one would be safe in assuming you have milk?
Oui.
Then milk is what I prefer.
Very well.
Julie, would you mind closing the window?
Merci.
Monsieur, to both your family and your cows I say, "Bravo."
Thank you.
Please join me at your table.
Very well.
Monsieur LaPadite what we have to discuss would be better discussed in private.
You'll notice I left my men outdoors.
If it wouldn't offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies to step outside?
You are right.
Charlotte, would you take the girls outside?
The Colonel and I need to have a few words.
Monsieur LaPadite I regret to inform you I've exhausted the extent of my French.
To continue to speak it so inadequately would only serve to embarrass me.
However, I've been led to believe you speak English quite well.
Yes.
Well, it just so happens, I do as well.
This being your house I ask your permission to switch to English for the remainder of the conversation.
By all means.
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
Yes.
This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
Only rumors.
I love rumors!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31.
Continue.
And the children,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
Amos was nine or 10.
And Shosanna?
And Shosanna was
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
That they call you "The Jew Hunter."
Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
Yes.
Monsieur LaPadite I thank you for the milk and your hospitality.
I do believe our business here is done.
Ah, ladies.
I thank you for your time.
We shan't be bothering your family any longer.
So, Monsieur Mademoiselle.
I bid farewell to you and say adieu.
It's the girl.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5, 000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got a little Indian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
How much more of these Jew swine must I endure?
They butcher my men like they were flies!
Do you know the latest rumor they've conjured up in their fear-induced delirium?
The one that beats my boys with a bat!
The one they call "The Bear Jew" is a Golem!
My Führer, this is just soldiers' gossip.
No one really believes "The Bear Jew" is a Golem.
Why not?
They seem to be able to elude capture like an apparition.
They seem to be able to appear and disappear at will.
You want to prove they're flesh and blood?
Then bring them to me!
I will hang them naked, by their heels, from the Eiffel Tower!
And then throw their bodies in the sewers for the rats of Paris to feast!
Kliest!
Yes, my Führer!
I have an order I want relayed to all German soldiers stationed in France.
The Jew degenerate known as "The Bear Jew," henceforth, is never to be referred to as The Bear Jew again.
Yes, my Führer!
Do you still wish to see Private Butz?
Who and what is a Private Butz?
He's the soldier you wanted to see personally.
His squad was ambushed by Lt. Raine's Jews.
He was its only survivor.
Indeed, I do want to see him.
Thank you for reminding me.
Send him in.
Sergeant Rachtmann, Ludwig and I were the only ones left alive after the ambush.
While one man guarded us, the rest removed the hair.
Hey, Hirschberg.
Send that Kraut sarge over.
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
Yes.
Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse,
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
Donny!
Yeah?
Got us a German here who wants to die for country.
Oblige him.
Did you get that for killing Jews?
Bravery.
Yeah!
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!
Donny!
Yeah, Donny!
About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you.
Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park!
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!
He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street!
You!
Damn it, Hirschberg!
Donny, bring that other one over here.
Alive!
Get the fuck up!
Batter up.
You're on deck!
Two hits.
I hit you, you hit the ground.
English?
Wicki.
Ask him if he wants to live.
Tell him to point out on this map the German position.
Ask him how many Germans.
Around about 12.
What kind of artillery?
How did you survive this ordeal?
They let me go.
Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
You are not to tell anybody anything.
Not one word of detail!
Your outfit was ambushed, and you got away!
Not one word more!
Yes, my Führer.
Did they mark you like they did the other survivors?
Yes, my Führer.
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
I will hug my mother like I've never hugged her before.
He's going to hug his mother.
Well, ain't that nice?
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
Not only shall I remove it, but I intend to burn it.
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that.
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?
Practice.
What starts tomorrow?
A Max Linder festival.
I always preferred Linder to Chaplin.
Except Linder never made a film as good as "The Kid."
The chase climax of "The Kid," superb.
I adore your cinema very much.
Merci.
Is it yours?
Do I own it?
Oui.
Oui.
How is it a girl as young as you owns a cinema?
My aunt left it to me.
Merci for hosting a German night.
I don't have a choice but you're welcome.
I love the Riefenstahl mountain films especially Piz Palü.
It's nice to see a French girl who's an admirer of Riefenstahl.
"Admire" would not really be the word I would use to describe my feelings towards Fräulein Riefenstahl.
But you do admire the director Pabst, don't you?
That's why you include his name on the marquee when you didn't have to.
I'm French.
We respect directors in our country.
Even Germans.
Even Germans, oui.
Merci for your assistance, soldier.
Adieu.
You're not finished.
I'll finish in the morning.
May I ask your name?
You wish to see my papers?
Emmanuelle Mimieux.
That's a very pretty name.
Merci.
Are you finished with my papers?
Mademoiselle, may I introduce myself Fredrick Zoller.
Well it's been a pleasure chatting with a fellow cinema lover.
Sweet dreams, mademoiselle.
Adieu.
Hello, mademoiselle.
May I join you?
Look, Fredrick...
You remember my name?
Yes.
Look, you seem a pleasant enough fellow...
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Regardless, I want you to stop pestering me.
I apologize, mademoiselle I wasn't trying to be a pest.
I was simply trying to be friendly.
I don't wish to be your friend.
Why not?
Don't act like an infant.
You know why.
I'm more than just a uniform.
Not to me.
If you are so desperate for a French girlfriend I suggest you try Vichy.
Who are you?
I thought I was just a uniform.
You're not just a German soldier.
Are you somebody's son?
Most German soldiers are somebody's son.
You're a very lucky girl, catching a brave war hero.
No, no, no, no, the mademoiselle is not my girlfriend.
Can you write "Amour Babette"?
So you're a war hero.
What did you do?
I was alone in a bell tower in a walled off city.
It was myself and a thousand rounds of ammo, in a bird's nest against three hundred enemy soldiers.
What's a bird's nest?
A bird's nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower.
It's a high structure, offering a three hundred and sixty degree view.
Very advantageous for marksmen.
How many did you kill?
Sixty-eight.
The first day.
A hundred and fifty the second day.
Thirty-two the third day.
On the fourth day they exited the city.
Naturally, my war story received a lot of attention in Germany that's why they all recognize me.
They call me the German Sergeant York.
Maybe they'll make a film about your exploits.
Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels thought.
So he did and called it "Nation's Pride."
And they wanted me to play myself so I did.
Joseph thinks this movie will be proven to be his masterpiece.
And I will be the German Van Johnson.
"Nation's Pride" is about you?
"Nation's Pride" is starring you?
I know.
Comical?
Well, good luck with your movie, Private.
I hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself.
Goodbye!
Do you need help?
No, it's okay.
If you need me, I'll be in the storage room.
Okay, my love.
Mademoiselle Mimieux?
Yes?
Is this your cinema?
Yes.
Come down!
Please.
I don't understand.
What have I done?
She wants to know what she's done.
Get your ass in that car.
It's only the offspring of slaves that allows America to be competitive athletically.
American Olympic gold can be measured in Negro sweat.
Good, you came.
I wasn't sure whether or not you'd accept my invitation.
Invitation?
Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick?
Yes, it is, Dr. Goebbels.
Emmanuelle, there is somebody I want you to meet.
Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to introduce you to the minister of propaganda the leader of the entire German film industry and now that I'm an actor, my boss, Dr. Joseph Goebbels.
Your reputation precedes you, Fräulein Mimieux.
And normally, this is Herr Goebbels' French interpreter Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.
Hello.
Hello.
And you've met the Major.
Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
Major Dieter Hellstrom of the Gestapo.
At your service, mademoiselle.
Please allow me have a seat please.
Try the champagne, mademoiselle, it's quite good.
I must say, Fräulein, I should be rather annoyed with you.
I arrive in France and I wish to have lunch with my star.
Little do I know he's become the toast of Paris.
And now he must find time for me.
People wait in line hours, days to see me.
For the Führer and Private Zoller, I wait.
So finally, I'm granted an audience with the young Private.
And he spends the entire lunch speaking of you and your cinema.
So Fräulein Mimieux, let's get down to business.
Herr Minister Doctor Goebbels...
I haven't informed her yet.
Unless the girl's a simpleton, I'm sure she's figured it out by now.
After all, she does operate a cinema.
Francesca, tell her.
What they are trying to tell you, Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has spent the last hour at lunch trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels to abandon previous plans for Private Zoller's film premiere and change the venue to your cinema.
What?
I wanted to inform her.
Shit!
I apologize, Private, of course you did.
What's the issue?
The Private wanted to inform the mademoiselle himself.
Nonsense!
Until I ask my questions, he has nothing to inform.
Let the record state, I have not agreed to switch cinemas for my premiere.
Duly noted.
You have opera boxes?
Yes.
How many?
Two.
More would be better.
How many seats in your auditorium?
Three hundred and fifty.
That's almost four hundred less than The Ritz.
But Dr. Goebbels that's not such a terrible thing.
You said yourself you didn't want to indulge every two-faced French bourgeois taking up space, currying favor.
With less seats, it makes the event more exclusive.
You're not trying to fill the house, they're fighting for seats.
Besides, to hell with the French.
This is a German night, a German event, a German celebration.
This night is for you, me for the German military, the high command their family and friends.
The only people who should be allowed in the room are people who will be moved by the exploits on the screen.
I see your public speaking has improved.
It appears I've created a monster.
A strangely persuasive monster.
When the war is over, politics await.
Well, Private though it is true, I'm inclined to indulge you anything...
I must watch a film in this young lady's cinema before I can say, yes or no.
So young lady, you are to close your cinema for a private screening tonight.
What German films do you have?
Ah, Landa, you are here.
Ah, Landa, you are here.
Emmanuelle, this is Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
He'll be running the security for the premiere.
Charmed, mademoiselle.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
And now I must get the Reich Minister to his next appointment.
Slave driver.
French slave driver.
Actually, in my role as security chief of this joyous German occasion,
I'm afraid I must have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux.
What sort of discussion?
That sounded suspiciously like a Private questioning the order of a Colonel.
Or am I just being sensitive?
Nothing could be further from the truth, Colonel.
Your authority is beyond question.
But your reputation does precede you.
Should Mademoiselle Mimieux or myself be concerned?
Hans, the boy means no harm he's simply smitten.
And he's correct.
Your reputation does precede you.
No need for concern, you two.
As security chief, I simply need to have a chat with the possible new venue's property owner.
Have you tried the strudel here?
No, no.
It's not so terrible.
So how is it the young Private and yourself came to be acquainted?
Yes, two strudels.
One for myself and one for the mademoiselle.
For me a cup of espresso and for the mademoiselle a glass of milk.
So, mademoiselle, you were beginning to explain?
Up until a couple of days ago, I had no knowledge of Private Zoller or his exploits.
To me the Private was simply just a patron of my cinema.
We spoke a few times but...
Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.
This is a simple formality.
No reason for you to feel anxious.
I apologize, I forgot to order the cream.
One moment.
Wait for the cream.
So, Emmanuelle.
May I call you Emmanuelle?
Oui.
So, Emmanuelle explain to me how does it happen, that a young lady such as yourself, comes to own a cinema?
After you.
Verdict?
Like I said, not so terrible.
You were explaining the origin of your cinema ownership.
The cinema originally belonged to my aunt and uncle.
What are their names?
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
Where are they now?
My uncle was killed during Blitzkrieg.
Pity.
Continue.
Aunt Ada passed away from fever last spring.
Regrettable.
It's come to my attention you have a Negro in your employ.
Is that true?
Oui.
He is a Frenchman.
His name is Marcel.
He worked with my aunt and uncle since they opened the cinema.
He's the only other one who works with me.
Doing what?
Projectionist.
Is he any good?
The best.
Actually, one could see where that might be a good trade for them.
Can you operate the projectors?
Of course I can.
Knowing the Reich Minister as I do...
I'm quite positive he wouldn't want the success or failure of his illustrious evening dependent on the prowess of a Negro.
So if it comes to pass we hold this event at your venue talented no doubt, as your Negro may be you will operate the projectors.
Is that acceptable?
Oui.
Cigarette?
They are not French.
They are German.
I did have something else I wanted to ask you.
But right now, for the life of me, I can't remember what it is.
Oh well, must not have been important.
'Til tonight.
I must say, I appreciate the modesty of this cinema.
Your cinema has real respect, almost church like.
Not to say we couldn't spruce the place up a bit.
Maybe I'll go to the Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes, and scatter them about the lobby.
So, Emmanuelle, how did you like "Lucky Kids"?
I quite like Lilian Harvey.
Lilian Harvey!
Never mention that name again in my presence!
Hey what the fuck are we supposed to do?
It looks like we're supposed to have a Nazi premiere.
Like I said what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Well, I need to talk with you about that.
I'm confused, what are we talking about?
Filling the cinema with Nazis and burning it down to the ground.
I'm not talking about that.
You are talking about that.
No, we're talking about that, right now.
If we can keep this place from burning down by ourselves we can burn it down by ourselves?
Oui Shosanna, we could do that.
And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate film print collection we wouldn't even need explosives would we?
You mean we wouldn't need any more explosives?
At that time, 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar.
Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle.
They're films, ain't they?
Yes.
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.
Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper.
Shosanna has a collection of over 350 nitrate film prints.
I am going to burn down the cinema on Nazi night.
And if I'm going to burn down the cinema which I am we both know, you're not going to let me do it by myself.
Because you love me.
And I love you.
And you're the only person on this earth I can trust.
But that's not all we're going to do.
Does the filmmaking equipment in the attic still work?
I know the film camera does.
How about the sound recorder?
Quite well, actually.
I recorded a new guitarist I met in a cafe last week.
It works superb.
Why do we need filmmaking equipment?
Because Marcel, my sweet we're going to make a film.
Just for the Nazis.
Right this way, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
And your occupation before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
What should we drink to, sir?
Well...
Down with Hitler.
All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer, how's he doing?
Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film, sir?
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
Bridget von Hammersmark?
The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
Indeed.
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was in a tavern.
It is a tavern.
Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
Stiglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.
So, I'm male I'm a fictional, literary character from the past I'm American, and that's controversial.
No, it's not controversial at all.
The nationality of the author has nothing to do with the nationality of the character.
The character is the character.
Hamlet is not British.
He is Danish.
So yes, this character was born in America.
Well then.
Mathilda.
Schnapps?
Schnapps?
Schnapps...
Schnapps...
Schnapps.
Five schnapps, please.
If I had a wife would she be called a squaw?
Yes!
He's got it.
Three more questions!
Is my blood brother Old Shatterhand?
Yes!
Did Karl May write me?
Yes!
So who are you?
!
I am "Winnetou," chief of the Apaches!
Yes!
That was good!
That was good!
That was good!
Now down with the glasses!
Cheers.
Cheers.
Attention!
Hello, my lovelies.
Take a seat.
I will join you in moments.
I'm just saying goodbye to my five new friends here.
No hurry, Frau von Hammersmark.
Take your time.
Enjoy yourself.
We'll be just over here waiting.
Eric, my love.
Those are the friends I've been waiting for.
Please treat them to anything they like.
Frau von Hammersmark.
Your wish is my command.
Officers it would appear the drinks are on the fräulein.
What would you like?
Whiskey.
Two whiskeys.
Three whiskeys.
Three whiskeys, very well.
I wish you a wonderful evening.
Same to you.
- I thank you.
Your card!
Yes, you're right.
Let's see.
Genghis Khan!
I would never have gotten that.
But of course you would have!
Hello, darling.
How are you?
So good to see you.
I thought this place was supposed to have more French than Germans?
Yes, normally that's true.
The Sergeant over there's wife just had a baby.
And his commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
We should leave.
No.
We should stay.
For one drink at least.
I've been waiting for you in a bar.
It would look strange if we left before we had a drink.
She's right.
Just be calm and enjoy your whiskey.
Mmm.
Mathilda...
She would love to play the game.
I will translate... and protect.
Don't worry, pretty little thing.
If any of these wolves gets out of line, I'll kick their ass in.
Watch.
Rip off his nose.
Stop it!
Schnapps, schnapps, take your schnapps in hand, comrades.
Before we go on playing we will drink.
We drink to our friend Wilhelm.
And his little boy Maximilian.
To Max!
- To Max!
There's some new development.
The cinema venue has changed.
Why?
No one knows but that should not be a real problem.
The cinema it's been changed to is considerably smaller than The Ritz.
So whatever explosives you brought for The Ritz should be doubly effective here.
Now the next piece of information is colossal.
Try not to overreact.
The Führer- ...I was just thinking could you sign an autograph to my son on his birthday?
Of course.
I'd love to, Wilhelm.
This handsome Staff Sergeant just became a father today.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Do you know the name of this progeny yet?
I most certainly do, fräulein.
His name is Maximilian.
Maximilian, wonderful name.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.
Max may not know who you are now but he will.
I will show him all of your movies.
Good.
He will grow up with your films and this napkin on his wall.
I propose a toast to the greatest actress in Germany!
There is no Dietrich!
There is no Riefenstahl!
Only Von Hammersmark!
Cheers!
- Cheers!
Cheers!
Once again-
Frau Hammersmark, what brings you to France?
None of your business!
Staff Sergeant.
You might not have worn out your welcome with the fräulein with your drunken boorish behavior, but you have worn out your welcome with me.
Might I remind you, Staff Sergeant, you are an enlisted man.
This is an officer's table!
I suggest you stop pestering the fräulein and rejoin your table.
Excuse me, Captain, but your accent is very unusual.
Where are you from?
You must be either completely drunk or mad to dare to speak to a superior officer with such impertinentness!
Staff Sergeant.
I'm making you and you responsible for him.
I suggest you take hold of your friend or he'll spend Max's first birthday in jail for public drunkenness.
Might I inquire?
Might I inquire?
Like our young newly christened father here I, too, have an acute ear for accents.
And like him I, too, find yours odd.
From where do you hail, Captain?
Major, this is highly-
I wasn't speaking to you, Lieutenant Munich.
Or you either, Lieutenant Frankfurt.
I was speaking to Captain l-don't-know-what.
I was born in a village that rests in the shadow of the Piz Palü.
The mountain?
Yes.
In that village, we all speak like this.
Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?
Yes.
Then you saw me.
You remember the skiing torch scene?
Yes.
In that scene was myself, my father, my sister and my two brothers.
My brother is so handsome the director Pabst, gave him a Close-Up.
Herr Major, if my word means anything I can vouch for everything the young captain has just said.
He does hail from the bottom of the Piz Palü.
He was in the film and his brother is far more handsome than he.
You should rejoin your friends.
May I join you?
By all means.
Wunderbar!
So that's the source of your bizarre accent.
That's extraordinary.
What are you doing here?
Aside from having a drink with the lovely fräulein?
Well, that pleasure requires no explanation.
I mean in country.
You're obviously not stationed in France or I'd know who you are.
You know every German in France?
Worth knowing.
Well, there lies the problem.
We never claimed to be worth knowing.
All levity aside, what are you doing in France?
Attending Minister Goebbels' film premiere as the fräulein's escort.
You are the Fräulein Hammersmark's escort.
Someone has to carry her lighter.
The captain is my date, but all three are my guests.
We are old friends who go back a long time.
Actually, longer than an actress would care to admit.
Well, in that case let me raise my glass to the three luckiest men in the room.
I'll drink to that.
Queen Christina.
Mata Hari.
I must say that game they're playing looks like a good bit of fun.
I didn't join them because you're quite right, Captain.
An officer should not fraternize with enlisted men.
But seeing as we are all officers and sophisticated lady friends of officers.
What say we play the game?
Yes, great, one game.
Wunderbar.
Soldiers the cards.
Thank you.
So gentlemen the object of the game is to write the name of a famous person on your card.
Real or fictitious, doesn't matter.
For instance, you could write, Confucius or Doctor Fu Manchu.
Eric!
More pens.
And they must be famous, not aunt Frida.
When you finish writing, put the card face down on the table.
And move it to the person on your right-
Thanks.
the person to your left moves his card to you.
You pick up the card without looking at it lick the back and stick it on your forehead.
Write!
Write.
I'll start, give you the idea.
Am I German?
No.
- No.
Am I American?
No.
- No.
Wait a minute, he goes to... -
Obviously, he wasn't born in America.
So...
I visited America, aye?
Yes.
Was this visit fortuitous?
Not for you.
My native land, is it what one would call, exotic?
Yes.
- Yes.
That could be either a reference to the jungle or the Orient.
I'm going to let my first instinct take over and ask.
Am I from the jungle?
Yes.
- Yes.
Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask whether you're real or fictitious.
I, however, think that's too easy, so I won't ask that yet.
Okay my native land is the jungle I visited America but my visit was not fortuitous to me but the implication is that it was to somebody else.
When I went from the jungle to America did I go by boat?
Yes.
- Yes.
Did I go against my will?
Yes.
- Yes.
On this boat ride, was I in chains?
Yes.
When I arrived in America, was I displayed in chains?
Yes.
- Yes.
Am I the story of the Negro in America?
No.
Well then I must be King Kong.
Bravo!
lmpressive.
Now, since I answered correctly, you all need to finish your drinks.
Cheers.
Now, who is next?
Well, Major I don't mean to be rude.
But the four of us are very good friends.
And we haven't seen each other in quite a while.
So, Major I am afraid you are intruding.
I beg to differ, Captain.
It's only if the fräulein considers my presence an intrusion that I become an intruder.
How about it, Fräulein von Hammersmark?
Am I intruding?
I didn't think so.
It's simply the captain is immune to my charms.
I am just joking.
Just joking.
Of course I'm intruding.
Allow me to refill your glasses, gentlemen, and I will bid you and the fräulein adieu.
Eric has a bottle of thirty-three-year-old whiskey.
From the Scottish Highlands.
What do you say, gentlemen?
You're most gracious, Major.
Eric!
The thirty-three.
And new glasses!
You don't want to contaminate the 33 with the swill you were drinking.
How many glasses?
Five.
Not for me.
I like scotch, scotch doesn't like me.
Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly.
Three glasses.
Frau von Hammersmark.
Thank you.
A thousand year German Reich!
A thousand year Reich!
- A thousand year Reich!
I must say I grow weary of these monkeyshines.
Did you hear that?
That was the sound of my Walther.
Pointed right at your testicles.
Why do you have your Walther pointed at my testicles?
Because you've just given yourself away, Captain.
You're no more German than that scotch.
Well, Major.
Shut up slut.
You were saying?
I was saying that makes two of us.
I've had a gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.
That makes three of us.
And at this range, I'm a real Fredrick Zoller.
Looks like we have a bit of a sticky situation here.
What's going to happen, Major you're going to stand up and walk out that door with us.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't think so.
I'm afraid you and I we both know, Captain no matter what happens to anybody else in this room the two of us aren't going anywhere.
Too bad about Sergeant Wilhelm and his famous friends.
If any of you expect to live, you'll have to shoot them too.
Looks like little Max will grow up an orphan.
How sad.
Well, if this is it, old boy,
I hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's.
By all means, Captain.
There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch.
Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily,
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
Now, about this pickle we find ourselves in.
It would appear there's only one thing left for you to do.
And what would that be?
Stiglitz.
Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls.
You outside.
Who are you?
British?
American?
What?
We're American.
What are you?
I'm a German, you idiot.
Speak English pretty good for a German.
I agree.
So let's talk.
Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
His name is Max.
We were in here drinking, celebrating.
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
It's not my fault!
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
No.
I'm alive!
Who's that?
Is the girl on your side?
Which girl?
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.
Yeah, she's ours.
Is she okay?
Wilhelm!
She's been shot.
But she's alive.
Okay, Wilhelm.
What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can I?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.
I've been rethinking my position in regards to your Paris premiere of "Nation's Pride."
As the weeks have gone on and the Americans are on the beach I do find myself thinking more and more about this Private Zoller.
This boy has done something tremendous for us.
And I'm beginning to think my participation in this event could be meaningful.
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-I-broke-my-leg- mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian.
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian.
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian.
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?
You've moved up in the world.
Look at you, Lieutenant First Class.
And with your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.
And that one's name is Wilhelm Wicki.
He's an Austrian-born Jew, who immigrated to the United States when things began turning sour for the Israelites.
They are the two German-born members of the Basterds.
They've been known to don German uniforms, to ambush squads.
What brings you all the way out here?
But that doesn't look like this.
This is odd.
It would appear somebody's missing.
Somebody fashionable.
Everybody out!
"To Max, with love."
Bridget von Hammersmark.
Remember... in English.
Yes.
Action.
But how do we get it developed?
Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop that footage.
And suppose someone would develop the footage how do we get a 35mm print with a soundtrack?
We find somebody who can develop and process a 35mm print with a soundtrack.
And we make them do it or we kill them.
Bring that fucker over here!
Put his head down on that table.
You either do what the fuck we tell you or I'll bury this axe in your collaborating skull.
I'm not a collaborator.
Marcel, do his wife and children know you?
Yes.
Then after we kill this dog for the Germans we'll go and silence them.
Jannings, come on, show the ring.
Come on, come on.
There you go!
Fredrick, have a look at it.
This is the highest artistic honor that I give.
Herr Doctor, I'm also feeling very honored.
- You deserve it, my dear Jannings!
But I believe after the premiere today, we have a new candidate.
Ah, Emmanuelle I'd like you to meet the greatest actor in the world Emil Jannings.
Mademoiselle, I'm pleased to meet you.
You have a beautiful cinema.
Thank you, Hermann.
Fräulein von Hammersmark.
Colonel Landa, it's been years.
Dashing as ever, I see.
So what's happened to your lovely leg?
A by-product of kicking ass in the German cinema, no doubt.
Save your flattery, you old dog.
I know too many of your former conquests to fall into that honey pot.
Seriously, what happened?
Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I might add at mountain climbing.
And this is the result.
Mountain climbing?
That's how you injured your leg - mountain climbing?
Believe it or not, yes it is.
Forgive me, fräulein.
I don't mean to laugh at your misfortune.
It's just... - mountain climbing?
I'm curious, fräulein, what could have ever compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor?
Well, I shan't be doing it again, I can tell you that.
That cast looks as fresh as my old Uncle Gustav.
When were you climbing this mountain, last night?
Very good eye, Colonel.
It happened yesterday morning.
And where in Paris is this mountain?
No, I'm just teasing you, fräulein.
You know me, I tease rough.
So, who are your three handsome escorts?
I'm afraid neither three speak a word of German.
They're friends of mine from Italy.
This is a wonderful Italian stuntman, Enzo Gorlomi.
A very talented cameraman, Antonio Margheriti.
And Antonio's camera assistant Dominick Decocco.
Gentlemen, this is an old friend, Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
Hello.
Gentlemen, it's a pleasure the friends of our cherished star, admired by all of us, this outright jewel of our culture are naturally going to be under my personal protection for the duration of their stay.
Thank you.
Gorlomi?
Am I saying it correctly?
Yes - 'er, correct.
Gorlomi.
Say it for me once please?
Gorlami.
I'm sorry, again?
Once more?
What's your name again?
Antonio Margheriti.
Again?
Margheriti.
One more time, but let me really hear the music in it!
Margheriti.
And you?
Dominick Decocco.
Well, my two cameraman friends need to find their seats.
Let me see your tickets.
I suppose you getting premiere tickets for your friends wouldn't be the most difficult thing for a star of your status.
0023 and 0024.
That shouldn't be too difficult to find, goodbye.
Ooh la la, Danielle Darrieux.
I have to go down and socialize with these Hun pigs.
Let's go over it again.
Reel one is on the first projector.
Reel two is on the second.
The third one is on the spool.
And the fourth one is ready to go.
Okay, the big sniper battle in the film begins around the middle of the third reel.
Our film comes in on the fourth reel.
Somewhere towards the end of the third reel go down and lock the doors of the auditorium.
Then take your place behind the screen and wait for my cue.
Then burn it down.
Take your seats.
The show is about to begin.
Everybody, please take your seats.
The show is about to begin.
We'll see you later.
Not so fast.
A glass of champagne to toast "Nation's Pride."
My fräulein, may I have a word with you in private?
Certainly.
Excuse us.
Have a seat, my fräulein.
May I?
Mademoiselle Mimieux allowed me to set up camp in her office for the time being.
Let me see your foot.
I beg your pardon?
Put your foot in my lap.
Hans, you embarrass me.
Could you please reach into the right pocket of my coat and give me what you find in there.
May I?
What's that American expression?
"If the shoe fits, you must wear it."
What now, Colonel?
The guy in the white smoking jacket.
Fucking shithead.
Faggot fuck.
Fuck you!
Bunch of shithead fuck.
Fuck you, too!
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches!
Get your hands off me.
You fucking bratwurst-smelling...
Goddamn you!
Get off!
Hmm.
Clever.
I informed the Führer that the audience has taken their seats.
He should arrive any minute.
Thank you, Hans.
You Jerry-banging, Limburg-smelling...
Let go.
As Stanley said to Livingstone,
Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?
Hans Landa.
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.
My hands to be exact.
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you.
Caught you flinching.
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.
Utivich?
Is that you, Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?
The woman?
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot." Yeah, I was just thinking that.
You may leave us.
But stay alert outside.
So you're Aldo the Apache.
So you're The Jew Hunter.
I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on Ice?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it?
"That's a bingo."
You just say, "Bingo."
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
Up there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999. 999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?
I implore you.
We must destroy that tower.
Sarge, that tower...
The tower stands!
Gum?
Psst!
Psst!
It's time.
I should go lock the auditorium and take my place behind the screen.
So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
I informed the Führer that the audience has taken their seats.
He should arrive any minute.
Thank you, Hans.
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.
Is that clear, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
Over and out.
Herr Dr, Goebbels, excuse me.
Could I go out for a moment?
Perfectly understandable, my boy.
You go now, and we'll see you after the show.
Who is it?
Fredrick!
Shit.
Are you the manager of this cinema?
I want my money back.
That actor in the movie stinks.
What are you doing here?
I came to visit you.
Can't you see how busy I am?
Then allow me to lend an assist.
Fredrick, it's not funny, you can't be here.
This is your premiere, you need to be out there with them.
Normally, you would be right.
And for all the other films I do I intend to endure evenings like tonight, in the proper spirit.
However, the fact remains this film is based on my military exploits.
And in this case, my exploits consisted of killing many men.
Consequently, the part of the film that's playing now I don't like watching this part.
I am sorry, Fredrick, but...
- So, I thought I'd come up here and do what I do best annoy you.
And from the look on your face, it would appear I haven't lost my touch.
Are you so used to the Nazis kissing your ass you've forgotten what the word "no" means?
No... you can't be here!
Now go away!
Fredrick, you hurt me.
Well, it's nice to know you can feel something.
Even if it's just physical pain.
I'm not a man you say, "go away" to.
There's over three hundred dead bodies in Italy, that if they could, would testify to that!
After what I've done for you you disrespect me at your peril!
Lock the door.
What?
Lock the door.
We don't have much time.
Time for what?
Forget it!
No, no, no... wait.
You want me to...
lock the door?
For the fifty-seventh time, yes.
When I kill that guy, you got 30 feet to get to that guard.
Can you do it?
I have to.
Champagne?
Extraordinary my dear, simply extraordinary!
This is your finest film yet.
Thank you, my Führer.
Thank you.
Who wants to send a message to Germany?
I have a message for Germany.
That you are all going to die.
Enough!
Stop it!
Turn off the projector!
And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who's going to do it!
I don't know what's going on.
That does not belong in my movie!
Marcel, burn it down.
Oui, Shosanna.
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face
of Jewish vengeance.
These are the American lines, Colonel sir.
Hermann, uncuff them.
I'm officially surrendering myself over to you, Lieutenant Raine.
We're your prisoners.
How about my knife?
Thank you very much, Colonel.
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back.
Is that really necessary?
I'm a slave to appearances.
Scalp Hermann.
Are you mad?
What have you done?
I made a deal with your general for that man's life!
Yeah, they made that deal.
But they don't give a fuck about him.
They need you.
You'll be shot for this!
Nah, I don't think so.
More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.
You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?
I'd make that deal.
I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command,
I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island,
I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know something, Utivich?
I think this just might be my masterpiece.
(DISTANT RUMBLING)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
(MEN SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am .
Are you aware of my existence?
Yes.
This is good .
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard .
I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile .
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing .
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite .
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation , there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel , would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
(CH UCKLES) Please , monsieur LaPadite , this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished .
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them .
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
Only rumors .
I love rumors !
Facts could be so misleading , where rumors, true or false, are often revealing .
So , monsieur LaPadite , what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
(CLEARS TH ROAT)
Again , this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain .
(MATCHSTlCKS SCRAPING)
So , the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
(AGREES IN FRENCH)
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
(CLEARS TH ROAT)
There were five of them .
The father, Jacob .
Wife, Miram .
And her brother, Bob .
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31 .
Continue .
And the children ,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
(SIGHS)
Amos was nine or 1 0 .
And Shosanna?
And Shosanna was
18 or 19 .
I'm not really sure.
Well , I guess that should do it.
(ZIPPER CLOSING)
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite , are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
(SIGHS)
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
(THAN KING IN FRENCH)
That they call you "The Jew H unter."
Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him .
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I , on the other hand , love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers ,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German .
(CHUCKLING) More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing .
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in .
It's a hostile world , indeed .
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would .
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread , a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
(AGREES IN FRENCH)
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail , they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel .
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel .
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them .
You don't really know why you don't like them .
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn , he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please , Herr Colonel , make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found , rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add , also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward .
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding .
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening , they don't speak English .
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
ls that clear?
(SN I FFLES)

ALDO:
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team , and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon .
Well , we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all , but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains , cross 5 , 000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating , mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed .
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform , they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man J im Bridger.
That means I got a little lndian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans .
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled , dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with .
Sound good?
ALL:
Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command , you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 1 00 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 1 00 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 1 00 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying !

Pleased to meet you .
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
Yes.
Then sit down .
How is your English , Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good .
Became American , got drafted , come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with .
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of H ugo Stiglitz.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
MALE NARRATOR:
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man , he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall , the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say , once the Basterds heard about him , he never got there.
(GASPING)
Sergeant H ugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis...
(MAN GROANING)
... I thinkyoushow great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
(BASTERDS WHOOPING)
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and , cousin , business is a-booming .
HIRSCHBERG :
(LAUGHING) Oh , yeah .
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you .
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard .
Besides you , we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again , you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them .
(SCOFFING)
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well , now, Werner, that's where you're wrong , because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees .
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held , how many is coming and what they brought to play with .
I respectfully refuse, sir.
(BATTAPPING)
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club .
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And , Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse,
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you .
And your Jew dogs.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
(BASTERDS APPLAU DING)
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.

Lieutenant Archie H icox reporting , sir.
General Ed Fenech .
At ease, H icox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap , will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid .
And your occupation before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well , sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published .
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G .W.
Pabst.
What should we drink to, sir?
Well ...
Down with H itier.
All the way down , sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes .
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon , sir?
Well , this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich .
Explain to me U FA under Goebbels .
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood .
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well , compared to, say, Louis B .
Mayer, how's he doing?
Quite well , actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B .
Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O .
Selznick.
Brief him .
Lieutenant H icox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino .
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film , sir?
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels , Goring , Bormann , and most of the German H igh Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo , as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino , blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth .
Jolly good , sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them .
Whole point of the Secret Service , old boy, you not hearing of them .
But the Jerries have heard of them , because these Yanks have been them the devil .
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you .
First thing , you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there .
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you , her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need .
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you .
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
Bridget von Hammersmark?
(CH UCKLING) The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild .
Indeed .
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was in a tavern .
It is a tavern .
Yeah , in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
N umber one being , you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous .
Stiglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful .
However, the off chance I'm wrong , things prove eventful ,
I need to know we can all remain calm .
I don't look calm to you?
(LAUGHS)
Well , now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
ls that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen , we need you to make damn sure no Germans , or French , for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised , the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress .
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans .

(THAN KING IN GERMAN)
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
Yes.
This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
Only rumors.
I love rumors!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31.
Continue.
And the children,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
Amos was nine or 10.
And Shosanna?
And Shosanna was
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
That they call you "The Jew Hunter."
Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
- Now
- My job dictates..... that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
Yes.
It's the girl.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5, 000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got a little Indian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!
Hey, Hirschberg.
Send that Kraut sarge over.
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
Yes.
Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse,
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
Donny!
Yeah?
Got us a German here who wants to die for country.
Oblige him.
Did you get that for killing Jews?
Bravery.
Yeah!
Oh, no!
- Oh, no!
Donny!
Yeah, Donny!
About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you.
Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park!
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!
He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street!
You!
Damn it, Hirschberg!
Donny, bring that other one over here.
Alive!
Get the fuck up!
Batter up.
You're on deck!
Two hits.
I hit you, you hit the ground.
English?
Wicki.
Ask him if he wants to live.
Tell him to point out on this map the German position.
Ask him how many Germans.
Around about 12.
What kind of artillery?
Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
He's going to hug his mother.
Well, ain't that nice?
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that.
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?
Practice.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
At that time, 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar.
Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle.
They're films, ain't they?
- Yes.
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.
Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper.
Shosanna has a collection of over 350 nitrate film prints.
Right this way, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
And your occupation before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
What should we drink to, sir?
Well...
Down with Hitler.
All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer, how's he doing?
Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film, sir?
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
Bridget von Hammersmark?
The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
Indeed.
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was in a tavern.
It is a tavern.
Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
Stiglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.
Mmm.
Well, if this is it, old boy,
I hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's.
By all means, Captain.
There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch.
Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily,
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
Now, about this pickle we find ourselves in.
It would appear there's only one thing left for you to do.
And what would that be?
Stiglitz.
Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls.
You outside.
Who are you?
British?
American?
What?
We're American.
What are you?
I'm a German, you idiot.
Speak English pretty good for a German.
I agree.
So let's talk.
Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
His name is Max.
We were in here drinking, celebrating.
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
It's not my fault!
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
No.
I'm alive!
Who's that?
Is the girl on your side?
Which girl?
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.
Yeah, she's ours.
Is she okay?
Wilhelm!
She's been shot.
But she's alive.
Okay, Wilhelm.
What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can I?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg- mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian.
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian.
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian.
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?
Yes.
Gorlomi?
Gorlomi.
Gorlomi.
Antonio Margheriti.
Margheriti.
Margheriti.
Dominick Decocco.
Dominick Decocco.
What's that American expression?
"If the shoe fits, you must wear it."
Fucking shithead.
Faggot fuck.
Fuck you!
Bunch of shithead fuck.
Fuck you, too!
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches!
Get your hands off me.
You fucking bratwurst-smelling...
Goddamn you!
Get off!
Hmm.
You Jerry-banging, Limburg-smelling......
As Stanley said to Livingstone,
Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?
Hans Landa.
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.
My hands to be exact.
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you.
Caught you flinching.
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.
Utivich?
Is that you, Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?
The woman?
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot."
- Yeah, I was just thinking that.
So you're Aldo the Apache.
So you're The Jew Hunter.
I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on Ice?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it?
"That's a bingo."
You just say, "Bingo."
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
Up there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999. 999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?
I implore you.
We must destroy that tower.
Sarge, that tower...
The tower stands!
Psst!
Psst!
So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.
Is that clear, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
Over and out.
When I kill that guy, you got 30 feet to get to that guard.
Can you do it?
I have to.
Champagne?
Who wants to send a message to Germany?
I have a message for Germany.
That you are all going to die.
And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who's going to do it!
Marcel, burn it down.
Oui, Shosanna.
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face
of Jewish vengeance.
Hermann, uncuff them.
I'm officially surrendering myself over to you, Lieutenant Raine.
We're your prisoners.
How about my knife?
Thank you very much, Colonel.
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back.
Is that really necessary?
I'm a slave to appearances.
Scalp Hermann.
Are you mad?
What have you done?
I made a deal with your general for that man's life!
Yeah, they made that deal.
But they don't give a fuck about him.
They need you.
You'll be shot for this!
Nah, I don't think so.
More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.
You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?
I'd make that deal.
I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command,
I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island,
I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know something, Utivich?
I think this just might be my masterpiece.
Subtitles by LeapinLar
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
Yes.
This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
(CHUCKLES) Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
Only rumors.
I love rumors!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31.
Continue.
And the children,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
Amos was nine or 10.
And Shosanna?
And Shosanna was
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
That they call you "The Jew H unter."
Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
(CHUCKLING) More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
Yes.
It's the girl.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
ALDO:
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5,000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man J im Bridger.
That means I got a little lndian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
ALL:
Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 1 00 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 1 00 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 1 00 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!
Hey, Hirschberg.
Send that Kraut sarge over.
HIRSCHBERG:
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
Yes.
Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of H ugo Stiglitz.
MALE NARRATOR:
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
Sergeant H ugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
HIRSCHBERG :
(LAUGHING) Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse,
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
Donny!
DON NY:
Yeah?
Got us a German here who wants to die for country.
Oblige him.
Did you get that for killing Jews?
Bravery.
Yeah!
BASTERD 1:
Oh, no!
BASTERD 2:
Oh, no!
Donny!
BASTERD:
Yeah, Donny!
About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you.
Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park!
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!
He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street!
You!
Damn it, Hirschberg!
Donny, bring that other one over here.
Alive!
Get the fuck up!
Batter up.
You're on deck!
Two hits.
I hit you, you hit the ground.
English?
ALDO:
Wicki.
Ask him if he wants to live.
Tell him to point out on this map the German position.
Ask him how many Germans.
Around about 12.
What kind of artillery?
Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
WICKI:
He's going to hug his mother.
Well, ain't that nice?
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
WICKI:
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that.
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?
Practice.
HANS:
Au revoir, Shosanna!
MALE NARRATOR:
At that time, 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar.
Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle.
They're films, ain't they?
Yes.
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.
MALE NARRATOR:
Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper.
Shosanna has a collection of over 350 nitrate film prints.
MAN:
Right this way, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Archie H icox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, H icox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
And your occupation before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
What should we drink to, sir?
Well...
Down with Hitler.
All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
GoebbeIs considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer, how's he doing?
Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant H icox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph GoebbeIs is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film, sir?
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German H igh Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
Bridget von Hammersmark?
(CHUCKLING) The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
Indeed.
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was in a tavern.
It is a tavern.
Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
N umber one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
Stiglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.
Well, if this is it, old boy,
I hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's.
By all means, Captain.
There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch.
Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily,
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
Now, about this pickle we find ourselves in.
It would appear there's only one thing left for you to do.
And what would that be?
Stiglitz.
Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls.
You outside.
Who are you?
British?
American?
What?
ALDO:
We're American.
What are you?
I'm a German, you idiot.
ALDO:
Speak English pretty good for a German.
I agree.
So let's talk.
Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
ln Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
His name is Max.
We were in here drinking, celebrating.
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
It's not my fault!
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
No.
I'm alive!
ALDO:
Who's that?
Is the girl on your side?
Which girl?
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.
Yeah, she's ours.
Is she okay?
Wilhelm!
She's been shot.
But she's alive.
ALDO:
Okay, Wilhelm.
What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can l?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant H icox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg- mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian..
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian..
So you mumble Italian.
and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian., so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian..
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?
Yes.
Gorlomi?
Gorlomi.
Gorlomi.
Antonio Margheriti.
Margheriti.
HANS:
Margheriti.
Dominick Decocco.
Dominick Decocco.
What's that American expression?
"If the shoe fits, you must wear it."
ALDO:
Fucking shithead.
Faggot fuck.
Fuck you!
Bunch of shithead fuck.
Fuck you, too!
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches!
Get your hands off me.
You fucking bratwurst-smelling...
Goddamn you!
Get off!
Hmm.
You Jerry-banging, Limburg-smelling...
As Stanley said to Livingstone,
Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?
Hans Landa.
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.
My hands to be exact.
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you.
Caught you flinching.
ALDO:
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.
Utivich?
Is that you, Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?
The woman?
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot." Yeah, I was just thinking that.
So you're Aldo the Apache.
So you're The Jew H unter.
I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew H unter?
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian. saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on lce?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, GoebbeIs will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing GoebbeIs and killing Goring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it?
"That's a bingo."
You just say, "Bingo."
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
Up there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999. 999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?
MAN:
I implore you.
We must destroy that tower.
Sarge, that tower...
MAN:
The tower stands!
Psst!
Psst!
HANS:
So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
GENERAL:
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.
Is that clear, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
Over and out.
When I kill that guy, you got 30 feet to get to that guard.
Can you do it?
I have to.
Champagne?
Who wants to send a message to Germany?
I have a message for Germany.
That you are all going to die.
And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who's going to do it!
Marcel, burn it down.
Oui, Shosanna.
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face
of Jewish vengeance.
HANS:
Hermann, uncuff them.
I'm officially surrendering myself over to you, Lieutenant Raine.
We're your prisoners.
How about my knife?
Thank you very much, Colonel.
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back.
Is that really necessary?
I'm a slave to appearances.
Scalp Hermann.
Are you mad?
What have you done?
I made a deal with your general for that man's life!
Yeah, they made that deal.
But they don't give a fuck about him.
They need you.
You'll be shot for this!
Nah, I don't think so.
More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.
You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?
I'd make that deal.
I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole H igh Command, I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island, I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know something, Utivich?
I think this just might be my masterpiece.
Chapter One
Once upon a time... in Nazi-occupied France
1941
(DISTANT RUMBLING)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Go back inside and shut the door.
Julie, get me some water for my wash up then get inside with your sisters.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Ready, Papa.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Thank you, my darling now you go inside with your sisters.
Don't run.
(MEN SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?
I am Perrier LaPadite.
It is a pleasure to meet you, Monsieur LaPadite I am Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
What can I do for you?
I was hoping you could invite me inside your home and we may have a discussion.
Certainly.
After you.
Colonel Landa, this is my family.
Colonel Hans Landa of the SS Mademoiselle at your service.
The rumors I have heard in the village about your family are all true.
Each one of your daughters is more lovely than the last.
Merci.
Please have a seat.
Suzanne, would you be so good as to get the Colonel some wine?
But no.
Merci beaucoup, Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine.
This being a dairy farm, one would be safe in assuming you have milk?
Oui.
Then milk is what I prefer.
Very well.
Julie, would you mind closing the window?
Merci.
Monsieur, to both your family and your cows I say, "Bravo."
Thank you.
Please join me at your table.
Very well.
Monsieur LaPadite what we have to discuss would be better discussed in private.
You'll notice I left my men outdoors.
If it wouldn't offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies to step outside?
You are right.
Charlotte, would you take the girls outside?
The Colonel and I need to have a few words.
Monsieur LaPadite I regret to inform you I've exhausted the extent of my French.
To continue to speak it so inadequately would only serve to embarrass me.
However, I've been led to believe you speak English quite well.
Yes.
Well, it just so happens, I do as well.
This being your house I ask your permission to switch to English for the remainder of the conversation.
By all means.
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
- Yes.
- This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
(CHUCKLES) Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
- Only rumors.
- I love rumors!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
(CLEARS THROAT)
Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
(MATCHSTICKS SCRAPING)
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
(AGREES IN FRENCH)
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
(CLEARS THROAT)
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31.
Continue.
And the children,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
(SIGHS)
Amos was nine or 10.
- And Shosanna?
- And Shosanna was
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
(ZIPPER CLOSING)
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
(SIGHS)
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
(THANKING IN FRENCH)
- That they call you "The Jew Hunter."
- Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
(CHUCKLING) More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
(AGREES IN FRENCH)
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels
- that you do with rats, do you?
- No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
(SNIFFLES)
Yes.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Monsieur LaPadite I thank you for the milk and your hospitality.
I do believe our business here is done.
Ah, ladies.
I thank you for your time.
We shan't be bothering your family any longer.
So, Monsieur Mademoiselle.
I bid farewell to you and say adieu.
(SHUSHING)
It's the girl.
(SOBBING)
(EXCLAIMS)
(PANTING)
Au revoir, Shosanna!
Chapter Two
INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
ALDO:
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5,000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got a little Indian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
- ALL:
Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!
(SHOUTING IN GERMAN)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
How much more of these Jew swine must I endure?
They butcher my men like they were flies!
Do you know the latest rumor they've conjured up in their fear-induced delirium?
The one that beats my boys with a bat!
The one they call "The Bear Jew" is a Golem!
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
My Führer, this is just soldiers' gossip.
No one really believes "The Bear Jew" is a Golem.
Why not?
They seem to be able to elude capture like an apparition.
They seem to be able to appear and disappear at will.
You want to prove they're flesh and blood?
Then bring them to me!
I will hang them naked, by their heels, from the Eiffel Tower!
And then throw their bodies in the sewers for the rats of Paris to feast!
(INTERCOM BUZZING)
Kliest!
(KLIEST SPEAKING GERMAN ON INTERCOM)
Yes, my Führer!
I have an order I want relayed to all German soldiers stationed in France.
The Jew degenerate known as "The Bear Jew,"
henceforth, is never to be referred to as The Bear Jew again.
(KLIEST SPEAKING GERMAN)
Yes, my Führer!
Do you still wish to see Private Butz?
Who and what is a Private Butz?
He's the soldier you wanted to see personally.
His squad was ambushed by Lt. Raine's Jews.
He was its only survivor.
Indeed, I do want to see him.
Thank you for reminding me.
Send him in.
(BUTZ SPEAKING GERMAN)
Sergeant Rachtmann, Ludwig and I were the only ones left alive after the ambush.
While one man guarded us, the rest removed the hair.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
Hey, Hirschberg.
Send that Kraut sarge over.
HIRSCHBERG:
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
- Yes.
- Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
MALE NARRATOR:
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
(GASPING)
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis,
(MAN GROANING)
I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
(BASTERDS WHOOPING)
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
HIRSCHBERG:
(LAUGHING) Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
(SCOFFING)
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
(BAT TAPPING)
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
- I heard of The Bear Jew.
- What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse, I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
(BASTERDS APPLAUDING)
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
Donny!
DONNY:
Yeah?
Got us a German here who wants to die for country.
Oblige him.
(BAT TAPPING)
(CONTINUES TAPPING)
(BASTERDS CHEERING)
Did you get that for killing Jews?
Bravery.
(BASTERDS EXCLAIMING)
Yeah!
BASTERD 1:
Oh, no!
BASTERD 2:
Oh, no!
Donny!
BASTERD:
Yeah, Donny!
About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you.
(LAUGHING)
Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park!
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!
He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street!
You!
Damn it, Hirschberg!
Donny, bring that other one over here.
Alive!
Get the fuck up!
Batter up.
You're on deck!
Two hits.
I hit you, you hit the ground.
English?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
ALDO:
Wicki.
Ask him if he wants to live.
(BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN)
Tell him to point out on this map the German position.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
Ask him how many Germans.
(BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN)
Around about 12.
What kind of artillery?
(BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
How did you survive this ordeal?
They let me go.
Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
You are not to tell anybody anything.
Not one word of detail!
Your outfit was ambushed, and you got away!
Not one word more!
Yes, my Führer.
Did they mark you like they did the other survivors?
Yes, my Führer.
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
I will hug my mother like I've never hugged her before.
WICKl:
He's going to hug his mother.
(SNIFFS)
Well, ain't that nice?
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
(WICKI SPEAKING GERMAN)
(BUTZ SPEAKING GERMAN)
Not only shall I remove it, but I intend to burn it.
WICKl:
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that.
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?
Practice.
Chapter Three
GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS 1944
JUNE
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
What starts tomorrow?
A Max Linder festival.
(EXCLAIMS)
I always preferred Linder to Chaplin.
Except Linder never made a film as good as "The Kid."
The chase climax of "The Kid," superb.
I adore your cinema very much.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Merci.
Is it yours?
Do I own it?
- Oui.
Oui.
How is it a girl as young as you owns a cinema?
My aunt left it to me.
Merci for hosting a German night.
I don't have a choice but you're welcome.
I love the Riefenstahl mountain films especially Piz Palü.
It's nice to see a French girl who's an admirer of Riefenstahl.
"Admire" would not really be the word I would use to describe my feelings towards Fräulein Riefenstahl.
But you do admire the director Pabst, don't you?
That's why you include his name on the marquee when you didn't have to.
I'm French.
We respect directors in our country.
Even Germans.
Even Germans, oui.
Merci for your assistance, soldier.
Adieu.
You're not finished.
I'll finish in the morning.
May I ask your name?
You wish to see my papers?
(LAUGHS)
Emmanuelle Mimieux.
That's a very pretty name.
Merci.
Are you finished with my papers?
Mademoiselle, may I introduce myself Fredrick Zoller.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Well it's been a pleasure chatting with a fellow cinema lover.
Sweet dreams, mademoiselle.
Adieu.
(SIGHS)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Hello, mademoiselle.
May I join you?
Look, Fredrick... (CHUCKLES EXCITEDLY)
You remember my name?
Yes.
Look, you seem a pleasant enough fellow...
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Regardless, I want you to stop pestering me.
I apologize, mademoiselle I wasn't trying to be a pest.
I was simply trying to be friendly.
I don't wish to be your friend.
Why not?
Don't act like an infant.
You know why.
I'm more than just a uniform.
Not to me.
If you are so desperate for a French girlfriend I suggest you try Vichy.
(EXHALES)
(SPEAKS FRENCH)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
(LAUGHING)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Who are you?
I thought I was just a uniform.
You're not just a German soldier.
Are you somebody's son?
Most German soldiers are somebody's son.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
(CLEARS THROAT)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
(LAUGHS EXCITEDLY)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
You're a very lucky girl, catching a brave war hero.
- No, no, no, no, the mademoiselle is not my girlfriend.
Can you write "Amour Babette"?
(BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
(OFFICER EXCLAIMS)
(OFFICERS CHATTERING)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

What did you do?

I was alone in a bell tower in a walled off city.
It was myself and a thousand rounds of ammo, in a bird's nest against three hundred enemy soldiers.
What's a bird's nest?
A bird's nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower.
It's a high structure, offering a three hundred and sixty degree view.
Very advantageous for marksmen.
How many did you kill?
Sixty-eight.
The first day.
A hundred and fifty the second day.
(EXHALES)
Thirty-two the third day.
On the fourth day they exited the city.
(CHUCKLES)
Naturally, my war story received a lot of attention in Germany that's why they all recognize me.
They call me the German Sergeant York.
Maybe they'll make a film about your exploits.
(LAUGHS)
Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels thought.
So he did and called it "Nation's Pride."
And they wanted me to play myself so I did.
Joseph thinks this movie will be proven to be his masterpiece.
And I will be the German Van Johnson.
"Nation's Pride" is about you?
"Nation's Pride" is starring you?
I know.
Comical?
Well, good luck with your movie, Private.
I hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself.
(SAYING GOODBYE IN FRENCH)
(DRIVER SPEAKING FRENCH)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Goodbye!
- Do you need help?
- No, it's okay.
If you need me, I'll be in the storage room.
Okay, my love.
(CAR APPROACHING)
(BRAKES SCREECH)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Mademoiselle Mimieux?
Yes?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Is this your cinema?
Yes.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Come down!
Please.
I don't understand.
What have I done?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
She wants to know what she's done.
Get your ass in that car.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
It's only the offspring of slaves that allows America to be competitive athletically.
American Olympic gold can be measured in Negro sweat.
(LAUGHING)
(GOEBBELS LAUGHING)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Good, you came.
I wasn't sure whether or not you'd accept my invitation.
Invitation?
(GOEBBELS SPEAKING GERMAN)
Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick?
Yes, it is, Dr. Goebbels.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Emmanuelle, there is somebody I want you to meet.
Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to introduce you to the minister of propaganda the leader of the entire German film industry and now that I'm an actor, my boss, Dr. Joseph Goebbels.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Your reputation precedes you, Fräulein Mimieux.
(FREDRICK LAUGHS)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
And normally, this is Herr Goebbels' French interpreter Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.
Hello.
(PANTING)
(BRAYING)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Hello.
And you've met the Major.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
Major Dieter Hellstrom of the Gestapo.
At your service, mademoiselle.
Please allow me have a seat, please.
Try the champagne, mademoiselle, it's quite good.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
I must say, Fräulein, I should be rather annoyed with you.
(TRANSLATING IN FRENCH)
I arrive in France and I wish to have lunch with my star.
(TRANSLATING IN FRENCH)
Little do I know he's become the toast of Paris.
And now he must find time for me.
(TRANSLATING IN FRENCH)
People wait in line hours, days to see me.
For the Führer and Private Zoller, I wait.
So finally, I'm granted an audience with the young Private.
(TRANSLATOR SPEAKING FRENCH)
And he spends the entire lunch speaking of you and your cinema.
So Fräulein Mimieux, let's get down to business.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
- Herr Minister Doctor Goebbels...
I haven't informed her yet.
Unless the girl's a simpleton, I'm sure she's figured it out by now.
After all, she does operate a cinema.
Francesca, tell her.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
What they are trying to tell you, Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has spent the last hour at lunch trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels to abandon previous plans for Private Zoller's film premiere and change the venue to your cinema.
(COUGHS)
What?
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
I wanted to inform her.
Shit!
I apologize, Private, of course you did.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
- What's the issue?
The Private wanted to inform the mademoiselle himself.
Nonsense!
Until I ask my questions, he has nothing to inform.
Let the record state, I have not agreed to switch cinemas for my premiere.
Duly noted.
You have opera boxes?
(TRANSLATOR SPEAKING FRENCH)
Yes.
How many?
Two.
(TRANSLATES IN GERMAN)
More would be better.
(GOEBBELS SPEAKING GERMAN)
How many seats in your auditorium?
Three hundred and fifty.
(TRANSLATING IN GERMAN)
(SCOFFS)
That's almost four hundred less than The Ritz.
- But Dr. Goebbels that's not such a terrible thing.
You said yourself you didn't want to indulge every two-faced French bourgeois taking up space, currying favor.
With less seats, it makes the event more exclusive.
You're not trying to fill the house, they're fighting for seats.
Besides, to hell with the French.
This is a German night, a German event, a German celebration.
This night is for you, me for the German military, the high command their family and friends.
The only people who should be allowed in the room are people who will be moved by the exploits on the screen.
I see your public speaking has improved.
It appears I've created a monster.
(CHUCKLES)
(LAUGHING)
A strangely persuasive monster.
When the war is over, politics await.
Well, Private though it is true, I'm inclined to indulge you anything...
I must watch a film in this young lady's cinema before I can say, yes or no.
So young lady, you are to close your cinema for a private screening tonight.
(TRANSLATING IN FRENCH)
What German films do you have?
Ah, Landa, you are here.
(FREDRICK SPEAKING FRENCH)
Emmanuelle, this is Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
He'll be running the security for the premiere.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Charmed, mademoiselle.
HANS:
Au revoir, Shosanna!
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
And now I must get the Reich Minister to his next appointment.
Slave driver.
French slave driver.
(LAUGHING)
(HANS SPEAKING GERMAN)
Actually, in my role as security chief of this joyous
German occasion, I'm afraid I must have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux.
(FREDRICK SPEAKING GERMAN)
What sort of discussion?
(HANS SPEAKING GERMAN)
That sounded suspiciously like a Private questioning the order of a Colonel.
Or am I just being sensitive?
(FREDRICK SPEAKING GERMAN)
Nothing could be further from the truth, Colonel.
Your authority is beyond question.
But your reputation does precede you.
Should Mademoiselle Mimieux or myself be concerned?
(GOEBBELS SPEAKING GERMAN)
Hans, the boy means no harm he's simply smitten.
And he's correct.
Your reputation does precede you.
(HANS SPEAKING GERMAN)
No need for concern, you two.
As security chief, I simply need to have a chat with the possible new venue's property owner.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Have you tried the strudel here?
No, no.
It's not so terrible.
(CHUCKLES)
So how is it the young Private and yourself came to be acquainted?
Yes, two strudels.
One for myself and one for the mademoiselle.
For me a cup of espresso and for the mademoiselle a glass of milk.
So, mademoiselle, you were beginning to explain...?
Up until a couple of days ago, I had no knowledge of Private Zoller or his exploits.
To me the Private was simply just a patron of my cinema.
We spoke a few times but...
- Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.
This is a simple formality.
No reason for you to feel anxious.
I apologize, I forgot to order the cream.
- One moment.
Wait for the cream.
So, Emmanuelle.
May I call you Emmanuelle?
Oui.
So, Emmanuelle explain to me how does it happen, that a young lady such as yourself, comes to own a cinema?
After you.
Verdict?
Like I said, not so terrible.
You were explaining the origin of your cinema ownership.
The cinema originally belonged to my aunt and uncle.
What are their names?
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
Where are they now?
My uncle was killed during Blitzkrieg.
Pity.
Continue.
Aunt Ada passed away from fever last spring.
Regrettable.
It's come to my attention you have a Negro in your employ.
Is that true?
Oui.
He is a Frenchman.
His name is Marcel.
He worked with my aunt and uncle since they opened the cinema.
He's the only other one who works with me.
Doing what?
Projectionist.
Is he any good?
The best.
Actually, one could see where that might be a good trade for them.
Can you operate the projectors?
Of course I can.
Knowing the Reich Minister as I do...
I'm quite positive he wouldn't want the success or failure of his illustrious evening dependent on the prowess of a Negro.
So if it comes to pass we hold this event at your venue talented no doubt, as your Negro may be you will operate the projectors.
Is that acceptable?
Oui.
Cigarette?
They are not French.
They are German.
I did have something else I wanted to ask you.
But right now, for the life of me, I can't remember what it is.
Oh, well, must not have been important.
'Til tonight.
(GASPING)
(GOEBBELS SPEAKING GERMAN)
I must say, I appreciate the modesty of this cinema.
Your cinema has real respect, almost church like.
Not to say we couldn't spruce the place up a bit.
Maybe I'll go to the Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes, and scatter them about the lobby.
(LAUGHS)
So, Emmanuelle, how did you like "Lucky Kids"?
(TRANSLATOR SPEAKING FRENCH)
(SHOSANNA SPEAKING FRENCH)
I quite like Lilian Harvey.
(GOEBBELS SPEAKING GERMAN)
Lilian Harvey!
Never mention that name again in my presence!
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Hey what the fuck are we supposed to do?
It looks like we're supposed to have a Nazi premiere.
Like I said, what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Well, I need to talk with you about that.
I'm confused, what are we talking about?
Filling the cinema with Nazis and burning it down to the ground.
I'm not talking about that.
You are talking about that.
No, we're talking about that, right now.
If we can keep this place from burning down by ourselves we can burn it down by ourselves?
Oui, Shosanna, we could do that.
And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate film print collection we wouldn't even need explosives would we?
(SCOFFS)
You mean we wouldn't need any more explosives?
MALE NARRATOR:
At that time, 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar.
Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle.
- They're films, ain't they?
- Yes.
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.
MALE NARRATOR:
Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper.
Shosanna has a collection of over 350 nitrate film prints.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
I am going to burn down the cinema on Nazi night.
And if I'm going to burn down the cinema which I am we both know, you're not going to let me do it by myself.
Because you love me.
And I love you.
And you're the only person on this earth I can trust.
But that's not all we're going to do.
Does the filmmaking equipment in the attic still work?
I know the film camera does.
How about the sound recorder?
Quite well, actually.
I recorded a new guitarist I met in a cafe last week.
It works superb.
Why do we need filmmaking equipment?
Because Marcel, my sweet we're going to make a film.
Just for the Nazis.
Chapter Four
OPERATION KINO
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
MAN:
Right this way, Lieutenant.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
- And your occupation before the war?
- I'm a film critic.
- List your accomplishments.
- Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a sub textual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
- What should we drink to, sir?
- Well...
- Down with Hitler.
- All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years,
- but I'm familiar with it.
- Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer,
- how's he doing?
- Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
- What film, sir?
- The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Göring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
- Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
- Bridget von Hammersmark?
(CHUCKLING) The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
- Indeed.
- Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
The village of Nadine
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
- I didn't know.
- You said it was in a tavern.
- It is a tavern.
- Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
- Stiglitz, right?
- That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
(LAUGHS)
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the death-trap rendezvous?
- She chose the spot.
- Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
- So, I'm male I'm a fictional, literary character from the past I'm American, and that's controversial.
No, it's not controversial at all.
The nationality of the author has nothing to do with the nationality of the character.
The character is the character.
Hamlet is not British.
He is Danish.
So yes, this character was born in America.
Well then.
(LAUGHING)
Mathilda.
Schnapps?
Schnapps?

Five schnapps, please.

If I had a wife would she be called a squaw?
Yes!
He's got it.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Three more questions!
Is my blood brother Old Shatterhand?
Yes!
Did Karl May write me?
Yes!
So who are you?
!
I am "Winnetou," chief of the Apaches!
Yes!
That was good!
That was good!
That was good!
Now down with the glasses!
Cheers.
(MAN LAUGHING)
(FEMALE SERGEANT SPEAKING GERMAN)
Attention!
(GLASS SHATTERING)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Hello, my lovelies.
Take a seat.
I will join you in moments.
I'm just saying goodbye to my five new friends here.
No hurry, Frau von Hammersmark.
Take your time.
Enjoy yourself.
We'll be just over here waiting.
(SPEAKING FRENCH AND GERMAN)
Eric, my love.
Those are the friends I've been waiting for.
Please treat them to anything they like.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Frau von Hammersmark.
Your wish is my command.
Officers it would appear the drinks are on the fräulein.
- What would you like?
- Whiskey.
Two whiskeys.
- Three whiskeys.
- Three whiskeys, very well.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
I wish you a wonderful evening.
- Same to you.
- I thank you.
Your card!
Yes, you're right.
Let's see.
Genghis Khan!
I would never have gotten that.
But of course you would have!
Hello, darling.
How are you?
So good to see you.
(PEOPLE LAUGHING)
(SPEAKING GERMAN SOFTLY)
I thought this place was supposed to have more French than Germans?
Yes, normally that's true.
The Sergeant over there's wife just had a baby.
And his commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
We should leave.
No.
We should stay.
For one drink at least.
I've been waiting for you in a bar.
(CORK POPPING)
It would look strange if we left before we had a drink.
She's right.
Just be calm and enjoy your whiskey.
Mmm.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Mathilda... (SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
She would love to play the game.
(ALL CHEERING)
I will translate... and protect.
Don't worry, pretty little thing.
If any of these wolves gets out of line, I'll kick their ass in.
Watch.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Rip off his nose.
Stop it!
Schnapps, schnapps, take your schnapps in hand, comrades.
Before we go on playing we will drink.
We drink to our friend Wilhelm.
And his little boy Maximilian.
(ALL TOASTING IN GERMAN)
- To Max!
- To Max!
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
There's some new development.
The cinema venue has changed.
Why?
No one knows but that should not be a real problem.
The cinema it's been changed to is considerably smaller than The Ritz.
So whatever explosives you brought for The Ritz should be doubly effective here.
Now the next piece of information is colossal.
Try not to overreact.
The Führer-
(STAMMERING)
(SPEAKING GERMAN) ...I was just thinking could you sign an autograph to my son on his birthday?
Of course.
I'd love to, Wilhelm.
This handsome Staff Sergeant just became a father today.
Congratulations.
(LAUGHING)
Thank you.
Do you know the name of this progeny yet?
I most certainly do, fräulein.
His name is Maximilian.
Maximilian, wonderful name.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.
(THANKING IN GERMAN)
Max may not know who you are now but he will.
I will show him all of your movies.
Good.
He will grow up with your films and this napkin on his wall.
I propose a toast to the greatest actress in Germany!
There is no Dietrich!
There is no Riefenstahl!
Only Von Hammersmark!
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Once again-
(EXHALING)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Frau Hammersmark, what brings you to France?
None of your business!
Staff Sergeant.
You might not have worn out your welcome with the fräulein with your drunken boorish behavior but you have worn out your welcome with me.
Might I remind you, Staff Sergeant, you are an enlisted man.
This is an officer's table!
I suggest you stop pestering the fräulein and rejoin your table.
Excuse me, Captain, but your accent is very unusual.
Where are you from?
You must be either completely drunk or mad to dare to speak to a superior officer with such impertinentness!
Staff Sergeant.
I'm making you and you responsible for him.
I suggest you take hold of your friend or he'll spend Max's first birthday in jail for public drunkenness.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
- Might I inquire?
(PHONOGRAPH CRACKLING)
Like our young newly christened father here I, too, have an acute ear for accents.
And like him I, too, find yours odd.
From where do you hail, Captain?
Major, this is highly- ...
- I wasn't speaking to you, Lieutenant Munich.
Or you either, Lieutenant Frankfurt.
I was speaking to Captain l-don't-know-what.
I was born in a village that rests in the shadow of the Piz Palü.
- The mountain?
- Yes.
In that village, we all speak like this.
Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?
- Yes.
- Then you saw me.
You remember the skiing torch scene?
Yes.
In that scene was myself, my father, my sister and my two brothers.
My brother is so handsome the director Pabst, gave him a Close-Up.
Herr Major, if my word means anything I can vouch for everything the young captain has just said.
He does hail from the bottom of the Piz Palü.
He was in the film and his brother is far more handsome than he.
(LAUGHING)
(ALL LAUGHING)
You should rejoin your friends.
May I join you?
By all means.
Wunderbar!
So that's the source of your bizarre accent.
That's extraordinary.
What are you doing here?
Aside from having a drink with the lovely fräulein?
Well, that pleasure requires no explanation.
I mean in country.
You're obviously not stationed in France or I'd know who you are.
You know every German in France?
Worth knowing.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Well, there lies the problem.
We never claimed to be worth knowing.
All levity aside, what are you doing in France?
Attending Minister Goebbels' film premiere as the fräulein's escort.
You are the Fräulein Hammersmark's escort.
Someone has to carry her lighter.
(CHUCKLING)
(LAUGHING)
The captain is my date, but all three are my guests.
We are old friends who go back a long time.
(SIGHS)
Actually, longer than an actress would care to admit.
Well, in that case let me raise my glass to the three luckiest men in the room.
I'll drink to that.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Queen Christina.
(HUMMING EXOTIC MELODY)
Mata Hari.
I must say that game they're playing looks like a good bit of fun.
I didn't join them because you're quite right, Captain.
An officer should not fraternize with enlisted men.
But seeing as we are all officers and sophisticated lady friends of officers.
What say we play the game?
Yes, great, one game.
Wunderbar.
Soldiers the cards.
Thank you.
So gentlemen the object of the game is to write the name of a famous person on your card.
Real or fictitious, doesn't matter.
For instance, you could write, Confucius or Doctor Fu Manchu.
Eric!
More pens.
And they must be famous, not aunt Frida.
When you finish writing, put the card face down on the table.
And move it to the person on your right-
- Thanks.
- The person to your left moves his card to you.
You pick up the card without looking at it lick the back and stick it on your forehead.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
(WHIP CRACKING)
(GRUNTS)
Write!
Write.
(VON HAMMERSMARK LAUGHING)
I'll start, give you the idea.
Am I German?
- No.
- No.
Am I American?
- No.
- No.
Wait a minute, he goes to... -
Obviously, he wasn't born in America.
So...
I visited America, aye?
Yes.
Was this visit fortuitous?
Not for you.
My native land, is it what one would call, exotic?
(VON HAMMERSMARK AND HICOX SPEAKING GERMAN)
- Yes.
- Yes.
That could be either a reference to the jungle or the Orient.
I'm going to let my first instinct take over and ask.
Am I from the jungle?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask whether you're real or fictitious.
I, however, think that's too easy, so I won't ask that yet.
Okay my native land is the jungle I visited America but my visit was not fortuitous to me but the implication is that it was to somebody else.
When I went from the jungle to America did I go by boat?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Did I go against my will?
- Yes.
- Yes.
On this boat ride, was I in chains?
Yes.
When I arrived in America, was I displayed in chains?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Am I the story of the Negro in America?
(HICOX SPEAKING GERMAN)
- No.
Well then I must be King Kong.
(LAUGHING)
Bravo!
Lmpressive.
Now, since I answered correctly, you all need to finish your drinks.
Cheers.
Now, who is next?
Well, Major I don't mean to be rude.
But the four of us are very good friends.
And we haven't seen each other in quite a while.
So, Major I am afraid you are intruding.
I beg to differ, Captain.
It's only if the fräulein considers my presence an intrusion that I become an intruder.
How about it, Fräulein von Hammersmark?
Am I intruding?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
I didn't think so.
It's simply the captain is immune to my charms.
(LAUGHING)
I am just joking.
Just joking.
Of course I'm intruding.
Allow me to refill your glasses, gentlemen, and I will bid you and the fräulein adieu.
Eric has a bottle of thirty-three-year-old whiskey.
From the Scottish Highlands.
What do you say, gentlemen?
You're most gracious, Major.
Eric!
The thirty-three.
And new glasses!
You don't want to contaminate the thirty-three with the swill you were drinking.
How many glasses?
- Five.
- Not for me.
I like scotch, scotch doesn't like me.
Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly.
Three glasses.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
(EXHALES)
(ERIC SPEAKING GERMAN)
Frau von Hammersmark.

I must say I grow weary of these monkeyshines.
Did you hear that?
That was the sound of my Walther.
Pointed right at your testicles.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Why do you have your Walther pointed at my testicles?
Because you've just given yourself away, Captain.
You're no more German than that scotch.
(BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN)
- Well, Major.
- Shut up slut.
You were saying?
I was saying that makes two of us.
I've had a gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.
That makes three of us.
And at this range, I'm a real Fredrick Zoller.
Looks like we have a bit of a sticky situation here.
What's going to happen, Major you're going to stand up and walk out that door with us.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't think so.
I'm afraid you and I we both know, Captain no matter what happens to anybody else in this room the two of us aren't going anywhere.
Too bad about Sergeant Wilhelm and his famous friends.
If any of you expect to live, you'll have to shoot them too.
Looks like little Max will grow up an orphan.
How sad.
Well, if this is it, old boy,
I hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's.
By all means, Captain.
There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch.
Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily,
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
Now, about this pickle we find ourselves in.
It would appear there's only one thing left for you to do.
And what would that be?
- Stiglitz.
- Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls.

You outside.
Who are you?
British?
American?
What?
ALDO:
We're American.
What are you?
I'm a German, you idiot.
ALDO:
Speak English pretty good for a German.
I agree.
So let's talk.
ALDO:
Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
His name is Max.
We were in here drinking, celebrating.
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
It's not my fault!
ALDO:
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
- No.
- I'm alive!
(SHOUTING IN GERMAN)
ALDO:
Who's that?
(GRUNTS)
Is the girl on your side?
ALDO:
Which girl?
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.
ALDO:
Yeah, she's ours.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
ALDO:
Is she okay?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
ALDO:
Wilhelm!
(SHOUTING IN GERMAN)
She's been shot.
But she's alive.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
ALDO:
Okay, Wilhelm.
What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
ALDO:
I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can I?
ALDO:
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
(SNIFFLES)
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
(BOTTLES CLATTERING)
(VON HAMMERSMARK GROANING)
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
(DOGS BARKING)
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
(EXCLAIMING)
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
(GROANS)
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
(GRUNTING)
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
(VON HAMMERSMARK BREATHING DEEPLY)
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
(DOGS BARKING)
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Führer is attending the premiere.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
I've been rethinking my position in regards to your Paris premiere of "Nation's Pride."
As the weeks have gone on and the Americans are on the beach I do find myself thinking more and more about this Private Zoller.
This boy has done something tremendous for us.
And I'm beginning to think my participation in this event could be meaningful.
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
(SNORTS)
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg-mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that rouge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian.
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian.
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian.
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
(CHUCKLES)
You've moved up in the world.
Look at you, Lieutenant First Class.
And with your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.
And that one's name is Wilhelm Wicki.
He's an Austrian-born Jew, who immigrated to the United States when things began turning sour for the Israelites.
They are the two German-born members of the Basterds.
They've been known to don German uniforms, to ambush squads.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
What brings you all the way out here?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
But that doesn't look like this.
This is odd.
It would appear somebody's missing.
Somebody fashionable.
Everybody out!

REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE
Night of "NATION'S PRIDE" premiere
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Remember... in English.
Yes.
Action.
But how do we get it developed?
Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop that footage.
And suppose someone would develop the footage how do we get a 35mm print with a soundtrack?
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
We find somebody who can develop and process a 35mm print with a soundtrack.
And we make them do it or we kill them.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Bring that fucker over here!
Put his head down on that table.
You either do what the fuck we tell you or I'll bury this ax in your collaborating skull.
(MAN SPEAKING FRENCH)
I'm not a collaborator.
Marcel, do his wife and children know you?
Yes.
Then after we kill this dog for the Germans we'll go and silence them.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Jannings, come on, show the ring.
Come on, come on.
There you go!
Fredrick, have a look at it.
This is the highest artistic honor that I give.
- Herr Doctor, I'm also feeling very honored.
- You deserve it, my dear Jannings!
But I believe after the premiere today, we have a new candidate.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Ah, Emmanuelle I'd like you to meet the greatest actor in the world Emil Jannings.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Mademoiselle, I'm pleased to meet you.
You have a beautiful cinema.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Thank you, Hermann.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Fräulein von Hammersmark.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Colonel Landa, it's been years.
Dashing as ever, I see.
So what's happened to your lovely leg?
A by-product of kicking ass in the German cinema, no doubt.
Save your flattery, you old dog.
I know too many of your former conquests to fall into that honey pot.
Seriously, what happened?
Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I might add at mountain climbing.
(LAUGHING)
And this is the result.
Mountain climbing?
That's how you injured your leg - mountain climbing?
Believe it or not, yes it is.
(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)
Forgive me, fräulein.
I don't mean to laugh at your misfortune.
It's just... - mountain climbing?
I'm curious, fräulein, what could have ever compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor?
Well, I shan't be doing it again, I can tell you that.
That cast looks as fresh as my old Uncle Gustav.
When were you climbing this mountain, last night?
Very good eye, Colonel.
It happened yesterday morning.
And where in Paris is this mountain?
No, I'm just teasing you, fräulein.
You know me, I tease rough.
So, who are your three handsome escorts?
I'm afraid neither three speak a word of German.
They're friends of mine from Italy.
This is a wonderful Italian stuntman, Enzo Gorlomi.
A very talented cameraman, Antonio Margheriti.
And Antonio's camera assistant Dominick Decocco.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
Gentlemen, this is an old friend, Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
Hello.
Gentlemen, it's a pleasure the friends of our cherished star, admired by all of us, this outright jewel of our culture are naturally going to be under my personal protection for the duration of their stay.
Thank you.
Gorlomi?
Am I saying it correctly?
Yes - 'er, correct.
Gorlomi?
Say it for me once please...?
Gorlomi.
I'm sorry, again...?
Gorlomi.
Once more...?
(SOFTLY) Gorlomi.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
What's your name again...?
Antonio Margheriti.
Again...?
Margheriti.
One more time, but let me really hear the music in it!
Margheriti.
HANS:
Margheriti.
And you...?
Dominick Decocco.

Well, my two cameraman friends need to find their seats.

And the fourth one is ready to go.
Okay, the big sniper battle in the film begins around the middle of the third reel.
Our film comes in on the fourth reel.
Somewhere towards the end of the third reel go down and lock the doors of the auditorium.
Then take your place behind the screen and wait for my cue.
Then burn it down.

The show is about to begin.

Hans Landa.
(TRUCK ENGINE STARTING)
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.
My hands to be exact.
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you.
Caught you flinching.
ALDO:
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.
ALDO:
Utivich?
UTIVICH:
Is that you, Lieutenant?
ALDO:
Yeah.
UTIVICH:
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?
- The woman?
- ALDO:
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot." Yeah, I was just thinking that.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
You may leave us.
But stay alert outside.
So you're Aldo the Apache.
- So you're The Jew Hunter.
- I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?
(SNORTS)
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on Ice?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Göring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Göring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
(EXCLAIMS)
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it? "That's a bingo."
You just say, "Bingo."
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
Up there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999.999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?

HANS:
So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
I informed the Führer that the audience has taken their seats.
He should arrive any minute.
Thank you, Hans.
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
GENERAL:
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.

Fredrick, it's not funny, you can't be here.
This is your premiere, you need to be out there with them.
Normally, you would be right.
And for all the other films I do I intend to endure evenings like tonight, in the proper spirit.
However, the fact remains this film is based on my military exploits.
And in this case, my exploits consisted of killing many men.
Consequently, the part of the film that's playing now I don't like watching this part.
- I am sorry, Fredrick, but...
- So, I thought I'd come up here and do what I do best annoy you.
And from the look on your face, it would appear I haven't lost my touch.
Are you so used to the Nazis kissing your ass you've forgotten what the word "no" means?
No... you can't be here!
Now go away!
Fredrick, you hurt me.
Well, it's nice to know you can feel something.
Even if it's just physical pain.
I'm not a man you say, "go away" to.

But they don't give a fuck about him.

You'll be shot for this!
Nah, I don't think so.
More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.
You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?
- I'd make that deal.
- I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command,
I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island,
I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
(HANS SCREAMING)
You know something, Utivich?
I think this just might be my masterpiece.
Chapter One
Once upon a time... in Nazi-occupied France
1941
(DISTANT RUMBLING)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Go back inside and shut the door.
Julie, get me some water for my wash up then get inside with your sisters.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Ready, Papa.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Thank you, my darling now you go inside with your sisters.
Don't run.
(MEN SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?
I am Perrier LaPadite.
It is a pleasure to meet you, Monsieur LaPadite I am Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
What can I do for you?
I was hoping you could invite me inside your home and we may have a discussion.
Certainly.
After you.
Colonel Landa, this is my family.
Colonel Hans Landa of the SS Mademoiselle at your service.
The rumors I have heard in the village about your family are all true.
Each one of your daughters is more lovely than the last.
Merci.
Please have a seat.
Suzanne, would you be so good as to get the Colonel some wine?
But no.
Merci beaucoup, Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine.
This being a dairy farm, one would be safe in assuming you have milk?
Oui.
Then milk is what I prefer.
Very well.
Julie, would you mind closing the window?
Merci.
Monsieur, to both your family and your cows I say, "Bravo."
Thank you.
Please join me at your table.
Very well.
Monsieur LaPadite what we have to discuss would be better discussed in private.
You'll notice I left my men outdoors.
If it wouldn't offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies to step outside?
You are right.
Charlotte, would you take the girls outside?
The Colonel and I need to have a few words.
Monsieur LaPadite I regret to inform you I've exhausted the extent of my French.
To continue to speak it so inadequately would only serve to embarrass me.
However, I've been led to believe you speak English quite well.
Yes.
Well, it just so happens, I do as well.
This being your house I ask your permission to switch to English for the remainder of the conversation.
By all means.
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
-Yes.
-This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard that the Fϋhrer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Fϋhrer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
(CHUCKLES) Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
-Only rumors.
-I love rumors!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
(CLEARS THROAT)
Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
(MATCHSTICKS SCRAPING)
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
(AGREES IN FRENCH)
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
(CLEARS THROAT)
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31 .
Continue.
And the children,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
(SIGHS)
Amos was nine or 1 0.
-And Shosanna?
-And Shosanna was
1 8 or 1 9.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
(ZIPPER CLOSING)
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
(SIGHS)
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
(THANKING IN FRENCH)
-That they call you "The Jew Hunter."
-Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
(CHUCKLING) More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Fϋhrer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
(AGREES IN FRENCH)
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels
-that you do with rats, do you?
-No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Fϋhrer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
(SNIFFLES)
Yes.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Monsieur LaPadite I thank you for the milk and your hospitality.
I do believe our business here is done.
Ah, ladies.
I thank you for your time.
We shan't be bothering your family any longer.
So, Monsieur Mademoiselle.
I bid farewell to you and say adieu.
(SHUSHING)
It's the girl.
(SOBBING)
(EXCLAIMS)
(PANTING)
Au revoir, Shosanna!
Chapter Two
INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
ALDO:
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5,000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got a little Indian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
-ALL:
Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 1 00 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 1 00 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 1 00 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!
(SHOUTING IN GERMAN)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
How much more of these Jew swine must I endure?
They butcher my men like they were flies!
Do you know the latest rumor they've conjured up in their fear-induced delirium?
The one that beats my boys with a bat!
The one they call "The Bear Jew" is a Golem!
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
My Fϋhrer, this is just soldiers' gossip.
No one really believes "The Bear Jew" is a Golem.
Why not?
They seem to be able to elude capture like an apparition.
They seem to be able to appear and disappear at will.
You want to prove they're flesh and blood?
Then bring them to me!
I will hang them naked, by their heels, from the Eiffel Tower!
And then throw their bodies in the sewers for the rats of Paris to feast!
(INTERCOM BUZZING)
Kliest!
(KLIEST SPEAKING GERMAN ON INTERCOM)
Yes, my Fϋhrer!
I have an order I want relayed to all German soldiers stationed in France.
The Jew degenerate known as "The Bear Jew,"
henceforth, is never to be referred to as The Bear Jew again.
(KLIEST SPEAKING GERMAN)
Yes, my Fϋhrer!
Do you still wish to see Private Butz?
Who and what is a Private Butz?
He's the soldier you wanted to see personally.
His squad was ambushed by Lt. Raine's Jews.
He was its only survivor.
Indeed, I do want to see him.
Thank you for reminding me.
Send him in.
(BUTZ speaking GERMAN)
Sergeant Rachtmann, Ludwig and I were the only ones left alive after the ambush.
While one man guarded us, the rest removed the hair.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
Hey, Hirschberg.
Send that Kraut sarge over.
HIRSCHBERG:
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
-Yes.
-Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
MALE NARRATOR:
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enIisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
(GASPING)
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis,
(MAN GROANING)
I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
(BASTERDS WHOOPING)
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
HIRSCHBERG:
(LAUGHING) Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
(SCOFFING)
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
(BAT TAPPING)
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard ofAldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
-I heard of The Bear Jew.
-What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse, I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
(BASTERDS APPLAUDING)
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
Donny!
DONNY:
Yeah?
Got us a German here who wants to die for country.
Oblige him.
(BAT TAPPING)
(CONTINUES TAPPING)
(BASTERDS CHEERING)
Did you get that for killing Jews?
Bravery.
(BASTERDS EXCLAIMING)
Yeah!
BASTERD 1 :
Oh, no!
BASTERD 2:
Oh, no!
Donny!
BASTERD:
Yeah, Donny!
About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you.
(LAUGHING)
Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park!
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!
He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street!
You!
Damn it, Hirschberg!
Donny, bring that other one over here.
Alive!
Get the fuck up!
Batter up.
You're on deck!
Two hits.
I hit you, you hit the ground.
English?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
ALDO:
Wicki.
Ask him if he wants to live.
(BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN)
Tell him to point out on this map the German position.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
Ask him how many Germans.
(BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN)
Around about 1 2.
What kind of artillery?
(BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
How did you survive this ordeal?
They let me go.
Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
You are not to tell anybody anything.
Not one word of detail!
Your outfit was ambushed, and you got away!
Not one word more!
Yes, my Fϋhrer.
Did they mark you like they did the other survivors?
Yes, my Fϋhrer.
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
I will hug my mother like I've never hugged her before.
WICKI:
He's going to hug his mother.
(SNIFFS)
Well, ain't that nice?
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
(WICKI SPEAKING GERMAN)
(BUTZ SPEAKING GERMAN)
Not only shall I remove it, but I intend to burn it.
WICKI:
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that.
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?
Practice.
Chapter Three
GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS 1 944
JUNE
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
What starts tomorrow?
A Max Linder festival.
(EXCLAIMS)
I always preferred Linder to Chaplin.
Except Linder never made a film as good as "The Kid."
The chase climax of "The Kid," superb.
I adore your cinema very much.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Merci.
Is it yours?
Do I own it?
-Oui.
Oui.
How is it a girl as young as you owns a cinema?
My aunt left it to me.
Merci for hosting a German night.
I don't have a choice but you're welcome.
I love the Riefenstahl mountain films especially Piz PaIϋ.
It's nice to see a French girl who's an admirer of Riefenstahl.
"Admire" would not really be the word I would use to describe my feelings towards Fräulein Riefenstahl.
But you do admire the director Pabst, don't you?
That's why you include his name on the marquee when you didn't have to.
I'm French.
We respect directors in our country.
Even Germans.
Even Germans, oui.
Merci for your assistance, soldier.
Adieu.
You're not finished.
I'll finish in the morning.
May I ask your name?
You wish to see my papers?
(LAUGHS)
Emmanuelle Mimieux.
That's a very pretty name.
Merci.
Are you finished with my papers?
Mademoiselle, may I introduce myself Fredrick Zoller.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Well it's been a pleasure chatting with a fellow cinema lover.
Sweet dreams, mademoiselle.
Adieu.
(SIGHS)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Hello, mademoiselle.
May I join you?
Look, Fredrick... (CHUCKLES EXCITEDLY)
You remember my name?
Yes.
Look, you seem a pleasant enough fellow...
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Regardless, I want you to stop pestering me.
I apologize, mademoiselle I wasn't trying to be a pest.
I was simply trying to be friendly.
I don't wish to be your friend.
Why not?
Don't act like an infant.
You know why.
I'm more than just a uniform.
Not to me.
If you are so desperate for a French girlfriend I suggest you try Vichy.
(EXHALES)
(SPEAKS FRENCH)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
(LAUGHING)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Who are you?
I thought I was just a uniform.
You're not just a German soldier.
Are you somebody's son?
Most German soldiers are somebody's son.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
(CLEARS THROAT)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
(LAUGHS EXCITEDLY)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
You're a very lucky girl, catching a brave war hero.
--No, no, no, no, the mademoiselle is not my girlfriend.
Can you write "Amour Babette"?
(BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
(OFFICER EXCLAIMS)
(OFFICERS CHATTERING)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
So you're a war hero.
What did you do?
(CLEARS THROAT)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
I was alone in a bell tower in a walled off city.
It was myself and a thousand rounds of ammo, in a bird's nest against three hundred enemy soldiers.
What's a bird's nest?
A bird's nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower.
It's a high structure, offering a three hundred and sixty degree view.
Very advantageous for marksmen.
How many did you kill?
Sixty-eight.
The first day.
A hundred and fifty the second day.
(EXHALES)
Thirty-two the third day.
On the fourth day they exited the city.
(CHUCKLES)
Naturally, my war story received a lot of attention in Germany that's why they all recognize me.
They call me the German Sergeant York.
Maybe they'll make a film about your exploits.
(LAUGHS)
Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels thought.
So he did and called it "Nation's Pride."
And they wanted me to play myself so I did.
Joseph thinks this movie will be proven to be his masterpiece.
And I will be the German Van Johnson.
"Nation's Pride" is about you?
"Nation's Pride" is starring you?
I know.
Comical?
Well, good luck with your movie, Private.
I hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself.
(SAYING GOODBYE IN FRENCH)
(DRIVER SPEAKING FRENCH)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Goodbye!
-Do you need help?
-No, it's okay.
If you need me, I'll be in the storage room.
Okay, my love.
(CAR APPROACHING)
(BRAKES SCREECH)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Mademoiselle Mimieux?
Yes?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Is this your cinema?
Yes.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Come down!
Please.
I don't understand.
What have I done?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
She wants to know what she's done.
Get your ass in that car.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
It's only the offspring of slaves that allows America to be competitive athletically.
American Olympic gold can be measured in Negro sweat.
(LAUGHING)
(GOEBBELS LAUGHING)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Good, you came.
I wasn't sure whether or not you'd accept my invitation.
Invitation?
(GOEBBELS SPEAKING GERMAN)
Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick?
Yes, it is, Dr. Goebbels.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Emmanuelle, there is somebody I want you to meet.
Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to introduce you to the minister of propaganda the leader of the entire German film industry and now that I'm an actor, my boss, Dr. Joseph Goebbels.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Your reputation precedes you, Fräulein Mimieux.
(FREDRICK LAUGHS)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
And normally, this is Herr Goebbels' French interpreter Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.
Hello.
(PANTING)
(BRAYING)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Hello.
And you've met the Major.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
Major Dieter Hellstrom of the Gestapo.
At your service, mademoiselle.
Please allow me have a seat, please.
Try the champagne, mademoiselle, it's quite good.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
I must say, Fräulein, I should be rather annoyed with you.
(TRANSLATING IN FRENCH)
I arrive in France and I wish to have lunch with my star.
(TRANSLATING IN FRENCH)
Little do I know he's become the toast of Paris.
And now he must find time for me.
(TRANSLATING IN FRENCH)
People wait in line hours, days to see me.
For the Fϋhrer and Private Zoller, I wait.
So finally, I'm granted an audience with the young Private.
(TRANSLATOR SPEAKING FRENCH)
And he spends the entire lunch speaking of you and your cinema.
So Fräulein Mimieux, let's get down to business.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
--Herr Minister Doctor Goebbels...
I haven't informed her yet.
Unless the girl's a simpleton, I'm sure she's figured it out by now.
After all, she does operate a cinema.
Francesca, tell her.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
What they are trying to tell you, Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has spent the last hour at lunch trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels to abandon previous plans for Private Zoller's film premiere and change the venue to your cinema.
(COUGHS)
What?
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
I wanted to inform her.
Shit!
I apologize, Private, of course you did.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
--What's the issue?
The Private wanted to inform the mademoiselle himself.
Nonsense!
Until I ask my questions, he has nothing to inform.
Let the record state, I have not agreed to switch cinemas for my premiere.
Duly noted.
You have opera boxes?
(TRANSLATOR SPEAKING FRENCH)
Yes.
How many?
Two.
(TRANSLATES IN GERMAN)
More would be better.
(GOEBBELS SPEAKING GERMAN)
How many seats in your auditorium?
Three hundred and fifty.
(TRANSLATING IN GERMAN)
(SCOFFS)
That's almost four hundred less than The Ritz.
--But Dr. Goebbels that's not such a terrible thing.
You said yourself you didn't want to indulge every two-faced French bourgeois taking up space, currying favor.
With less seats, it makes the event more exclusive.
You're not trying to fill the house, they're fighting for seats.
Besides, to hell with the French.
This is a German night, a German event, a German celebration.
This night is for you, me for the German military, the high command their family and friends.
The only people who should be allowed in the room are people who will be moved by the exploits on the screen.
I see your public speaking has improved.
It appears I've created a monster.
(CHUCKLES)
(LAUGHING)
A strangely persuasive monster.
When the war is over, politics await.
Well, Private though it is true, I'm inclined to indulge you anything...
I must watch a film in this young lady's cinema before I can say, yes or no.
So young lady, you are to close your cinema for a private screening tonight.
(TRANSLATING IN FRENCH)
What German films do you have?
Ah, Landa, you are here.
(FREDRICK SPEAKING FRENCH)
Emmanuelle, this is Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
He'll be running the security for the premiere.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Charmed, mademoiselle.
HANS:
Au revoir, Shosanna!
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
And now I must get the Reich Minister to his next appointment.
Slave driver.
French slave driver.
(LAUGHING)
(HANS SPEAKING GERMAN)
Actually, in my role as security chief of this joyous
German occasion, I'm afraid I must have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux.
(FREDRICK SPEAKING GERMAN)
What sort of discussion?
(HANS SPEAKING GERMAN)
That sounded suspiciously like a Private questioning the order of a Colonel.
Or am I just being sensitive?
(FREDRICK SPEAKING GERMAN)
Nothing could be further from the truth, Colonel.
Your authority is beyond question.
But your reputation does precede you.
Should Mademoiselle Mimieux or myself be concerned?
(GOEBBELS SPEAKING GERMAN)
Hans, the boy means no harm he's simply smitten.
And he's correct.
Your reputation does precede you.
(HANS SPEAKING GERMAN)
No need for concern, you two.
As security chief, I simply need to have a chat with the possible new venue's property owner.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Have you tried the strudel here?
No, no.
It's not so terrible.
(CHUCKLES)
So how is it the young Private and yourself came to be acquainted?
Yes, two strudels.
One for myself and one for the mademoiselle.
For me a cup of espresso and for the mademoiselle a glass of milk.
So, mademoiselle, you were beginning to explain...?
Up until a couple of days ago, I had no knowledge of Private Zoller or his exploits.
To me the Private was simply just a patron of my cinema.
We spoke a few times but- -Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.
This is a simple formality.
No reason for you to feel anxious.
I apologize, I forgot to order the cream.
--One moment.
Wait for the cream.
So, Emmanuelle.
May I call you Emmanuelle?
Oui.
So, Emmanuelle explain to me how does it happen, that a young lady such as yourself, comes to own a cinema?
After you.
Verdict?
Like I said, not so terrible.
You were explaining the origin of your cinema ownership.
The cinema originally belonged to my aunt and uncle.
What are their names?
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
Where are they now?
My uncle was killed during Blitzkrieg.
Pity.
Continue.
Aunt Ada passed away from fever last spring.
Regrettable.
It's come to my attention you have a Negro in your employ.
Is that true?
Oui.
He is a Frenchman.
His name is Marcel.
He worked with my aunt and uncle since they opened the cinema.
He's the only other one who works with me.
Doing what?
Projectionist.
Is he any good?
The best.
Actually, one could see where that might be a good trade for them.
Can you operate the projectors?
Of course I can.
Knowing the Reich Minister as I do...
I'm quite positive he wouldn't want the success or failure of his illustrious evening dependent on the prowess of a Negro.
So if it comes to pass we hold this event at your venue talented no doubt, as your Negro may be you will operate the projectors.
Is that acceptable?
Oui.
Cigarette?
They are not French.
They are German.
I did have something else I wanted to ask you.
But right now, for the life of me, I can't remember what it is.
Oh, well, must not have been important.
'Til tonight.
(GASPING)
(GOEBBELS SPEAKING GERMAN)
I must say, I appreciate the modesty of this cinema.
Your cinema has real respect, almost church like.
Not to say we couldn't spruce the place up a bit.
Maybe I'll go to the Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes, and scatter them about the lobby.
(LAUGHS)
So, Emmanuelle, how did you like "Lucky Kids"?
(TRANSLATOR SPEAKING FRENCH)
(SHOSANNA SPEAKING FRENCH)
I quite like Lilian Harvey.
(GOEBBELS SPEAKING GERMAN)
Lilian Harvey!
Never mention that name again in my presence!
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Hey what the fuck are we supposed to do?
It looks like we're supposed to have a Nazi premiere.
Like I said, what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Well, I need to talk with you about that.
I'm confused, what are we talking about?
Filling the cinema with Nazis and burning it down to the ground.
I'm not talking about that.
You are talking about that.
No, we're talking about that, right now.
If we can keep this place from burning down by ourselves we can burn it down by ourselves?
Oui, Shosanna, we could do that.
And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate film print collection we wouldn't even need explosives would we?
(SCOFFS)
You mean we wouldn't need any more explosives?
MALE NARRATOR:
At that time, 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar.
Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle.
-They're films, ain't they?
-Yes.
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.
MALE NARRATOR:
Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper.
Shosanna has a collection of over 350 nitrate film prints.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
I am going to burn down the cinema on Nazi night.
And if I'm going to burn down the cinema which I am we both know, you're not going to let me do it by myself.
Because you love me.
And I love you.
And you're the only person on this earth I can trust.
But that's not all we're going to do.
Does the filmmaking equipment in the attic still work?
I know the film camera does.
How about the sound recorder?
Quite well, actually.
I recorded a new guitarist I met in a cafe last week.
It works superb.
Why do we need filmmaking equipment?
Because Marcel, my sweet we're going to make a film.
Just for the Nazis.
Chapter Four
OPERATION KINO
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
MAN:
Right this way, Lieutenant.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
-And your occupation before the war?
-I'm a film critic.
-List your accomplishments.
-Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called films and filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a sub textual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
-What should we drink to, sir?
-Well...
-Down with Hitler.
-All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years,
-but I'm familiar with it.
-Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer,
-how's he doing?
-Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
-What film, sir?
-The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Göring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
-Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
-Bridget von Hammersmark?
(CHUCKLING) The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
-Indeed.
-Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
The village of Nadine
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
-I didn't know.
-You said it was in a tavern.
-It is a tavern.
-Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
-Stiglitz, right?
-That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
(LAUGHS)
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the death-trap rendezvous?
-She chose the spot.
-Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
--So, I'm male I'm a fictional, literary character from the past I'm American, and that's controversial.
No, it's not controversial at all.
The nationality of the author has nothing to do with the nationality of the character.
The character is the character.
Hamlet is not British.
He is Danish.
So yes, this character was born in America.
Well then.
(LAUGHING)
Mathilda.
Schnapps?
Schnapps?
Schnapps...
Schnapps...
Schnapps.
(ORDERING IN GERMAN AND FRENCH)
Five schnapps, please.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
If I had a wife would she be called a squaw?
Yes!
He's got it.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Three more questions!
Is my blood brother Old Shatterhand?
Yes!
Did Karl May write me?
Yes!
So who are you?
!
I am "Winnetou," chief of the Apaches!
Yes!
That was good!
That was good!
That was good!
Now down with the glasses!
Cheers.
(MAN LAUGHING)
(FEMALE SERGEANT SPEAKING GERMAN)
Attention!
(GLASS SHATTERING)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Hello, my lovelies.
Take a seat.
I will join you in moments.
I'm just saying goodbye to my five new friends here.
No hurry, Frau von Hammersmark.
Take your time.
Enjoy yourself.
We'll be just over here waiting.
(SPEAKING FRENCH AND GERMAN)
Eric, my love.
Those are the friends I've been waiting for.
Please treat them to anything they like.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Frau von Hammersmark.
Your wish is my command.
Officers it would appear the drinks are on the fräulein.
-What would you like?
-Whiskey.
Two whiskeys.
-Three whiskeys.
-Three whiskeys, very well.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
I wish you a wonderful evening.
-Same to you.
-I thank you.
Your card!
Yes, you're right.
Let's see.
Genghis Khan!
I would never have gotten that.
But of course you would have!
Hello, darling.
How are you?
So good to see you.
(PEOPLE LAUGHING)
(SPEAKING GERMAN SOFTLY)
I thought this place was supposed to have more French than Germans?
Yes, normally that's true.
The Sergeant over there's wife just had a baby.
And his commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
We should leave.
No.
We should stay.
For one drink at least.
I've been waiting for you in a bar.
(CORK POPPING)
It would look strange if we left before we had a drink.
She's right.
Just be calm and enjoy your whiskey.
Mmm.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Mathilda... (SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
She would love to play the game.
(ALL CHEERING)
I will translate...and protect.
Don't worry, pretty little thing.
If any of these wolves gets out of line, I'll kick their ass in.
Watch.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Rip off his nose.
Stop it!
Schnapps, schnapps, take your schnapps in hand, comrades.
Before we go on playing we will drink.
We drink to our friend Wilhelm.
And his little boy Maximilian.
(ALL TOASTING IN GERMAN)
-To Max!
-To Max!
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
There's some new development.
The cinema venue has changed.
Why?
No one knows but that should not be a real problem.
The cinema it's been changed to is considerably smaller than The Ritz.
So whatever explosives you brought for The Ritz should be doubly effective here.
Now the next piece of information is colossal.
Try not to overreact.
The Fϋhrer-
(STAMMERING)
(SPEAKING GERMAN) ...I was just thinking could you sign an autograph to my son on his birthday?
Of course.
I'd love to, Wilhelm.
This handsome Staff Sergeant just became a father today.
Congratulations.
(LAUGHING)
Thank you.
Do you know the name of this progeny yet?
I most certainly do, fräulein.
His name is Maximilian.
Maximilian, wonderful name.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.
(THANKING IN GERMAN)
Max may not know who you are now but he will.
I will show him all of your movies.
Good.
He will grow up with your films and this napkin on his wall.
I propose a toast to the greatest actress in Germany!
There is no Dietrich!
There is no Riefenstahl!
Only Von Hammersmark!
-Cheers!
-Cheers!
-Cheers!
Once again-
(EXHALING)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Frau Hammersmark, what brings you to France?
None of your business!
Staff Sergeant.
You might not have worn out your welcome with the fräulein with your drunken boorish behavior but you have worn out your welcome with me.
Might I remind you, Staff Sergeant, you are an enlisted man.
This is an officer's table!
I suggest you stop pestering the fräulein and rejoin your table.
Excuse me, Captain, but your accent is very unusual.
Where are you from?
You must be either completely drunk or mad to dare to speak to a superior officer with such impertinentness!
Staff Sergeant.
I'm making you and you responsible for him.
I suggest you take hold of your friend or he'll spend Max's first birthday in jail for public drunkenness.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
--Might I inquire?
(PHONOGRAPH CRACKLING)
Like our young newly christened father here I, too, have an acute ear for accents.
And like him I, too, find yours odd.
From where do you hail, Captain?
Major, this is highly --I wasn't speaking to you, Lieutenant Munich.
Or you either, Lieutenant Frankfurt.
I was speaking to Captain I-don't-know-what.
I was born in a village that rests in the shadow of the Piz Palϋ.
-The mountain?
-Yes.
In that village, we all speak like this.
Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?
-Yes.
-Then you saw me.
You remember the skiing torch scene?
Yes.
In that scene was myself, my father, my sister and my two brothers.
My brother is so handsome the director Pabst, gave him a Close-Up.
Herr Major, if my word means anything I can vouch for everything the young captain has just said.
He does hail from the bottom of the Piz Palϋ.
He was in the film and his brother is far more handsome than he.
(LAUGHING)
(ALL LAUGHING)
You should rejoin your friends.
May I join you?
By all means.
Wunderbar!
So that's the source of your bizarre accent.
That's extraordinary.
What are you doing here?
Aside from having a drink with the lovely fräulein?
Well, that pleasure requires no explanation.
I mean in country.
You're obviously not stationed in France or I'd know who you are.
You know every German in France?
Worth knowing.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Well, there lies the problem.
We never claimed to be worth knowing.
All levity aside, what are you doing in France?
Attending Minister Goebbels' film premiere as the fräulein's escort.
You are the Fräulein Hammersmark's escort.
Someone has to carry her lighter.
(CHUCKLING)
(LAUGHING)
The captain is my date, but all three are my guests.
We are old friends who go back a long time.
(SIGHS)
Actually, longer than an actress would care to admit.
Well, in that case let me raise my glass to the three luckiest men in the room.
I'll drink to that.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Queen Christina.
(HUMMING EXOTIC MELODY)
Mata Hari.
I must say that game they're playing looks like a good bit of fun.
I didn't join them because you're quite right, Captain.
An officer should not fraternize with enlisted men.
But seeing as we are all officers and sophisticated lady friends of officers.
What say we play the game?
Yes, great, one game.
Wunderbar.
Soldiers the cards.
Thank you.
So gentlemen the object of the game is to write the name of a famous person on your card.
Real or fictitious, doesn't matter.
For instance, you could write, Confucius or Doctor Fu Manchu.
Eric!
More pens.
And they must be famous, not aunt Frida.
When you finish writing, put the card face down on the table.
And move it to the person on your right -Thanks.
-the person to your left moves his card to you.
You pick up the card without looking at it lick the back and stick it on your forehead.
(ROCK music playing)
(whip cracking)
(GRUNTS)
Write!
Write.
(VON HAMMERSMARK LAUGHING)
I'll start, give you the idea.
Am I German?
-No.
-No.
Am I American?
-No.
-No.
Wait a minute, he goes to ---
Obviously, he wasn't born in America.
So...
I visited America, aye?
Yes.
Was this visit fortuitous?
Not for you.
My native land, is it what one would call, exotic?
(VON HAMMERSMARK AND HICOX SPEAKING GERMAN)
-Yes.
-Yes.
That could be either a reference to the jungle or the Orient.
I'm going to let my first instinct take over and ask.
Am I from the jungle?
-Yes.
-Yes.
Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask whether you're real or fictitious.
I, however, think that's too easy, so I won't ask that yet.
Okay my native land is the jungle I visited America but my visit was not fortuitous to me but the implication is that it was to somebody else.
When I went from the jungle to America did I go by boat?
-Yes.
-Yes.
Did I go against my will?
-Yes.
-Yes.
On this boat ride, was I in chains?
Yes.
When I arrived in America, was I displayed in chains?
-Yes.
-Yes.
Am I the story of the Negro in America?
(HICOX SPEAKING GERMAN)
-No.
Well then I must be King Kong.
(LAUGHING)
Bravo!
Impressive.
Now, since I answered correctly, you all need to finish your drinks.
Cheers.
Now, who is next?
Well, Major I don't mean to be rude.
But the four of us are very good friends.
And we haven't seen each other in quite a while.
So, Major I am afraid you are intruding.
I beg to differ, Captain.
It's only if the fräuIein considers my presence an intrusion that I become an intruder.
How about it, Fräulein von Hammersmark?
Am I intruding?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
I didn't think so.
It's simply the captain is immune to my charms.
(LAUGHING)
I am just joking.
Just joking.
Of course I'm intruding.
Allow me to refill your glasses, gentlemen, and I will bid you and the fräulein adieu.
Eric has a bottle of thirty-three-year-old whiskey.
From the Scottish Highlands.
What do you say, gentlemen?
You're most gracious, Major.
Eric!
The thirty-three.
And new glasses!
You don't want to contaminate the thirty-three with the swill you were drinking.
How many glasses?
-Five.
-Not for me.
I like scotch, scotch doesn't like me.
Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly.
Three glasses.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
(EXHALES)
(ERIC SPEAKING GERMAN)
Frau von Hammersmark.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Thank you.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
A thousand year German Reich!
-A thousand year Reich!
-A thousand year Reich!
(EXCLAIMS)
I must say I grow weary of these monkeyshines.
Did you hear that?
That was the sound of my Walther.
Pointed right at your testicles.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Why do you have your Walther pointed at my testicles?
Because you've just given yourself away, Captain.
You're no more German than that scotch.
(BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN)
-Well, Major.
-Shut up slut.
You were saying?
I was saying that makes two of us.
I've had a gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.
That makes three of us.
And at this range, I'm a real Fredrick Zoller.
Looks like we have a bit of a sticky situation here.
What's going to happen, Major you're going to stand up and walk out that door with us.
--No, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't think so.
I'm afraid you and I we both know, Captain no matter what happens to anybody else in this room the two of us aren't going anywhere.
Too bad about Sergeant Wilhelm and his famous friends.
If any of you expect to live, you'll have to shoot them too.
Looks like little Max will grow up an orphan.
How sad.
Well, if this is it, old boy,
I hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's.
By all means, Captain.
There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch.
Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily,
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
Now, about this pickle we find ourselves in.
It would appear there's only one thing left for you to do.
And what would that be?
-Stiglitz.
-Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls.
(SCREAMING)
(PANTING)
(DOOR OPENING)
(GUN COCKING)
You outside.
Who are you?
British?
American?
What?
ALDO:
We're American.
What are you?
I'm a German, you idiot.
ALDO:
Speak English pretty good for a German.
I agree.
So let's talk.
ALDO:
Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
His name is Max.
We were in here drinking, celebrating.
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
It's not my fault!
ALDO:
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
-No.
-I'm alive!
(SHOUTING IN GERMAN)
ALDO:
Who's that?
(GRUNTS)
Is the girl on your side?
ALDO:
Which girl?
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.
ALDO:
Yeah, she's ours.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
ALDO:
Is she okay?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
ALDO:
Wilhelm!
(SHOUTING IN GERMAN)
She's been shot.
But she's alive.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
ALDO:
Okay, Wilhelm.
What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
ALDO:
I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can I?
ALDO:
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
(SNIFFLES)
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
(BOTTLES CLATTERING)
(VON HAMMERSMARK GROANING)
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
(DOGS BARKING)
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
(EXCLAIMING)
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
(GROANS)
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
(GRUNTING)
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
(VON HAMMERSMARK BREATHING DEEPLY)
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
(DOGS BARKING)
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
DerFϋhrer is attending the premiere.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
I've been rethinking my position in regards to your Paris premiere of "Nation's Pride."
As the weeks have gone on and the Americans are on the beach I do find myself thinking more and more about this Private Zoller.
This boy has done something tremendous for us.
And I'm beginning to think my participation in this event could be meaningful.
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
(SNORTS)
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-I-broke-my-leg-mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that rouge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian.
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian.
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian.
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
(CHUCKLES)
You've moved up in the world.
Look at you, Lieutenant First Class.
And with your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.
And that one's name is Wilhelm Wicki.
He's an Austrian-born Jew, who immigrated to the United States when things began turning sour for the Israelites.
They are the two German-born members of the Basterds.
They've been known to don German uniforms, to ambush squads.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
What brings you all the way out here?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
But that doesn't look like this.
This is odd.
It would appear somebody's missing.
Somebody fashionable.
Everybody out!

Chapter Five
REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE
Night of "NATION'S PRIDE" premiere
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Remember...in English.
Yes.
Action.
But how do we get it developed?
Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop that footage.
And suppose someone would develop the footage how do we get a 35mm print with a soundtrack?
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
We find somebody who can develop and process a 35mm print with a soundtrack.
And we make them do it or we kill them.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Bring that fucker over here!
Put his head down on that table.
You either do what the fuck we tell you or I'll bury this ax in your collaborating skull.
(MAN SPEAKING FRENCH)
I'm not a collaborator.
Marcel, do his wife and children know you?
Yes.
Then after we kill this dog for the Germans we'll go and silence them.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Jannings, come on, show the ring.
Come on, come on.
There you go!
Fredrick, have a look at it.
This is the highest artistic honor that I give.
-Herr Doctor, I'm also feeling very honored.
-You deserve it, my dear Jannings!
But I believe after the premiere today, we have a new candidate.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Ah, Emmanuelle I'd like you to meet the greatest actor in the world Emil Jannings.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Mademoiselle, I'm pleased to meet you.
You have a beautiful cinema.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Thank you, Hermann.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Fräulein von Hammersmark.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Colonel Landa, it's been years.
Dashing as ever, I see.
So what's happened to your lovely leg?
A by-product of kicking ass in the German cinema, no doubt.
Save your flattery, you old dog.
I know too many of your former conquests to fall into that honey pot.
Seriously, what happened?
Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I might add at mountain climbing.
(LAUGHING)
And this is the result.
Mountain climbing?
That's how you injured your leg -mountain climbing?
Believe it or not, yes it is.
(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)
Forgive me, fräulein.
I don't mean to laugh at your misfortune.
It's just --- mountain climbing?
I'm curious, fräulein, what could have ever compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor?
Well, I shan't be doing it again, I can tell you that.
That cast looks as fresh as my old Uncle Gustav.
When were you climbing this mountain, last night?
Very good eye, Colonel.
It happened yesterday morning.
And where in Paris is this mountain?
No, I'm just teasing you, fräulein.
You know me, I tease rough.
So, who are your three handsome escorts?
I'm afraid neither three speak a word of German.
They're friends of mine from Italy.
This is a wonderful Italian stuntman, Enzo Gorlomi.
A very talented cameraman, Antonio Margheriti.
And Antonio's camera assistant Dominick Decocco.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
Gentlemen, this is an old friend, Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
Hello.
Gentlemen, it's a pleasure the friends of our cherished star, admired by all of us, this outright jewel of our culture are naturally going to be under my personal protection for the duration of their stay.
Thank you.
Gorlomi?
Am I saying it correctly?
Yes - 'er, correct.
Gorlomi?
Say it for me once please...?
Gorlomi.
I'm sorry, again...?
Gorlomi.
Once more...?
(SOFTLY) Gorlomi.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
What's your name again...?
Antonio Margheriti.
Again...?
Margheriti.
One more time, but let me really hear the music in it!
Margheriti.
HANS:
Margheriti.
And you...?
Dominick Decocco.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
Dominick Decocco.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Well, my two cameraman friends need to find their seats.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
Let me see your tickets.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
I suppose you getting premiere tickets for your friends wouldn't be the most difficult thing for a star of your status.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN) 0023 and 0024.
That shouldn't be too difficult to find, goodbye.

I have to go down and socialize with these Hun pigs.
Let's go over it again.
Reel one is on the first projector.
Reel two is on the second.
The third one is on the spool.
And the fourth one is ready to go.
Okay, the big sniper battle in the film begins around the middle of the third reel.
Our film comes in on the fourth reel.
Somewhere towards the end of the third reel go down and lock the doors of the auditorium.
Then take your place behind the screen and wait for my cue.
Then burn it down.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Take your seats.
The show is about to begin.
Everybody, please take your seats.
The show is about to begin.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
We'll see you later.
(HANS SPEAKING GERMAN)
Not so fast.
A glass of champagne to toast "Nation's Pride."
(TOASTING)
My fräulein, may I have a word with you in private?
Certainly.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
Excuse us.
(USHER CONTINUES ANNOUNCING IN GERMAN)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Have a seat, my fräulein.
May I?
Mademoiselle Mimieux allowed me to set up camp in her office for the time being.
Let me see your foot.
I beg your pardon?
Put your foot in my lap.
Hans, you embarrass me.
(GASPS SOFTLY)
Could you please reach into the right pocket of my coat and give me what you find in there.
May I?
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
What's that American expression?

Fuck you, too!
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches!
Get your hands off me.
You fucking bratwurst-smelling...
God damn you!
Get off!
Hmm.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Clever.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
I informed the Fϋhrer that the audience has taken their seats.
He should arrive any minute.
Thank you, Hans.
ALDO:
You Jerry-banging, Limburg-smelling... (SPEAKING GERMAN)
Let go.
As Stanley said to Livingstone, Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?
Hans Landa.
(TRUCK ENGINE STARTING)
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.
My hands to be exact.
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you.
Caught you flinching.
ALDO:
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.
ALDO:
Utivich?
UTIVICH:
Is that you, Lieutenant?
ALDO:
Yeah.
UTIVICH:
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?
-The woman?
-ALDO:
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot." Yeah, I was just thinking that.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
You may leave us.
But stay alert outside.
So you're Aldo the Apache.
-So you're The Jew Hunter.
-I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?
(SNORTS)
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
EIiza on Ice?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Göring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Göring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
(EXCLAIMS)
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it? "That's a bingo."
You just say, "Bingo."
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
Up there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999.999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?

(PEOPLE cheering)
HANS:
So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
I informed the Fϋhrer that the audience has taken their seats.
He should arrive any minute.
Thank you, Hans.
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States ofAmerica to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
GENERAL:
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.
Is that clear, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
Over and out.

That actor in the movie stinks.
What are you doing here?
I came to visit you.
Can't you see how busy I am?
Then allow me to lend an assist.
Fredrick, it's not funny, you can't be here.
This is your premiere, you need to be out there with them.
Normally, you would be right.
And for all the other films I do I intend to endure evenings like tonight, in the proper spirit.
However, the fact remains this film is based on my military exploits.
And in this case, my exploits consisted of killing many men.
Consequently, the part of the film that's playing now I don't like watching this part.
-I am sorry, Fredrick, but...
-So, I thought I'd come up here and do what I do best annoy you.
And from the look on your face, it would appear I haven't lost my touch.
Are you so used to the Nazis kissing your ass you've forgotten what the word "no" means?
No...you can't be here!
Now go away!
Fredrick, you hurt me.
Well, it's nice to know you can feel something.
Even if it's just physical pain.
I'm not a man you say, "go away" to.
There's over three hundred dead bodies in Italy, that if they could, would testify to that!
After what I've done for you you disrespect me at your peril!
Lock the door.
What?
Lock the door.
We don't have much time.
Time for what?
(SIGHS)
Forget it!
--No, no, no...wait.
You want me to...
lock the door?
For the fifty-seventh time, yes.

I have a message for Germany.
That you are all going to die.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Enough!
Stop it!
Turn off the projector!
And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who's going to do it!
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
I don't know what's going on.
That does not belong in my movie!

These are the American lines, Colonel sir.
Excellent, Hermann.
HANS:
Hermann, uncuff them.
I'm officially surrendering myself over to you, Lieutenant Raine.
We're your prisoners.
How about my knife?
(CHUCKLES)
Thank you very much, Colonel.
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back.
Is that really necessary?
I'm a slave to appearances.
(GUNSHOT)
Scalp Hermann.
Are you mad?
What have you done?
I made a deal with your general for that man's life!
Yeah, they made that deal.
But they don't give a fuck about him.
They need you.
You'll be shot for this!
Nah, I don't think so.
More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.
You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?
-I'd make that deal.
-I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command,
I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island,
I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
(HANS SCREAMING)
You know something, Utivich?
I think this just might be my masterpiece.
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
Yes.
This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
Only rumors.
I love rumors!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miriam.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
30, 31.
Continue.
And the children,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
Amos was 9 or 10.
And Shosanna?
And Shosanna was
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
That they call you "The Jew Hunter."
Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
Yes.
It's the girl.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5,000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got a little Indian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!
Hey, Hirschberg.
Send that Kraut sarge over.
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
Yes.
Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse,
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
Donny!
Yeah?
Got us a German here who wants to die for country.
Oblige him.
Did you get that for killing Jews?
Bravery.
Yeah!
Oh, no!
- Oh, no!
Donny!
Yeah, Donny!
About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you.
Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park!
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!
He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street!
You!
Damn it, Hirschberg!
Donny, bring that other one over here.
Alive!
Get the fuck up!
Batter up.
You're on deck!
Two hits.
I hit you, you hit the ground.
English?
Wicki.
Ask him if he wants to live.
Tell him to point out on this map the German position.
Ask him how many Germans.
Around about 12.
What kind of artillery?
Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
He's going to hug his mother.
Well, ain't that nice?
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that.
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?
Practice.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
At that time, 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar.
Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle.
They're films, ain't they?
- Yes.
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.
Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper.
Shosanna has a collection of over 350 nitrate film prints.
Right this way, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
And your occupation before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
What should we drink to, sir?
Well...
Down with Hitler.
All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer, how's he doing?
Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film, sir?
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
Bridget von Hammersmark?
The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
Indeed.
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was in a tavern.
It is a tavern.
Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
Stiglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.
Mmm.
Well, if this is it, old boy,
I hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's.
By all means, Captain.
There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch.
Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily,
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
Now, about this pickle we find ourselves in.
It would appear there's only one thing left for you to do.
And what would that be?
Stiglitz.
Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls.
You outside.
Who are you?
British?
American?
What?
We're American.
What are you?
I'm a German, you idiot.
Speak English pretty good for a German.
I agree.
So let's talk.
Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
His name is Max.
We were in here drinking, celebrating.
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
It's not my fault!
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
No.
I'm alive!
Who's that?
Is the girl on your side?
Which girl?
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.
Yeah, she's ours.
Is she okay?
Wilhelm!
She's been shot.
But she's alive.
Okay, Wilhelm.
What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can I?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-I-broke-my-leg- mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian.
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian.
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian.
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?
Yes.
Gorlomi?
Gorlomi.
Gorlomi.
Antonio Margheriti.
Margheriti.
Margheriti.
Dominick Decocco.
Dominick Decocco.
What's that American expression?
"If the shoe fits, you must wear it."
Fucking shithead.
Faggot fuck.
Fuck you!
Bunch of shithead fuck.
Fuck you, too!
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches!
Get your hands off me.
You fucking bratwurst-smelling...
Goddamn you!
Get off!
Hmm.
You Jerry-banging, Limburg-smelling...
As Stanley said to Livingstone,
Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?
Hans Landa.
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.
My hands to be exact.
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you.
Caught you flinching.
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.
Utivich?
Is that you, Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?
The woman?
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot."
- Yeah, I was just thinking that.
So you're Aldo the Apache.
So you're The Jew Hunter.
I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on Ice?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it?
"That's a bingo."
You just say, "Bingo."
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
Up there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999. 999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?
I implore you.
We must destroy that tower.
Sarge, that tower...
The tower stands!
Psst!
Psst!
So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.
Is that clear, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
Over and out.
When I kill that guy, you got 30 feet to get to that guard.
Can you do it?
I have to.
Champagne?
Who wants to send a message to Germany?
I have a message for Germany.
That you are all going to die.
And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who's going to do it!
Marcel, burn it down.
Oui, Shosanna.
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face
of Jewish vengeance.
Hermann, uncuff them.
I'm officially surrendering myself over to you, Lieutenant Raine.
We're your prisoners.
How about my knife?
Thank you very much, Colonel.
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back.
Is that really necessary?
I'm a slave to appearances.
Scalp Hermann.
Are you mad?
What have you done?
I made a deal with your general for that man's life!
Yeah, they made that deal.
But they don't give a fuck about him.
They need you.
You'll be shot for this!
Nah, I don't think so.
More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.
You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?
I'd make that deal.
I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command,
I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island,
I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know something, Utivich?
I think this just might be my masterpiece.
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
Yes.
This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard... that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts... most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now... before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts... and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers... all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
Only rumors.
I love rumors!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31.
Continue.
And the children...
Amos... and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
Amos was nine or 10.
And Shosanna?
And Shosanna was... 18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
That they call you "The Jew Hunter."
Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast... it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking... would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates... that I must have my men enter your home... and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
Yes.
It's the girl.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory... as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5,000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform... they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got a little Indian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves, but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!
Hey, Hirschberg.
Send that Kraut sarge over.
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
- Yes.
- Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis...
I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again... you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse,
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
Donny!
Yeah?
Got us a German here who wants to die for country.
Oblige him.
Did you get that for killing Jews?
Bravery.
Yeah!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Donny!
Yeah, Donny!
About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you.
Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park!
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!
He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street!
You!
Damn it, Hirschberg!
Donny, bring that other one over here.
Alive!
Get the fuck up!
Batter up.
You're on deck!
Two hits.
I hit you, you hit the ground.
English?
Wicki.
Ask him if he wants to live.
Tell him to point out on this map the German position.
Ask him how many Germans.
Around about 12.
What kind of artillery?
Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
He's going to hug his mother.
Well, ain't that nice?
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that.
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?
Practice.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
At that time, 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar.
Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle.
- They're films, ain't they?
- Yes.
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.
Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper.
Shosanna has a collection of over 350 nitrate film prints.
Right this way, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
And your occupation before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
What should we drink to, sir?
Well...
Down with Hitler.
All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s... and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer... how's he doing?
Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film, sir?
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino... blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
Bridget von Hammersmark?
The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
Indeed.
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was in a tavern.
It is a tavern.
Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
Stiglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful...
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.
Mmm.
Well, if this is it, old boy...
I hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's.
By all means, Captain.
There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch.
Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily...
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
Now, about this pickle... we find ourselves in.
It would appear there's only one thing left for you to do.
And what would that be?
Stiglitz.
Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls.
You outside.
Who are you?
British?
American?
What?
We're American.
What are you?
I'm a German, you idiot.
Speak English pretty good for a German.
I agree.
So let's talk.
Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
His name is Max.
We were in here drinking, celebrating.
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
It's not my fault!
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
- No.
- I'm alive!
Who's that?
Is the girl on your side?
Which girl?
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.
Yeah, she's ours.
Is she okay?
Wilhelm!
She's been shot.
But she's alive.
Okay, Wilhelm.
What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo...
I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can I?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo...
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John... why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry... they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Führer is attending the premiere.
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-I-broke-my-leg-mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian.
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian.
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian.
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?
Yes.
Gorlomi?
Gorlomi.
Gorlomi.
Antonio Margheriti.
Margheriti.
Margheriti.
Dominick Decocco.
Dominick Decocco.
What's that American expression?
"If the shoe fits, you must wear it."
Fucking shithead.
Faggot fuck.
Fuck you!
Bunch of shithead fuck.
Fuck you, too!
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches!
Get your hands off me.
You fucking bratwurst-smelling...
Goddamn you!
Get off!
Hmm.
You Jerry-banging, Limburg-smelling...
As Stanley said to Livingstone,
Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?
Hans Landa.
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.
My hands to be exact.
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you.
Caught you flinching.
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.
Utivich?
Is that you, Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?
The woman?
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot." Yeah, I was just thinking that.
So you're Aldo the Apache.
So you're The Jew Hunter.
I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you are in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo... if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors... we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on Ice?
However... all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still there, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if... there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war... tonight.
So, gentlemen... let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction... if I do nothing... it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight... we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it?
"That's a bingo."
You just say, "Bingo."
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my... let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
Up there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true... it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999.999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?
I implore you.
We must destroy that tower.
Sarge, that tower...
The tower stands!
Psst!
Psst!
So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.
Is that clear, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
Over and out.
When I kill that guy, you got 30 feet to get to that guard.
- Can you do it?
- I have to.
Champagne?
Who wants to send a message to Germany?
I have a message for Germany.
That you are all going to die.
And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who's going to do it!
Marcel, burn it down.
Oui, Shosanna.
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus... and this is the face... of Jewish vengeance.
Hermann, uncuff them.
I'm officially surrendering myself over to you, Lieutenant Raine.
We're your prisoners.
How about my knife?
Thank you very much, Colonel.
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back.
Is that really necessary?
I'm a slave to appearances.
Scalp Hermann.
Are you mad?
What have you done?
I made a deal with your general for that man's life!
Yeah, they made that deal.
But they don't give a fuck about him.
They need you.
You'll be shot for this!
Nah, I don't think so.
More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.
You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?
I'd make that deal.
I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command,
I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island,
I imagine you won't take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So...
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know something, Utivich?
I think this just might be my masterpiece.

Nazi Occupied France"
1941 One year into the German occupation of France
Pappa
Go back inside and shut the door.
Julie, get me some water from the pump to wash up with, then get inside with your mother.
Ready Pappa.
Thank you darling, now go inside and take care of your mother.
Don't run.
This is the property of Perrier LaPadite?
Yes heer Colonel.
Herman, until I summon you, I am to be left alone.
As you wish Heer Col.
Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?
I am Perrier LaPadite.
It is a pleasure to meet you Monsieur LaPadite,
I am Colonel Hans Landa of the S.S.
How may I help you?
I was hoping you could invite me inside your home and we may have a discussion.
Follow Me
Colonel Landa, this is my family.
Col Hans Landa of the S.S. madame, at your service.
Please excuse my rude intrusion on your routine.
Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have heard in the village about your family are all true.
Your wife is a beautiful woman.
And each of your daughters is more lovely then the last.
Merci.
Please have a seat.
Charlotte, would you be so good as to get The Colonel some wine?
No, no
Merci be coupe Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine.
This being a dairy farm one would be safe in assuming you have milk?
Oui.
Then milk is what I prefer.
Very Well.
Could you please close the window?
Merci.
Monsieur, to both your family, and your cows,
I say;
Bravo.
Merci.
Please, join me at your table.
Very well.
Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to discuss,' would be better discussed in private.
You'll notice, I left my men outdoors- if it wouldn't offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies to step outside.
You are right.
Charlotte, would you take the girls outside.
The Colonel and I need to have a few words.
Monsieur LaPadite,
I regret to inform you I've exhausted the extent of my French.
To continue to speak it so inadequately, would only serve to embarrass me.
However, I've been lead to believe you speak English quite well?
Oui.
Well, it just so happens, I do as well.
This being your house, I ask your permission to switch to English, for the remainder of the conversation?
By all means.
Monsieur LaPadite,
I thank you for milk, and your hospitality.
I do believe our business here is done.
Mademoiselle LaPadite,
I thank you for your time, we shant be bothering your family any longer.
So, Monsieur and Madame LaPadite I bid you adieu.
Till we meet again!
Au revoir, Shosanna!
Chapter TWO "Inglorious Basterds"
No, no, no, no...
How much more of these jew swine must I endure?
I have heard the rumors myself!
Solders of The Third Reich, who have brought the world to their knee`s, now pecking and clucking like chickens.
Do you know the latest rumor they've conjured up, in their fear induced delirium?
The one that beats my boys with a bat.
The one they call "The Bear Jew"...is a Golem.
Mine Fuhrer, this is just soldiers gossip, no one really believes The Bear Jew is a golem.
Why not?
They seem to be able to elude capture like a aberration.
They seem to be able to appear and disappear at will.
You want to prove their flesh and blood?
Then BRING THEM TO ME!
I will hang them naked, by their heels, from the eiffel tower!
And then throw their bodies in the sewers, for the rats of Paris to feast!
KLIEST
Year mine Fuhrer.
I have a order I want relayed to all German soldiers stationed in France.
The Jew degenerate known as The Bear Jew, hence forth, is never to be referred to as The Bear Jew again.
Yes mine Fubrer.
Do you still wish to see Private Butz?
Who and what is a private Butz?
He's the soldier you wanted to see personally.
His squad was ambushed by Lt.Raines Jews.
He was it's only survivor.
Indeed I do want to see him, thank you for reminding me.
Send him in.
Werner and I were the only ones left alive after the ambush.
While one man guarded us, the rest removed the hair.
Hugo Stiglitz
How did you survived this ordel?
They let me go.
You are not to tell anybody anything!
Not one word of detail!
Your outfit was ambushed, and you got a away.
Not one word more.
Yes mine Fuhrer.
Did they mark you like they did the other survivors?
Yes mine Fuhrer.
Chapter THREE "German Night in Paris"
Paris
WHITE HELL OF PIZA PALU
GERMAN NIGHT LENI REFENSHTAL in PABST WHITE HELL OF PIZA PALU
What starts tomorrow?
A Max Linder festival.
Ummmm, I always preferred Linder to Chaplin.
Except Linder never made a film as good as "The Rid".
The chase climax of "The Kid", superb.
- I adore your cinema very much
- Merci
Is it yours?
- Do I own it?
- Oui
Oui
How does a young girl, such as yourself, own a cinema?
My aunt left it to me.
Merci for hosting a German night.
I don't have a choice, but your welcome.
I love the Refensthal mountain films, especially, "Pizu Palu".
It's nice to see a French girl who's a admirer of Refensthal.
"Admire", would not be the adjective I would use to describe my feelings towards Fraulein Refensthal.
But you do admire the director.
Pabst, don't you?
That's why you included his name on the marquee.
I'm French.
We respect directors in our country.
Apparently even Germans.
Even Germans.
Merci for assistance, Private.
Adieu.
Your not finished?
I'll finish in the morning.
May I ask your name?
You wish to see my papers?
Emmanuelle Mimieux.
That's a very pretty name.
Merci.
Are you finished with my papers?
Mademoiselle.
My name is Fredrick Zoller.
It's been a pleasure chatting with a fellow cinema lover.
Sweet dreams, Mademoiselle.
May I join you?
Look Fredrick -
- You remember my name?
-Yes....
Look, you seem a pleasant enough fellow -
- Merci.
Your welcome. - regardless, I want you to stop pestering me.
I apologize mademoiselle, I wasn't trying to be a pest.
I was simply trying to be friendly.
I don't wish to be your friend.
-Why not?
- Don't act like a infant.
You know why.
I'm more then just a uniform.
Not to me.
If you are so desperate for a French girlfriend, I suggest you try Vichy?
Who are you?
I thought I was just a uniform?
Your not just a German soldier, are you somebodies son?
Most German soldiers are somebodies son.
So your a war hero?
What did you do?
I was alone in a bell tower in a walled off city in Russia.
It was myself, and a thousand rounds of ammo, in a bird's nest, against three hundred Soviet soldiers.
What's a bird's nest?
A bird's nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower.
It's a high structure, offering a three hundred and sixty degree view.
Very advantageous for marksmen.
How many Russian's did you kill?
Sixty-eight.
The first day.
A hundred and fifty the second day.
Thirty-two, the third day.
On the forth day, they exited the city.
Naturally my war story received alot of attention in Germany, that's why they all recognize me.
They call me the German Sgt.York.
Maybe they'll make a film about your exploits.
Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels thought.
So he did.
It's called "Nation's Pride", and guess what, they wanted me to play myself, so I did.
They have posters for it in kiosks all over Paris.
That's another reason for all the attention.
"Nation's Pride" is about you?
"Nation's Pride" is starring you?
I know, comical, huh?
Well, good luck with your premier Private.
I hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself.
Au revoir.
Mademoiselle Nimieux?
Oui?
-Ask her if this is her cinema?
-is this your cinema?
Oui
-Tell her to come down.
-Come down please.
I don't understand, what have I done?
-She wants to know what she's done?
-Who says she's done anything?
-Who says you've done anything?
it's only the off spring of slaves that allows America to be competitive athletically.
America olympic gold can measured in Negro sweat.
DOCTOR JOSEPH GOEBBELS Second Top man in charge of the Third Reich
Good you came.
I wasn't sure weather or not you'd except my invitation.
Invitation?
-Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick?
-Yes it is, Heer Goebbels.
Emmanuelle, there is somebody I want you to meet.
Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to introduce you to the minister of propaganda, the leader of the entire German film industry, and now I'm a actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels.
Your reputation precedes you Fraulein Mimieux.
And normally, this is Heer Goebbels French interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.
Bon jour.
Bon jour.
And you've met the Major.
Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
Major Deiter Helistrom of the Gestapo, at your service mademoiselle.
Please allow me, have a seat.
Try the wine mademoiselle, it's quite good.
well I must say, you've made quite a impression on our boy.
I must say fraulein, I should be rather annoyed with you.
I arrive in France, and I wish to have lunch with my star...
Little do I know Be's become the toast of paris, and now he must find time for me.
People wait in line hours, day's, to see me.
For the Fuhrer and Private Zoller, I wait.
So finally, I'm granted a audience with the young Private, and he spends the entire lunch speaking of you and your cinema.
-So Fraulein Mimieux, let's get down to business.
-
- Heer Goebbels, I haven't informed her yet.
Unless the girls a simpleton, I'm sure she's figured it out by now, after all she does operate a cinema.
Francesca, tell her.
What they're trying to tell you Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has spent the last hour at lunch, trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels to abandon previous plans for Private Zollers film premier, and change the venue to your cinema.
-What?
-I wanted to inform her.
-Shit.
I apologize Private, of course you did.
-What's the issue?
The Private wanted to inform the mademoiselle himself.
Nonsense.
Until I ask a few questions, he has nothing to inform.
Let the record state, I have not agreed to a venue change.
Duly noted.
-You have opera boxes?
-Oui
-How Many?
-Two
More would be better.
How many seats in your auditorium?
Three hundred and fifty.
But Heer Goebbels, that's not such a terrible thing.
You said yourself you didn't want to indulge every two faced french bourgeois taking up space currying favor.
With less seat's it makes the event more exclusive.
Your not trying to fill the house, they're fighting for seats.
Besides, to hell with the French.
This is a German night, a German event, a German celebration.
This night is for you, me, the German military, the high command, their family and friends.
The only people who should be allowed in the room, are people who will be moved by the exploits on screen.
I see your public speaking has improved.
It appears I've created a monster.
A strangely persuasive monster.
When the war's over, politics awaits.
Well Private, though it is true,
I'm inclined to indulge you anything.
I must watch a film in this young ladies cinema before I can say, yes or no.
So young lady, you are to close your cinema tonight, and have a private screening for me.
What German films do you have?
Ah Landa, your here.
Emmanuelle, this is Col Hans Landa of the SS., he'll be running security for the premier.
Charmed Mademoiselle.
And now I must get Reich Minister Goebbels to his next appointment.
Slave driver!
French slave driver!
Actually, in my role as security chief of this joyous German occasion, I'm afraid I must have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux.
What sort of discussion?
That sounded suspiciously like a Private questioning the order of a Colonel?
Or am I just being sensitive?
Nothing could be further from the truth Colonel.
Your authority is beyond question.
But your reputation does proceed you.
Should Mademoiselle Mimieux or myself be concerned?
Hans, the boy means no harm, he's simply smitten.
And he's correct.
Your reputation does proceed you.
No need for concern, you two.
As security chief, I simply need to have a chat with the possible new venue's property owner.
Have you tried the strudel here?
No.
It's not so terrible.
So how is it the young Private and yourself came to be acquainted?
Yes, two strudels, one for myself, and one for the mademoiselle.
A cup of espresso, with a container of steamed milk, on the side.
For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk.
So Mademoiselle, you were beginning to explain....?
Up untill a couple of days ago, I had no knowledge of Private Zoller, or his exploits.
To me, the Private was simply just a patron of my cinema.
We spoke a few times, but -
- Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.
This is a simple formality, no reason for you to feel anxious.
-I apologize, I forgot to order the cream fresh.
-One moment.
Wait for the cream.
So Emmanuelle
- May I call you Emmanuelle?
Oui.
So Emmanuelle, explain to me how does it happen, that a young lady such as your self, comes to own a cinema?
After you.
Success?
Like I said, not so terrible.
So you were explaining the origin of your cinema ownership?
The cinema originally belonged to my aunt and uncle -
- What is there names?
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
Where are they now?
My uncle was killed during blitzkrieg.
Pity... .
Continue.
Aunt Ada passed away from fever last spring.
Regrettable.
It's come to my attention you have a negro in your employ, is that true?
Yes, he's a Frenchman.
His name is Marcel.
He worked with my aunt and uncle since they opened the cinema.
He's the only other one who works with me.
-Doing What?
-Projectonist.
-Is he any good?
-The best
Actually one could see where that might be a good trade for them.
Can you operate the projectors?
Of course I can.
Knowing the Reich Minister as I do,
I'm quite positive he wouldn't want the success or failure of his illustrious evening, dependent on the prowess of a negro.
So if it comes to pass we hold this event at your venue, talented no doubt, as your negro may be, you will operate the projectors.
Is that exceptable?
Oui
Cigarette?
There not French, there German.
I did have some thing else I wanted to ask you,
but right now, I can't remember what it is.
Oh well, must not of been important.
Till tonight.
I must say, I appreciate the modesty of this auditorium.
Your Cinema has real respect, almost church like.
Not to say we couldn't spruce the place up a bit.
In Versailles there's a crystal chandelier hanging in the banquet hall that is extraordinary.
we're going to get it, and hang it from the very middle of auditorium roof.
Also I want to go to Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes, and just scatter them about the lobby.
What the fuck are we suppose to do?
It looks like we're suppose to have a Nazi premier.
Like I said, what the fuck are we suppose to do?
-Well, when I was watching the bosch I got a idea.
-I'm confused, what are we talking about?
-Filling the cinema with Nazi's and their whores, and burning it down to the ground.
-I'm not talking about that, your talking about that.
No, Marcel, just for sake of argument, if we wanted to burn down the cinema, for any number of reasons, you and I could physically accomplish that, no?
Oui Shosanna, we could do that.
And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate film print collection, we wouldn't even need explosives, would we?
You mean we wouldn't need any more explosives?
I am going to burn down the cinema on Nazi night.
And if I'm going to burn down the cinema, which I am, we both know, your not going to let me do it by myself.
Because you love me.
And I love you.
And your the only person on this earth I can trust.
But that's not all we're going to do.
Does the filmmaking equipment in the attic still work?
I know the film camera does.
How about the sound recorder?
Quite well, actually.
I recorded a new guitarist I met in a cafe last week.
It works superb.
Why do we need filmmaking equipment?
Because Marcel, my sweet, we're going to make a film.
Just for the Nazi's.
Chapter FOUR "Operation Kino"
The Village of NADINE, FRANCE
My honor - loyalty
Okay, I'm a fictional, literary character, from the past, I'm American, and that's controversial.
No it's not controversial.
The nationally of the author, has nothing to do with the nationally of the character.
The Character is the character.
Hamlet's not British, he's Danish.
So yes, this character was born in America.
-Schnapps, please.
-Sure, I'll be right back
-If I had a wife, would she be called a squaw?
-He's got it.
-Is my bloodbrother, Old Shatterhand?
-Yes!
-Did Karl May write me?
-Yes!
I am WINNETOU, CHIEF of the APACHES!
Hello, my lovelies,
I will join you in moments.
I'm finishing up a game with my five new friends here.
No hurry, Frau Von Hammersmark.
Take your time, enjoy yourself.
I Would like to get my friends some drinks, could you ask them what they want?
Of course.
-Gentlemen, courtesy of the frauline, what can I get you to drink?
-Whiskey.
Three Whiskys
Well gentlemen, I need to excuse myself for a moment.
So what's on your card?
Oh, yes.
Let's see.
Gengus Khaun!
I would have never gotten that.
I thought this place was suppose to have more French then Germans?
Normally that's true.
The Sgt over there's wife, just had a baby.
His commanding officer gave him, and his mates the night off to celebrate.
We should leave.
No, we should stay.
For one drink at least.
I've been waiting for you in a bar, it would look strange if we left before we had a drink.
She's right, just be calm, and enjoy your booze.
-Eric, Merci
-Your welcome
You should come and play with us, it'll be fun.
But I'm working
Merci, but part of your job is entertaining the guests, so sit down with them.
Here she is.
Just remember, no funny bussines.
I'll show him some funny business, because this guy here is having a baby.
just look at this.
I propose a toast to the happy father of Maximilian.
Cheers!
There's been some new developments.
The cinema venue has changed.
Why?
No one knows.
But that in itself shouldn't be a problem.
The cinema it's been changed to is considerably smaller then The Ritz.
So whatever materials you brought for The Ritz, should be doubly effective here.
Now this next piece of information is colossal, try not to over react.
The Fuhrer, will be attending tomorrow.
Frau Von Hammersmark, I was just thinking, could you sign a autograph to my son on his birthday?
I'd love to Wilhelm.
This handsome happy Sgt, just became a father today.
-Congratulations
-Thank you
So Wilhelm, do you know the name of this progeny yet?
I most certainly do, fraulein.
His name is Maximilian.
Maximilian, What a wonderful name, Sgt.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.
Thank you fraulein, thank you.
Max may not know who you are now.
But he will.
I will show him all of your movies.
He will grow up with your films, and this napkin on his wall.
Then, to the whole tavern...
I purpose a toast to the greatest actress in Germany!
There is no Dietrich, there is no Riefenstahl, only Von Hammersmark!
There's much to discuss and...
So, Frau Von Hammersmark, what brings you to France?
None of your business,Sgt.
You might not have worn out your welcome with the fraulein, with your drunken boorish behavior, but you have wore out your welcome with me.
Might I remind you Sgt.,you're an enlisted man.
This is a officers table.
I suggest you stop pestering the fraulein, and rejoin your table.
Excuse me Cap't, but your accent is very unusual.
Where are you from?
Sgt.!
You must be ether drunk or mad, to speak to a superior officer with such impertinentness!
I'm making YOU,...and YOU,...responsible, for him.
I suggest you take hold of your friend, or he'll spend Max's first birthday in jail for public drunkenness!
Then might I inquire?
Like the young newly christened father, I too have a acute ear for accents.
And like him, I too find yours odd.
From where do you hail, Cap't?
Major, this is highly inappr -
I wasn't speaking to you Lt.Saltzberg, or you ether, Lt.Berlin.
I was speaking to Cap't I--don't-know-what.
I was born in the village that rests in the shadow of Piz Palu.
The mountain?
Yes.
In that village we all speak like this.
Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?
Yes.
Then you saw me.
You remember the skiing torch scene?
Yes I do.
In that scene was myself, my father, my sister, and my two brothers.
My brother is so handsome, the director Pabst, gave him a Close Up.
Major, if my word means anything, I can vouch for everything the Young Cap't has just said.
He does hail from the bottom of Piz Palu, he was in the film, and his brother is far more handsome then he.
You should rejoin your friends.
-May I join you?
-By all means Major
-Wonderful
So that's the source of your bazaar accent?
Extraordinary.
So what are you doing here Cap't?
Aside from having a drink with the lovely fraulein?
Well that pleasure requires no explanation.
I mean in country.
Your obviously not stationed in France, or I'd know who you are.
You know every German in France?
Worth knowing.
Well, there in lies the problem.
We never claimed to be worth knowing.
All levity aside, what are you doing in France?
Attending Goebbels film premiere as the frauleins escort.
Your the frauleins escort?
Somebody has to carry the lighter.
The Captain is my date, but all three are my guests.
We're old friends Major, who go back along time.
Longer then a actress would care to admit.
Well, in that case, let me raise a glass to the three luckiest men in the room.
I'll drink to that.
I must say, that game their playing looks like a good bit of fun.
I didn't join them, because your quite right Cap't, officers and enlisted men shouldn't fraternize.
But seeing as we're all officers here, and sophisticated lady friends of officers.
What say we play the game?
-okay, one game.
-wonderful
So the object of the game, is to write the name of a famous person on your card.
Real or fictitious, doesn't matter.
For instance, you could write Confucius or Fu Manchu.
Eric' More pens.
And they must be famous.
No Aunt Inga's.
When you finish writing, put the card face down on the table, and move it to the person to your left.
The person to your right, will move their card in front of you.
You pick up the card without looking at it, lick the back, and stick it on your forehead like so.
And in ten yes or no questions, you must guess who you are...
So let's give it a try, shall we?
I'll start, give you the idea.
Am I German?
No.
-Am I a American?
-No
Wait a minute, he goes to
Don't be ridiculous, obviously he wasn't born in America.
-So... .
I visited America, aye?
-Yes
-Was this vist...fortuitous?
Not for you.
-My native land, is it what one would call, exotic?
-Yes
That could be ether a reference to the jungle, or the Orient.
I'm going to let my first instinct take over, and ask, am I from the jungle?
Yes you are
Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask, whether your real or fictitious.
I however, think that's too easy, so I won't ask that, yet.
Okay, my native land is the jungle?
I visited America, but my visit was not fortuitous to me, but the implication is that it was to somebody else.
When I went from the jungle to America,...
-Did I go by boat?
-Yes
-Did I go against my will?
-Yes
-On this boat ride, ... .
Was I in chains?
-Yes
-When I arrived in America,...
Was I displayed in chains?
-Yes
-Am I the story of the Negro in America?
-No
Well then I must be King Kong.
Bravo, that was impressive.
Now since I answered correctly, you all need to finnish your drinks.
Now, who's next?
Major, I don't mean to be rude.
But... the four of us are very good friends.
And the four of us haven't seen each other in quite a while.
So...
Major, I'm afraid, you are intruding.
I beg to differ Cap't.
It's only if the fraulein considers my presence a intrusion, that I become a intruder.
How about it fraulein?
Am I intruding?
Of course not, Major.
I didn't think so.
It's simply the young Cap't is immune to my charms.
I'm just joking, of course I'm intruding.
Allow me to refill your glasses gentlemen, and I will bid you and the fraulein adieu.
Eric has a bottle of thirty-three year old single malt scotch whisky from the Scottish highlands.
What do you say gentlemen?
Your most gracious, sir.
Eric, the thirty-three, and new glasses!
You don't want to contaminate the thirty-three with the swill you were drinking.
-How many glasses?
-Five glasses
-Not me.
I like scotch, scotch doesn't like me.
-Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly.
Three glasses
To a thousand year Reich!
Did you hear that?
That's the sound of my Luger pointed right at your testicles.
Why do you have a Luger pointed at my testicles?
Because you've just given yourself away, Cap't.
Your no more German then that scotch.
-Well,
-Major - -
-Major-
Shut up slut.
You were saying?
I was saying that makes two of us.
I've had a gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.
That makes three of us.
And at this range, I'm a real Fredrick Zoller.
Looks like we have a bit of a sticky situation here.
What's going to happen, Major, is you're going to stand up, and walk out that door with us.
No no no no no no, I don't think so.
I'm afraid you and I both know, no matter what happens to anybody else in this room, the two of us aren't going anywhere.
Too bad about them though.
They seem like a likeable bunch
You two will have to shoot them.
I thought so.
So you run with the American's now, huh?
Now times are bad?
You despicable traitor.
For now.
Willhelm, think of Maximillian.
I've been rethinking my position in regards to your Paris premiere of "Nations Pride".
As the weeks have gone on, and the Americans are on the beach,
I do find myself thinking more and more about this Private Zoller.
This boy has done something tremendous for us.
And I'm beginning to think my participation in this event could be meaningful.
Ahhh Hugo, you've moved up in the world I see.
Lieutenant.
And with your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.
And that ones name is Weiheim Wicki.
He's an Austrian born jew, who immigrated to the United States when things began turning sour for the Israelites.
They are the two German born members of The Basterds.
They've been known to don german uniforms, to ambush squads.
But that doesnt look like this.
This is odd.
It would appear somebodies missing.
Somebody fashionable.
Chapter FIVE "Revenge of the Giant Face"
NIGHT OF "NATION'S PRIDE" PREMIERE
-Ooh lala, this is so exciting
-Shut up fool
-Sorry
You know this is a brilliant idea.
But do you really think we'll pull it off?
We don't have any other choice
Quickly, get him on the table.
- I should just kill you
- No please don't
-What are we gonna do with him now?
I'd like to know what you were doing here in the first place
Hermann Goering
-No, no look...
Won the gold for germany in the olympics
-Not as big of a deal as this boy.
-Yeah, this is a great deal for germany.
the premiere of a true hero
And let me present the owner of this cinema and our host
Nice to meet you madame. beautiful set-up you have here...
Fraulein Von Hammersmark
Colonel Landa, it's been years.
Dashing as ever I see.
So what's happened to your lovely leg, a by product of kicking ass in the German cinema, no doubt.
Save your flattery, you old dog.
I know too many of your former conquests, to fall into that honey pot.
Seriously, what happened?
Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I might add, at mountain climbing.
And this was the result.
Mountain climbing?
That's how you injured your leg, mountain climbing?
Believe it or not, yes it is.
Forgive me, fraulein.
I don't mean laugh at your misfortune.
It's just mountain climbing?
I'm curious fraulein, what could of ever compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor?
Well, I chant be doing it again, I can tell you that.
That cast looks as fresh as my old Uncle Gustave, when were you climbing this mountain, last night?
Very good eye, Colonel.
It happened yesterday morning.
And where exactly in Paris is this mountain?
I'm just teasing you, fraulein.
You know me, I tease rough.
So who are your three handsome escorts?
I'm afraid neither three speak a word of German.
They're friends of mine from Italy.
This is a wonderful Italian stuntman, Enzo Gorlomi
A very talented cameraman, Antonio Margheriti
And Antonio's camera assistant, Dominick Decocco
Gentlemen, this is a old friend, Col. Sans Landa of the S.S.
Good evening
Welcome gentlemen.
Friends of our beloved stars, which we all admire, the true gems of our culture will naturally be under my personal protection
Thank you
Did I pronounce that properly?
Yes, yes, it's correct.
Repeat once more
Excuse me, how?
Once again, I ask
And your name is?
Again
One more time, but let me really hear the music in it.
and you?
Well, my two cameraman friends need to find there seats.
These are your tickets
0023 and 0024 your places are easy to find. see you later
Martin Bormann
Ooh lala, Danielle Darrieux
I have to go down and socialize with these Hun pigs.
Let's go over it again?
Reel one is on the first projector.
Reel two is on the second.
Three and four are ready to go.
Okay, the big sniper battle in the film begins around the middle of the third reel.
Our film, comes on in the forth reel, so Somewhere towards the end of the third reel, go down and lock the doors of the auditorium.
Then take your place behind the screen, and wait for my CUE, when I give it to you,
BURN IT DOWN!
Take your seats!
The show is about to begin!
Everybody take your seatsl
-Its starting
-Yes, but let's enjoy a glass of champagne first
-I need to speak with you alone for a moment
- Of course
Excuse us
Have a seat fraulein.
Let me see your foot.
I beg your pardon?
Put your foot in my lap.
Colonel, you embarrass me.
Now, to your right, in the bag, there's a shoe. get it
Can I have it please?
What now Colonel?
Clever
-The Fuhrer will be here in a moment and we can start
-Thank you
It's time.
I should go lock the auditorium, and take my place behind the screen.
Perfectly understandable, dear boy.
You go now, and we'll see you after the show.
-Who is it?
-Fredrick
Are you the manager, of this cinema?
I want my money back.
That actor in the movie stinks.
- What are you doing here?
- I came to visit you
-Can't you see how busy I am?
-Then allow me to lend a assist.
Fredrick it's not funny, you can't be here.
This is your premiere, you need to be out there with them.
Normally, you would be right.
And for all the other films I do, I intend to endure evenings like tonight, in the proper sprit.
However the fact remains, this film, is based on my military exploits.
And in this case, my exploits consisted of me killing many men.
Consequently, the part of the film that's playing now, I don't like watching this part.
Fredrick, I am sorry, but -
- So, I thought, I'd come up here and do what I do best, annoy you.
And from the look on your face, it would appear I haven't lost my touch.
Are you so use to the Nazi's kissing your ass, you've forgotten what the word, "No" means?
No Fredrick, you can't come in here, now go away!
Well, it's nice to know you can feel something.
Even if it's just physical pain.
I'm not a man you say, "Go away" to.
There's over three hundred dead bodies in Russia, that if they could, would testify to that.
After what I've done for you, you disrespect me at your peril.
I have to get prepared for the reel change.
-What
-I have to get prepared for the reel change
-Let me do it
-No
Oh, please, it's been two years since i've done a reel change.
I said no
Fabulous, just fabulous.
The best movie this year
Thank you, Fuhrer...
Thank you
English subtitles by Jerry Shadow
Chapter One Once Upon a Time... in Nazi Occupied France
Go back inside and shut the door
Julie, get some water from the pump to wash up with then get inside with your mother.
Ready Papa
Thank you darling, now go inside and take care of your mother.
Don't run.
Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?
I am Perrier LaPadite
It is a pleasure to meet you Monsieur LaPadite, I am Colenel Hans Landa of the S.S.
How may I help you?
I was hoping you could invite me inside your home and we may have a discussion.
Certainly, after you.
Colenel Landa, this is my family.
Colonel Hans Landa of the S.S. madame, at your service.
Please excuse my rude intrusion on your routine.
The rumors I have heard in the village about your family are all true.
Each of your daughters is more lovely then the last.
Thank you.
Please have a seat.
Susane, would you be so good as to get the Colonel some wine?
Ah, no.
Thank you Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine.
This being a dairy farm one would be safe in assuming you have milk?
Yes.
Then milk is what I prefer.
Very well.
Please shut the window.
Thank you.
Monsieur, to both your family, and your cows, I say:
Bravo.
Thank you.
Please, join me at your table.
Very well.
Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to discuss, would be better discussed in private.
You'll notice, I left my men outdoors.
If it wouldn't offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies to step outside?
You are right.
Charlotte, would you take the girls outside.
The Colonel and I need to have a few words.
Monsieur LaPadite,
I regret to inform you I've exhausted the extent of my French.
To continue to speak it so inadequatel, would only serve to embarrass me.
However, I've been lead to belive you speak English quite well?
Yes.
Well, it just so happens, I do as well...
This being your house, I ask your permission to switch to English, for the remainder of the conversation.
Certainly.
Monsieur LaPadite, I thank you for the milk and your hospitality...
I do believe our business here is done.
Madmoiselle LaPadite!
I thank you for your time.
We shant be bothering your family any longer.
So, Monsieur...
Mademousielles.
I bid you adieu.
Chapter Two INGLORIOUS BASTERDS
I have heard the rumors myself.
Solders of the Third reich, who have brought the world to their knee's.
Now pecking and clucking like chickens.
Do you know the latest rumor?
The one that beats my boys with a bat.
The one called "The Bear Jew" is a golem.
Mine Fuher, this is just soldiers gossip, no one really believes the Bear Jew is a golem.
Why not?
They seem to be able to elude capture like an aberration.
They seem to be able to appear and disappear at will.
You want to prove their flesh and blood?
Then BRING THEM TO ME!
I will hang them naked, by their heels from the eiffel tower!
And then throw their bodies... in the swers, for the rats of Paris to feast!
Kilest!
Yes, mine Fuhrer.
I have an order I want relayed to all German soldierds stationed in France.
The jew degenerate known as "the Bear Jew"
is never to be referred to as The Bear Jew again.
Yes mine Fuhrer.
Do you still wish to see Private Butz?
Who and what is a private Butz?
He's the soldier you wanted to see personally.
His squad was ambushed by Lt. Raines Jews.
He was it's only survivor.
Indeed I do want to see him...
Thank you for reminding me.
Send him in.
So tell me exactly how you got away.
Werner and I were the only ones left alive after the ambush.
While one man guarded us, the rest removed the hair.
Hugo Stiglitz
How did you survive this ordeal?
They let me go.
You are not to tell anybody anything!
Your outfit was ambushed.
And you managed to get away.
Not one word more.
Yes mine Fuhrer.
Did they mark you like they did the other survivors?
Yes mine Fuhrer.
Chapter Three
German Night In Paris
"GERMAN NIGHT LENI REFENSHTAL in PAST WHITE HELL OF PIZA PALU"
What starts tomorrow?
A Max Linder festival.
Ummmm, I always prefered Linder to Chaplin.
Except Linder never made a film as good as "The Kid".
The chase climax of "The Kid", superb.
I adore your cinema very much.
Thank You.
Is it yours?
Do i own it?
Yes.
Yes
How does a young girl, such as yourself, own a cinema?
My aunt left it to me.
Thank you for hosting a German night.
I dont have a choice, but your welcome.
Then my thank you stands.
I love the Refensthal mountain films, especially, "Piza Palu".
Its nice to see a French girl who's a admirer of Refensthal
"Admire", would not be the adjective I would use to describe Fraulien Refensthal.
But you do admire the director Pabst, dont you?
Thats why you included his name on the marquee.
I'm French.
We respect directors in our country.
Apperently even Germans.
Even Germans.
Thank you for assistance, Private.
Adieu
Your not finished?
I'll finish in the morning.
May i ask your name?
You wish to see my papers
Emmanuelle Mimieux.
Thats a very pretty name.
Thank you.
Are you finished with me papers?
Mademoiselle.
My name is Fredrick Zoller.
Its been a pleasure chatting with a fellow cinema lover.
Sweet dreams, Mademoiselle.
Hello, mademoiselle.
May I join you?
Look Fedrick...
You remember my name?
Yes.
Look, you seem a pleasent enough fellow...
Thank you.
You're welcome... regardless, I want you to stop pestering me.
I appologize Mademoiselle,
I wasn't trying to be a pest.
I was simply trying to be friendly.
I don't wish to be your friend.
Why not?
Don't act like an infant.
You know why.
I'm more then just a uniform.
Not to me.
If you are so desperate for a French girlfriend, I suggest you try Vichy?
You are Fredrick Zoller?
Yes it is me.
Who are you?
I thought I was just a uniform?
You're not just a German soldier, are you somebodies son?
Most German soldiers are somebodies son.
Such a lucky girl to be with this German war hero.
No, no, no.
She is not my girlfriend.
So you're a war hero?
What did you do?
I was alone in a walled city, by myself with a thousand rounds of ammo.
In a bird's nest against three hundred soldiers.
What's a bird's nest?
A bird's nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower.
It's a tall strcuture offering a three hundred and sixty degree view.
Very advantageous for a marksmen.
How many did you kill?
Sixty-eight the first day.
A hundred and fifty the second day.
Thirty-two the third day.
On the fourth day, they exited the city.
Naturally my war story recieved alot of attention in Germany, that's why they all recognize me.
They call me the German Sergant York.
Maybe they'll make a film about your exploits.
Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels thought.
So he did, It's called "Nation's Pride".
They wanted me to play myself, so I did.
They have posters for it in kiosks all over Paris.
That's another reason for all the attention.
"Nation's Pride" is about you?
"Nation's Pride" is starring you?
I know, comical, huh?
Well, good luck with your premier Private.
I hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself.
Goodbye.
Mademoiselle Mimieux?
Yes?
Is this your cinema?
Yes.
Tell her to come down.
Come down please.
I don't understand, what have I done?
She wants to know what she's done?
Get your ass in that car.
- it's only the offspring of slaves that allows America to be competitive athletically.
America olympic gold can be measured in Negro sweat.
Joseph Goebbels The second most important to Hitler
Good you came.
I wasn't sure whether or not you'd except my invitation.
Invitation?
Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick?
Yes it is, Goebbels.
Emmanuelle, there is somebody I want you to meet.
Emanuelle Mimineux, I'd like to introduce you to the minister of propaganda, the leader of the entire German film industry, and now I'm an actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels.
Your reputation precedes you Fraulein Mimieux.
And normally, this is heer Goebbels French interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.
Hello.
Hello.
And you've met the major.
Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
Major Deither Hellstrom of the Gestapo,...
At your service mademoiselle.
Please allow me.
Try the wine mademoiselle, it's quite good.
Well I must say, you've made quite an impression on our boy.
I arrive in France, and I wish to have lunch with my star...
Little do I know he's become the toast of Paris, and now he must find the time for me.
People wait in line hours, days, to see me.
For the Fuhrer and Private Zoller, I wait.
So finally, I'm granted an audience with the young Private, and he spends the entire lunch speaking of you and your cinema.
So Fraulein Mimieux, let's get down to business.
Heer Goebbels, I haven't informed her yet.
Unless the girl's a simpleton, I'm sure she's figured out by now after all she does operate a cinema.
Francesca, tell her.
What they're trying to tell you is Private Zoller has spent the last hour at lunch, trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels to abandon previous plans for Private Zollers film premier, and change the venue to your cinema.
What?
I wanted to inform her
Shit.
I apologize Private, of course you did.
What's the issue?
The Private wanted to inform the mademoiselle himself.
Nonsense!
Until I ask a few questions, he has nothing to inform.
Let the record state, I have not agreed to a venue change.
Duly noted.
You have opera boxes?
Yes.
How many?
Two.
More would be better.
How many seats in your auditorium?
Three hundred and fifty.
That's almost four hundred less then The Ritz.
But heer Goebbels, that's not such a terrible thing.
You said yourself you didn't want to indulge every two faced French bourgeious taking up space currying favor.
With less seats it makes the event more exclusive.
You're not trying to fill the house, their fighting for seats.
Besides, to hell with the French.
This is a German night, a German event, a German celebration.
This night is for you, me, the German military, the high command, their family and friends.
The only people who should be allowed in the room, are people who will be moved by the exploits on screen.
I see your public speaking has improved.
It appears I've created a monster.
A strangely persuasive monster.
When the war's over, politics awaits.
Well Private, though it is true, I'm inclined to induldge you anything.
I must watch a film in this young ladies cinema before I can say yes or no.
So young lady, you are to close your cinema tonight, and have a private screening for me.
What German films do you have?
Ah, Landa, you're here!
Emmanuel, this is Colenel Hans Landa of the S.S.,..
...he'll be running security for the premier.
Charmed Mademoiselle.
And now I must get Reich Minister Goebbels to his next appointment.
Slave driver!
French slave driver!
Actually, in my role as security chief of this joyous German ocassion.... ...I'm afraid I must have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux.
What sort of discussion?
That sounded suspiciously like a Private questioning the order of a Colonel.
Or am I just being sensitive?
Nothing could be further from the truth Colonel.
Your authority is beyond question.
But your reputation does proceed you.
Should Mademoiselle Mimieux or myself be concerned?
Hans, the boy means no harm.
He is simply smitten.
And he's correct.
Your reputation does proceed you.
No need for concern you two.
As security chief, I simply need to have a chat with the possible new venue's property owner.
Have you tried the strudel here?
No.
It's not so terrible.
So how is it the young Private and yourself came to be acquainted?
Yes, two strudels, one for myself and one for the Mademoiselle.
A cup of espresso for myself.
And for the mademoiselle, a glass of milk.
So Mademoiselle, you were begining to explain...?
Up until a couple of days ago, I had no knowledge of Private Zoller or his exploits.
To me, Private was simply just a patron of my cinema.
We spoke a few times but...
Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.
This is a simple formality, no reason for you to feel anxious.
I apologize, I forgot to order the fresh cream.
One moment.
Wait for the cream.
So Emmanuelle
- May I call you Emmanuelle?
Yes.
So Emmanuelle, explain to me how does it happen, that a young lady such as yourself, comes to own a cinema?
After you.
What do you think?
Like I said, not so terrible.
So you were explaining the orgin of your cinema ownership?
The cinema originally belonged to my aunt and uncle.
What is there names?
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
Where are they now?
My uncle was killed during blitzkrieg.
Pity...
Continue.
Aunt Ada passed away from fever last spring.
Regrettable.
It's come to my attention you have a negro in your employ, is that true?
Yes.
He's a Frenchman.
His name is Marcel.
He wored with my aunt and uncle since they opened the cinema.
He's the only other one who works with me.
Doing what?
Projectionist.
Is he any good?
The best.
Actually one could see where that might be a good trade for them.
Can you operate the projectors?
Of course I can.
Knowing the Reich Minister as I do, I'm quite positive he wouldn't want the sucees or failure of his illustrious evening,... dependent on the prowess of a negro.
So if it comes to pass we hold this event at your venue, ,talented no doubt he may be, you will oberate the projectors.
Is that exceptable?
Yes.
Cigarette?
They're not French, they're German.
I did have something else I wanted to ask you, but right now, for the life of me, I can't remember what it is.
Oh well, must not of been important.
Till tonight.
I must say, I appreciate the modesty of this auditorium.
Your cinema has real respect, almost church like.
Not to say we couldn't spruce the place up a bit.
I want to go to the Lource, pick up a few Greek nudes, and scatter them about, what do you think?
What the fuck are we supposed to do?
It looks like w're to supposed to have a Nazi premier.
Like I said, what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Well, I need to speak wih you about that.
I'm confused, what are we talking about?
Filling the cinema with Nazis and burning it to the ground.
I'm not talking about that, ou're talking about that.
No, we're talking about that, right now.
If we can keep this place from burning down by ourselves, we can burn it down ourselves.
Yes Soshanna, we could do that.
And with Madame Mimieux's nitrate film print collection, we wouldn't even need explosives right?
You mean we wouldn't need any more explosives?
I am going to burn down the cinema on Nazi night.
Because you love me, and I love you.
And you're the only person on this earth I can trust.
But that's not all w're going to do.
Does the filmmaking equipment in the attic still work?
I know the film camera does.
How about the sound recorder?
Quite well, actually.
I recorded a new guitarist I met in the cafe last week.
It works superb.
Why do we need filmmaking equipment?
Because Marcel, by sweet, we're going to make a film.
Just for the Nazi's.
Chapter Four Operation "Kino"
Nadine, France
...okay, I'm a fictional, literary character from the past, I'm American, and that's controversial.
No it's not controversial.
The nationality of the author, has nothing to do with the nationality of the character.
The character is the character.
Hamlet's not British, he's Danish.
So yes, this character was born in America.
Horay!
Schnapps?
Schnapps?
Schnapps?
Schnapps?
Schnapps?
Five Schnapps.
Well I'm glad that's settled.
If I had a wife, would she be called a squaw?
He's got it!
Is my bloodbrother, Old Shatterhand?
Yes!
Did Karl May write me?
Yes!
I am Winnetou, chief of the Apaches!
Yes!
Hello my lovelies.
I will join you in moments.
I'm finishing up a game with my five new friends here.
No hurry, Frau Von Hammersmark.
Take your time, enjoy yourself.
Eric, my love.
Please go and serve my friends over there.
Von Hammersmark, anything for you.
Three Whiskey.
I thank you all for including me in your game.
Hey, your card!
Let's see.
Gegus Khaun!
I thought this place was supposed to have more French then Germans?
Normally that's true.
The Sargent over there's wifre, just had a baby.
His commanding officer gave him, and his mates the night off to celebrate.
We should leave.
No, we should stay.
For one drink at least.
I've been waiting for you in a bar, it would look strange if we left before we had a drink.
She's right, just be calm, and enjoy your whiskey.
Eric, thank you very much.
Hey, why don't you come and fill in the empty place?
No, no, no.
I can't.
I must help my father.
Oh, you can go and play.
I will help her translate.
Nobody try to mess with her.
Don't worry.
I'll help you out if they try anything.
I am stronger than I look.
Schnapps, Schnapps, Schnapps, Schnapps and Schnapps.
I have something to say.
We drink to the birth of a new son, Maxemillion.
All for max!
There's been some new developments in Operation Kino.
The cinema venue has changed.
Why so?
No one knows.
But that in itself shouldnn't be a problem.
The cinema it's been changed to is considerably smaller then the Ritz.
So whatever materials you brought for The Ritz should be doubly effective here.
Now this next piece of information is colossal, try not to over react.
The Fuhrer, will be attending tomorrow.
Frau Von Hammersmark, I was just thinking could you sign an autograph to my son on his birthday?
I'd love to Wilhelm.
This handsome happy Sargent just became a father today.
So Wilhelm, do you know the name of this progeny yet?
Certainly.
His name is Maximilian.
Wonderful name, Maximilian.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.
Thank you fraulein, thank you.
Max may not know who you are know.
But he will.
I will show him all of your movies.
He will grow up with your films and this napkin on his wall.
I purpose a toast to the greatest actress in Germany!
There is no Dietrich, there is no Riefenstahl, only Von Hammersmark!
Frau Von Hammersmark, what brings you to France?
None of your business, Sargent.
You might not have worn out your welcome with the fraulein with your drunken boorish behavior but you have wore out your welcome with me.
Might I remind you Sargent, you're an enlisted man.
This is an Officers table.
I suggest you stop pestering the fraulein and rejoin your table.
Excuse me Captain, but your accent is very unusual.
Where are you from?
Sargent!
You must be either drunk or mad... to speak to a superior officer with such impertinentness!
I'm making you and you responsible for him!
I suggest you take hold of your friend or he'll spend Max's first birthday in jail for public drunkenness!
Then might I inquire?
Like the young newly christened father, I too have a accute ear for accents.
And like him, I too find yours odd.
From where did you hail, Cap't?
Major, this is highly inappr -
- I wasnt speaking to you Lt. Saltzberg, or you either, Lt. Berlin.
I was speaking to Cap't I-don't-know-what.
I was born in the village that rests in the shadow of Piz Palu.
The mountain?
Yes.
In that village we all speak like this.
Have you seen the Riefenshtal film?
Yes.
Then you saw me.
You remember the skiing torch scene?
Yes i do.
In that scene was myself, my father, my sister, and my two brothers.
My brother is so handsome, the director Pabst, gave him a closeup
Major, if my word means anything, i can vouch for everything the Young Cap't has just said.
He does hail from the bottom of Piz Palu, he was in the film, and his brother is far more handsome than he.
You should rejoin your friends.
May i join you?
By all means, Major.
So that's the source of your bazarr accent?
Extraodinary.
So what are you doing here Cap't?
Aside from having a drink with the lovely fraulien?
Well that pleasure requires no explanation.
I mean in country.
Your obviously not stationed in France, or I'd know who you are.
You know every German in France?
Worth knowing?
Well,
There in lies the problem.
We never claimed to be worth knowing.
All levity aside, what are you doing in France?
Attending Goebbels film premiere as the frauleins escort.
Your the frauleins escort?
Somebody has to carry the lighter.
The Captain is my date, but all three are my guests.
We're old friends Major, who go back a long time.
Longer than an actress would care to admit
Well in that case, let me raise my glass to the three luckiest men in the room.
I'll drink to that
I must say, that game their playing looks like a good bit of fun.
I didnt join them, because your quite right Cap't, officers and enlisted men shouldnt fraternize, ...and sophisticated lady friends of officers.
What say we play the game.
Okay, one game.
wunderbar
So the object of this game, is to write the name of a famous person on your card.
Real Or Fictitious, doesnt matter. for instance, you could write Confucious or Fu Manchu
Eric!
More pens.
And they must be famous.
No aunt Inga's.
When you finish writing, put the card facedown on the table, and move it to the person to your left.
The person to the right, will move their card infront of you.
you pick the card up without looking at it, lick the back, and stick it on your forehead like so.
And in ten yes or no questions, you must guess who you are..... ...So lets give it a try, shall we?
Everybody write your names.
I'll Start, Give you an idea.
Am I German?
No.
Am I American?
No.
Wait a minute, he goes to -
Don't be ridiculous, obviously he wasn't born in America.
So I visited America, aye?
Yes.
Was this visit...fortuitous?
Not for you.
Hummm.
My native land, is it what one would call, exotic?
Yes.
Hummmm.
That could be ether a reference to the jungle, or the Orient.
I'm going to let my first instinct take over, and ask, am I from the jungle?
Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask, weather your real or fictitious.
I however, think that's too easy, so I won't ask that, yet.
Okay, my native land is the jungle?
I visited America, but my visit was not fortuitous to me, but the implication is that it was to somebody else.
When I went from the jungle to America, Did I go by boat?
Did I go against my will?
On this boat ride, Was I in chains?
When I arrived in America....
Was I displayed in chains?
Am I the story of the Negro in America?
Well then I must be King Kong.
Now since I answered correctly, you all need to finish your drinks.
Now, who's next?
Major, I don`t mean to be rude.
But the four of us are very good friends.
And the four of us haven't seen each other in quite a while.
Major, I'm afraid, you are intruding.
I beg to differ Cap't.
It's only if the fraulein considers my presence a intrusion, that I become a intruder.
How about it fraulein?
Am I intruding?
Of course not, Major.
I didn't think so.
It's simply the young Cap't is immune to my charms.
I`m just joking, of course I'm intruding.
Allow me to refill your glasses gentlemen, i and I will bid you and the fraulein adieu.
Eric has a bottle of thirty-three year old single malt scotch whisky from the Scottish highlands.
What do you say gentlemen?
Your most gracious, sir.
Eric, the thirty-three, and new glasses!
You don`t want to contaminate the thirty- three with the swill you were drinking.
How many glasses?
Five glasses.
Not me.
I like scotch, scotch doesn`t like me
Nor I. I`ll stay with bubbly.
Three Glasses.
To a thousand year Reich!
Did you hear that?
That's the sound of my Luger pointed right at your testicles
Why do you have a Lugar pointed at my testicles?
Because you've just given yourself away, Captain.
You're no more German then Scotch.
Well, Major...
Major.
Shut up slut.
You were saying?
I was saying that makes two of us.
I've had a gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.
That makes three of us.
And at this range, I'm a real Fredrick Zoller.
Looks like we have a bit of a sticky situation here.
What's going to happen, Major, is you're going to stand up and walk out that door with us.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't think so.
I'm afraid you and I both know, no matter what happens to anybody else in this room, the two of us aren't going anywhere.
Too bad about them though.
They seem like a likeable bunch.
You will have to shoot them too.
Wilhelm, think about little Maximillian.
I've been rethinking my position in regards to your Paris premiere of "Nations Pride".
As the weeks have gone on, and the Americans are on the beach, I do find myslef thinking more and more about this Private Zoller.
This boy has done something tremendous for us.
And I'm begining to think my participation in this event could be meaningful.
Ahhh, Hugo, you've moved up in the world I see.
Lieutenant.
And with your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.
And that one is Weihelm Wicki.
He's Austrian born jew, who imigrated to the United States when things began turning sour for the Israelites.
They are the two German born members of the Basterds.
They've been known to don german uniforms, to ambush squads.
What brings you all the way out here?
But that doesn't look like this.
This is odd.
I would appear somebody's missing.
Somebody fashionable.
To Max, with love Bridget Von Hammersmark.
Chapter Five Revenge of the Giant Face
Nigt of "Nation's Pride" Premiere
Ready?
Ready.
Action.
But how do we get it developed?
Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop that footage.
How do we get a 35mm print with a soundtrack?
We find somebebody who can develop and process a 35mm print.
And we make them do it, or we kill them.
Bring that fucker over here!
Put his head down on that table.
You either do what the fuck we tell you to, or I'll burry this axe in your collaborating skull.
I'm not a collaborator!
Marcel, does his wife, and childrem know you?
Yes.
Then after we kill this dog for Germans, we'll go and silence them.
Not in the script DiRTYWORK
I want to introduce you to the greatest actor in Germany.
My pleasure.
You have a beautiful cinema.
Fraulein Von Hammersmark.
Colonel Landa, it's been years.
Dasing as ever I see.
So what's happened to your lovely leg?
A product of kicking ass in the German cinema, no doubt.
Save your flattery, you old dog.
I know too many of your former conquests, to fall in that honey pot.
Seriously, what happened?
Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I might add, at mountain climbing.
Mountain climbing?
That's how you injured your leg, mountain climbing?
Believe it or not, yes it is.
Forgive me, fraulein.
I don't mean to laugh at your misforutune It's just mountain climbing?
I'm curious fraulein what could ever compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavour?
Well, I shant be doing it again, I can tell you that.
That cast looks as fresh.
When were you climbing this mountain, last night?
Very good eye, Colonel.
It happened yesterday morning.
And where exactly is in Paris is this mountain?
I'm just teasing you, fraulein.
You know me, I tease rough.
So who are your handsome escorts?
I'm afraid neither three speak a word of German.
Their friends of mine from Italy.
This is a wonderful Italian stuntman, Enzo Gorlomi.
A very talented cameraman, Antonio Margheriti.
And Antonio's camera assistant, Dominick Decocco.
Gentlemen, this is an old friend, Colonel Hans Landa of the S.S.
Hello.
Gentlemen, I must say.
Thank you.
Am I pronouncing it correctly?
Yes, you are correct.
Say it for me once please.
I'm sorry, again?
Once more.
What's your name again?
Again?
One more time!
But let me really hear the music in it!
And you?
Well, my two cameramen friends need to find their seats.
Let me see your tickets.
These are fairly easy seats to find for the Premier.
Seats 0023 and 0024.
I hope you enjoy the film.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Ooh lala, Danielle Darrieux.
I have to go down and socialize with these pigs.
Let's go over it again?
Reel one is on the first projector.
Reel two is on the second.
Three and four are ready to go.
Okay, the big sniper battle in the film begins around the middle of the third reel.
Our film, comes on in the fourth reel, then take your place behind the screen.
Wait for my cue, when I give it to you, then burn it down.
Take your seats!
The show is about to begin!
Everybody take your seats!
Well, we should go find our seats.
Not so fast, let's enjoy some champagne before "Nation's Pride".
Frau Von Hammersmark, may I speak to you in private?
Yes, of course.
Excuse us.
Have a seat fraulein.
Mademoiselle Mimieux has allowed me to use her office.
Let me see your foot.
I beg your parden?
Put your foot in my lap.
Colonel, you embarrass me.
Can you reach inside my coats pocket and give me whats there.
What now Colenel?
The man in the white suit.
Very clever.
Do you have any gum?
It's almost time.
I'll go lock the auditorium and go behind the screen.
Who is it?
Fredrick.
Are you the manager of this cinema?
I want my money back.
That actor in the movie stinks.
What are you doing here?
I came to visit you.
Can't you see how busy I am?
Then allow me to lend my assistance.
Fredrick it's not funny, you can't be here.
This is your premiere, you need to be out there with them.
Normally, you would be right.
And for all the other films I do, I intend to endure evenings like tonight in the proper spirit.
However the fact remains, this film is based on military exploits.
And in this case, my exploits consisted of me killing many men.
Consequently, the part of the film that's playing now, I don't enjoy watching.
Fredrick, I am sorry, but...
So, I though, I'd come up here and do what I do best, annoy you.
And from the look on your face, it would appear I haven't lost my touch.
Are you so use to the Nazi's kissing your ass, you've forgotten what the word "No" means?
No Fredrick, you can't come in here, now go away!
Fredrick, you hurt me.
Well, it's nice to know you can feel something.
Even if it's just physical pain.
I'm not a man you say, "Go away" to.
There's over three hundred dead bodies in Russia, that if they could, would testify to that.
After what I've done for you, you disrespect me at your peril.
Shut the door.
Pardon?
Shut the door so we can have privacy.
May I ask why?
I guess you don't want to help.
You want me to shut the door?
Yes I only said it fifty times!
Fabulous, fabulous!
This is your best work ever.
Thank you Fuhrer.

Chapter One
Once upon a time... in Nazi-occupied France
Go back inside and shut the door.
Julie, get me some water for my wash up then get inside with your sisters.
Ready, Papa.
Thank you, my darling now you go inside with your sisters.
Don't run.
Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?
I am Perrier LaPadite.
It is a pleasure to meet you, Monsieur LaPadite I am Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
What can I do for you?
I was hoping you could invite me inside your home and we may have a discussion.
Certainly.
After you.
Colonel Landa, this is my family.
Colonel Hans Landa of the SS Mademoiselle at your service.
The rumors I have heard in the village about your family are all true.
Each one of your daughters is more lovely than the last.
Merci.
Please have a seat.
Suzanne, would you be so good as to get the Colonel some wine?
But no.
Merci beaucoup, Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine.
This being a dairy farm, one would be safe in assuming you have milk?
Oui.
Then milk is what I prefer.
Very well.
Julie, would you mind closing the window?
Merci.
Monsieur, to both your family and your cows I say, "Bravo."
Thank you.
Please join me at your table.
Very well.
Monsieur LaPadite what we have to discuss would be better discussed in private.
You'll notice I left my men outdoors.
If it wouldn't offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies to step outside?
You are right.
Charlotte, would you take the girls outside?
The Colonel and I need to have a few words.
Monsieur LaPadite I regret to inform you I've exhausted the extent of my French.
To continue to speak it so inadequately would only serve to embarrass me.
However, I've been led to believe you speak English quite well.
Yes.
Well, it just so happens, I do as well.
This being your house I ask your permission to switch to English for the remainder of the conversation.
By all means.
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
- Yes.
- This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
- Only rumors.
- I love rumors!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31.
Continue.
And the children,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
Amos was nine or 10.
- And Shosanna?
- And Shosanna was
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
- That they call you "The Jew Hunter."
- Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels
- that you do with rats, do you?
- No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
Yes.
Monsieur LaPadite I thank you for the milk and your hospitality.
I do believe our business here is done.
Ah, ladies.
I thank you for your time.
We shan't be bothering your family any longer.
So, Monsieur Mademoiselle.
I bid farewell to you and say adieu.
It's the girl.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
Chapter Two
INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5,000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got a little Indian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
How much more of these Jew swine must I endure?
They butcher my men like they were flies!
Do you know the latest rumor they've conjured up in their fear-induced delirium?
The one that beats my boys with a bat!
The one they call "The Bear Jew" is a Golem!
My Führer, this is just soldiers' gossip.
No one really believes "The Bear Jew" is a Golem.
Why not?
They seem to be able to elude capture like an apparition.
They seem to be able to appear and disappear at will.
You want to prove they're flesh and blood?
Then bring them to me!
I will hang them naked, by their heels, from the Eiffel Tower!
And then throw their bodies in the sewers for the rats of Paris to feast!
Kliest!
Yes, my Führer!
I have an order I want relayed to all German soldiers stationed in France.
The Jew degenerate known as "The Bear Jew", henceforth, is never to be referred to as The Bear Jew again.
Yes, my Führer!
Do you still wish to see Private Butz?
Who and what is a Private Butz?
He's the soldier you wanted to see personally.
His squad was ambushed by Lt. Raine's Jews.
He was its only survivor.
Indeed, I do want to see him.
Thank you for reminding me.
Send him in.
Sergeant Rachtmann, Ludwig and I were the only ones left alive after the ambush.
While one man guarded us, the rest removed the hair.
Hey, Hirschberg.
Send that Kraut sarge over.
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
- Yes.
- Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis,
I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard ofAldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
- I heard of The Bear Jew.
- What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse, I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
Donny!
Yeah?
Got us a German here who wants to die for country.
Oblige him.
Did you get that for killing Jews?
Bravery.
Yeah!
Oh, no!
Donny!
Yeah, Donny!
About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you.
Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park!
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!
He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street!
You!
Damn it, Hirschberg!
Donny, bring that other one over here.
Alive!
Get the fuck up!
Batter up.
You're on deck!
Two hits.
I hit you, you hit the ground.
English?
Wicki.
Ask him if he wants to live.
Tell him to point out on this map the German position.
Ask him how many Germans.
Around about 12.
What kind of artillery?
How did you survive this ordeal?
They let me go.
Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
You are not to tell anybody anything.
Not one word of detail!
Your outfit was ambushed, and you got away!
Not one word more!
Yes, my Führer.
Did they mark you like they did the other survivors?
Yes, my Führer.
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
I will hug my mother like I've never hugged her before.
He's going to hug his mother.
Well, ain't that nice?
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
Not only shall I remove it, but I intend to burn it.
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that.
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?
Practice.
Chapter Three
GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS
JUNE
What starts tomorrow?
A Max Linder festival.
I always preferred Linder to Chaplin.
Except Linder never made a film as good as "The Kid."
The chase climax of "The Kid", superb.
I adore your cinema very much.
Merci.
Is it yours?
Do I own it?
Oui.
Oui.
How is it a girl as young as you owns a cinema?
My aunt left it to me.
Merci for hosting a German night.
I don't have a choice but you're welcome.
I love the Riefenstahl mountain films especially Piz Palü.
It's nice to see a French girl who's an admirer of Riefenstahl.
"Admire" would not really be the word I would use to describe my feelings towards Fräulein Riefenstahl.
But you do admire the director Pabst, don't you?
That's why you include his name on the marquee when you didn't have to.
I'm French.
We respect directors in our country.
Even Germans.
Even Germans, oui.
Merci for your assistance, soldier.
Adieu.
You're not finished.
I'll finish in the morning.
May I ask your name?
You wish to see my papers?
Emmanuelle Mimieux.
That's a very pretty name.
Merci.
Are you finished with my papers?
Mademoiselle, may I introduce myself Fredrick Zoller.
Well it's been a pleasure chatting with a fellow cinema lover.
Sweet dreams, mademoiselle.
Adieu.
Hello, mademoiselle.
May I join you?
Look, Fredrick...
You remember my name?
Yes.
Look, you seem a pleasant enough fellow...
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Regardless, I want you to stop pestering me.
I apologize, mademoiselle I wasn't trying to be a pest.
I was simply trying to be friendly.
I don't wish to be your friend.
Why not?
Don't act like an infant.
You know why.
I'm more than just a uniform.
Not to me.
If you are so desperate for a French girlfriend I suggest you try Vichy.
Who are you?
I thought I was just a uniform.
You're not just a German soldier.
Are you somebody's son?
Most German soldiers are somebody's son.
You're a very lucky girl, catching a brave war hero.
No, no, no, no, the mademoiselle is not my girlfriend.
Can you write "Amour Babette"?
So you're a war hero.
What did you do?
I was alone in a bell tower in a walled off city.
It was myself and a thousand rounds of ammo, in a bird's nest against three hundred enemy soldiers.
What's a bird's nest?
A bird's nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower.
It's a high structure, offering a three hundred and sixty degree view.
Very advantageous for marksmen.
How many did you kill?
Sixty-eight.
The first day.
A hundred and fifty the second day.
Thirty-two the third day.
On the fourth day they exited the city.
Naturally, my war story received a lot of attention in Germany that's why they all recognize me.
They call me the German Sergeant York.
Maybe they'll make a film about your exploits.
Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels thought.
So he did and called it "Nation's Pride".
And they wanted me to play myself so I did.
Joseph thinks this movie will be proven to be his masterpiece.
And I will be the German Van Johnson.
"Nation's Pride" is about you?
"Nation's Pride" is starring you?
I know.
Comical?
Well, good luck with your movie, Private.
I hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself.
Goodbye!
- Do you need help?
- No, it's okay.
If you need me, I'll be in the storage room.
Okay, my love.
Mademoiselle Mimieux?
Yes?
Is this your cinema?
Yes.
Come down!
Please.
I don't understand.
What have I done?
She wants to know what she's done.
Get your ass in that car.
It's only the offspring of slaves that allows America to be competitive athletically.
American Olympic gold can be measured in Negro sweat.
Good, you came.
I wasn't sure whether or not you'd accept my invitation.
Invitation?
Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick?
Yes, it is, Dr. Goebbels.
Emmanuelle, there is somebody I want you to meet.
Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to introduce you to the minister of propaganda the leader of the entire German film industry and now that I'm an actor, my boss, Dr. Joseph Goebbels.
Your reputation precedes you, Fräulein Mimieux.
And normally, this is Herr Goebbels' French interpreter Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.
Hello.
Hello.
And you've met the Major.
Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
Major Dieter Hellstrom of the Gestapo.
At your service, mademoiselle.
Please allow me have a seat, please.
Try the champagne, mademoiselle, it's quite good.
I must say, Fräulein, I should be rather annoyed with you.
I arrive in France and I wish to have lunch with my star.
Little do I know he's become the toast of Paris.
And now he must find time for me.
People wait in line hours, days to see me.
For the Führer and Private Zoller, I wait.
So finally, I'm granted an audience with the young Private.
And he spends the entire lunch speaking of you and your cinema.
So Fräulein Mimieux, let's get down to business.
Herr Minister Doctor Goebbels...
I haven't informed her yet.
Unless the girl's a simpleton, I'm sure she's figured it out by now.
After all, she does operate a cinema.
Francesca, tell her.
What they are trying to tell you, Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has spent the last hour at lunch trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels to abandon previous plans for Private Zoller's film premiere and change the venue to your cinema.
What?
I wanted to inform her.
Shit!
I apologize, Private, of course you did.
What's the issue?
The Private wanted to inform the mademoiselle himself.
Nonsense!
Until I ask my questions, he has nothing to inform.
Let the record state, I have not agreed to switch cinemas for my premiere.
Duly noted.
You have opera boxes?
Yes.
How many?
Two.
More would be better.
How many seats in your auditorium?
Three hundred and fifty.
That's almost four hundred less than The Ritz.
But Dr. Goebbels that's not such a terrible thing.
You said yourself you didn't want to indulge every two-faced French bourgeois taking up space, currying favor.
With less seats, it makes the event more exclusive.
You're not trying to fill the house, they're fighting for seats.
Besides, to hell with the French.
This is a German night, a German event, a German celebration.
This night is for you, me for the German military, the high command their family and friends.
The only people who should be allowed in the room are people who will be moved by the exploits on the screen.
I see your public speaking has improved.
It appears I've created a monster.
A strangely persuasive monster.
When the war is over, politics await.
Well, Private though it is true, I'm inclined to indulge you anything...
I must watch a film in this young lady's cinema before I can say, yes or no.
So young lady, you are to close your cinema for a private screening tonight.
What German films do you have?
Ah, Landa, you are here.
Emmanuelle, this is Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
He'll be running the security for the premiere.
Charmed, mademoiselle.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
And now I must get the Reich Minister to his next appointment.
Slave driver.
French slave driver.
Actually, in my role as security chief of this joyous
German occasion, I'm afraid I must have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux.
What sort of discussion?
That sounded suspiciously like a Private questioning the order of a Colonel.
Or am I just being sensitive?
Nothing could be further from the truth, Colonel.
Your authority is beyond question.
But your reputation does precede you.
Should Mademoiselle Mimieux or myself be concerned?
Hans, the boy means no harm he's simply smitten.
And he's correct.
Your reputation does precede you.
No need for concern, you two.
As security chief, I simply need to have a chat with the possible new venue's property owner.
Have you tried the strudel here?
No, no.
It's not so terrible.
So how is it the young Private and yourself came to be acquainted?
Yes, two strudels.
One for myself and one for the mademoiselle.
For me a cup of espresso and for the mademoiselle a glass of milk.
So, mademoiselle, you were beginning to explain...?
Up until a couple of days ago, I had no knowledge of Private Zoller or his exploits.
To me the Private was simply just a patron of my cinema.
We spoke a few times but-
Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.
This is a simple formality.
No reason for you to feel anxious.
I apologize, I forgot to order the cream.
One moment.
Wait for the cream.
So, Emmanuelle.
May I call you Emmanuelle?
Oui.
So, Emmanuelle explain to me how does it happen, that a young lady such as yourself, comes to own a cinema?
After you.
Verdict?
Like I said, not so terrible.
You were explaining the origin of your cinema ownership.
The cinema originally belonged to my aunt and uncle.
What are their names?
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
Where are they now?
My uncle was killed during Blitzkrieg.
Pity.
Continue.
Aunt Ada passed away from fever last spring.
Regrettable.
It's come to my attention you have a Negro in your employ.
Is that true?
Oui.
He is a Frenchman.
His name is Marcel.
He worked with my aunt and uncle since they opened the cinema.
He's the only other one who works with me.
Doing what?
Projectionist.
Is he any good?
The best.
Actually, one could see where that might be a good trade for them.
Can you operate the projectors?
Of course I can.
Knowing the Reich Minister as I do...
I'm quite positive he wouldn't want the success or failure of his illustrious evening dependent on the prowess of a Negro.
So if it comes to pass we hold this event at your venue talented no doubt, as your Negro may be you will operate the projectors.
Is that acceptable?
Oui.
Cigarette?
They are not French.
They are German.
I did have something else I wanted to ask you.
But right now, for the life of me, I can't remember what it is.
Oh, well, must not have been important.
'Til tonight.
I must say, I appreciate the modesty of this cinema.
Your cinema has real respect, almost church like.
Not to say we couldn't spruce the place up a bit.
Maybe I'll go to the Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes, and scatter them about the lobby.
So, Emmanuelle, how did you like "Lucky Kids"?
I quite like Lilian Harvey.
Lilian Harvey!
Never mention that name again in my presence!
Hey what the fuck are we supposed to do?
It looks like we're supposed to have a Nazi premiere.
Like I said, what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Well, I need to talk with you about that.
I'm confused, what are we talking about?
Filling the cinema with Nazis and burning it down to the ground.
I'm not talking about that.
You are talking about that.
No, we're talking about that, right now.
If we can keep this place from burning down by ourselves we can burn it down by ourselves?
Oui, Shosanna, we could do that.
And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate film print collection we wouldn't even need explosives would we?
You mean we wouldn't need any more explosives?
At that time, 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar.
Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle.
- They're films, ain't they?
- Yes.
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.
Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper.
Shosanna has a collection of over 350 nitrate film prints.
I am going to burn down the cinema on Nazi night.
And if I'm going to burn down the cinema which I am we both know, you're not going to let me do it by myself.
Because you love me.
And I love you.
And you're the only person on this earth I can trust.
But that's not all we're going to do.
Does the filmmaking equipment in the attic still work?
I know the film camera does.
How about the sound recorder?
Quite well, actually.
I recorded a new guitarist I met in a cafe last week.
It works superb.
Why do we need filmmaking equipment?
Because Marcel, my sweet we're going to make a film.
Just for the Nazis.
Chapter Four
OPERATION KINO
Right this way, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
- And your occupation before the war?
- I'm a film critic.
- List your accomplishments.
- Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a sub textual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
- What should we drink to, sir?
- Well...
- Down with Hitler.
- All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years,
- but I'm familiar with it.
- Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer,
- how's he doing?
- Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
- What film, sir?
- The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Göring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
- Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
- Bridget von Hammersmark?
The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
- Indeed.
- Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
The village of Nadine
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
- I didn't know.
- You said it was in a tavern.
- It is a tavern.
- Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
- Stiglitz, right?
- That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the death-trap rendezvous?
- She chose the spot.
- Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.
So, I'm male I'm a fictional, literary character from the past I'm American, and that's controversial.
No, it's not controversial at all.
The nationality of the author has nothing to do with the nationality of the character.
The character is the character.
Hamlet is not British.
He is Danish.
So yes, this character was born in America.
Well then.
Mathilda.
Schnapps?
Schnapps?
Schnapps...
Schnapps...
Schnapps.
Five schnapps, please.
If I had a wife would she be called a squaw?
Yes!
He's got it.
Three more questions!
Is my blood brother Old Shatterhand?
Yes!
Did Karl May write me?
Yes!
So who are you?
!
I am "Winnetou", chief of the Apaches!
Yes!
That was good!
That was good!
That was good!
Now down with the glasses!
Cheers.
Attention!
Hello, my lovelies.
Take a seat.
I will join you in moments.
I'm just saying goodbye to my five new friends here.
No hurry, Frau von Hammersmark.
Take your time.
Enjoy yourself.
We'll be just over here waiting.
Eric, my love.
Those are the friends I've been waiting for.
Please treat them to anything they like.
Frau von Hammersmark.
Your wish is my command.
Officers it would appear the drinks are on the fräulein.
- What would you like?
- Whiskey.
Two whiskeys.
- Three whiskeys.
- Three whiskeys, very well.
I wish you a wonderful evening.
- Same to you.
- I thank you.
Your card!
Yes, you're right.
Let's see.
Genghis Khan!
I would never have gotten that.
But of course you would have!
Hello, darling.
How are you?
So good to see you.
I thought this place was supposed to have more French than Germans?
Yes, normally that's true.
The Sergeant over there's wife just had a baby.
And his commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
We should leave.
No.
We should stay.
For one drink at least.
I've been waiting for you in a bar.
It would look strange if we left before we had a drink.
She's right.
Just be calm and enjoy your whiskey.
Mmm.
Mathilda...
She would love to play the game.
I will translate... and protect.
Don't worry, pretty little thing.
If any of these wolves gets out of line, I'll kick their ass in.
Watch.
Rip off his nose.
Stop it!
Schnapps, schnapps, take your schnapps in hand, comrades.
Before we go on playing we will drink.
We drink to our friend Wilhelm.
And his little boy Maximilian.
- To Max!
- To Max!
There's some new development.
The cinema venue has changed.
Why?
No one knows but that should not be a real problem.
The cinema it's been changed to is considerably smaller than The Ritz.
So whatever explosives you brought for The Ritz should be doubly effective here.
Now the next piece of information is colossal.
Try not to overreact.
The Führer-
...I was just thinking could you sign an autograph to my son on his birthday?
Of course.
I'd love to, Wilhelm.
This handsome Staff Sergeant just became a father today.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Do you know the name of this progeny yet?
I most certainly do, fräulein.
His name is Maximilian.
Maximilian, wonderful name.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.
Max may not know who you are now but he will.
I will show him all of your movies.
Good.
He will grow up with your films and this napkin on his wall.
I propose a toast to the greatest actress in Germany!
There is no Dietrich!
There is no Riefenstahl!
Only Von Hammersmark!
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Cheers!
Once again-
Frau Hammersmark, what brings you to France?
None of your business!
Staff Sergeant.
You might not have worn out your welcome with the fräulein with your drunken boorish behavior but you have worn out your welcome with me.
Might I remind you, Staff Sergeant, you are an enlisted man.
This is an officer's table!
I suggest you stop pestering the fräulein and rejoin your table.
Excuse me, Captain, but your accent is very unusual.
Where are you from?
You must be either completely drunk or mad to dare to speak to a superior officer with such impertinentness!
Staff Sergeant.
I'm making you and you responsible for him.
I suggest you take hold of your friend or he'll spend Max's first birthday in jail for public drunkenness.
Might I inquire?
Like our young newly christened father here I, too, have an acute ear for accents.
And like him I, too, find yours odd.
From where do you hail, Captain?
Major, this is highly-
- I wasn't speaking to you, Lieutenant Munich.
Or you either, Lieutenant Frankfurt.
I was speaking to Captain I-don't-know-what.
I was born in a village that rests in the shadow of the Piz Palü.
- The mountain?
- Yes.
In that village, we all speak like this.
Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?
- Yes.
- Then you saw me.
You remember the skiing torch scene?
Yes.
In that scene was myself, my father, my sister and my two brothers.
My brother is so handsome the director Pabst, gave him a Close-Up.
Herr Major, if my word means anything I can vouch for everything the young captain has just said.
He does hail from the bottom of the Piz Palü.
He was in the film and his brother is far more handsome than he.
You should rejoin your friends.
May I join you?
By all means.
Wunderbar!
So that's the source of your bizarre accent.
That's extraordinary.
What are you doing here?
Aside from having a drink with the lovely fräulein?
Well, that pleasure requires no explanation.
I mean in country.
You're obviously not stationed in France or I'd know who you are.
You know every German in France?
Worth knowing.
Well, there lies the problem.
We never claimed to be worth knowing.
All levity aside, what are you doing in France?
Attending Minister Goebbels' film premiere as the fräulein's escort.
You are the Fräulein Hammersmark's escort.
Someone has to carry her lighter.
The captain is my date, but all three are my guests.
We are old friends who go back a long time.
Actually, longer than an actress would care to admit.
Well, in that case let me raise my glass to the three luckiest men in the room.
I'll drink to that.
Queen Christina.
Mata Hari.
I must say that game they're playing looks like a good bit of fun.
I didn't join them because you're quite right, Captain.
An officer should not fraternize with enlisted men.
But seeing as we are all officers and sophisticated lady friends of officers.
What say we play the game?
Yes, great, one game.
Wunderbar.
Soldiers the cards.
Thank you.
So gentlemen the object of the game is to write the name of a famous person on your card.
Real or fictitious, doesn't matter.
For instance, you could write, Confucius or Doctor Fu Manchu.
Eric!
More pens.
And they must be famous, not aunt Frida.
When you finish writing, put the card face down on the table.
And move it to the person on your right-
Thanks.
- the person to your left moves his card to you.
You pick up the card without looking at it lick the back and stick it on your forehead.
Write!
Write.
I'll start, give you the idea.
Am I German?
- No.
- No.
Am I American?
- No.
- No.
Wait a minute, he goes to -
Obviously, he wasn't born in America.
So...
I visited America, aye?
Yes.
Was this visit fortuitous?
Not for you.
My native land, is it what one would call, exotic?
- Yes.
- Yes.
That could be either a reference to the jungle or the Orient.
I'm going to let my first instinct take over and ask.
Am I from the jungle?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask whether you're real or fictitious.
I, however, think that's too easy, so I won't ask that yet.
Okay my native land is the jungle I visited America but my visit was not fortuitous to me but the implication is that it was to somebody else.
When I went from the jungle to America did I go by boat?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Did I go against my will?
- Yes.
- Yes.
On this boat ride, was I in chains?
Yes.
When I arrived in America, was I displayed in chains?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Am I the story of the Negro in America?
No.
Well then I must be King Kong.
Bravo!
Impressive.
Now, since I answered correctly, you all need to finish your drinks.
Cheers.
Now, who is next?
Well, Major I don't mean to be rude.
But the four of us are very good friends.
And we haven't seen each other in quite a while.
So, Major I am afraid you are intruding.
I beg to differ, Captain.
It's only if the fräulein considers my presence an intrusion that I become an intruder.
How about it, Fräulein von Hammersmark?
Am I intruding?
I didn't think so.
It's simply the captain is immune to my charms.
I am just joking.
Just joking.
Of course I'm intruding.
Allow me to refill your glasses, gentlemen, and I will bid you and the fräulein adieu.
Eric has a bottle of thirty-three-year-old whiskey.
From the Scottish Highlands.
What do you say, gentlemen?
You're most gracious, Major.
Eric!
The thirty-three.
And new glasses!
You don't want to contaminate the thirty-three with the swill you were drinking.
How many glasses?
- Five.
- Not for me.
I like scotch, scotch doesn't like me.
Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly.
Three glasses.
Frau von Hammersmark.
Thank you.
A thousand year German Reich!
- A thousand year Reich!
- A thousand year Reich!
I must say I grow weary of these monkeyshines.
Did you hear that?
That was the sound of my Walther.
Pointed right at your testicles.
Why do you have your Walther pointed at my testicles?
Because you've just given yourself away, Captain.
You're no more German than that scotch.
- Well, Major.
- Shut up slut.
You were saying?
I was saying that makes two of us.
I've had a gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.
That makes three of us.
And at this range, I'm a real Fredrick Zoller.
Looks like we have a bit of a sticky situation here.
What's going to happen, Major you're going to stand up and walk out that door with us.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't think so.
I'm afraid you and I we both know, Captain no matter what happens to anybody else in this room the two of us aren't going anywhere.
Too bad about Sergeant Wilhelm and his famous friends.
If any of you expect to live, you'll have to shoot them too.
Looks like little Max will grow up an orphan.
How sad.
Well, if this is it, old boy,
I hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's.
By all means, Captain.
There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch.
Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily,
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
Now, about this pickle we find ourselves in.
It would appear there's only one thing left for you to do.
And what would that be?
- Stiglitz.
- Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls.
You outside.
Who are you?
British?
American?
What?
We're American.
What are you?
I'm a German, you idiot.
Speak English pretty good for a German.
I agree.
So let's talk.
Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
His name is Max.
We were in here drinking, celebrating.
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
It's not my fault!
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
- No.
- I'm alive!
Who's that?
Is the girl on your side?
Which girl?
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.
Yeah, she's ours.
Is she okay?
Wilhelm!
She's been shot.
But she's alive.
Okay, Wilhelm.
What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can I?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
DerFührer is attending the premiere.
I've been rethinking my position in regards to your Paris premiere of "Nation's Pride".
As the weeks have gone on and the Americans are on the beach I do find myself thinking more and more about this Private Zoller.
This boy has done something tremendous for us.
And I'm beginning to think my participation in this event could be meaningful.
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-I-broke-my-leg-mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that rouge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian.
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian.
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian.
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?
You've moved up in the world.
Look at you, Lieutenant First Class.
And with your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.
And that one's name is Wilhelm Wicki.
He's an Austrian-born Jew, who immigrated to the United States when things began turning sour for the Israelites.
They are the two German-born members of the Basterds.
They've been known to don German uniforms, to ambush squads.
What brings you all the way out here?
But that doesn't look like this.
This is odd.
It would appear somebody's missing.
Somebody fashionable.
Everybody out!
"To Max, with love".
Bridget von Hammersmark.
Chapter Five
REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE
Night of "NATION'S PRIDE" premiere
Remember... in English.
Yes.
Action.
But how do we get it developed?
Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop that footage.
And suppose someone would develop the footage how do we get a 35mm print with a soundtrack?
We find somebody who can develop and process a 35mm print with a soundtrack.
And we make them do it or we kill them.
Bring that fucker over here!
Put his head down on that table.
You either do what the fuck we tell you or I'll bury this ax in your collaborating skull.
I'm not a collaborator.
Marcel, do his wife and children know you?
Yes.
Then after we kill this dog for the Germans we'll go and silence them.
Jannings, come on, show the ring.
Come on, come on.
There you go!
Fredrick, have a look at it.
This is the highest artistic honor that I give.
- Herr Doctor, I'm also feeling very honored.
- You deserve it, my dear Jannings!
But I believe after the premiere today, we have a new candidate.
Ah, Emmanuelle I'd like you to meet the greatest actor in the world Emil Jannings.
Mademoiselle, I'm pleased to meet you.
You have a beautiful cinema.
Thank you, Hermann.
Fräulein von Hammersmark.
Colonel Landa, it's been years.
Dashing as ever, I see.
So what's happened to your lovely leg?
A by-product of kicking ass in the German cinema, no doubt.
Save your flattery, you old dog.
I know too many of your former conquests to fall into that honey pot.
Seriously, what happened?
Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I might add at mountain climbing.
And this is the result.
Mountain climbing?
That's how you injured your leg -mountain climbing?
Believe it or not, yes it is.
Forgive me, fräulein.
I don't mean to laugh at your misfortune.
It's just -mountain climbing?
I'm curious, fräulein, what could have ever compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor?
Well, I shan't be doing it again, I can tell you that.
That cast looks as fresh as my old Uncle Gustav.
When were you climbing this mountain, last night?
Very good eye, Colonel.
It happened yesterday morning.
And where in Paris is this mountain?
No, I'm just teasing you, fräulein.
You know me, I tease rough.
So, who are your three handsome escorts?
I'm afraid neither three speak a word of German.
They're friends of mine from Italy.
This is a wonderful Italian stuntman, Enzo Gorlomi.
A very talented cameraman, Antonio Margheriti.
And Antonio's camera assistant Dominick Decocco.
Gentlemen, this is an old friend, Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
Hello.
Gentlemen, it's a pleasure the friends of our cherished star, admired by all of us, this outright jewel of our culture are naturally going to be under my personal protection for the duration of their stay.
Thank you.
Gorlomi?
Am I saying it correctly?
Yes - 'er, correct.
Gorlomi?
Say it for me once please...?
Gorlomi.
I'm sorry, again...?
Gorlomi.
Once more...?
Gorlomi.
What's your name again...?
Antonio Margheriti.
Again...?
Margheriti.
One more time, but let me really hear the music in it!
Margheriti.
Margheriti.
And you...?
Dominick Decocco.
Dominick Decocco.
Well, my two cameraman friends need to find their seats.
Let me see your tickets.
I suppose you getting premiere tickets for your friends wouldn't be the most difficult thing for a star of your status.
0023 and 0024.
That shouldn't be too difficult to find, goodbye.
Ooh la la, Danielle Darrieux.
I have to go down and socialize with these Hun pigs.
Let's go over it again.
Reel one is on the first projector.
Reel two is on the second.
The third one is on the spool.
And the fourth one is ready to go.
Okay, the big sniper battle in the film begins around the middle of the third reel.
Our film comes in on the fourth reel.
Somewhere towards the end of the third reel go down and lock the doors of the auditorium.
Then take your place behind the screen and wait for my cue.
Then burn it down.
Take your seats.
The show is about to begin.
Everybody, please take your seats.
The show is about to begin.
We'll see you later.
Not so fast.
A glass of champagne to toast "Nation's Pride".
My fräulein, may I have a word with you in private?
Certainly.
Excuse us.
Have a seat, my fräulein.
May I?
Mademoiselle Mimieux allowed me to set up camp in her office for the time being.
Let me see your foot.
I beg your pardon?
Put your foot in my lap.
Hans, you embarrass me.
Could you please reach into the right pocket of my coat and give me what you find in there.
May I?
What's that American expression?
"If the shoe fits, you must wear it."
What now, Colonel?
The guy in the white smoking jacket.
Fucking shithead.
Faggot fuck.
Fuck you!
Bunch of shithead fuck.
Fuck you, too!
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches!
Get your hands off me.
You fucking bratwurst-smelling...
God damn you!
Get off!
Hmm.
Clever.
I informed the Führer that the audience has taken their seats.
He should arrive any minute.
Thank you, Hans.
You Jerry-banging, Limburg-smelling...
Let go.
As Stanley said to Livingstone, Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?
Hans Landa.
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.
My hands to be exact.
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you.
Caught you flinching.
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.
Utivich?
Is that you, Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?
The woman?
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot." Yeah, I was just thinking that.
You may leave us.
But stay alert outside.
So you're Aldo the Apache.
- So you're The Jew Hunter.
- I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on Ice?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Göring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Göring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it? "That's a bingo".
You just say, "Bingo".
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
Up there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999.999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?
I implore you.
We must destroy that tower.
Sarge, that tower...
The tower stands!
Gum?
Psst!
Psst!
It's time.
I should go lock the auditorium and take my place behind the screen.
So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
I informed the Führer that the audience has taken their seats.
He should arrive any minute.
Thank you, Hans.
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States ofAmerica to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.
Is that clear, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
Over and out.
Herr Dr. Goebbels, excuse me.
Could I go out for a moment?
Perfectly understandable, my boy.
You go now, and we'll see you after the show.
Who is it?
Fredrick!
Shit.
Are you the manager of this cinema?
I want my money back.
That actor in the movie stinks.
What are you doing here?
I came to visit you.
Can't you see how busy I am?
Then allow me to lend an assist.
Fredrick, it's not funny, you can't be here.
This is your premiere, you need to be out there with them.
Normally, you would be right.
And for all the other films I do I intend to endure evenings like tonight, in the proper spirit.
However, the fact remains this film is based on my military exploits.
And in this case, my exploits consisted of killing many men.
Consequently, the part of the film that's playing now I don't like watching this part.
- I am sorry, Fredrick, but...
- So, I thought I'd come up here and do what I do best annoy you.
And from the look on your face, it would appear I haven't lost my touch.
Are you so used to the Nazis kissing your ass you've forgotten what the word "no" means?
No... you can't be here!
Now go away!
Fredrick, you hurt me.
Well, it's nice to know you can feel something.
Even if it's just physical pain.
I'm not a man you say, "go away" to.
There's over three hundred dead bodies in Italy, that if they could, would testify to that!
After what I've done for you you disrespect me at your peril!
Lock the door.
What?
Lock the door.
We don't have much time.
Time for what?
Forget it!
No, no, no... wait.
You want me to...
lock the door?
For the fifty-seventh time, yes.
When I kill that guy, you got 30 feet to get to that guard.
- Can you do it?
- I have to.
Champagne?
Extraordinary my dear, simply extraordinary!
This is your finest film yet.
Thank you, my Führer.
Thank you.
Who wants to send a message to Germany?
I have a message for Germany.
That you are all going to die.
Enough!
Stop it!
Turn off the projector!
And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who's going to do it!
I don't know what's going on.
That does not belong in my movie!
Marcel, burn it down.
Oui, Shosanna.
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face
of Jewish vengeance.
These are the American lines, Colonel sir.
Excellent, Hermann.
Hermann, uncuff them.
I'm officially surrendering myself over to you, Lieutenant Raine.
We're your prisoners.
How about my knife?
Thank you very much, Colonel.
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back.
Is that really necessary?
I'm a slave to appearances.
Scalp Hermann.
Are you mad?
What have you done?
I made a deal with your general for that man's life!
Yeah, they made that deal.
But they don't give a fuck about him.
They need you.
You'll be shot for this!
Nah, I don't think so.
More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.
You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?
- I'd make that deal.
- I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command,
I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island,
I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know something, Utivich?
I think this just might be my masterpiece.
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
Yes.
This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
Only rumors.
I love rumors!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31.

And the children,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
Amos was nine or 10.
And Shosanna?
And Shosanna was
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
That they call you "The Jew Hunter."
Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
Yes.
It's the girl.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5, 000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got a little Indian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!
Hey, Hirschberg.
Send that Kraut sarge over.
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
Yes.
Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse,
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
Donny!
Yeah?
Got us a German here who wants to die for country.
Oblige him.
Did you get that for killing Jews?
Bravery.
Yeah!
Oh, no!
- Oh, no!
Donny!
Yeah, Donny!
About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you.
Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park!
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!
He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street!
You!
Damn it, Hirschberg!
Donny, bring that other one over here.
Alive!
Get the fuck up!
Batter up.
You're on deck!
Two hits.
I hit you, you hit the ground.
English?
Wicki.
Ask him if he wants to live.
Tell him to point out on this map the German position.
Ask him how many Germans.
Around about 12.
What kind of artillery?
Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
He's going to hug his mother.
Well, ain't that nice?
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that.
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?
Practice.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
At that time, 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar.
Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle.
They're films, ain't they?
- Yes.
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.
Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper.
Shosanna has a collection of over 350 nitrate film prints.
Right this way, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
And your occupation before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
What should we drink to, sir?
Well...
Down with Hitler.
All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer, how's he doing?
Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film, sir?
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
Bridget von Hammersmark?
The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
Indeed.
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was in a tavern.
It is a tavern.
Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
Stiglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.
Mmm.
Well, if this is it, old boy,
I hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's.
By all means, Captain.
There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch.
Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily,
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
Now, about this pickle we find ourselves in.
It would appear there's only one thing left for you to do.
And what would that be?
Stiglitz.
Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls.
You outside.
Who are you?
British?
American?
What?
We're American.
What are you?
I'm a German, you idiot.
Speak English pretty good for a German.
I agree.
So let's talk.
Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
His name is Max.
We were in here drinking, celebrating.
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
It's not my fault!
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
No.
I'm alive!
Who's that?
Is the girl on your side?
Which girl?
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.
Yeah, she's ours.
Is she okay?
Wilhelm!
She's been shot.
But she's alive.
Okay, Wilhelm.
What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can I?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg- mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian.
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian.
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian.
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?
Yes.
Gorlomi?
Gorlomi.
Gorlomi.
Antonio Margheriti.
Margheriti.
Margheriti.
Dominick Decocco.
Dominick Decocco.
What's that American expression?
"If the shoe fits, you must wear it."
Fucking shithead.
Faggot fuck.
Fuck you!
Bunch of shithead fuck.
Fuck you, too!
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches!
Get your hands off me.
You fucking bratwurst-smelling...
Goddamn you!
Get off!
Hmm.
You Jerry-banging, Limburg-smelling...
As Stanley said to Livingstone,
Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?
Hans Landa.
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.
My hands to be exact.
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you.
Caught you flinching.
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.
Utivich?
Is that you, Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?
The woman?
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot."
- Yeah, I was just thinking that.
So you're Aldo the Apache.
So you're The Jew Hunter.
I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on Ice?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it?
"That's a bingo."
You just say, "Bingo."
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
Up there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999. 999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?
I implore you.
We must destroy that tower.
Sarge, that tower...
The tower stands!
Psst!
Psst!
So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.
Is that clear, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
Over and out.
When I kill that guy, you got 30 feet to get to that guard.
Can you do it?
I have to.
Champagne?
Who wants to send a message to Germany?
I have a message for Germany.
That you are all going to die.
And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who's going to do it!
Marcel, burn it down.
Oui, Shosanna.
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face
of Jewish vengeance.
Hermann, uncuff them.
I'm officially surrendering myself over to you, Lieutenant Raine.
We're your prisoners.
How about my knife?
Thank you very much, Colonel.
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back.
Is that really necessary?
I'm a slave to appearances.
Scalp Hermann.
Are you mad?
What have you done?
I made a deal with your general for that man's life!
Yeah, they made that deal.
But they don't give a fuck about him.
They need you.
You'll be shot for this!
Nah, I don't think so.
More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.
You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?
I'd make that deal.
I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command,
I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island,
I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know something, Utivich?
I think this just might be my masterpiece.
Subtitles by LeapinLar
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
Yes.
This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard... that the Fuehrer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France... who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Feuhrer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews... and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts, most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts... and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for... except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape... or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
Only rumors.
I love rumors.
Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me... the exact members of the household and their names?
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31.
Continue.
And the children,
Amos... and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
Amos was nine or 10.
And Shosanna?
And Shosanna was... 18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
That they call you 'The Jew Hunter.'
Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker... the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name 'the Hangman' is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title... precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew... where they can only think like a German.
More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute... the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Fuehrer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you... to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels... that you do with rats, do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking... would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search... of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria... and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of... once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates... that I must have my men enter your home... and conduct a thorough search... before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me... that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information... that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way... by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
Yes.
It's the girl.
Au revoir, Shosanna.
Ten-hut.
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5,000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily... and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac... and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got a little lndian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty... in the disemboweled, dismembered... and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves... but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night... and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
Yes, sir.
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying.
Hey, Hirschberg.
Send that Kraut sarge over.
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what 'sit down' means, Werner?
Yes.
Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity... among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin... to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis...
I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive... depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another
Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me... what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're... wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours... and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse,
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death... is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
Donny.
Yeah?
Got us a German here who wants to die for country.
Oblige him.
Did you get that for killing Jews?
Bravery.
Yeah.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.
Donny.
Yeah, Donny.
About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you.
Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park.
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame.
He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street.
You.
Damn it, Hirschberg.
Donny, bring that other one over here.
Alive.
Get the fuck up.
Batter up.
You're on deck.
Two hits.
I hit you, you hit the ground.
English?
Wicki.
Ask him if he wants to live.
Tell him to point out on this map the German position.
Ask him how many Germans.
Around about 12.
What kind of artillery?
Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks... what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
He's going to hug his mother.
Well, ain't that nice?
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that.
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?
Practice.
Au revoir, Shosanna.
At that time, 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable... that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar.
Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle.
They're films, ain't they?
Yes.
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.
Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper.
Shosanna has a collection... of over 350 nitrate film prints.
Right this way, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
And your occupation before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a sub textual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
What should we drink to, sir?
Well...
Down with Hitler.
All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry... under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making... to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers... the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer, how's he doing?
Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film, sir?
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion... will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command... including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines... will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
Bridget von Hammersmark?
The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
Indeed.
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was in a tavern.
It is a tavern.
Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
Stiglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure... no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose... idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.
Mmm.
Well, if this is it, old boy,
I hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's.
By all means, Captain.
There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch.
Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily,
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
Now, about this pickle... we find ourselves in.
It would appear there's only one thing left for you to do.
And what would that be?
Stiglitz.
Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls.
You outside.
Who are you?
British?
American?
What?
We're American.
What are you?
I'm a German, you idiot.
Speak English pretty good for a German.
I agree.
So let's talk.
Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
H is name is Max.
We were in here drinking, celebrating.
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
It's not my fault.
Okay.
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
No.
I'm alive.
Who's that?
Is the girl on your side?
Which girl?
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.
Yeah, she's ours.
Is she okay?
Wilhelm.
She's been shot.
But she's alive.
Okay, Wilhelm.
What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can I?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father.
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans... and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms... with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes.
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.
Fuck a duck.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf... makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg- mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears... and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian.
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian.
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian.
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?
Yes.
Gorlomi?
Gorlomi.
Gorlomi.
Antonio Margheriti.
Margheriti.
Margheriti.
Dominick Decocco.
What's that American expression?
'If the shoe fits, you must wear it.'
Fucking shithead.
Faggot fuck.
Fuck you.
Bunch of shithead fuck.
Fuck you, too.
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches.
Get your hands off me.
You fucking bratwurst-smelling...
Goddamn you.
Get off.
Hmm.
You Jerry-banging, Limburg-smelling...
As Stanley said to Livingstone,
Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?
Hans Landa.
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.
My hands to be exact.
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you.
Caught you flinching.
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.
Utivich?
Is that you, Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?
The woman?
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression about shoes and feet?
'Looks like the shoe is on the other foot.' Yeah, I was just thinking that.
So you're Aldo the Apache.
So you're The Jew Hunter.
I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate... every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on lce?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys... without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you... for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war... tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention... of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
That's a bingo.
Is that the way you say it?
'That's a bingo.'
You just say, 'Bingo.'
Bingo.
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah.
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it... is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio... with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
U p there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family... selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999.999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?
I implore you.
We must destroy that tower.
Sarge, that tower...
The tower stands.
Psst.
Psst.
So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino... from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel... was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil... to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite... in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor... for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino... to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States of America... to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island... as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved... by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party... to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck... and bring them straight to me for debriefing.
Is that clear, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
Over and out.
When I kill that guy, you got 30 feet to get to that guard.
Can you do it?
I have to.
Champagne?
Who wants to send a message to Germany?
I have a message for Germany.
That you are all going to die.
And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who's going to do it.
Marcel, burn it down.
Oui, Shosanna.
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face... of Jewish vengeance.
Hermann, uncuff them.
I'm officially surrendering myself over to you, Lieutenant Raine.
We're your prisoners.
How about my knife?
Thank you very much, Colonel.
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back.
Is that really necessary?
I'm a slave to appearances.
Scalp Hermann.
Are you mad?
What have you done?
I made a deal with your general for that man's life.
Yeah, they made that deal.
But they don't give a fuck about him.
They need you.
You'll be shot for this.
Nah, I don't think so.
More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.
You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?
I'd make that deal.
I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command,
I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island,
I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know something, Utivich?
I think this just might be my masterpiece.
{DISTANT RUMBLING}
{SPEAKING FRENCH Papa}
{MEN SPEAKING GERMAN}
{SPEAKING FRENCH}
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
Yes.
This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard that the Few has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Few couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur Lapidate.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Dolores, Rollins, the Lovett's and the Defuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
Please,monsieurLapidate, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Defuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Defuses, monsieur Lapidate?
Only rumours.
I love rumours!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumours, true or false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur Lapidate, what rumours have you heard regarding the Defuses?
{CLEARS THROAT}
Again, this is just a rumour, but we heard the Defuses had made their way into Spain.
{MATCHSTICKS SCRAPING}
So, the rumours you've heard have been of escape?
{AGREES IN FRENCH}
Yes.
Having never met the Defuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
{CLEARS THROAT}
There were five of them.
The Father, Jacob.
Wife, Miriam.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31.
Continue.
And the children,
Amos and Shoshanna.
Ages of the children?
Amos was nine or 10.
And Shoshanna?
And Shoshanna was
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
{ZIPPER CLOSING}
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur Lapidate, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
{THANKING IN FRENCH}
That they call you "The Jew Hunter. "
Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Hedrick apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Father and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
{AGREES IN FRENCH}
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Father has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
Yes.
{SPEAKING FRENCH}
It's the girl.
Au devoir, Shoshanna!
{FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING}
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Rayne.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumours about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5,000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi isn't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got a little Indian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disembowelled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!

Hey, Hirschberg.
Send that Kraut serge over.
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Ranchman.
Lieutenant Aldo Rayne.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
Yes.
Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stieglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stieglitz.
{BASTERDS LAUGHING}
The reason for Hugo Stieglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Bustards heard about him, he never got there.
Sergeant Hugo Stieglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Rayne.
These are the Bustards.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis... {MAN GROANING}
...I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
{BASTERDS LAUGHING}
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
{BASTERDS WHOOPING}
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we isn't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
Oh,yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
{BAT TAPPING}
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse,
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
{BASTERDS LAUGHING}
{BASTERDS APPLAUDING}
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
Donny!

Oblige him.

{BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN}
Around about 12.

{BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN}
{SPEAKING GERMAN}
Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
{SPEAKING GERMAN}
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
{SPEAKING GERMAN}
WICKl:
He's going to hug his mother.
Well, isn't that nice?
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
{WICKl SPEAKING GERMAN}
{BUTZ SPEAKING GERMAN}
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
{SPEAKING GERMAN}
But you take off that uniform, isn't nobody going to know yours a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.

{FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING}
Right this way, Lieutenant.
{CLEARS THROAT}
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
And your occupation before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a sub textual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
What should we drink to, sir?
Well...
Down with Hitler.
All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer, how's he doing?
Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film, sir?
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Bustards.
The Bustards.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometres outside of Paris.
The Bustards will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiana.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Bustards.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
Your contact is Bridget von Hammers mark.
Bridget von Hammers mark?
TheGermanmovie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
Indeed.
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was in a tavern.
It is a tavern.
Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
Stieglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stieglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammers mark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammers mark, whose idea was it for the death-trap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.

There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch.
Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily,
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
Now, about this pickle we find ourselves in.
It would appear there's only one thing left for you to do.
And what would that be?
Stieglitz.
Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls.
{DOOR OPENING}

You outside.
Who are you?
British?
American?
What?
We're American.
What are you?
I'm a German, you idiot.
Speak English pretty good for a German.
I agree.
So let's talk.
Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
H is name is Max.
We were in here drinking, celebrating.
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
It's not my fault!
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
No.
I'm alive!
{SHOUTING IN GERMAN}
Who's that?
Is the girl on your side?
Which girl?
Who do you think?
Von Hammers mark.
Yeah, she's ours.
Is she okay?
{SPEAKING GERMAN}
Wilhelm!
{SHOUTING IN GERMAN}
She's been shot.
But she's alive.
{SPEAKING GERMAN}
Okay, Wilhelm.
What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willie.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willie?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willie.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can I?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
Hey, Willie, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff isn't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.
{SPEAKING GERMAN}
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
{VON HAMMERSMARK GROANING}
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
{SPEAKING FRENCH}
{DOGS BARKING}
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willie.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
{BREATHING DEEPLY}
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.
{SPEAKING GERMAN}
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different colour.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your game.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-I-broke-my-leg- mountain-climbing story.
That's German, isn't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that rouge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian.
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian.
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian.
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?

Lieutenant Aldo Rayne, I presume?
Hans Linda.
{TRUCK ENGINE STARTING}
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.
My hands to be exact.
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you.
Caught you flinching.
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.
Univac?
Is that you, Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?
The woman?
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot. " Yeah, I was just thinking that.
{SPEAKING GERMAN}
So you're Aldo the Apache.
So you're The Jew Hunter.
I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammers mark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammers mark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your peasants, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on Ice?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there isn't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Univac?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it? "That's a bingo. "
You just say, "Bingo. "
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
U p there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behoves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it isn't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999. 999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?
{PEOPLE ON FILM SHOUTING}

{PEOPLE CHEERING}
So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Rayne's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
{SPEAKING GERMAN}
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honour for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honour.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Rayne?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Linda will put you and Private Univac in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Linda and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.
Is that clear, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.

Thank you very much, Colonel.
Univac, cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back.
Is that really necessary?
I'm a slave to appearances.
Scalp Hermann.
Are you mad?
What have you done?
I made a deal with your general for that man's life!
Yeah, they made that deal.
But they don't give a fuck about him.
They need you.
You'll be shot for this!
Nah, I don't think so.
More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.
You know, Univac and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Univac?
You make that deal?
I'd make that deal.
I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command,
I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island,
I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Isn't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Univac, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd swear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that isn't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
{HANS SCREAMING}
You know something, Univac?
I think this just might be my masterpiece.

Go back inside and shut the door.
Julie, get me some water for my wash up then get inside with your sisters.
Ready, Papa.
Thank you, my darling now you go inside with your sisters.
Don't run.
Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?
I am Perrier LaPadite.
It is a pleasure to meet you, Monsieur LaPadite I am Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
What can I do for you?
I was hoping you could invite me inside your home and we may have a discussion.
Certainly.
After you.
Colonel Landa, this is my family.
Colonel Hans Landa of the SS Mademoiselle at your service.
The rumors I have heard in the village about your family are all true.
Each one of your daughters is more lovely than the last.
Merci.
Please have a seat.
Suzanne, would you be so good as to get the Colonel some wine?
But no.
Merci beaucoup, Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine.
This being a dairy farm, one would be safe in assuming you have milk?
Oui.
Then milk is what I prefer.
Very well.
Julie, would you mind closing the window?
Merci.
Monsieur, to both your family and your cows I say, "Bravo."
Thank you.
Please join me at your table.
Very well.
Monsieur LaPadite what we have to discuss would be better discussed in private.
You'll notice I left my men outdoors.
If it wouldn't offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies to step outside?
You are right.
Charlotte, would you take the girls outside?
The Colonel and I need to have a few words.
Monsieur LaPadite I regret to inform you I've exhausted the extent of my French.
To continue to speak it so inadequately would only serve to embarrass me.
However, I've been led to believe you speak English quite well.
Yes.
Well, it just so happens, I do as well.
This being your house I ask your permission to switch to English for the remainder of the conversation.
By all means.
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
Yes.
This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
Only rumors.
I love rumors!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31.
Continue.
And the children,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
Amos was nine or 10.
And Shosanna?
And Shosanna was
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
That they call you "The Jew Hunter."
Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
Yes.
Monsieur LaPadite I thank you for the milk and your hospitality.
I do believe our business here is done.
Ah, ladies.
I thank you for your time.
We shan't be bothering your family any longer.
So, Monsieur Mademoiselle.
I bid farewell to you and say adieu.
It's the girl.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
Chapter Two
Chapter Two INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS
Ten-hut!
Chapter Two INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5, 000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got a little Indian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
How much more of these Jew swine must I endure?
They butcher my men like they were flies!
Do you know the latest rumor they've conjured up in their fear-induced delirium?
The one that beats my boys with a bat!
The one they call "The Bear Jew" is a Golem!
My FÃ¼hrer, this is just soldiers' gossip.
No one really believes "The Bear Jew" is a Golem.
Why not?
They seem to be able to elude capture like an apparition.
They seem to be able to appear and disappear at will.
You want to prove they're flesh and blood?
Then bring them to me!
I will hang them naked, by their heels, from the Eiffel Tower!
And then throw their bodies in the sewers for the rats of Paris to feast!
Kliest!
Yes, my FÃ¼hrer!
I have an order I want relayed to all German soldiers stationed in France.
The Jew degenerate known as "The Bear Jew," henceforth, is never to be referred to as The Bear Jew again.
Yes, my FÃ¼hrer!
Do you still wish to see Private Butz?
Who and what is a Private Butz?
He's the soldier you wanted to see personally.
His squad was ambushed by Lt. Raine's Jews.
He was its only survivor.
Indeed, I do want to see him.
Thank you for reminding me.
Send him in.
Sergeant Rachtmann, Ludwig and I were the only ones left alive after the ambush.
While one man guarded us, the rest removed the hair.
Hey, Hirschberg.
Send that Kraut sarge over.
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
Yes.
Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse,
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
Donny!
Yeah?
Got us a German here who wants to die for country.
Oblige him.
Did you get that for killing Jews?
Bravery.
Yeah!
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!
Donny!
Yeah, Donny!
About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you.
Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park!
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!
He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street!
You!
Damn it, Hirschberg!
Donny, bring that other one over here.
Alive!
Get the fuck up!
Batter up.
You're on deck!
Two hits.
I hit you, you hit the ground.
English?
Wicki.
Ask him if he wants to live.
Tell him to point out on this map the German position.
Ask him how many Germans.
Around about 12.
What kind of artillery?
How did you survive this ordeal?
They let me go.
Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
You are not to tell anybody anything.
Not one word of detail!
Your outfit was ambushed, and you got away!
Not one word more!
Yes, my FÃ¼hrer.
Did they mark you like they did the other survivors?
Yes, my FÃ¼hrer.
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
I will hug my mother like I've never hugged her before.
He's going to hug his mother.
Well, ain't that nice?
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
Not only shall I remove it, but I intend to burn it.
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that.
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?
Practice.
Chapter Three
Chapter Three GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS
1 944
JUNE
What starts tomorrow?
A Max Linder festival.
I always preferred Linder to Chaplin.
Except Linder never made a film as good as "The Kid."
The chase climax of "The Kid," superb.
I adore your cinema very much.
Merci.
Is it yours?
Do I own it?
-Oui.
Oui.
How is it a girl as young as you owns a cinema?
My aunt left it to me.
Merci for hosting a German night.
I don't have a choice but you're welcome.
I love the Riefenstahl mountain films especially Piz PalÃ¼.
It's nice to see a French girl who's an admirer of Riefenstahl.
"Admire" would not really be the word I would use to describe my feelings towards FrÃ¤ulein Riefenstahl.
But you do admire the director Pabst, don't you?
That's why you include his name on the marquee when you didn't have to.
I'm French.
We respect directors in our country.
Even Germans.
Even Germans, oui.
Merci for your assistance, soldier.
Adieu.
You're not finished.
I'll finish in the morning.
May I ask your name?
You wish to see my papers?
Emmanuelle Mimieux.
That's a very pretty name.
Merci.
Are you finished with my papers?
Mademoiselle, may I introduce myself Fredrick Zoller.
Well it's been a pleasure chatting with a fellow cinema lover.
Sweet dreams, mademoiselle.
Adieu.
Hello, mademoiselle.
May I join you?
Look, Fredrick...
You remember my name?
Yes.
Look, you seem a pleasant enough fellow...
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Regardless, I want you to stop pestering me.
I apologize, mademoiselle I wasn't trying to be a pest.
I was simply trying to be friendly.
I don't wish to be your friend.
Why not?
Don't act like an infant.
You know why.
I'm more than just a uniform.
Not to me.
If you are so desperate for a French girlfriend I suggest you try Vichy.
Who are you?
I thought I was just a uniform.
You're not just a German soldier.
Are you somebody's son?
Most German soldiers are somebody's son.
You're a very lucky girl, catching a brave war hero.
--No, no, no, no, the mademoiselle is not my girlfriend.
Can you write "Amour Babette"?
So you're a war hero.
What did you do?
I was alone in a bell tower in a walled off city.
It was myself and a thousand rounds of ammo, in a bird's nest against three hundred enemy soldiers.
What's a bird's nest?
A bird's nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower.
It's a high structure, offering a three hundred and sixty degree view.
Very advantageous for marksmen.
How many did you kill?
Sixty-eight.
The first day.
A hundred and fifty the second day.
Thirty-two the third day.
On the fourth day they exited the city.
Naturally, my war story received a lot of attention in Germany that's why they all recognize me.
They call me the German Sergeant York.
Maybe they'll make a film about your exploits.
Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels thought.
So he did and called it "Nation's Pride."
And they wanted me to play myself so I did.
Joseph thinks this movie will be proven to be his masterpiece.
And I will be the German Van Johnson.
"Nation's Pride" is about you?
"Nation's Pride" is starring you?
I know.
Comical?
Well, good luck with your movie, Private.
I hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself.
Goodbye!
Do you need help?
No, it's okay.
If you need me, I'll be in the storage room.
Okay, my love.
Mademoiselle Mimieux?
Yes?
Is this your cinema?
Yes.
Come down!
Please.
I don't understand.
What have I done?
She wants to know what she's done.
Get your ass in that car.
It's only the offspring of slaves that allows America to be competitive athletically.
American Olympic gold can be measured in Negro sweat.
Good, you came.
I wasn't sure whether or not you'd accept my invitation.
Invitation?
Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick?
Yes, it is, Dr. Goebbels.
Emmanuelle, there is somebody I want you to meet.
Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to introduce you to the minister of propaganda the leader of the entire German film industry and now that I'm an actor, my boss, Dr. Joseph Goebbels.
Your reputation precedes you, FrÃ¤ulein Mimieux.
And normally, this is Herr Goebbels' French interpreter Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.
Hello.
And you've met the Major.
Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
Major Dieter Hellstrom of the Gestapo.
At your service, mademoiselle.
Please allow me have a seat please.
Try the champagne, mademoiselle, it's quite good.
I must say, FrÃ¤ulein, I should be rather annoyed with you.
I arrive in France and I wish to have lunch with my star.
Little do I know he's become the toast of Paris.
And now he must find time for me.
People wait in line hours, days to see me.
For the FÃ¼hrer and Private Zoller, I wait.
So finally, I'm granted an audience with the young Private.
And he spends the entire lunch speaking of you and your cinema.
So FrÃ¤ulein Mimieux, let's get down to business.
--Herr Minister Doctor Goebbels...
I haven't informed her yet.
Unless the girl's a simpleton, I'm sure she's figured it out by now.
After all, she does operate a cinema.
Francesca, tell her.
What they are trying to tell you, Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has spent the last hour at lunch trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels to abandon previous plans for Private Zoller's film premiere and change the venue to your cinema.
What?
I wanted to inform her.
Shit!
I apologize, Private, of course you did.
--What's the issue?
The Private wanted to inform the mademoiselle himself.
Nonsense!
Until I ask my questions, he has nothing to inform.
Let the record state, I have not agreed to switch cinemas for my premiere.
Duly noted.
You have opera boxes?
Yes.
How many?
Two.
More would be better.
How many seats in your auditorium?
Three hundred and fifty.
That's almost four hundred less than The Ritz.
--But Dr. Goebbels that's not such a terrible thing.
You said yourself you didn't want to indulge every two-faced French bourgeois taking up space, currying favor.
With less seats, it makes the event more exclusive.
You're not trying to fill the house, they're fighting for seats.
Besides, to hell with the French.
This is a German night, a German event, a German celebration.
This night is for you, me for the German military, the high command their family and friends.
The only people who should be allowed in the room are people who will be moved by the exploits on the screen.
I see your public speaking has improved.
It appears I've created a monster.
A strangely persuasive monster.
When the war is over, politics await.
Well, Private though it is true, I'm inclined to indulge you anything...
I must watch a film in this young lady's cinema before I can say, yes or no.
So young lady, you are to close your cinema for a private screening tonight.
What German films do you have?
Ah, Landa, you are here.
Emmanuelle, this is Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
He'll be running the security for the premiere.
Charmed, mademoiselle.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
And now I must get the Reich Minister to his next appointment.
Slave driver.
French slave driver.
Actually, in my role as security chief of this joyous German occasion, I'm afraid I must have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux.
What sort of discussion?
That sounded suspiciously like a Private questioning the order of a Colonel.
Or am I just being sensitive?
Nothing could be further from the truth, Colonel.
Your authority is beyond question.
But your reputation does precede you.
Should Mademoiselle Mimieux or myself be concerned?
Hans, the boy means no harm he's simply smitten.
And he's correct.
Your reputation does precede you.
No need for concern, you two.
As security chief, I simply need to have a chat with the possible new venue's property owner.
Have you tried the strudel here?
No, no.
It's not so terrible.
So how is it the young Private and yourself came to be acquainted?
Yes, two strudels.
One for myself and one for the mademoiselle.
For me a cup of espresso and for the mademoiselle a glass of milk.
So, mademoiselle, you were beginning to explain...?
Up until a couple of days ago, I had no knowledge of Private Zoller or his exploits.
To me the Private was simply just a patron of my cinema.
We spoke a few times but- -Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.
This is a simple formality.
No reason for you to feel anxious.
I apologize, I forgot to order the cream.
--One moment.
Wait for the cream.
So, Emmanuelle.
May I call you Emmanuelle?
Oui.
So, Emmanuelle explain to me how does it happen, that a young lady such as yourself, comes to own a cinema?
After you.
Verdict?
Like I said, not so terrible.
You were explaining the origin of your cinema ownership.
The cinema originally belonged to my aunt and uncle.
What are their names?
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
Where are they now?
My uncle was killed during Blitzkrieg.
Pity.
Continue.
Aunt Ada passed away from fever last spring.
Regrettable.
It's come to my attention you have a Negro in your employ.
Is that true?
Oui.
He is a Frenchman.
His name is Marcel.
He worked with my aunt and uncle since they opened the cinema.
He's the only other one who works with me.
Doing what?
Projectionist.
Is he any good?
The best.
Actually, one could see where that might be a good trade for them.
Can you operate the projectors?
Of course I can.
Knowing the Reich Minister as I do...
I'm quite positive he wouldn't want the success or failure of his illustrious evening dependent on the prowess of a Negro.
So if it comes to pass we hold this event at your venue talented no doubt, as your Negro may be you will operate the projectors.
Is that acceptable?
Oui.
Cigarette?
They are not French.
They are German.
I did have something else I wanted to ask you.
But right now, for the life of me, I can't remember what it is.
Oh well, must not have been important.
'Til tonight.
I must say, I appreciate the modesty of this cinema.
Your cinema has real respect, almost church like.
Not to say we couldn't spruce the place up a bit.
Maybe I'll go to the Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes, and scatter them about the lobby.
So, Emmanuelle, how did you like "Lucky Kids"?
I quite like Lilian Harvey.
Lilian Harvey!
Never mention that name again in my presence!
Hey what the fuck are we supposed to do?
It looks like we're supposed to have a Nazi premiere.
Like I said, what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Well, I need to talk with you about that.
I'm confused, what are we talking about?
Filling the cinema with Nazis and burning it down to the ground.
I'm not talking about that.
You are talking about that.
No, we're talking about that, right now.
If we can keep this place from burning down by ourselves we can burn it down by ourselves?
Oui Shosanna, we could do that.
And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate film print collection we wouldn't even need explosives would we?
You mean we wouldn't need any more explosives?
At that time, 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable You mean we wouldn't need any more explosives?
At that time, 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar.
Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle.
They're films, ain't they?
Yes.
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.
Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper.
Shosanna has a collection of over 350 nitrate film prints.
I am going to burn down the cinema on Nazi night.
And if I'm going to burn down the cinema which I am we both know, you're not going to let me do it by myself.
Because you love me.
And I love you.
And you're the only person on this earth I can trust.
But that's not all we're going to do.
Does the filmmaking equipment in the attic still work?
I know the film camera does.
How about the sound recorder?
Quite well, actually.
I recorded a new guitarist I met in a cafe last week.
It works superb.
Why do we need filmmaking equipment?
Because Marcel, my sweet we're going to make a film.
Just for the Nazis.
Chapter Four
Chapter Four OPERATION KINO
Right this way, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
And your occupation before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
What should we drink to, sir?
Well...
Down with Hitler.
All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer, how's he doing?
Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film, sir?
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
Bridget von Hammersmark?
The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
Indeed.
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
The village of Nadine
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
The village of Nadine
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was in a tavern.
It is a tavern.
Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
Stiglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.
--So, I'm male I'm a fictional, literary character from the past I'm American, and that's controversial.
No, it's not controversial at all.
The nationality of the author has nothing to do with the nationality of the character.
The character is the character.
Hamlet is not British.
He is Danish.
So yes, this character was born in America.
Well then.
Mathilda.
Schnapps?
Schnapps...
Schnapps...
Schnapps.
Five schnapps, please.
If I had a wife would she be called a squaw?
Yes!
He's got it.
Three more questions!
Is my blood brother Old Shatterhand?
Yes!
Did Karl May write me?
Yes!
So who are you?
!
I am "Winnetou," chief of the Apaches!
Yes!
That was good!
That was good!
That was good!
Now down with the glasses!
Cheers.
Attention!
Hello, my lovelies.
Take a seat.
I will join you in moments.
I'm just saying goodbye to my five new friends here.
No hurry, Frau von Hammersmark.
Take your time.
Enjoy yourself.
We'll be just over here waiting.
Eric, my love.
Those are the friends I've been waiting for.
Please treat them to anything they like.
Frau von Hammersmark.
Your wish is my command.
Officers it would appear the drinks are on the frÃ¤ulein.
What would you like?
Whiskey.
Two whiskeys.
Three whiskeys.
Three whiskeys, very well.
I wish you a wonderful evening.
-Same to you.
-I thank you.
Your card!
Yes, you're right.
Let's see.
Genghis Khan!
I would never have gotten that.
But of course you would have!
Hello, darling.
How are you?
So good to see you.
I thought this place was supposed to have more French than Germans?
Yes, normally that's true.
The Sergeant over there's wife just had a baby.
And his commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
We should leave.
No.
We should stay.
For one drink at least.
I've been waiting for you in a bar.
It would look strange if we left before we had a drink.
She's right.
Just be calm and enjoy your whiskey.
Mmm.
Mathilda...
She would love to play the game.
I will translate...and protect.
Don't worry, pretty little thing.
If any of these wolves gets out of line, I'll kick their ass in.
Watch.
Rip off his nose.
Stop it!
Schnapps, schnapps, take your schnapps in hand, comrades.
Before we go on playing we will drink.
We drink to our friend Wilhelm.
And his little boy Maximilian.
-To Max!
-To Max!
There's some new development.
The cinema venue has changed.
Why?
No one knows but that should not be a real problem.
The cinema it's been changed to is considerably smaller than The Ritz.
So whatever explosives you brought for The Ritz should be doubly effective here.
Now the next piece of information is colossal.
Try not to overreact.
The FÃ¼hrer- ...I was just thinking could you sign an autograph to my son on his birthday?
Of course.
I'd love to, Wilhelm.
This handsome Staff Sergeant just became a father today.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Do you know the name of this progeny yet?
I most certainly do, frÃ¤ulein.
His name is Maximilian.
Maximilian, wonderful name.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.
Max may not know who you are now but he will.
I will show him all of your movies.
Good.
He will grow up with your films and this napkin on his wall.
I propose a toast to the greatest actress in Germany!
There is no Dietrich!
There is no Riefenstahl!
Only Von Hammersmark!
-Cheers!
-Cheers!
-Cheers!
Once again-
Frau Hammersmark, what brings you to France?
None of your business!
Staff Sergeant.
You might not have worn out your welcome with the frÃ¤ulein with your drunken boorish behavior but you have worn out your welcome with me.
Might I remind you, Staff Sergeant, you are an enlisted man.
This is an officer's table!
I suggest you stop pestering the frÃ¤ulein and rejoin your table.
Excuse me, Captain, but your accent is very unusual.
Where are you from?
You must be either completely drunk or mad to dare to speak to a superior officer with such impertinentness!
Staff Sergeant.
I'm making you and you responsible for him.
I suggest you take hold of your friend or he'll spend Max's first birthday in jail for public drunkenness.
--Might I inquire?
Like our young newly christened father here I, too, have an acute ear for accents.
And like him I, too, find yours odd.
From where do you hail, Captain?
Major, this is highly -I wasn't speaking to you, Lieutenant Munich.
Or you either, Lieutenant Frankfurt.
I was speaking to Captain l-don't-know-what.
I was born in a village that rests in the shadow of the Piz PalÃ¼.
The mountain?
Yes.
In that village, we all speak like this.
Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?
Yes.
Then you saw me.
You remember the skiing torch scene?
Yes.
In that scene was myself, my father, my sister and my two brothers.
My brother is so handsome the director Pabst, gave him a Close-Up.
Herr Major, if my word means anything I can vouch for everything the young captain has just said.
He does hail from the bottom of the Piz PalÃ¼.
He was in the film and his brother is far more handsome than he.
You should rejoin your friends.
May I join you?
By all means.
Wunderbar!
So that's the source of your bizarre accent.
That's extraordinary.
What are you doing here?
Aside from having a drink with the lovely frÃ¤ulein?
Well, that pleasure requires no explanation.
I mean in country.
You're obviously not stationed in France or I'd know who you are.
You know every German in France?
Worth knowing.
Well, there lies the problem.
We never claimed to be worth knowing.
All levity aside, what are you doing in France?
Attending Minister Goebbels' film premiere as the frÃ¤ulein's escort.
You are the FrÃ¤ulein Hammersmark's escort.
Someone has to carry her lighter.
The captain is my date, but all three are my guests.
We are old friends who go back a long time.
Actually, longer than an actress would care to admit.
Well, in that case let me raise my glass to the three luckiest men in the room.
I'll drink to that.
Queen Christina.
Mata Hari.
I must say that game they're playing looks like a good bit of fun.
I didn't join them because you're quite right, Captain.
An officer should not fraternize with enlisted men.
But seeing as we are all officers and sophisticated lady friends of officers.
What say we play the game?
Yes, great, one game.
Wunderbar.
Soldiers the cards.
Thank you.
So gentlemen the object of the game is to write the name of a famous person on your card.
Real or fictitious, doesn't matter.
For instance, you could write, Confucius or Doctor Fu Manchu.
Eric!
More pens.
And they must be famous, not aunt Frida.
When you finish writing, put the card face down on the table.
And move it to the person on your right -Thanks.
-the person to your left moves his card to you.
You pick up the card without looking at it lick the back and stick it on your forehead.
Write!
Write.
I'll start, give you the idea.
Am I German?
-No.
-No.
Am I American?
-No.
-No.
Wait a minute, he goes to ---
Obviously, he wasn't born in America.
So...
I visited America, aye?
Yes.
Was this visit fortuitous?
Not for you.
My native land, is it what one would call, exotic?
-Yes.
-Yes.
That could be either a reference to the jungle or the Orient.
I'm going to let my first instinct take over and ask.
Am I from the jungle?
-Yes.
-Yes.
Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask whether you're real or fictitious.
I, however, think that's too easy, so I won't ask that yet.
Okay my native land is the jungle I visited America but my visit was not fortuitous to me but the implication is that it was to somebody else.
When I went from the jungle to America did I go by boat?
-Yes.
-Yes.
Did I go against my will?
-Yes.
-Yes.
On this boat ride, was I in chains?
Yes.
When I arrived in America, was I displayed in chains?
-Yes.
-Yes.
Am I the story of the Negro in America?
-No.
Well then I must be King Kong.
Bravo!
lmpressive.
Now, since I answered correctly, you all need to finish your drinks.
Cheers.
Now, who is next?
Well, Major I don't mean to be rude.
But the four of us are very good friends.
And we haven't seen each other in quite a while.
So, Major I am afraid you are intruding.
I beg to differ, Captain.
It's only if the frÃ¤ulein considers my presence an intrusion that I become an intruder.
How about it, FrÃ¤ulein von Hammersmark?
Am I intruding?
I didn't think so.
It's simply the captain is immune to my charms.
I am just joking.
Just joking.
Of course I'm intruding.
Allow me to refill your glasses, gentlemen, and I will bid you and the frÃ¤ulein adieu.
Eric has a bottle of thirty-three-year-old whiskey.
From the Scottish Highlands.
What do you say, gentlemen?
You're most gracious, Major.
Eric!
The thirty-three.
And new glasses!
You don't want to contaminate the thirty-three with the swill you were drinking.
How many glasses?
Five.
Not for me.
I like scotch, scotch doesn't like me.
Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly.
Three glasses.
Frau von Hammersmark.
Thank you.
A thousand year German Reich!
-A thousand year Reich!
-A thousand year Reich!
I must say I grow weary of these monkeyshines.
Did you hear that?
That was the sound of my Walther.
Pointed right at your testicles.
Why do you have your Walther pointed at my testicles?
Because you've just given yourself away, Captain.
You're no more German than that scotch.
Well, Major.
Shut up slut.
You were saying?
I was saying that makes two of us.
I've had a gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.
That makes three of us.
And at this range, I'm a real Fredrick Zoller.
Looks like we have a bit of a sticky situation here.
What's going to happen, Major you're going to stand up and walk out that door with us.
--No, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't think so.
I'm afraid you and I we both know, Captain no matter what happens to anybody else in this room the two of us aren't going anywhere.
Too bad about Sergeant Wilhelm and his famous friends.
If any of you expect to live, you'll have to shoot them too.
Looks like little Max will grow up an orphan.
How sad.
I've been rethinking my position in regards to your Paris premiere of "Nation's Pride."
As the weeks have gone on and the Americans are on the beach I do find myself thinking more and more about this Private Zoller.
This boy has done something tremendous for us.
And I'm beginning to think my participation in this event could be meaningful.
You've moved up in the world.
Look at you, Lieutenant First Class.
And with your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.
And that one's name is Wilhelm Wicki.
He's an Austrian-born Jew, who immigrated to the United States when things began turning sour for the Israelites.
They are the two German-born members of the Basterds.
They've been known to don German uniforms, to ambush squads.
What brings you all the way out here?
But that doesn't look like this.
This is odd.
It would appear somebody's missing.
Somebody fashionable.
Everybody out!
"To Max, with love."
Bridget von Hammersmark.
Chapter Five
Chapter Five REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE
Night of "NATION'S PRIDE" premiere
Remember...in English.
Action.
But how do we get it developed?
Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop that footage.
And suppose someone would develop the footage how do we get a 35mm print with a soundtrack?
We find somebody who can develop and process a 35mm print with a soundtrack.
And we make them do it or we kill them.
Bring that fucker over here!
Put his head down on that table.
You either do what the fuck we tell you or I'll bury this axe in your collaborating skull.
I'm not a collaborator.
Marcel, do his wife and children know you?
Yes.
Then after we kill this dog for the Germans we'll go and silence them.
Jannings, come on, show the ring.
Come on, come on.
There you go!
Fredrick, have a look at it.
This is the highest artistic honor that I give.
-Herr Doctor, I'm also feeling very honored.
-You deserve it, my dear Jannings!
But I believe after the premiere today, we have a new candidate.
Ah, Emmanuelle I'd like you to meet the greatest actor in the world Emil Jannings.
Mademoiselle, I'm pleased to meet you.
You have a beautiful cinema.
Thank you, Hermann.
FrÃ¤ulein von Hammersmark.
Colonel Landa, it's been years.
Dashing as ever, I see.
So what's happened to your lovely leg?
A by-product of kicking ass in the German cinema, no doubt.
Save your flattery, you old dog.
I know too many of your former conquests to fall into that honey pot.
Seriously, what happened?
Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I might add at mountain climbing.
And this is the result.
Mountain climbing?
That's how you injured your leg -mountain climbing?
Believe it or not, yes it is.
Forgive me, frÃ¤ulein.
I don't mean to laugh at your misfortune.
It's just --- mountain climbing?
I'm curious, frÃ¤ulein, what could have ever compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor?
Well, I shan't be doing it again, I can tell you that.
That cast looks as fresh as my old Uncle Gustav.
When were you climbing this mountain, last night?
Very good eye, Colonel.
It happened yesterday morning.
And where in Paris is this mountain?
No, I'm just teasing you, frÃ¤ulein.
You know me, I tease rough.
So, who are your three handsome escorts?
I'm afraid neither three speak a word of German.
They're friends of mine from Italy.
This is a wonderful Italian stuntman, Enzo Gorlomi.
A very talented cameraman, Antonio Margheriti.
And Antonio's camera assistant Dominick Decocco.
Gentlemen, this is an old friend, Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
Hello.
Gentlemen, it's a pleasure the friends of our cherished star, admired by all of us, this outright jewel of our culture are naturally going to be under my personal protection for the duration of their stay.
Thank you.
Am I saying it correctly?
Yes - 'er, correct.
Say it for me once please...?
I'm sorry, again...?
Once more...?
What's your name again...?
Again...?
One more time, but let me really hear the music in it!
And you...?
Well, my two cameraman friends need to find their seats.
Let me see your tickets.
I suppose you getting premiere tickets for your friends wouldn't be the most difficult thing for a star of your status.
0023 and 0024.
That shouldn't be too difficult to find, goodbye.
Ooh la la, Danielle Darrieux.
I have to go down and socialize with these Hun pigs.
Let's go over it again.
Reel one is on the first projector.
Reel two is on the second.
The third one is on the spool.
And the fourth one is ready to go.
Okay, the big sniper battle in the film begins around the middle of the third reel.
Our film comes in on the fourth reel.
Somewhere towards the end of the third reel go down and lock the doors of the auditorium.
Then take your place behind the screen and wait for my cue.
Then burn it down.
Take your seats.
The show is about to begin.
Everybody, please take your seats.
The show is about to begin.
We'll see you later.
Not so fast.
A glass of champagne to toast "Nation's Pride."
My frÃ¤ulein, may I have a word with you in private?
Certainly.
Excuse us.
Have a seat, my frÃ¤ulein.
May I?
Mademoiselle Mimieux allowed me to set up camp in her office for the time being.
Let me see your foot.
I beg your pardon?
Put your foot in my lap.
Hans, you embarrass me.
Could you please reach into the right pocket of my coat and give me what you find in there.
May I?
What now, Colonel?
The guy in the white smoking jacket.
Clever.
I informed the FÃ¼hrer that the audience has taken their seats.
He should arrive any minute.
Thank you, Hans.
Let go.
You may leave us.
But stay alert outside.
Gum?
It's time.
I should go lock the auditorium and take my place behind the screen.
I informed the FÃ¼hrer that the audience has taken their seats.
He should arrive any minute.
Thank you, Hans.
Herr Dr, Goebbels, excuse me.
Could I go out for a moment?
Perfectly understandable, my boy.
You go now, and we'll see you after the show.
Who is it?
Fredrick!
Shit.
Are you the manager of this cinema?
I want my money back.
That actor in the movie stinks.
What are you doing here?
I came to visit you.
Can't you see how busy I am?
Then allow me to lend an assist.
Fredrick, it's not funny, you can't be here.
This is your premiere, you need to be out there with them.
Normally, you would be right.
And for all the other films I do I intend to endure evenings like tonight, in the proper spirit.
However, the fact remains this film is based on my military exploits.
And in this case, my exploits consisted of killing many men.
Consequently, the part of the film that's playing now I don't like watching this part.
-I am sorry, Fredrick, but...
-So, I thought I'd come up here and do what I do best annoy you.
And from the look on your face, it would appear I haven't lost my touch.
Are you so used to the Nazis kissing your ass you've forgotten what the word "no" means?
No...you can't be here!
Now go away!
Fredrick, you hurt me.
Well, it's nice to know you can feel something.
Even if it's just physical pain.
I'm not a man you say, "go away" to.
There's over three hundred dead bodies in Italy, that if they could, would testify to that!
After what I've done for you you disrespect me at your peril!
Lock the door.
What?
Lock the door.
We don't have much time.
Time for what?
Forget it!
--No, no, no...wait.
You want me to...
lock the door?
For the fifty-seventh time, yes.
Extraordinary my dear, simply extraordinary!
This is your finest film yet.
Thank you, my FÃ¼hrer.
Thank you.
Enough!
Stop it!
Turn off the projector!
I don't know what's going on.
That does not belong in my movie!
These are the American lines, Colonel sir.
Excellent, Hermann.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)
(MEN SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
Yes.
This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
(CHUCKLES) Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
Only rumors.
I love rumors!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
(CLEARS THROAT)
Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
(MATCHSTICKS SCRAPING)
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
(AGREES IN FRENCH)
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
(CLEARS THROAT)
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31.
Continue.
And the children,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
(SIGHS)
Amos was nine or 10.
And Shosanna?
And Shosanna was
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
(ZIPPER CLOSING)
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite,..
..are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
(SIGHS)
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
(THANKING IN FRENCH)
That they call you "The Jew Hunter."
Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title..
..precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
(CHUCKLING) More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
(AGREES IN FRENCH)
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
(SNIFFLES)

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
ALDO:
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5, 000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got a little Indian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
ALL:
Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!

Hey, Hirschberg.
Send that Kraut sarge over.
HIRSCHBERG:
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
Yes.
Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here,..
..an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
MALE NARRATOR:
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity..
..among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall,..
..the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin..
..to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
(GASPING)
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis... (MAN GROANING)
...I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
(BASTERDS WHOOPING)
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
HIRSCHBERG: (LAUGHING) Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
(SCOFFING)
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
(BAT TAPPING)
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse,
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his,..
..and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger,..
..and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
(BASTERDS APPLAUDING)
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
Donny!
DONNY:
Yeah?
Got us a German here who wants to die for country.
Oblige him.

(BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN)
Around about 12.
What kind of artillery?
(BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
WICKI:
He's going to hug his mother.
(SNIFFS)
Well, ain't that nice?
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
(WICKI SPEAKING GERMAN)
(BUTZ SPEAKING GERMAN)
WICKI:
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.

So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.

MAN:
Right this way, Lieutenant.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
And your occupation before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
What should we drink to, sir?
Well...
Down with Hitler.
All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry..
..under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer, how's he doing?
Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film, sir?
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion..
..will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
Bridget von Hammersmark?
(CHUCKLING) The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
Indeed.
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was in a tavern.
It is a tavern.
Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
Stiglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
(LAUGHS)
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.

They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
It's not my fault!

You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can I?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
(SNIFFLES)
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
(VON HAMMERSMARK GROANING)
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
(DOGS BARKING)
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
(EXCLAIMING)
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
(GROANS)
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
(GRUNTING)
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
(SNORTS)
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg- mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian.
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian.
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian.
Like I said, third best.

You Jerry-banging, Limburg-smelling... (SPEAKING GERMAN)
As Stanley said to Livingstone,
Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?
Hans Landa.
(TRUCK ENGINE STARTING)
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.
My hands to be exact.
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you.
Caught you flinching.
ALDO:
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.
Utivich?
Is that you, Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?
The woman?
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot."
Yeah, I was just thinking that.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
So you're Aldo the Apache.
So you're The Jew Hunter.
I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?
(SNORTS)
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on Ice?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
(EXCLAIMS)
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it?
"That's a bingo."
You just say, "Bingo."
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
Up there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999. 999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?

So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
GENERAL:
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.

I'd make that deal.

I'd make that deal.
I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command,
I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island,
I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.

[ DISTANT RUMBLING ]
[ SPEAKING FRENCH ]
[ MEN SPEAKING GERMAN ]
[ SPEAKING FRENCH ]
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
Yes.
This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
[ CHUCKLES ] Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
Only rumors.
I love rumors!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
[ CLEARS THROAT ]
Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
[ MATCHSTlCKS SCRAPING ]
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
[ AGREES IN FRENCH ]
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
[ CLEARS THROAT ]
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31.
Continue.
And the children,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
[ SIGHS ]
Amos was nine or 10.
And Shosanna?
And Shosanna was
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
[ ZIPPER CLOSING ]
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
[ SIGHS ]
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
[ THANKING IN FRENCH ]
That they call you "The Jew Hunter."
Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
[ CHUCKLING ] More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
[ AGREES IN FRENCH ]
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
ls that clear?
[ SNIFFLES ]

ALDO:
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5,000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got a little lndian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
ALL:
Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.

Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
[ BASTERDS LAUGHING ]
MALE NARRATOR:
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
[ GASPING ]
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis...
[ MAN GROANING ] ... I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
[ BASTERDS LAUGHING ]
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
[ BASTERDS WHOOPING ]
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
HIRSCHBERG: [ LAUGHING ] Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
[ SCOFFING ]
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
[ BAT TAPPING ]
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse,
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
[ BASTERDS LAUGHING ]

At that time, 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar.
Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle.
They're films, ain't they?
Yes.
Then they're flammable.

MAN:
Right this way, Lieutenant.
[ CLEARS THROAT ]
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
And your occupation before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a sub textual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
What should we drink to, sir?
Well...
Down with Hitler.
All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer, how's he doing?
Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film, sir?
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
Bridget von Hammersmark?
[ CHUCKLING ] The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
Indeed.
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was in a tavern.
It is a tavern.
Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
Stiglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
[ LAUGHS ]
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
ls that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.

They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
It's not my fault!
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?

I'm alive!

What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can l?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
[ SNIFFLES ]
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.
[ SPEAKING GERMAN ]
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
[ VON HAMMERSMARK GROANING ]
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
[ SPEAKING FRENCH ]
[ DOGS BARKING ]
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
[ EXCLAIMING ]
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
[ GROANS ]
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
[ GRUNTING ]
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
[ BREATHING DEEPLY ]
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.
[ SPEAKING GERMAN ]
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
[ SNORTS ]
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg- mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian.
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian.
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian.
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?

So you're Aldo the Apache.
So you're The Jew Hunter.

And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?

Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on lce?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
[ EXCLAlMS ]
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it? "That's a bingo."
You just say, "Bingo."
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
U p there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999. 999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?

HANS:
So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
[ SPEAKING GERMAN ]
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
GENERAL:
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing. ls that clear, Lieutenant?

I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
[ HANS SCREAMING ]
You know something, Utivich?
I think this just might be my masterpiece.
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
Yes.
This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
Only rumors.
I love rumors!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31.
Continue.
And the children,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
Amos was nine or 10.
And Shosanna?
And Shosanna was
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
That they call you "The Jew Hunter."
Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
Yes.
It's the girl.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5, 000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got a little Indian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!
Hey, Hirschberg.
Send that Kraut sarge over.
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
Yes.
Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse,
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
Donny!
Yeah?
Got us a German here who wants to die for country.
Oblige him.
Did you get that for killing Jews?
Bravery.
Yeah!
Oh, no!
- Oh, no!
Donny!
Yeah, Donny!
About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you.
Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park!
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!
He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street!
You!
Damn it, Hirschberg!
Donny, bring that other one over here.
Alive!
Get the fuck up!
Batter up.
You're on deck!
Two hits.
I hit you, you hit the ground.
English?
Wicki.
Ask him if he wants to live.
Tell him to point out on this map the German position.
Ask him how many Germans.
Around about 12.
What kind of artillery?
Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
He's going to hug his mother.
Well, ain't that nice?
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that.
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?
Practice.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
At that time, 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar.
Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle.
They're films, ain't they?
- Yes.
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.
Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper.
Shosanna has a collection of over 350 nitrate film prints.
Right this way, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
And your occupation before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
What should we drink to, sir?
Well...
Down with Hitler.
All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer, how's he doing?
Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film, sir?
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
Bridget von Hammersmark?
The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
Indeed.
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was in a tavern.
It is a tavern.
Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
Stiglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.
Mmm.
Well, if this is it, old boy,
I hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's.
By all means, Captain.
There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch.
Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily,
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
Now, about this pickle we find ourselves in.
It would appear there's only one thing left for you to do.
And what would that be?
Stiglitz.
Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls.
You outside.
Who are you?
British?
American?
What?
We're American.
What are you?
I'm a German, you idiot.
Speak English pretty good for a German.
I agree.
So let's talk.
Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
His name is Max.
We were in here drinking, celebrating.
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
It's not my fault!
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
No.
I'm alive!
Who's that?
Is the girl on your side?
Which girl?
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.
Yeah, she's ours.
Is she okay?
Wilhelm!
She's been shot.
But she's alive.
Okay, Wilhelm.
What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can I?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg- mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian.
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian.
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian.
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?
Yes.
Gorlomi?
Gorlomi.
Gorlomi.
Antonio Margheriti.
Margheriti.
Margheriti.
Dominick Decocco.
Dominick Decocco.
What's that American expression?
"If the shoe fits, you must wear it."
Fucking shithead.
Faggot fuck.
Fuck you!
Bunch of shithead fuck.
Fuck you, too!
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches!
Get your hands off me.
You fucking bratwurst-smelling...
Goddamn you!
Get off!
Hmm.
You Jerry-banging, Limburg-smelling...
As Stanley said to Livingstone,
Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?
Hans Landa.
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.
My hands to be exact.
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you.
Caught you flinching.
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.
Utivich?
Is that you, Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?
The woman?
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot."
- Yeah, I was just thinking that.
So you're Aldo the Apache.
So you're The Jew Hunter.
I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on Ice?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it?
"That's a bingo."
You just say, "Bingo."
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
Up there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999. 999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?
I implore you.
We must destroy that tower.
Sarge, that tower...
The tower stands!
Psst!
Psst!
So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.
Is that clear, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
Over and out.
When I kill that guy, you got 30 feet to get to that guard.
Can you do it?
I have to.
Champagne?
Who wants to send a message to Germany?
I have a message for Germany.
That you are all going to die.
And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who's going to do it!
Marcel, burn it down.
Oui, Shosanna.
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face
of Jewish vengeance.
Hermann, uncuff them.
I'm officially surrendering myself over to you, Lieutenant Raine.
We're your prisoners.
How about my knife?
Thank you very much, Colonel.
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back.
Is that really necessary?
I'm a slave to appearances.
Scalp Hermann.
Are you mad?
What have you done?
I made a deal with your general for that man's life!
Yeah, they made that deal.
But they don't give a fuck about him.
They need you.
You'll be shot for this!
Nah, I don't think so.
More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.
You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?
I'd make that deal.
I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command,
I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island,
I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know something, Utivich?
I think this just might be my masterpiece.

(DISTANT RUMBLING)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
(MEN SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
Yes.
This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
(CHUCKLES) Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
Only rumors.
I love rumors!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
(CLEARS THROAT)
Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
(MATCHSTICKS SCRAPING)
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
(AGREES IN FRENCH)
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
(CLEARS THROAT)
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31.
Continue.
And the children,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
(SIGHS)
Amos was nine or 10.
And Shosanna?
And Shosanna was
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
(ZIPPER CLOSING)
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
(SIGHS)
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
(THANKING IN FRENCH)
That they call you "The Jew Hunter."
Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
(CHUCKLING) More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
(AGREES IN FRENCH)
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
(SNIFFLES)
Yes.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
ALDO:
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5, 000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
That means I got a little Indian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
ALL:
Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!

Hey, Hirschberg.

HIRSCHBERG:
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
Yes.
Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
MALE NARRATOR:
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
(GASPING)
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis... (MAN GROANING)
...I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
(BASTERDS WHOOPING)
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
HIRSCHBERG:
(LAUGHING) Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
(SCOFFING)
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
(BAT TAPPING)
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse,
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
(BASTERDS APPLAUDING)
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
Donny!
DONNY:
Yeah?
Got us a German here who wants to die for country.
Oblige him.
(BAT TAPPING)
(CONTINUES TAPPING)
(BASTERDS CHEERING)
Did you get that for killing Jews?
Bravery.
(BASTERDS EXCLAIMING)

Yeah, Donny!
About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you.

Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park!
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!
He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street!
You!
Damn it, Hirschberg!
Donny, bring that other one over here.
Alive!
Get the fuck up!

You're on deck!
Two hits.
I hit you, you hit the ground.

(BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN)
Around about 12.

Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
WICKI:
He's going to hug his mother.
(SNIFFS)
Well, ain't that nice?
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
(WICKI SPEAKING GERMAN)
(BUTZ SPEAKING GERMAN)
WICKI:
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.

Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
And your occupation before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
What should we drink to, sir?
Well...
Down with Hitler.
All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer, how's he doing?
Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film, sir?
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
Bridget von Hammersmark?
(CHUCKLING) The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
Indeed.
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was in a tavern.
It is a tavern.
Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
Stiglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
(LAUGHS)
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.

ALDO:
Speak English pretty good for a German.
I agree.
So let's talk.
Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
His name is Max.
We were in here drinking, celebrating.
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
It's not my fault!
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
No.
I'm alive!
(SHOUTING IN GERMAN)
ALDO:
Who's that?
(GRUNTS)
Is the girl on your side?
Which girl?
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.
Yeah, she's ours.
Is she okay?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Wilhelm!
(SHOUTING IN GERMAN)
She's been shot.
But she's alive.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
ALDO:
Okay, Wilhelm.
What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can I?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
(SNIFFLES)
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
(VON HAMMERSMARK GROANING)
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
(DOGS BARKING)
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
(EXCLAIMING)
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
(GROANS)
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
(GRUNTING)
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
(SNORTS)
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg- mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian.
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian.
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian.
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?

You've had a nice long run, Aldo.

And they've been waiting a long time to touch you.
Caught you flinching.
ALDO:
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.
Utivich?
Is that you, Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?

No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot." Yeah, I was just thinking that.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
So you're Aldo the Apache.
So you're The Jew Hunter.
I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?
(SNORTS)
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on Ice?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
(EXCLAIMS)
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it?
"That's a bingo."
You just say, "Bingo."
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
Up there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999. 999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?

So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
GENERAL:
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.

End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?
I'd make that deal.
I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command,
I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island,
I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.

I think this just might be my masterpiece.
Subtitles by LeapinLar
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
Are you aware of my existence?
Yes.
This is good.
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard.
I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
(CHUCKLES) Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
Only rumors.
I love rumors!
Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob.
Wife, Miram.
And her brother, Bob.
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31.
Continue.
And the children,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
Amos was nine or 10.
And Shosanna?
And Shosanna was
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.
Well, I guess that should do it.
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
That they call you "The Jew Hunter."
Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
(CHUCKLING) More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
It's a hostile world, indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would.
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like them.
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
Is that clear?
Yes.
It's the girl.
Au revoir, Shosanna!
ALDO:
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5,000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man J im Bridger.
That means I got a little lndian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans.
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
Sound good?
ALL:
Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command, you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 1 00 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 1 00 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 1 00 dead Nazis.
Or you will die trying!
Hey, Hirschberg.
Send that Kraut sarge over.
HIRSCHBERG:
You.
Go.
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
Yes.
Then sit down.
How is your English, Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
MALE NARRATOR:
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis I think you show great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
HIRSCHBERG :
(LAUGHING) Oh, yeah.
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
I respectfully refuse, sir.
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club.
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse,
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you.
And your Jew dogs.
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
Donny!
DONNY:
Yeah?
Got us a German here who wants to die for country.
Oblige him.
Did you get that for killing Jews?
Bravery.
Yeah!
BASTERD 1:
Oh, no!
BASTERD 2:
Oh, no!
Donny!
BASTERD:
Yeah, Donny!
About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you.
Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park!
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!
He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street!
You!
Damn it, Hirschberg!
Donny, bring that other one over here.
Alive!
Get the fuck up!
Batter up.
You're on deck!
Two hits.
I hit you, you hit the ground.
English?
ALDO:
Wicki.
Ask him if he wants to live.
Tell him to point out on this map the German position.
Ask him how many Germans.
Around about 12.
What kind of artillery?
Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
WICKI:
He's going to hug his mother.
Well, ain't that nice?
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
WICKI:
He's going to burn it.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.
Just like that.
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that.
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?
Practice.
HANS:
Au revoir, Shosanna!
MALE NARRATOR:
At that time, 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar.
Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle.
They're films, ain't they?
Yes.
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.
MALE NARRATOR:
Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper.
Shosanna has a collection of over 350 nitrate film prints.
MAN:
Right this way, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
And your occupation before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well, sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
What should we drink to, sir?
Well...
Down with Hitler.
All the way down, sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes.
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon, sir?
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer, how's he doing?
Quite well, actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.
Brief him.
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film, sir?
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
Jolly good, sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
Bridget von Hammersmark?
(CHUCKLING) The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
Indeed.
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was in a tavern.
It is a tavern.
Yeah, in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
N umber one being, you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
Stiglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,
I need to know we can all remain calm.
I don't look calm to you?
Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
Is that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress.
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.
Well, if this is it, old boy,
I hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's.
By all means, Captain.
There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch.
Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily,
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
Now, about this pickle we find ourselves in.
It would appear there's only one thing left for you to do.
And what would that be?
Stiglitz.
Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls.
You outside.
Who are you?
British?
American?
What?
ALDO:
We're American.
What are you?
I'm a German, you idiot.
ALDO:
Speak English pretty good for a German.
I agree.
So let's talk.
Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
ln Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
His name is Max.
We were in here drinking, celebrating.
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
It's not my fault!
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm.
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
No.
I'm alive!
ALDO:
Who's that?
Is the girl on your side?
Which girl?
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.
Yeah, she's ours.
Is she okay?
Wilhelm!
She's been shot.
But she's alive.
ALDO:
Okay, Wilhelm.
What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you.
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willi.
I want to trust you.
But...
But how can l?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you.
Come down.
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal, we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
No trust, no deal.
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
It's called suspicious.
Everybody needs to calm down.
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi.
You remember him, don't you?
Yeah, I remember him.
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both.
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three.
The other looks odd.
Germans would and did notice it.
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes!
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
Least of all, by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.
Fuck a duck!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg- mountain-climbing story.
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian..
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian..
So you mumble Italian.
and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good.
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good.
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
Who does what?
Well, I speak the most Italian., so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian..
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?
Yes.
Gorlomi?
Gorlomi.
Gorlomi.
Antonio Margheriti.
Margheriti.
HANS:
Margheriti.
Dominick Decocco.
Dominick Decocco.
What's that American expression?
"If the shoe fits, you must wear it."
ALDO:
Fucking shithead.
Faggot fuck.
Fuck you!
Bunch of shithead fuck.
Fuck you, too!
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches!
Get your hands off me.
You fucking bratwurst-smelling...
Goddamn you!
Get off!
Hmm.
You Jerry-banging, Limburg-smelling...
As Stanley said to Livingstone,
Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?
Hans Landa.
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.
My hands to be exact.
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you.
Caught you flinching.
ALDO:
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.
Utivich?
Is that you, Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?
The woman?
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot." Yeah, I was just thinking that.
So you're Aldo the Apache.
So you're The Jew Hunter.
I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?
Just a name that stuck.
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you.
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
No, I guess not.
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian. saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on lce?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann.
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you, Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general.
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess.
That's a bingo!
Is that the way you say it?
"That's a bingo."
You just say, "Bingo."
Bingo!
How fun.
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah!
Make a deal.
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down.
You know, where I'm from...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging.
Up there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999. 999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
What shall the history books read?
MAN:
I implore you.
We must destroy that tower.
Sarge, that tower...
MAN:
The tower stands!
Psst!
Psst!
HANS:
So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.
And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
GENERAL:
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.
Is that clear, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
Over and out.
When I kill that guy, you got 30 feet to get to that guard.
Can you do it?
I have to.
Champagne?
Who wants to send a message to Germany?
I have a message for Germany.
That you are all going to die.
And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who's going to do it!
Marcel, burn it down.
Oui, Shosanna.
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face
of Jewish vengeance.
HANS:
Hermann, uncuff them.
I'm officially surrendering myself over to you, Lieutenant Raine.
We're your prisoners.
How about my knife?
Thank you very much, Colonel.
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back.
Is that really necessary?
I'm a slave to appearances.
Scalp Hermann.
Are you mad?
What have you done?
I made a deal with your general for that man's life!
Yeah, they made that deal.
But they don't give a fuck about him.
They need you.
You'll be shot for this!
Nah, I don't think so.
More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.
You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal.
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?
I'd make that deal.
I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command, I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question.
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island, I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical.
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
You know something, Utivich?
I think this just might be my masterpiece.
(DISTANT RUMBLING)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
(MEN SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
While I'm very familiar with you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am .
Are you aware of my existence?
Yes.
This is good .
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
Yes.
Please tell me what you've heard .
I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile .
The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing .
I'm aware of that.
I've read the reports of this area.
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts,
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite .
If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
Now, before the occupation , there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
Is that correct?
To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel , would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
(CH UCKLES) Please , monsieur LaPadite , this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished .
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them .
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
Only rumors .
I love rumors !
Facts could be so misleading , where rumors, true or false, are often revealing .
So , monsieur LaPadite , what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
(CLEARS TH ROAT)
Again , this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain .
(MATCHSTlCKS SCRAPING)
So , the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
(AGREES IN FRENCH)
Yes.
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
(CLEARS TH ROAT)
There were five of them .
The father, Jacob .
Wife, Miram .
And her brother, Bob .
How old is Bob?
Thirty, 31 .
Continue .
And the children ,
Amos and Shosanna.
Ages of the children?
(SIGHS)
Amos was nine or 1 0 .
And Shosanna?
And Shosanna was
18 or 19 .
I'm not really sure.
Well , I guess that should do it.
(ZIPPER CLOSING)
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
But of course.
Monsieur LaPadite , are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
(SIGHS)
I have no interest in such things.
But you are aware of what they call me.
I'm aware.
What are you aware of?
(THAN KING IN FRENCH)
That they call you "The Jew H unter."
Precisely.
I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him .
Actually, why he would hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
Now I , on the other hand , love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers ,
I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German .
(CHUCKLING) More precisely, a German soldier.
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing .
But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in .
It's a hostile world , indeed .
If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
I suppose I would .
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread , a squirrel could equally carry.
Would you agree?
(AGREES IN FRENCH)
Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
No.
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
And except for the tail , they even rather look alike, don't they?
It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel .
However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel .
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
Probably not.
I didn't think so.
You don't like them .
You don't really know why you don't like them .
All you know is you find them repulsive.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look?
He looks in the barn , he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Please , Herr Colonel , make yourself at home.
Now, my job dictates
that I must have my men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
And if there are any irregularities to be found , rest assured they will be.
That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
I might add , also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward .
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
Yes.
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
Yes.
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding .
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume, while they're listening , they don't speak English .
Yes.
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
ls that clear?
(SN I FFLES)

ALDO:
Ten-hut!
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
And I'm putting together a special team , and I need me eight soldiers.
Eight Jewish American soldiers.
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon .
Well , we'll be leaving a little earlier.
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
Killing Nazis.
I don't know about you all , but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains , cross 5 , 000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
Nazi ain't got no humanity.
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating , mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed .
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform , they're going to die.
Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man J im Bridger.
That means I got a little lndian in me.
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
We will be cruel to the Germans .
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled , dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
And the German will be sickened by us.
And the German will talk about us.
And the German will fear us.
And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with .
Sound good?
ALL:
Yes, sir!
That's what I like to hear.
But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
When you join my command , you take on debit.
A debit you owe me, personally.
Each and every man under my command owes me 1 00 Nazi scalps.
And I want my scalps.
And all y'all will get me 1 00 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 1 00 dead Nazis.

Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you .
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?
Yes.
Then sit down .
How is your English , Werner?
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good .
Became American , got drafted , come back to give y'all what for.
Another one up there you might be familiar with .
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of him?
Everybody in the German Army has heard of H ugo Stiglitz.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
MALE NARRATOR:
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
As a German-enlisted man , he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
Instead of putting him up against a wall , the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
Needless to say , once the Basterds heard about him , he never got there.
(GASPING)
Sergeant H ugo Stiglitz?
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.
Ever heard of us?
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
When it comes to killing Nazis...
(MAN GROANING)
... I thinkyoushow great talent.
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
Can I assume you know who we are?
You're Aldo the Apache.
(BASTERDS WHOOPING)
Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
We in the killing Nazi business, and , cousin , business is a-booming .
HIRSCHBERG :
(LAUGHING) Oh , yeah .
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill you or let you go.
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you .
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard .
Besides you , we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again , you got to show me on this here map where they are.
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them .
(SCOFFING)
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
Well , now, Werner, that's where you're wrong , because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hiding in trees .
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me right now.
Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held , how many is coming and what they brought to play with .
I respectfully refuse, sir.
(BATTAPPING)
Hear that?
Yes.
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
You might know him better by his nickname.
The Bear Jew.
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
I heard of The Bear Jew.
What did you hear?
Beats German soldiers with a club .
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
And , Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse,
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
Fuck you .
And your Jew dogs.
(BASTERDS LAUGHING)
(BASTERDS APPLAU DING)
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.

Lieutenant Archie H icox reporting , sir.
General Ed Fenech .
At ease, H icox.
Drink?
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap , will you?
The bar is in the globe.
Something for yourself, sir?
Whiskey.
Straight.
No junk in it.
It says here that you speak German fluently.
Like a Katzenjammer Kid .
And your occupation before the war?
I'm a film critic.
List your accomplishments.
Well , sir, such as they are,
I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published .
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?
The first book was called
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
It's a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G .W.
Pabst.
What should we drink to, sir?
Well ...
Down with H itier.
All the way down , sir.
Yes.
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
Yes .
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
Explain it to me.
Pardon , sir?
Well , this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich .
Explain to me U FA under Goebbels .
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood .
How's he doing?
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
Well , compared to, say, Louis B .
Mayer, how's he doing?
Quite well , actually.
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
But Louis B .
Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O .
Selznick.
Brief him .
Lieutenant H icox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino .
Three days from now
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
What film , sir?
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels , Goring , Bormann , and most of the German H igh Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo , as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
The master race at play?
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
The objective of Operation Kino , blow up the basket.
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth .
Jolly good , sir.
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
The Germans call them the Basterds.
The Basterds.
Never heard of them .
Whole point of the Secret Service , old boy, you not hearing of them .
But the Jerries have heard of them , because these Yanks have been them the devil .
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you .
First thing , you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
She'll take it from there .
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
It'll be you , her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need .
How will I know her?
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you .
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
Bridget von Hammersmark?
(CH UCKLING) The German movie star is working for England?
Yes, for the last two years now.
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild .
Indeed .
Got the gist?
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
I didn't know.
You said it was in a tavern .
It is a tavern .
Yeah , in a basement.
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
N umber one being , you're fighting in a basement.
What if we go in there and she's not even there?
We wait.
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous .
Stiglitz, right?
That's right, sir.
I hear you're pretty good with that.
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful .
However, the off chance I'm wrong , things prove eventful ,
I need to know we can all remain calm .
I don't look calm to you?
(LAUGHS)
Well , now that you put it like that, I guess you do.
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
ls that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?
Fair point, Lieutenant.
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?
If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
But if trouble does happen , we need you to make damn sure no Germans , or French , for that matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised , the mission is kaput.
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
She chose the spot.
Isn't that just dandy?
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just an actress .
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans .

So let's talk.
Okay, talk.
I'm a father.
My baby was born today.
ln Frankfurt.
Five hours ago.
H is name is Max.
We were in here drinking , celebrating .
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing .
It's not my fault!
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.
What's your name, soldier?
Wilhelm .
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
No.
I'm alive !
(SHOUTING IN GERMAN)
ALDO:
Who's that?
(G RU NTS) ls the girl on your side?
Which girl?
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.
Yeah , she's ours.
ls she okay?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Wilhelm !
(SHOUTING IN GERMAN)
She's been shot.
But she's alive.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
ALDO:
Okay, Wilhelm .
What do you say we make us a deal?
What's your name?
Aldo.
Okay, Wilhelm , here's my deal .
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
No guns.
No guns me, no guns you .
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi .
You go your way, we go ours.
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?
Aldo.
I'm here, Willi .
I want to trust you .
But...
But how can l?
What choice you got, son?
Okay, okay.
Aldo,
I'm going to trust you .
Come down .
(SN I FFLES)
Hey, Willi , what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?
We still have a deal .
Now, get the girl and go.
Not so fast.
We only got a deal , we trust each other.
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead .
U p top , they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead .
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal .
No trust, no deal .
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
All right, Aldo.
Fine.
J ust take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
(VON HAMMERSMARK G ROANING)
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
(DOGS BARKING)
Before we yank that slug out you , you need to answer a few questions.
Few questions about what?
About I got three men dead back there.
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
Before we get into who shot John , why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd .
Yeah , we got a word for that kind of odd in English .
It's called suspicious.
(EXCLAIMING)
Everybody needs to calm down .
You're letting your imagination get the better of you .
You met the sergeant yourself.
Willi .
You remember him , don't you?
Yeah , I remember him .
H is wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...
He had just become a father!
H is commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
(GROANS)
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
It couldn't be both .
(GRUNTING)
How'd the shooting start?
The Englishman gave himself away.
How'd he do that?
He ordered three glasses.
We order three glasses.
That's the German three .
The other looks odd .
Germans would and did notice it.
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
What was the next step?
Tuxedos.
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
Hand me my purse.
Lieutenant H icox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
You still get us in that premiere?
You speak German better than your friends?
No.
Have I been shot?
Yes !
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon .
Least of all , by tomorrow night.
However, there's something you don't know.
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino .
One , the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
It probably has something to do with the second development.
Which is?
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Fuck a duck !
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old U ncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you getting us in that premiere.
I'm probably going to end up losing this leg .
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted .
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
(SNORTS)
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam .
He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg- mountain-climbing story.
That's German , ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
I don't.
I like smoking , drinking and ordering in restaurants.
But I see your point.
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet.
I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
We both speak a little Italian .
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib .
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian .
So you mumble Italian and brazen through it.
Is that the plan?
That's about it.
That sounds good .
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do?
Go home?
No, that sounds good .
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building .
Who does what?
Well , I speak the most Italian , so I'll be your escort.
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman .
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.
I don't speak Italian .
Like I said , third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?

You've had a nice long run , Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS .
My hands to be exact.
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you .
Caught you flinching .
ALDO:
Touch me again , Kraut-burger.
Utivich?
Is that you , Lieutenant?
Yeah .
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Omar?
The woman?
No, I do not.
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting , would you show me mercy?
Nope.
What is that English expression about shoes and feet?
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot." Yeah , I was just thinking that.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
So you're Aldo the Apache .
So you're The Jew H unter.
I'm a detective.
A damn good detective.
Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And , yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew H unter?
(SNORTS)
J ust a name that stuck.
Well , you do have to admit, it is catchy.
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
What do you mean the Little Man?
Germans' nickname for you .
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
I mean , you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
Where's my men?
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
Well , let's just say, she got what she deserved .
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...
How you know our names?
Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors,
we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed .
No, I guess not.
Well , back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs.
As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in .
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24 , if my memory serves.
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
And your mission , some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next?
Eliza on lce?
However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
I have no doubt.
And , yes, some Germans will die .
Yes, it will ruin the evening .
And , yes , Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get H itier, you won't get Goebbels , you won't get Goring , and you won't get Bormann .
And you need all four to end the war.
But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
So , gentlemen , let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
So , the way I see it, since H itier's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction , if I do nothing , it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?
I guess so.
How about you , Utivich?
I guess so, too.
Gentlemen , I have no intention of killing H itier and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann , not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal .
If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal .
What kind of deal?
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
A general .
I'm betting for...
OSS would be my guess .
(EXCLAlMS)
That's a bingo !
Is that the way you say it?
"That's a bingo."
You just say, "Bingo."
Bingo !
How fun .
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah !
Make a deal .
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann .
Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
If that tastes better going down .
You know, where I'm from ...
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?
Maynardville, Tennessee.
I've done my share of bootlegging .
U p there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing , and 999 . 999 times out of a million , you would be correct.
But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand .
What shall the history books read?

HANS:
So when the military history of this night is written , it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans .
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in H itier and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
By the way, that last part is actually true.
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich .
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Full citizenship for myself.
Well , that goes without saying .
And I would like the U nited States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end .
Do you have all that, sir?
I look forward to seeing you face to face as well , sir.
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.
Yes, sir.
GENERAL:
Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you .
You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.

Nah , I don't think so.

I've been chewed out before.
You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.
End the war tonight?
I'd make that deal .
How about you , Utivich?
You make that deal?
I'd make that deal .
I don't blame you .
Damn good deal .
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
Well , if you're willing to barbecue the whole H igh Command , I suppose that's worth certain considerations.
But I do have one question .
When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island , I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours .
Ain't you?
That's what I thought.
Now, that I can't abide.
How about you , Utivich , can you abide it?
Not one damn bit, sir.
I mean , if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
But I'm aware that ain't practical .
I mean , at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
So ,
I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.

I think this just might be my masterpiece.
Go back inside and shut the door.
Julie, get me some water for my wash up then get inside with your sisters.

Thank you, my darling now you go inside with your sisters.
Don't run.
Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?
I am Perrier LaPadite.
It is a pleasure to meet you, Monsieur LaPadite I am Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
What can I do for you?
I was hoping you could invite me inside your home and we may have a discussion.
Certainly.
After you.
Colonel Landa, this is my family.
Colonel Hans Landa of the SS Mademoiselle at your service.
The rumors I have heard in the village about your family are all true.
Each one of your daughters is more lovely than the last.
Merci.
Please have a seat.
Suzanne, would you be so good as to get the Colonel some wine?
But no.
Merci beaucoup, Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine.
This being a dairy farm, one would be safe in assuming you have milk?
Oui.
Then milk is what I prefer.
Very well.
Julie, would you mind closing the window?
Merci.
Monsieur, to both your family and your cows I say, "Bravo."
Thank you.
Please join me at your table.
Very well.
Monsieur LaPadite what we have to discuss would be better discussed in private.
You'll notice I left my men outdoors.
If it wouldn't offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies to step outside?
You are right.
Charlotte, would you take the girls outside?
The Colonel and I need to have a few words.
Monsieur LaPadite I regret to inform you I've exhausted the extent of my French.
To continue to speak it so inadequately would only serve to embarrass me.
However, I've been led to believe you speak English quite well.
Yes.
Well, it just so happens, I do as well.
This being your house I ask your permission to switch to English for the remainder of the conversation.
By all means.
Monsieur LaPadite I thank you for the milk and your hospitality.
I do believe our business here is done.
Ah, ladies.
I thank you for your time.
We shan't be bothering your family any longer.
So, Monsieur Mademoiselle.
I bid farewell to you and say adieu.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
How much more of these Jew swine must I endure?
They butcher my men like they were flies!
Do you know the latest rumor they've conjured up in their fear-induced delirium?
The one that beats my boys with a bat!
The one they call "The Bear Jew" is a Golem!
My Führer, this is just soldiers' gossip.
No one really believes "The Bear Jew" is a Golem.
Why not?
They seem to be able to elude capture like an apparition.
They seem to be able to appear and disappear at will.
You want to prove they're flesh and blood?
Then bring them to me!
I will hang them naked, by their heels, from the Eiffel Tower!
And then throw their bodies in the sewers for the rats of Paris to feast!
Kliest!
Yes, my Führer!
I have an order I want relayed to all German soldiers stationed in France.
The Jew degenerate known as "The Bear Jew," henceforth, is never to be referred to as The Bear Jew again.
Yes, my Führer!
Do you still wish to see Private Butz?
Who and what is a Private Butz?
He's the soldier you wanted to see personally.
His squad was ambushed by Lt. Raine's Jews.
He was its only survivor.
Indeed, I do want to see him.
Thank you for reminding me.
Send him in.
Sergeant Rachtmann, Ludwig and I were the only ones left alive after the ambush.
While one man guarded us, the rest removed the hair.
How did you survive this ordeal?
They let me go.
You are not to tell anybody anything.
Not one word of detail!
Your outfit was ambushed, and you got away!
Not one word more!
Yes, my Führer.
Did they mark you like they did the other survivors?
Yes, my Führer.
I will hug my mother like I've never hugged her before.
Not only shall I remove it, but I intend to burn it.
What starts tomorrow?
A Max Linder festival.
I always preferred Linder to Chaplin.
Except Linder never made a film as good as "The Kid."
The chase climax of "The Kid," superb.
I adore your cinema very much.
Merci.
Is it yours?
Do I own it?
Oui.
Oui.
How is it a girl as young as you owns a cinema?
My aunt left it to me.
Merci for hosting a German night.
I don't have a choice but you're welcome.
I love the Riefenstahl mountain films especially Piz Palü.
It's nice to see a French girl who's an admirer of Riefenstahl.
"Admire" would not really be the word I would use to describe my feelings towards Fräulein Riefenstahl.
But you do admire the director Pabst, don't you?
That's why you include his name on the marquee when you didn't have to.
I'm French.
We respect directors in our country.
Even Germans.
Even Germans, oui.
Merci for your assistance, soldier.
Adieu.
You're not finished.
I'll finish in the morning.
May I ask your name?
You wish to see my papers?
Emmanuelle Mimieux.
That's a very pretty name.
Merci.
Are you finished with my papers?
Mademoiselle, may I introduce myself Fredrick Zoller.
Well it's been a pleasure chatting with a fellow cinema lover.
Sweet dreams, mademoiselle.
Adieu.
Hello, mademoiselle.
May I join you?
Look, Fredrick...
You remember my name?
Yes.
Look, you seem a pleasant enough fellow...
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Regardless, I want you to stop pestering me.
I apologize, mademoiselle I wasn't trying to be a pest.
I was simply trying to be friendly.
I don't wish to be your friend.
Why not?
Don't act like an infant.
You know why.
I'm more than just a uniform.
Not to me.
If you are so desperate for a French girlfriend I suggest you try Vichy.
Who are you?
I thought I was just a uniform.
You're not just a German soldier.
Are you somebody's son?
Most German soldiers are somebody's son.
You're a very lucky girl, catching a brave war hero.
No, no, no, no, the mademoiselle is not my girlfriend.
Can you write "Amour Babette"?
So you're a war hero.
What did you do?
I was alone in a bell tower in a walled off city.
It was myself and a thousand rounds of ammo, in a bird's nest against three hundred enemy soldiers.
What's a bird's nest?
A bird's nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower.
It's a high structure, offering a three hundred and sixty degree view.
Very advantageous for marksmen.
How many did you kill?
Sixty-eight.
The first day.
A hundred and fifty the second day.
Thirty-two the third day.
On the fourth day they exited the city.
Naturally, my war story received a lot of attention in Germany that's why they all recognize me.
They call me the German Sergeant York.
Maybe they'll make a film about your exploits.
Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels thought.
So he did and called it "Nation's Pride."
And they wanted me to play myself so I did.
Joseph thinks this movie will be proven to be his masterpiece.
And I will be the German Van Johnson.
"Nation's Pride" is about you?
"Nation's Pride" is starring you?
I know.
Comical?
Well, good luck with your movie, Private.
I hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself.
Goodbye!
Do you need help?
No, it's okay.
If you need me, I'll be in the storage room.
Okay, my love.
Mademoiselle Mimieux?
Yes?
Is this your cinema?
Yes.
Come down!
Please.
I don't understand.
What have I done?
She wants to know what she's done.
Get your ass in that car.
It's only the offspring of slaves that allows America to be competitive athletically.
American Olympic gold can be measured in Negro sweat.
Good, you came.
I wasn't sure whether or not you'd accept my invitation.
Invitation?
Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick?
Yes, it is, Dr. Goebbels.
Emmanuelle, there is somebody I want you to meet.
Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to introduce you to the minister of propaganda the leader of the entire German film industry and now that I'm an actor, my boss, Dr. Joseph Goebbels.
Your reputation precedes you, Fräulein Mimieux.
And normally, this is Herr Goebbels' French interpreter Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.
Hello.
Hello.
And you've met the Major.
Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
Major Dieter Hellstrom of the Gestapo.
At your service, mademoiselle.
Please allow me have a seat please.
Try the champagne, mademoiselle, it's quite good.
I must say, Fräulein, I should be rather annoyed with you.
I arrive in France and I wish to have lunch with my star.
Little do I know he's become the toast of Paris.
And now he must find time for me.
People wait in line hours, days to see me.
For the Führer and Private Zoller, I wait.
So finally, I'm granted an audience with the young Private.
And he spends the entire lunch speaking of you and your cinema.
So Fräulein Mimieux, let's get down to business.
Herr Minister Doctor Goebbels...
I haven't informed her yet.
Unless the girl's a simpleton, I'm sure she's figured it out by now.
After all, she does operate a cinema.
Francesca, tell her.
What they are trying to tell you, Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has spent the last hour at lunch trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels to abandon previous plans for Private Zoller's film premiere and change the venue to your cinema.
What?
I wanted to inform her.
Shit!
I apologize, Private, of course you did.
What's the issue?
The Private wanted to inform the mademoiselle himself.
Nonsense!
Until I ask my questions, he has nothing to inform.
Let the record state, I have not agreed to switch cinemas for my premiere.
Duly noted.
You have opera boxes?
Yes.
How many?
Two.
More would be better.
How many seats in your auditorium?
Three hundred and fifty.
That's almost four hundred less than The Ritz.
But Dr. Goebbels that's not such a terrible thing.
You said yourself you didn't want to indulge every two-faced French bourgeois taking up space, currying favor.
With less seats, it makes the event more exclusive.
You're not trying to fill the house, they're fighting for seats.
Besides, to hell with the French.
This is a German night, a German event, a German celebration.
This night is for you, me for the German military, the high command their family and friends.
The only people who should be allowed in the room are people who will be moved by the exploits on the screen.
I see your public speaking has improved.
It appears I've created a monster.
A strangely persuasive monster.
When the war is over, politics await.
Well, Private though it is true, I'm inclined to indulge you anything...
I must watch a film in this young lady's cinema before I can say, yes or no.
So young lady, you are to close your cinema for a private screening tonight.
What German films do you have?
Ah, Landa, you are here.
Ah, Landa, you are here.
Emmanuelle, this is Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
He'll be running the security for the premiere.
Charmed, mademoiselle.
And now I must get the Reich Minister to his next appointment.
Slave driver.
French slave driver.
Actually, in my role as security chief of this joyous German occasion, I'm afraid I must have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux.
What sort of discussion?
That sounded suspiciously like a Private questioning the order of a Colonel.
Or am I just being sensitive?
Nothing could be further from the truth, Colonel.
Your authority is beyond question.
But your reputation does precede you.
Should Mademoiselle Mimieux or myself be concerned?
Hans, the boy means no harm he's simply smitten.
And he's correct.
Your reputation does precede you.
No need for concern, you two.
As security chief, I simply need to have a chat with the possible new venue's property owner.
Have you tried the strudel here?
No, no.
It's not so terrible.
So how is it the young Private and yourself came to be acquainted?
Yes, two strudels.
One for myself and one for the mademoiselle.
For me a cup of espresso and for the mademoiselle a glass of milk.
So, mademoiselle, you were beginning to explain?
Up until a couple of days ago, I had no knowledge of Private Zoller or his exploits.
To me the Private was simply just a patron of my cinema.
We spoke a few times but...
Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.
This is a simple formality.
No reason for you to feel anxious.
I apologize, I forgot to order the cream.
One moment.
Wait for the cream.
So, Emmanuelle.
May I call you Emmanuelle?
Oui.
So, Emmanuelle explain to me how does it happen, that a young lady such as yourself, comes to own a cinema?
After you.
Verdict?
Like I said, not so terrible.
You were explaining the origin of your cinema ownership.
The cinema originally belonged to my aunt and uncle.
What are their names?
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
Where are they now?
My uncle was killed during Blitzkrieg.
Pity.
Continue.
Aunt Ada passed away from fever last spring.
Regrettable.
It's come to my attention you have a Negro in your employ.
Is that true?
Oui.
He is a Frenchman.
His name is Marcel.
He worked with my aunt and uncle since they opened the cinema.
He's the only other one who works with me.
Doing what?
Projectionist.
Is he any good?
The best.
Actually, one could see where that might be a good trade for them.
Can you operate the projectors?
Of course I can.
Knowing the Reich Minister as I do...
I'm quite positive he wouldn't want the success or failure of his illustrious evening dependent on the prowess of a Negro.
So if it comes to pass we hold this event at your venue talented no doubt, as your Negro may be you will operate the projectors.
Is that acceptable?
Oui.
Cigarette?
They are not French.
They are German.
I did have something else I wanted to ask you.
But right now, for the life of me, I can't remember what it is.
Oh well, must not have been important.
'Til tonight.
I must say, I appreciate the modesty of this cinema.
Your cinema has real respect, almost church like.
Not to say we couldn't spruce the place up a bit.
Maybe I'll go to the Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes, and scatter them about the lobby.
So, Emmanuelle, how did you like "Lucky Kids"?
I quite like Lilian Harvey.
Lilian Harvey!
Never mention that name again in my presence!
Hey what the fuck are we supposed to do?
It looks like we're supposed to have a Nazi premiere.
Like I said what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Well, I need to talk with you about that.
I'm confused, what are we talking about?
Filling the cinema with Nazis and burning it down to the ground.
I'm not talking about that.
You are talking about that.
No, we're talking about that, right now.
If we can keep this place from burning down by ourselves we can burn it down by ourselves?
Oui Shosanna, we could do that.
And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate film print collection we wouldn't even need explosives would we?
You mean we wouldn't need any more explosives?
I am going to burn down the cinema on Nazi night.
And if I'm going to burn down the cinema which I am we both know, you're not going to let me do it by myself.
Because you love me.
And I love you.
And you're the only person on this earth I can trust.
But that's not all we're going to do.
Does the filmmaking equipment in the attic still work?
I know the film camera does.
How about the sound recorder?
Quite well, actually.
I recorded a new guitarist I met in a cafe last week.
It works superb.
Why do we need filmmaking equipment?
Because Marcel, my sweet we're going to make a film.
Just for the Nazis.
So, I'm male I'm a fictional, literary character from the past I'm American, and that's controversial.
No, it's not controversial at all.
The nationality of the author has nothing to do with the nationality of the character.
The character is the character.
Hamlet is not British.
He is Danish.
So yes, this character was born in America.
Well then.
Mathilda.
Schnapps?
Schnapps?
Schnapps...
Schnapps...
Schnapps.
Five schnapps, please.
If I had a wife would she be called a squaw?
Yes!
He's got it.
Three more questions!
Is my blood brother Old Shatterhand?
Yes!
Did Karl May write me?
Yes!
So who are you?
!
I am "Winnetou," chief of the Apaches!
Yes!
That was good!
That was good!
That was good!
Now down with the glasses!
Cheers.
Cheers.
Attention!
Hello, my lovelies.
Take a seat.
I will join you in moments.
I'm just saying goodbye to my five new friends here.
No hurry, Frau von Hammersmark.
Take your time.
Enjoy yourself.
We'll be just over here waiting.
Eric, my love.
Those are the friends I've been waiting for.
Please treat them to anything they like.
Frau von Hammersmark.
Your wish is my command.
Officers it would appear the drinks are on the fräulein.
What would you like?
Whiskey.
Two whiskeys.
Three whiskeys.
Three whiskeys, very well.
I wish you a wonderful evening.
Same to you.
- I thank you.
Your card!
Yes, you're right.
Let's see.
Genghis Khan!
I would never have gotten that.
But of course you would have!
Hello, darling.
How are you?
So good to see you.
I thought this place was supposed to have more French than Germans?
Yes, normally that's true.
The Sergeant over there's wife just had a baby.
And his commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
We should leave.
No.
We should stay.
For one drink at least.
I've been waiting for you in a bar.
It would look strange if we left before we had a drink.
She's right.
Just be calm and enjoy your whiskey.
Mathilda...
She would love to play the game.
I will translate... and protect.
Don't worry, pretty little thing.
If any of these wolves gets out of line, I'll kick their ass in.
Watch.
Rip off his nose.
Stop it!
Schnapps, schnapps, take your schnapps in hand, comrades.
Before we go on playing we will drink.
We drink to our friend Wilhelm.
And his little boy Maximilian.
To Max!
- To Max!
There's some new development.
The cinema venue has changed.
Why?
No one knows but that should not be a real problem.
The cinema it's been changed to is considerably smaller than The Ritz.
So whatever explosives you brought for The Ritz should be doubly effective here.
Now the next piece of information is colossal.
Try not to overreact.
The Führer- ...I was just thinking could you sign an autograph to my son on his birthday?
Of course.
I'd love to, Wilhelm.
This handsome Staff Sergeant just became a father today.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Do you know the name of this progeny yet?
I most certainly do, fräulein.
His name is Maximilian.
Maximilian, wonderful name.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.
Max may not know who you are now but he will.
I will show him all of your movies.
Good.
He will grow up with your films and this napkin on his wall.
I propose a toast to the greatest actress in Germany!
There is no Dietrich!
There is no Riefenstahl!
Only Von Hammersmark!
Cheers!
- Cheers!
Cheers!
Once again-
Frau Hammersmark, what brings you to France?
None of your business!
Staff Sergeant.
You might not have worn out your welcome with the fräulein with your drunken boorish behavior but you have worn out your welcome with me.
Might I remind you, Staff Sergeant, you are an enlisted man.
This is an officer's table!
I suggest you stop pestering the fräulein and rejoin your table.
Excuse me, Captain, but your accent is very unusual.
Where are you from?
You must be either completely drunk or mad to dare to speak to a superior officer with such impertinentness!
Staff Sergeant.
I'm making you and you responsible for him.
I suggest you take hold of your friend or he'll spend Max's first birthday in jail for public drunkenness.
Might I inquire?
Might I inquire?
Like our young newly christened father here I, too, have an acute ear for accents.
And like him I, too, find yours odd.
From where do you hail, Captain?
Major, this is highly-
I wasn't speaking to you, Lieutenant Munich.
Or you either, Lieutenant Frankfurt.
I was speaking to Captain l-don't-know-what.
I was born in a village that rests in the shadow of the Piz Palü.
The mountain?
Yes.
In that village, we all speak like this.
Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?
Yes.
Then you saw me.
You remember the skiing torch scene?
Yes.
In that scene was myself, my father, my sister and my two brothers.
My brother is so handsome the director Pabst, gave him a Close-Up.
Herr Major, if my word means anything I can vouch for everything the young captain has just said.
He does hail from the bottom of the Piz Palü.
He was in the film and his brother is far more handsome than he.
You should rejoin your friends.
May I join you?
By all means.
Wunderbar!
So that's the source of your bizarre accent.
That's extraordinary.
What are you doing here?
Aside from having a drink with the lovely fräulein?
Well, that pleasure requires no explanation.
I mean in country.
You're obviously not stationed in France or I'd know who you are.
You know every German in France?
Worth knowing.
Well, there lies the problem.
We never claimed to be worth knowing.
All levity aside, what are you doing in France?
Attending Minister Goebbels' film premiere as the fräulein's escort.
You are the Fräulein Hammersmark's escort.
Someone has to carry her lighter.
The captain is my date, but all three are my guests.
We are old friends who go back a long time.
Actually, longer than an actress would care to admit.
Well, in that case let me raise my glass to the three luckiest men in the room.
I'll drink to that.
Queen Christina.
Mata Hari.
I must say that game they're playing looks like a good bit of fun.
I didn't join them because you're quite right, Captain.
An officer should not fraternize with enlisted men.
But seeing as we are all officers and sophisticated lady friends of officers.
What say we play the game?
Yes, great, one game.
Wunderbar.
Soldiers the cards.
Thank you.
So gentlemen the object of the game is to write the name of a famous person on your card.
Real or fictitious, doesn't matter.
For instance, you could write, Confucius or Doctor Fu Manchu.
Eric!
More pens.
And they must be famous, not aunt Frida.
When you finish writing, put the card face down on the table.
And move it to the person on your right-
Thanks.
the person to your left moves his card to you.
You pick up the card without looking at it lick the back and stick it on your forehead.
Write!
Write.
I'll start, give you the idea.
Am I German?
No.
- No.
Am I American?
No.
- No.
Wait a minute, he goes to... -
Obviously, he wasn't born in America.
So...
I visited America, aye?
Yes.
Was this visit fortuitous?
Not for you.
My native land, is it what one would call, exotic?
Yes.
- Yes.
That could be either a reference to the jungle or the Orient.
I'm going to let my first instinct take over and ask.
Am I from the jungle?
Yes.
- Yes.
Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask whether you're real or fictitious.
I, however, think that's too easy, so I won't ask that yet.
Okay my native land is the jungle I visited America but my visit was not fortuitous to me but the implication is that it was to somebody else.
When I went from the jungle to America did I go by boat?
Yes.
- Yes.
Did I go against my will?
Yes.
- Yes.
On this boat ride, was I in chains?
Yes.
When I arrived in America, was I displayed in chains?
Yes.
- Yes.
Am I the story of the Negro in America?
No.
Well then I must be King Kong.
Bravo!
lmpressive.
Now, since I answered correctly, you all need to finish your drinks.
Cheers.
Now, who is next?
Well, Major I don't mean to be rude.
But the four of us are very good friends.
And we haven't seen each other in quite a while.
So, Major I am afraid you are intruding.
I beg to differ, Captain.
It's only if the fräulein considers my presence an intrusion that I become an intruder.
How about it, Fräulein von Hammersmark?
Am I intruding?
I didn't think so.
It's simply the captain is immune to my charms.
I am just joking.
Just joking.
Of course I'm intruding.
Allow me to refill your glasses, gentlemen, and I will bid you and the fräulein adieu.
Eric has a bottle of thirty-three-year-old whiskey.
From the Scottish Highlands.
What do you say, gentlemen?
You're most gracious, Major.
Eric!
The thirty-three.
And new glasses!
You don't want to contaminate the thirty-three with the swill you were drinking.
How many glasses?
Five.
Not for me.
I like scotch, scotch doesn't like me.
Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly.
Three glasses.
Frau von Hammersmark.
Thank you.
A thousand year German Reich!
A thousand year Reich!
- A thousand year Reich!
I must say I grow weary of these monkeyshines.
Did you hear that?
That was the sound of my Walther.
Pointed right at your testicles.
Why do you have your Walther pointed at my testicles?
Because you've just given yourself away, Captain.
You're no more German than that scotch.
Well, Major.
Shut up slut.
You were saying?
I was saying that makes two of us.
I've had a gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.
That makes three of us.
And at this range, I'm a real Fredrick Zoller.
Looks like we have a bit of a sticky situation here.
What's going to happen, Major you're going to stand up and walk out that door with us.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't think so.
I'm afraid you and I we both know, Captain no matter what happens to anybody else in this room the two of us aren't going anywhere.
Too bad about Sergeant Wilhelm and his famous friends.
If any of you expect to live, you'll have to shoot them too.
Looks like little Max will grow up an orphan.
How sad.
I've been rethinking my position in regards to your Paris premiere of "Nation's Pride."
As the weeks have gone on and the Americans are on the beach I do find myself thinking more and more about this Private Zoller.
This boy has done something tremendous for us.
And I'm beginning to think my participation in this event could be meaningful.
You've moved up in the world.
Look at you, Lieutenant First Class.
And with your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.
And that one's name is Wilhelm Wicki.
He's an Austrian-born Jew, who immigrated to the United States when things began turning sour for the Israelites.
They are the two German-born members of the Basterds.
They've been known to don German uniforms, to ambush squads.
What brings you all the way out here?
But that doesn't look like this.
This is odd.
It would appear somebody's missing.
Somebody fashionable.
Everybody out!
"To Max, with love."
Bridget von Hammersmark.
Remember... in English.
Action.
But how do we get it developed?
Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop that footage.
And suppose someone would develop the footage how do we get a 35mm print with a soundtrack?
We find somebody who can develop and process a 35mm print with a soundtrack.
And we make them do it or we kill them.
Bring that fucker over here!
Put his head down on that table.
You either do what the fuck we tell you or I'll bury this axe in your collaborating skull.
I'm not a collaborator.
Marcel, do his wife and children know you?
Yes.
Then after we kill this dog for the Germans we'll go and silence them.
Jannings, come on, show the ring.
Come on, come on.
There you go!
Fredrick, have a look at it.
This is the highest artistic honor that I give.
Herr Doctor, I'm also feeling very honored.
- You deserve it, my dear Jannings!
But I believe after the premiere today, we have a new candidate.
Ah, Emmanuelle I'd like you to meet the greatest actor in the world Emil Jannings.
Mademoiselle, I'm pleased to meet you.
You have a beautiful cinema.
Thank you, Hermann.
Fräulein von Hammersmark.
Colonel Landa, it's been years.
Dashing as ever, I see.
So what's happened to your lovely leg?
A by-product of kicking ass in the German cinema, no doubt.
Save your flattery, you old dog.
I know too many of your former conquests to fall into that honey pot.
Seriously, what happened?
Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I might add at mountain climbing.
And this is the result.
Mountain climbing?
That's how you injured your leg - mountain climbing?
Believe it or not, yes it is.
Forgive me, fräulein.
I don't mean to laugh at your misfortune.
It's just... - mountain climbing?
I'm curious, fräulein, what could have ever compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor?
Well, I shan't be doing it again, I can tell you that.
That cast looks as fresh as my old Uncle Gustav.
When were you climbing this mountain, last night?
Very good eye, Colonel.
It happened yesterday morning.
And where in Paris is this mountain?
No, I'm just teasing you, fräulein.
You know me, I tease rough.
So, who are your three handsome escorts?
I'm afraid neither three speak a word of German.
They're friends of mine from Italy.
This is a wonderful Italian stuntman, Enzo Gorlomi.
A very talented cameraman, Antonio Margheriti.
And Antonio's camera assistant Dominick Decocco.
Gentlemen, this is an old friend, Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
Hello.
Gentlemen, it's a pleasure the friends of our cherished star, admired by all of us, this outright jewel of our culture are naturally going to be under my personal protection for the duration of their stay.
Thank you.
Am I saying it correctly?
Yes - 'er, correct.
Say it for me once please?
I'm sorry, again?
Once more?
What's your name again?
Again?
One more time, but let me really hear the music in it!
And you?
Well, my two cameraman friends need to find their seats.
Let me see your tickets.
I suppose you getting premiere tickets for your friends wouldn't be the most difficult thing for a star of your status.
0023 and 0024.
That shouldn't be too difficult to find, goodbye.
Ooh la la, Danielle Darrieux.
I have to go down and socialize with these Hun pigs.
Let's go over it again.
Reel one is on the first projector.
Reel two is on the second.
The third one is on the spool.
And the fourth one is ready to go.
Okay, the big sniper battle in the film begins around the middle of the third reel.
Our film comes in on the fourth reel.
Somewhere towards the end of the third reel go down and lock the doors of the auditorium.
Then take your place behind the screen and wait for my cue.
Then burn it down.
Take your seats.
The show is about to begin.
Everybody, please take your seats.
The show is about to begin.
We'll see you later.
Not so fast.
A glass of champagne to toast "Nation's Pride."
My fräulein, may I have a word with you in private?
Certainly.
Excuse us.
Have a seat, my fräulein.
May I?
Mademoiselle Mimieux allowed me to set up camp in her office for the time being.
Let me see your foot.
I beg your pardon?
Put your foot in my lap.
Hans, you embarrass me.
Could you please reach into the right pocket of my coat and give me what you find in there.
May I?
What now, Colonel?
The guy in the white smoking jacket.
Clever.
I informed the Führer that the audience has taken their seats.
He should arrive any minute.
Thank you, Hans.
Let go.
You may leave us.
But stay alert outside.
Gum?
It's time.
I should go lock the auditorium and take my place behind the screen.
I informed the Führer that the audience has taken their seats.
He should arrive any minute.
Thank you, Hans.
Herr Dr, Goebbels, excuse me.
Could I go out for a moment?
Perfectly understandable, my boy.
You go now, and we'll see you after the show.
Who is it?
Fredrick!
Shit.
Are you the manager of this cinema?
I want my money back.
That actor in the movie stinks.
What are you doing here?
I came to visit you.
Can't you see how busy I am?
Then allow me to lend an assist.
Fredrick, it's not funny, you can't be here.
This is your premiere, you need to be out there with them.
Normally, you would be right.
And for all the other films I do I intend to endure evenings like tonight, in the proper spirit.
However, the fact remains this film is based on my military exploits.
And in this case, my exploits consisted of killing many men.
Consequently, the part of the film that's playing now I don't like watching this part.
I am sorry, Fredrick, but...
- So, I thought I'd come up here and do what I do best annoy you.
And from the look on your face, it would appear I haven't lost my touch.
Are you so used to the Nazis kissing your ass you've forgotten what the word "no" means?
No... you can't be here!
Now go away!
Fredrick, you hurt me.
Well, it's nice to know you can feel something.
Even if it's just physical pain.
I'm not a man you say, "go away" to.
There's over three hundred dead bodies in Italy, that if they could, would testify to that!
After what I've done for you you disrespect me at your peril!
Lock the door.
What?
Lock the door.
We don't have much time.
Time for what?
Forget it!
No, no, no... wait.
You want me to...
lock the door?
For the fifty-seventh time, yes.
Extraordinary my dear, simply extraordinary!
This is your finest film yet.
Thank you, my Führer.
Thank you.
Enough!
Stop it!
Turn off the projector!
I don't know what's going on.
That does not belong in my movie!
These are the American lines, Colonel sir.
Hey, Robyn.
It's good to see you again.
Now, according to your chart, your hair's been falling out, your nails are splitting and you're fatigued.
Robyn, you're a zombie.
Hmm.
Patient also grumpy and not responding to classic comedy.
It's just a little hard to find the funny when you're 32, single and balding.
Point taken.
Look, we're going to figure this out, okay?
And you don't worry, if you need me, I will be here all night.
- So you're working tonight, too?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm the on-call surgical attending.
I kind of signed up because J.D. Was supposed to be working with me.
I'm covering for him.
He and Sam went on a little trip to...
You know what, it's not important.
Oh!
No, no, no, no, no.
Finish your thought.
(SIGHS) I didn't want to be the one to tell you this.
Kim had a medical conference in Anaheim, and so J.D. Went and took Sam to Disneyland.
That's impossible, because he and I swore to each other that since neither one of us has ever been to Disneyland, that we would go for our 40th birthday together.
What do you want me to say?
I want you to tell me he's not at Disneyland right now,
- can you tell me that?
- No.
You know what?
Adults move on, and that's what I'm doing right now.
I'm moving on.
How do you wanna handle tonight's workload?
- Okay, I was thinking...
- I can't do it, Elliot!
You know, I tried.
I tried, but it hurts too bad.
It hurts me deep right here.
It hurts me.
I can feel it in my chest!
That man went to Disneyland without me.
They got roller coasters that roller coaster in the dark, okay?
You don't know where the turns are coming from.
They got the Finding Nemo ride where you ride around with Nemo and it's a ride!
A ride with Nemo.
Okay, tonight's going to be great.
My co-pilot here is a blubbering man-child and the interns have been here just long enough that they think they know what they're doing.
We totally saved that patient's life up there.
Cancer's our bitch.
No one does a Foley cath like Howie Gelder.
Oh!
Yeah!
Up high!
Okay, I'm not going to get mad because you're new.
But I'm kind of the high-fiver around here.
From now on, you're only allowed to high-five when I'm not here.
"Are we clear" five?
You may hit that because I'm instigating.
Now get the hell out of here.
Dr. Turk.
I put that central line on Mr. Phelphs for you.
So, next time you give me an assignment, can you make it something that's a challenge?
Okay, next time I'll...
Make sure you do.
Yeah, that's my surgical intern.
He's been here less time than everyone else and that's how he acts.
- You know what we should do?
- Hmm?
We should scare the hell out of them.
Full moon tonight, guys.
You wanna know what that means?
Means it's gonna get fricking crazy up in here.
Buckle up for some nasty stuff.
I'm talking nightmares that you cannot un-see.
During my first full-moon shift, psych patient, Tony Belmont, bit off his own tongue and threw it at me.
We couldn't re-attach the sucker, so I tossed it into that very Hazmat bin.
(EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)
Later that night, we heard a sound coming from in there.
So we open up the lid very, very slowly, and inside is Mr. Belmont holding his own tongue.
Do you want to know what he said to me?
He said... (EXCLAIMING)
(ALL SCREAM)
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Yes!
Nailed them.
Give it up.
Guys, high-fiving?
I feel like I've been more than clear about this.
It won't happen again, Todd.
Promise.
You're my friends, so I hope not.
"I'm sorry" five?
- Still.
- Still.
MAN: (SINGING) I can't do this all on my own
No, I know
I'm no Superman
I'm no Superman
All right, Robyn, here's the deal.
The last time you were here all your health issues were from malnourishment.
And now, a year later, you're nine pounds lighter than you were at your lowest weight.
But you know what's weird?
I really have been eating.
Okay.
I'm going to have you talk to a specialist named Dr. Paulson.
He's on his way.
Why are you having her talk to the staff shrink?
Because she's anorexic, Turk.
You know, I have a complicated psychological issue, too.
Mrs. Powell, your gallbladder surgery went terrific, however, I can't discharge you until I'm sure your pipes are working.
And since you said it's impossible for you to go "number two"
outside of your house due to the fact that you're a nervous poo-er... (SIGHS) I feel you, sister.
I'm gonna have to ask you to pass gas.
(SCOFFING) Excuse me?
You know.
(IMITATES FARTING)
- I don't do that.
- Women fart.
- You know, we should probably go.
- I know they do.
'Cause I have a wife and a daughter and they both fart.
And she farts and I've smelled it before.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Turk.
Enough.
- Smells like hotdogs.
Okay, guys, the full moon is upon us.
It's only 8:30, we already have 10 new admissions, so let's stay sharp.
Remember, nights like this are why you got into medicine.
Sunny, I'm gonna need you to get the lady in bed six to fart.
- I'm on it.
- Why don't you just pull her finger?
Howie, did you just make a joke?
I did, and it felt great.
Good for you.
And as a reward for the effort, you get the gentleman in bed three.
He poisoned himself.
We need to know what he took.
Go.
Gone.
Hey, my pneumonia patient, Mrs. Emmitt, is presenting with a crapload of fluid in her left lung.
"Crapload" really isn't a technical term.
Fine. "Bucketload."
Is she being sassy?
Because I love it.
More than Space Mountain?
Why, Elliot?
I just forgot about it.
Oh!
Derek, can you get Denise's patient a thoracentesis and get that fluid out of there?
Surgery to the rescue.
You are welcome.
Aw!
That's adorable.
You have a crush on yourself.
I'd be careful, the guy you're in love with is a douche.
- Where's Katie?
- KATIE:
Dr. Turk,
I've been doing post-op on your hand surgery patient, Mr. Gold.
He says he can't feel anything in his arms from his elbows up.
Now, I've been doing research for hours and I think it's either radiculopathy or a brachial plexus injury.
Or...
Ow!
He's lying.
Patients do that.
Katie, a word, please?
Look, that man is homeless and not all there.
You see his bandages?
It means he's been chewing at his sutures.
I'm probably gonna have to strap him down.
I can find another way to make him stop.
Suit yourself.
If he messes up my handiwork, it's on you.
Hi, Mr. Gold, can you do me a favor and stop chewing on your hands?
Pass.
I had to talk to that shrink for an hour.
Dr. Reid, I am not anorexic.
You've lost weight, you're anemic, your pre-albumin is low.
I mean, all symptoms point to it.
Well, who are you going to believe, me or that stupid chart?
Robyn, I'm a doctor.
We believe everything on the charts.
That's why I write "Elliot has a slamming tushie"
on every single one.
See?
Right here.
Okay.
I keep making jokes at all the wrong times, don't I?
Look, I know that this is hard...
It's only hard because it isn't true.
I've been eating.
But you've already made up your mind, haven't you?
Mrs. Powell, it's not your fault you don't want to pass gas.
It's society's.
I mean, guys have always been allowed to do it.
There's no shame for them.
But if a girl lets out even a little squeaker, she's a freak.
So, come on, for women everywhere.
Let's do it together on the count of three.
One, two, three.
Oh!
You didn't do it.
Neither did you.
There's people around.
Hi, Mr. Swick.
I'm Dr. Gelder.
You know what?
I'm going to grab a chart that doesn't say
"Elliot has a slamming tushie" on it.
Much better.
Now, Mr. Swick.
Nope, look, this one's got it, too.
Is her butt that nice?
It's okay for a white chick.
(SNICKERS)
Now, I want you to tell me how you poisoned yourself.
- I can't.
- Why not?
Because you're not my doctor.
You may sound like him, and you look exactly like him, but you're not him.
Excuse me.
All right.
Thanks, Dr. Paulson.
So, the staff shrink says that Mr. Swick has Capgras Syndrome.
It's a brain disorder.
Basically, it means he thinks everyone in his life has been replaced by an identical impostor.
That's wicked cool.
I know, dude!
If we sent the twins from radiology in there his brain would explode.
But still, I think it's more important that we try and figure out what he ingested, you know, so he doesn't die.
Yeah.
Fine.
Hey, Katie.
How's it going?
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
Doing great over here.
It's hard to believe that we were interns eight years ago, you know?
What?
Oh!
Sorry, my patient, Robyn, sort of got into my head, so I'm just looking over her case history.
Yeah, that's crazy boring to me, so you know what I'm going to do?
I'm gonna just continue my conversation.
All the signs point to anorexia.
Do you like being a doctor?
Maybe I just wanna believe her.
I love being a doctor.
It's not like all of those other jobs where you just sit on your ass all day.
You actually get to do things.
Okay, Mrs. Emmitt, there's going to be a little discomfort from the needle, but not too much.
Prepare to witness perfection.
Did you really just say that?
TURK:
I also like that doctors get to think on their feet.
Mr. Swick, I want to commend you for not disclosing what you ingested before, because, well, you were actually talking to my imposter.
I knew it!
And I'm impressed 'cause the differences are subtle.
You see, his voice sounds like this.
And my voice sounds like this.
I heard it.
Anyway, why don't you just tell me what you took before he comes back?
Yes!
I tricked his ass!
Someone give me some!
Look, I came from home because I couldn't sleep.
Howie, I've decided I am not comfortable with you giving high-fives, even when I'm not here.
But I just totally nailed a diagnosis.
The fact that I'm not making a tremendous sex joke right now about who or what I nailed tonight should tell you how serious I am.
You know what?
I'm spending so much time focusing on Robyn's past that I'm prejudicing myself.
I mean, if I just looked at her admission form from this morning,
"Young woman who has undergone a drastic weight loss
"even though she says she's been eating,"
well, I'd know exactly what to look for.
Handle your business.
I'll go check on the interns.
(WHISPERING) Katie, no!
- But it works.
- I said no.
He's human.
- Do we got blast-off yet?
- Nothing yet.
Give me some good news, man.
I need a win.
He overdosed on acetaminophen.
- There we go.
- Boo-yah.
Hey, Derek, everything all good in here?
(CHUCKLES) You know it!
But I'm getting some bubbles coming out with the fluid.
- Is that supposed to happen?
- No.
Step back, please.
Thank you.
Mrs. Emmitt, I'm gonna need you to hold still.
You might have a collapsed lung.
(WHISPERING) Quick, tell him that's impossible because you're the greatest doctor in the world.
The troops are one for four.
How's it going over here?
Not great.
Robyn is HIV positive.
That sucks.
Yeah.
(ELLIOT SIGHS)
When she wakes up I have to tell her.
Elliot, maybe it won't be so bad.
You know, we made a lot of headway with HIV.
It's not a death sentence anymore.
Check out Mr. Maller over here.
He found out he was HIV positive today.
(WHOOPING)
All right, admittedly, he's not psyched about that, he's actually watching sports on his computer.
- Oh!
- Yeah.
Elliot, my point is, maybe it won't be that hard telling Robyn she has the Hivvie.
Hivvie?
I heard somebody say it and I thought it was kind of cool.
It sounds like a dance the kids do nowadays, you know.
(SINGING) Do the Hivvie Do the Hivvie
Do the Hivvie Do the Hivvie
Like this?
- (SINGING) Do the Hivvie
- Do the Hivvie
Break it down.
- Do the Hivvie
- Do the Hivvie
There it is.
Do the...
I like it when you do the Hivvie.
We should not do the Hivvie!
Okay.
(SINGING) Do the Hivvie Do the Hivvie
Mrs. Emmitt, we can't drain the fluid in your chest until we repair your collapsed lung.
How did I get a collapsed lung?
That happened when I tried to drain the fluid.
I'm sorry.
Okay, but when it's fixed,
I want the procedure to be done by a real doctor.
So how long is it before you become a real doctor?
Is it soon?
Back off, okay?
Oh!
Come on!
When you act all hurt it ruins all the fun for me!
Anything?
(IMITATING EXPLOSIONS)
No.
Mrs. Powell, when I was a kid, my mom used to tell me that farts were demons that were crawling around in your belly, and if I ever let one out it would give my grandma cancer.
So, I know what you're going through.
But let me tell you the real issue here.
The number one killer in hospitals is infection.
And since you just underwent surgery, you're very susceptible.
We need to get you out of here, but we can't until you do it, so it's up to you.
(GRUNTING)
I'm so sorry we have to strap your arms down.
Please know I'm just trying to help.
(SPITS)
Hey, Katie.
I can't really talk right now.
Looks like someone got her first face-spitting.
See, there's lots of things to hate about being a doctor.
I mean, for starters, no woman looks good in scrubs, but guys do, it's unfair.
Plus, malpractice insurance, bad hours...
Yeah, but at least you guys in medicine get to figure stuff out.
You know, you were like a detective with your HIV patient.
Surgeons, all we do is cut and sew.
Sometimes I feel like a glorified mechanic.
(COUNTRY INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Yeah.
Well, the spleen's shot to hell.
I'm gonna have to remove it.
While I'm in there, I might as well get that gall-bladder, too.
I mean, you could leave it in there, but you're just gonna be back here in a couple months.
To be honest with you, I ain't too great with those Japanese models.
I'd look good in a jumpsuit.
If you're going to fantasize like J.D., you have to talk like him when you come out of it.
I'd look good in it.
In a jumpsuit.
(LAUGHS)
- Better.
- Thank you.
I got to tell you what else I don't like about being a doctor.
The patients.
I mean, sometimes they're great.
But sometimes, like you said, they just lie through their teeth.
I need you to guzzle this Mucomyst to counteract the effects of the acetaminophen overdose.
It wasn't acetaminophen.
There was a guy in here before pretending to be you, so I lied to him to throw him off the trail.
Dude, you're killing me.
I think the only way I got through my first year here was leaning on the people around me.
You know how you found Carla and I found J. D?
Do you ever think how weird it would have been if you and I had found each other?
Elliot, you're very cute.
But your booty is really tiny.
I don't know what I would do with that thing.
You could start by smacking it.
And secondly, if we were in a committed relationship,
I'd have gained, like, 30 to 40 pounds for you.
- Really?
- No.
Still, this place could have used some jungle fever.
You know, the whole white doctor, black surgeon thing.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Why is this happening?
That whole pathetic, no self-esteem thing you have going on right now?
I'm really vibing that.
That's why I used to date fat guys.
You know, the reason why I work on my body so much now is 'cause I was kind of a heavy kid.
- How heavy?
- 260.
Oh!
God.
You know, we're acting all nostalgic, but we're barely in our thirties.
I mean, we could still do anything we want with our lives.
You think we'll both be doctors forever?
Dr. Reid?
Your patient Robyn is up.
Great.
Here goes.
Also, I got Mr. Swick to admit he actually ate fertilizer.
How'd you do that?
I may have given him a little slap.
You'll do fine here.
(MRS. POWELL BREAKS WIND)
- Dr. Turk!
It's done!
- Yeah.
Just, with me being a guy, I have to ask this question.
What did it smell like?
Thirty years of repression.
And hotdogs.
Good job.
I'm HIV positive?
You were right, it's not anorexia.
Wow, that's a huge victory for me.
Look, I know it's scary to even be talking about the "Hivvie."
- The what?
- I'm sorry.
Forget it, I'm just really nervous.
Look, the point is HIV is very treatable now.
Okay, this does not have to ruin your life.
So I should just stay positive?
Definitely.
Because even though I really want to get married and have kids, this will probably make it easier to find someone.
No.
Don't try to make this okay.
This is not okay.
This is the worst thing that's ever going to happen to me in my entire life, and you're here to see it.
So, you need to find a way to handle it better.
'Cause I get to handle it however I want.
Okay.
Do you want me to shut up?
Do you want me to leave?
No.
(CRYING)
(HARDLY ENOUGH PLAYING)
(SINGING) Hardly enough for all the trouble
And hardly enough to get it right
Here.
Sorry about that guy spitting in your face.
Thanks, Howie.
You smell horrible.
I showered three times and I can't get Mrs. Powell's stink off me.
(SNIFFS) It's in my hair.
(KATIE EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST)
Where have you two been?
- Nowhere.
We weren't anywhere.
- Nowhere.
Around.
What smells?
I'm going to go take a bath in tomato juice.
Look at that.
They have no idea what's ahead of them.
You know, I never answered your question earlier, about whether you and I would always be doctors.
You will.
You have this amazing ability to find joy in everything you do.
Thank you.
Whether it's, like, an operation you've done 100 times, or even teaching.
All right, Derek, the trick to this is to get the needle right between the ribs, okay?
Watch.
Like so.
And like so.
You wanna get it for me?
But as for me?
I know you think it was a big victory figuring out what was wrong with Robyn.
But those moments are kind of like eating a piece of chocolate.
I enjoy the satisfaction for about 10 seconds and then it's gone.
See, the thing that sticks with me is the anguish on a patient's face when I give them crappy news.
I hold on to that forever.
You're a surgeon, you occasionally get to fix people.
I figure out what's wrong with someone, and then most of the time I can't do anything about it.
I just wish them luck dealing with it, or try to keep them alive for a while longer.
So, you wanna know if I'll always be a doctor?
I'd have to say, "I don't know."
I'm a doctor now.
I will be tomorrow.
But I can tell you that if I'm ever lucky enough to get married, to have some kids, to maybe not need the money,
I think I'd walk out of here and never look back.
But how am I supposed to express my joy?
Dude, you got to find your own thing.
I'd tell you to do the low arm-pump, but Dr. Fordham owns that.
Here's the coffee you wanted.
Yeah!
Deb, relax.
It's just coffee.
Don't tell her there's donuts in the break room.
FORDHAM:
We have donuts?
Yeah!
Anyway.
Hey, Robyn.
It's good to see you again.
Now according to your chart, your hair has been falling out, your nails are splitting and you're fatigued.
Robyn, you're a zombie.
Patient also grumpy and not responding to classic comedy.
Just a little hard to find the funny when you're 32, single and balding.
Point taken.
We're gonna figure this out, okay?
And don't you worry, if you need me, I will be here all night.
- So you're working tonight too, huh?
- Yeah.
I'm new on-call surgical attending.
I kind of signed up because JD was supposed to be working with me.
I'm covering for him.
He and Sam went on a trip to...
You know what?
It's not important.
No, no.
Finish your thought.
I didn't want to tell you this.
Kim had a medical conference in Anaheim.
And so JD went and took Sam to Disneyland.
That's impossible.
Because he and I swore to each other that since we've never been to Disneyland that we would go for our 40th birthday together.
- What do you want me to say?
- That he's not at Disneyland right now.
- Can you tell me that?
- No.
You know what?
Adults move on.
And that's what I'm doing right now, I'm moving on.
How do you want to handle tonight's workload?
- I was think...
- I can't do it Elliot!
You know, I tried!
I tried but it hurts too bad.
It hurts me deep right here.
I can feel it in my chest.
That man went to Disneyland without me!
They got roller coasters that roller-coaster in the dark.
You don't where the turns are coming from.
They've got the Finding Nemo ride where you ride in round with Nemo.
It is a ride!
A ride with Nemo!
Tonight's gonna be great.
My co-pilot here is a blubbering man-child.
and the interns begin to think they know what they're doing.
We totally saved that patient's life up there.
Cancer's our bitch!
No one does a Foley cath like Howie Gilder.
Up high!
I'm not gonna get mad because you're new.
But I'm kind of the high-fiver around here.
From now on, you're only allowed to high-five when I'm not here.
Are we clear five?
You may hit that because I'm instigating.
Now get the hell out of here.
I put that central line on Mr. Phelps for you.
So next time you give me an assignment, can you make it something that's a challenge?
- Okay.
Next time.
- Make sure you do.
That's my surgical intern.
He's been here less time than everyone else and that's how he acts.
You know what we should do?
We should scare the hell out of them.
Full moon tonight, guys.
Wanna know what that means?
Means it's getting fricking crazy up in here!
Buckle up for some nasty stuff.
I'm talking nightmares that you cannot unsee.
During my first full moon shift, psych patient Tony Belmont bit off his own tongue.
And threw it at me.
We couldn't reattach the sucker so I tossed it into that very Hazmat bin.
Later that night, we heard a sound coming from in there.
So we open up the lid very very slowly.
And inside, is Mr. Belmont holding his own tongue.
Do you want to know what he said to me?
He said...
Nailed it!
Give it up!
Guys!
High-fiving?
I feel like I've been more than clear about this.
It won't happen again, Todd.
Promise.
You're my friends, so I hope not.
I'm sorry five?
- Still.
- Still.
Season 8 Episode 13 My Full Moon
{\pos(192,220)}Alright, Robyn.
Here's the deal.
{\pos(192,220)}The last time you were here, all your health issues were from malnourishment.
{\pos(192,220)}And now, a year later,
{\pos(192,220)}you're nine pounds lighter than you were at your lowest rate.
{\pos(192,220)}You know what's weird.
I really have been eating.
{\pos(192,220)}I'm gonna have you talk to a specialist named Dr. Paulson.
{\pos(192,220)}He's on his way.
Why are you having her talk to the staff shrink?
Because she's anorexic, Turk.
{\pos(192,220)}You know, I... {\pos(192,220)}I have a complicated psychological issue too.
{\pos(192,220)}Mrs. Powell, your gall bladder surgery went terrific.
{\pos(192,220)}However I can't discharge you until I'm sure your pipes are working.
{\pos(192,220)}And since you said it's impossible for you to go number two
{\pos(192,220)} outside of your house due to the fact that you're a nervous pooer... {\pos(192,220)}I feel you, sister.
{\pos(192,220)}I'm gonna have to ask you to pass gas.
Excuse me?
You know...
I don't do that.
{\pos(192,190)}
- Women fart.
- You know.
{\pos(192,190)}
- We should go.
- I know they do.
{\pos(192,190)}Cause I have a wife and a daughter, and they both fart... {\pos(192,220)}And she farts and I smelt it before.
{\pos(192,220)}It smells like hot dogs.
{\pos(192,220)}Okay guys, full moon is upon us.

Oh that's adorable.
You have a crush on yourself.
I'd be careful.
The guy you're in love with is a douche.
Where's Katie?
I've been doing post-op on your hand surgery patient Mr. Gold.
He says he can't feel anything in his arms from his elbows up.
Now, I've been doing research for hours, and I think it's either a radiculopathy or a brachial plexus injury.

That's crazy boring to me.
So you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna just continue my conversation.
All the signs point to anorexia.
Do you like being a doctor?
I just want to believe her.
I love being a doctor.
It's not like all of those other jobs where you just sit on your ass all day.
You actually get to do things.

Sounds like a dance the kids do nowadays.
Do the hivy, do the hivy...
Like this?
Bring it down.
Here it is.
- I like when you do the hivy.
- We should not do the hivy!
Do the hivy...
Mrs. Emmett, we can't drain the fluid in your chest until we repair your collapsed lung.
How did I get a collapsed lung?
That happened when I tried to drain the fluid.
I'm sorry.
Okay but when it's fixed,
I want the procedure to be done by a real doctor.
So how long is it before you become a real doctor?
Is it soon?
Back off, okay?
Come on, when you act all hurt, it ruins all the fun for me.
Anything?
Mrs. Powell, when I was a kid, my mom used to tell me that farts were demons that were crawling around in your belly and if I ever let one out, it would give my grandma cancer.
So I know what you're going through.
But let me tell you the real issue here.
The number one killer in hospitals is infection.
And since you just underwent surgery, you're very susceptible.
We need to get you out of here, but we can't until you do it so...
It's up to you.
I'm so sorry we have to strap your arms down.
Please know I'm just trying to help.
Hey Katie.
I can't really talk right now.
Looks like someone got her first face spitting.
See, there's a lot of things to hate about being a doctor.
For starters, no women looks good in scrubs.
But guys do.
It's unfair.
Plus, malpractice insurance, bad hours...
Yeah, but at least you guys in medicine get to figure stuff out.
You were like a detective with your HIV patient.
Surgeons, all we do is cut and sew.
Sometimes I feel like a glorified mechanic.
Well...
Spleen is shot to hell.
I'm gonna have to remove it.
While I'm in there, I might as well get that gall bladder too.
You can leave it in there but...
Just gonna be back in a couple of months.
To be honest with you, I ain't do great with those "japonese" models.
I'd look good in a jumpsuit.
If you fantasize like JD, you have to talk like him when you come out of it.
I'd look good in it, in a jumpsuit.
- Better.
- Thank you.
Gotta tell you what else I don't like about being a doctor.
The patients.
Sometimes they're great.
But sometimes, like you said, they just lie through their teeth.
Guzzle this Mucomyst to counteract the effects of the acetaminophen overdose.
It wasn't acetaminophen.
There was a guy in here before pretending to be you, so I lied to him to throw him off the trail.
Dude, you're killing me!
I think the only way I got through my first year here was leaning on the people around me.
You know how you found Carla and I found JD?
You ever think how weird it would've been if you and I found each other?
Elliot...
You're very cute, but your booty is really tiny,
I don't know what I would do with that thing.
You could start by smacking it.
And secondly, if we were in a committed relationship,
I'd have gained like 30 to 40 pounds for you.
- Really?
- No.
Still this place could use some jungle fever.
The whole white doctor black surgeon thing.
Wait, wait.
Why is this happening?
That whole pathetic no self-esteem thing you have going on right now...
I'm really vibing that.
That's why I used to date fat guys.
The reason why I work my body so much now is cause I was... kind of a heavy kid.
- How heavy?
- 260.
Oh god.
We're acting all nostalgic, but we're barely in our thirties.
We could still do anything we want with our lives.
You don't think we'll both be doctors forever?
Dr Reid, your patient Robyn is up.
Great.
Here goes.
Also, I got Mr. Swick to admit he actually ate fertilizer.
- How did you do that?
- I may have given him a little slap.
You'll do fine here.
It's done.
Just me being a guy, I have to ask this question.
- What did it smell like?
- 30 years of repression.
And hot dogs.
Good job.
I'm HIV-positive?
You were right.
It's not anorexia.
Wow, that's a...
Huge victory for me.
I know it's scary to even be talking about the "hivy".
The what?
I'm sorry, forget it.
I'm just really nervous.
The point is, HIV is very treatable now.
This does not have to ruin your life.
So I should just... stay positive?
Definitely.
Because...
Even though I really want to get married and have kids, this will probably make it easier... to find someone.
Don't try to make this okay.
This is not okay.
This is the worse thing that's ever gonna happen to me in my entire life.
And you're here to see it so... you need to find a way to handle it better.
Cause I get to handle it however I want.
Do you want me to shut up?
Do you want me to leave?
Here.
Sorry about the guy spitting in your face.
Thanks, Howie.
You smell horrible.
I showered three times and I can't get Mrs. Powell's stink off me.
It's in my hair.
Where have you two been?
- Nowhere.
- We weren't anywhere.
What smells?
I'm going to go take a bath in tomato juice.
Look at that.
They have no idea what's ahead of them.
You know, I never answered your question earlier about whether you and I would always be doctors.
You will.
You have this amazing ability to find joy in everything you do.
Thank you.
Whether it's like an operation you've done a hundred times, or even teaching.
Alright, the trick to this is to get the needle right between the ribs, okay?
Watch.
Like... so.
- Nice.
- You wanna get it for me?
But as for me,
I know you think it was a big victory figuring out what was wrong with Robyn.
But those moments are kind of like eating a piece of chocolate.
I enjoy the satisfaction for about ten seconds and then it's gone.
See...
The thing that sticks with me is the anguish on a patient's face when I give them crappy news.
I hold on to that forever.
You're a surgeon, you occasionally get to fix people.
I figure out what's wrong and then most of the time I can't do anything about it.
I just wish them luck dealing with it... or try to keep them alive for a while longer.
So you wanna know if I'll always be a doctor?
I'd have to say, I don't know.
I'm a doctor now, I will be tomorrow.
But I can't tell you that if I'm ever lucky enough to get married, to have some kids, to maybe not need the money,
I think I'd walk out of here and never look back.
But how am I supposed to express my joy?
{\pos(192,220)}Dude, you gotta find your own thing.
{\pos(192,220)}I'd tell you to do the low arm pump, but Dr. Fordham owns that.
{\pos(192,220)}Here's the coffee you wanted.
{\pos(192,200)}Deb, relax.
It's just coffee.
{\pos(192,210)}Don't tell her there's donuts in the break room.
{\pos(192,210)}We have donuts?
{\pos(192,180)}Anyway.
Hey, Robyn.
It's good to see you again.
Now, according to your chart, your hair's been falling out, your nails are splitting and you're fatigued.
Robyn, you're a zombie.
Hmm.
Patient also grumpy and not responding to classic comedy.
It's just a little hard to find the funny when you're 32, single and balding.
Point taken.
Look, we're going to figure this out, okay?
And you don't worry, if you need me, I will be here all night.
- So you're working tonight, too?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm the on-call surgical attending.
I kind of signed up because J.D. Was supposed to be working with me.
I'm covering for him.
He and Sam went on a little trip to...
You know what, it's not important.
Oh!
No, no, no, no, no.
Finish your thought.
(SIGHS) I didn't want to be the one to tell you this.
Kim had a medical conference in Anaheim, and so J.D. Went and took Sam to Disneyland.
That's impossible, because he and I swore to each other that since neither one of us has ever been to Disneyland, that we would go for our 40th birthday together.
What do you want me to say?
I want you to tell me he's not at Disneyland right now,
- can you tell me that?
- No.
You know what?
Adults move on, and that's what I'm doing right now.
I'm moving on.
How do you wanna handle tonight's workload?
- Okay, I was thinking...
- I can't do it, Elliot!
You know, I tried.
I tried, but it hurts too bad.
It hurts me deep right here.
It hurts me.
I can feel it in my chest!
That man went to Disneyland without me.
They got roller coasters that roller coaster in the dark, okay?
You don't know where the turns are coming from.
They got the Finding Nemo ride where you ride around with Nemo and it's a ride!
A ride with Nemo.
Okay, tonight's going to be great.
My co-pilot here is a blubbering man-child and the interns have been here just long enough that they think they know what they're doing.
We totally saved that patient's life up there.
Cancer's our bitch.
No one does a Foley cath like Howie Gelder.
Oh!
Yeah!
Up high!
Okay, I'm not going to get mad because you're new.
But I'm kind of the high-fiver around here.
From now on, you're only allowed to high-five when I'm not here.
"Are we clear" five?
You may hit that because I'm instigating.
Now get the hell out of here.
Dr. Turk.
I put that central line on Mr. Phelphs for you.
So, next time you give me an assignment, can you make it something that's a challenge?
Okay, next time I'II...
Make sure you do.
Yeah, that's my surgical intern.
He's been here less time than everyone else and that's how he acts.
- You know what we should do?
- Hmm?
We should scare the hell out of them.
Full moon tonight, guys.
You wanna know what that means?
Means it's gonna get fricking crazy up in here.
Buckle up for some nasty stuff.
I'm talking nightmares that you cannot un-see.
During my first full-moon shift, psych patient, Tony Belmont, bit off his own tongue and threw it at me.
We couldn't re-attach the sucker, so I tossed it into that very Hazmat bin.
(EERIE MUSIC PLA YIN G)
Later that night, we heard a sound coming from in there.
So we open up the lid very, very slowly, and inside is Mr. Belmont holding his own tongue.
Do you want to know what he said to me?
He said... (EX CLAIMING)
(ALL SCREAM)
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Yes!
Nailed them.
Give it up.
Guys, high-fiving?
I feel like I've been more than clear about this.
It won't happen again, Todd.
Promise.
You're my friends, so I hope not.
"I'm sorry" five?
- Still.
- Still.
MAN: (SIN GIN G) I can't do this all on my own
No, I know
I'm no Superman
I'm no Superman
All right, Robyn, here's the deal.
The last time you were here all your health issues were from malnourishment.
And now, a year later, you're nine pounds lighter than you were at your lowest weight.
But you know what's weird?
I really have been eating.
Okay.
I'm going to have you talk to a specialist named Dr. Paulson.
He's on his way.
Why are you having her talk to the staff shrink?
Because she's anorexic, Turk.
You know, I have a complicated psychological issue, too.
Mrs. Powell, your gallbladder surgery went terrific, however, I can't discharge you until I'm sure your pipes are working.
And since you said it's impossible for you to go "number two"
outside of your house due to the fact that you're a nervous poo-er... (SIGHS) I feel you, sister.
I'm gonna have to ask you to pass gas.
(SCOFFING) Excuse me?
You know.
(IMITATES FARTING)
- I don't do that.
- Women fart.
- You know, we should probably go.
- I know they do.
'Cause I have a wife and a daughter and they both fart.
And she farts and I've smelled it before.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Turk.
Enough.
- Smells like hotdogs.
Okay, guys, the full moon is upon us.
It's only 8:30, we already have 10 new admissions, so let's stay sharp.
Remember, nights like this are why you got into medicine.
Sunny, I'm gonna need you to get the lady in bed six to fart.
- I'm on it.
- Why don't you just pull her finger?
Howie, did you just make a joke?
I did, and it felt great.
Good for you.
And as a reward for the effort, you get the gentleman in bed three.
He poisoned himself.
We need to know what he took.
Go.
Gone.
Hey, my pneumonia patient, Mrs. Emmitt, is presenting with a crapload of fluid in her left lung.
"Crapload" really isn't a technical term.
Fine. "Bucketload."
Is she being sassy?
Because I love it.
More than Space Mountain?
Why, Elliot?
I just forgot about it.
Oh!
Derek, can you get Denise's patient a thoracentesis and get that fluid out of there?
Surgery to the rescue.
You are welcome.
Aw!
That's adorable.
You have a crush on yourself.
I'd be careful, the guy you're in love with is a douche.
- Where's Katie?
- KATIE:
Dr. Turk,
I've been doing post-op on your hand surgery patient, Mr. Gold.
He says he can't feel anything in his arms from his elbows up.
Now, I've been doing research for hours and I think it's either radiculopathy or a brachial plexus injury.
Or...
Ow!
He's lying.
Patients do that.
Katie, a word, please?
Look, that man is homeless and not all there.
You see his bandages?
It means he's been chewing at his sutures.
I'm probably gonna have to strap him down.
I can find another way to make him stop.
Suit yourself.
If he messes up my handiwork, it's on you.
Hi, Mr. Gold, can you do me a favor and stop chewing on your hands?
Pass.
I had to talk to that shrink for an hour.
Dr. Reid, I am not anorexic.
You've lost weight, you're anemic, your pre-albumin is low.
I mean, all symptoms point to it.
Well, who are you going to believe, me or that stupid chart?
Robyn, I'm a doctor.
We believe everything on the charts.
That's why I write "Elliot has a slamming tushie"
on every single one.
See?
Right here.
Okay.
I keep making jokes at all the wrong times, don't I?
Look, I know that this is hard...
It's only hard because it isn't true.
I've been eating.
But you've already made up your mind, haven't you?
Mrs. Powell, it's not your fault you don't want to pass gas.
It's society's.
I mean, guys have always been allowed to do it.
There's no shame for them.
But if a girl lets out even a little squeaker, she's a freak.
So, come on, for women everywhere.
Let's do it together on the count of three.
One, two, three.
Oh!
You didn't do it.
Neither did you.
There's people around.
Hi, Mr. Swick.
I'm Dr. Gelder.
You know what?
I'm going to grab a chart that doesn't say
"Elliot has a slamming tushie" on it.
Much better.
Now, Mr. Swick.
Nope, look, this one's got it, too.
Is her butt that nice?
It's okay for a white chick.
(SNICKERS)
Now, I want you to tell me how you poisoned yourself.
- I can't.
- Why not?
Because you're not my doctor.
You may sound like him, and you look exactly like him, but you're not him.
Excuse me.
All right.
Thanks, Dr. Paulson.
So, the staff shrink says that Mr. Swick has Capgras Syndrome.
It's a brain disorder.
Basically, it means he thinks everyone in his life has been replaced by an identical impostor.
That's wicked cool.
I know, dude!
If we sent the twins from radiology in there his brain would explode.
But still, I think it's more important that we try and figure out what he ingested, you know, so he doesn't die.
Yeah.
Fine.
Hey, Katie.
How's it going?
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
Doing great over here.
It's hard to believe that we were interns eight years ago, you know?
What?
Oh!
Sorry, my patient, Robyn, sort of got into my head, so I'm just looking over her case history.
Yeah, that's crazy boring to me, so you know what I'm going to do?
I'm gonna just continue my conversation.
All the signs point to anorexia.
Do you like being a doctor?
Maybe I just wanna believe her.
I love being a doctor.
It's not like all of those other jobs where you just sit on your ass all day.
You actually get to do things.
Okay, Mrs. Emmitt, there's going to be a little discomfort from the needle, but not too much.
Prepare to witness perfection.
Did you really just say that?
TURK:
I also like that doctors get to think on their feet.
Mr. Swick, I want to commend you for not disclosing what you ingested before, because, well, you were actually talking to my imposter.
I knew it!
And I'm impressed 'cause the differences are subtle.
You see, his voice sounds like this.
And my voice sounds like this.
I heard it.
Anyway, why don't you just tell me what you took before he comes back?
Yes!
I tricked his ass!
Someone give me some!
Look, I came from home because I couldn't sleep.
Howie, I've decided I am not comfortable with you giving high-fives, even when I'm not here.
But I just totally nailed a diagnosis.
The fact that I'm not making a tremendous sex joke right now about who or what I nailed tonight should tell you how serious I am.
You know what?
I'm spending so much time focusing on Robyn's past that I'm prejudicing myself.
I mean, if I just looked at her admission form from this morning,
"Young woman who has undergone a drastic weight loss
"even though she says she's been eating,"
well, I'd know exactly what to look for.
Handle your business.
I'll go check on the interns.
(WHISPERING) Katie, no!
- But it works.
- I said no.
He's human.
- Do we got blast-off yet?
- Nothing yet.
Give me some good news, man.
I need a win.
He overdosed on acetaminophen.
- There we go.
- Boo-yah.
Hey, Derek, everything all good in here?
(CHUCKLES) You know it!
But I'm getting some bubbles coming out with the fluid.
- Is that supposed to happen?
- No.
Step back, please.
Thank you.
Mrs. Emmitt, I'm gonna need you to hold still.
You might have a collapsed lung.
(WHISPERING) Quick, tell him that's impossible because you're the greatest doctor in the world.
The troops are one for four.
How's it going over here?
Not great.
Robyn is HIV positive.
That sucks.
Yeah.
(ELLIOT SIGHS)
When she wakes up I have to tell her.
Elliot, maybe it won't be so bad.
You know, we made a lot of headway with HIV.
It's not a death sentence anymore.
Check out Mr. Maller over here.
He found out he was HIV positive today.
(WHOOPING)
All right, admittedly, he's not psyched about that, he's actually watching sports on his computer.
- Oh!
- Yeah.
Elliot, my point is, maybe it won't be that hard telling Robyn she has the Hivvie.
Hivvie?
I heard somebody say it and I thought it was kind of cool.
It sounds like a dance the kids do nowadays, you know.
(SINGING) Do the Hivvie Do the Hivvie
Do the Hivvie Do the Hivvie
Like this?
- (SINGING) Do the Hivvie
- Do the Hivvie
Break it down.
- Do the Hivvie
- Do the Hivvie
There it is.
Do the...
I like it when you do the Hivvie.
We should not do the Hivvie!
Okay.
(SINGING) Do the Hivvie Do the Hivvie
Mrs. Emmitt, we can't drain the fluid in your chest until we repair your collapsed lung.
How did I get a collapsed lung?
That happened when I tried to drain the fluid.
I'm sorry.
Okay, but when it's fixed,
I want the procedure to be done by a real doctor.
So how long is it before you become a real doctor?
Is it soon?

(GRUNTING)
I'm so sorry we have to strap your arms down.
Please know I'm just trying to help.
(SPITS)
Hey, Katie.
I can't really talk right now.
Looks like someone got her first face-spitting.
See, there's lots of things to hate about being a doctor.
I mean, for starters, no woman looks good in scrubs, but guys do, it's unfair.
Plus, malpractice insurance, bad hours...
Yeah, but at least you guys in medicine get to figure stuff out.
You know, you were like a detective with your HIV patient.
Surgeons, all we do is cut and sew.

I kind of signed up because J.D. Was supposed to be working with me.
I'm covering for him.
He and Sam went on a little trip to...
You know what, it's not important.
Oh!
No, no, no, no, no.
Finish your thought.
I didn't want to be the one to tell you this.
Kim had a medical conference in Anaheim, and so J.D. Went and took Sam to Disneyland.
That's impossible, because he and I swore to each other that since neither one of us has ever been to Disneyland, that we would go for our 40th birthday together.
What do you want me to say?
I want you to tell me he's not at Disneyland right now,
- can you tell me that?
- No.
You know what?
Adults move on, and that's what I'm doing right now.
I'm moving on.
How do you wanna handle tonight's workload?
- Okay, I was thinking...
- I can't do it, Elliot!
You know, I tried.
I tried, but it hurts too bad.
It hurts me deep right here.
It hurts me.
I can feel it in my chest!
That man went to Disneyland without me.
They got roller coasters that roller coaster in the dark, okay?
You don't know where the turns are coming from.
They got the Finding Nemo ride where you ride around with Nemo and it's a ride!
A ride with Nemo.
Okay, tonight's going to be great.
My co-pilot here is a blubbering man-child and the interns have been here just long enough that they think they know what they're doing.
We totally saved that patient's life up there.
Cancer's our bitch.
No one does a Foley cath like Howie Gelder.
Oh!
Yeah!
Up high!
Okay, I'm not going to get mad because you're new.
But I'm kind of the high-fiver around here.
From now on, you're only allowed to high-five when I'm not here.
"Are we clear" five?
You may hit that because I'm instigating.
Now get the hell out of here.
Dr. Turk.
I put that central line on Mr. Phelphs for you.
So, next time you give me an assignment, can you make it something that's a challenge?
Okay, next time I'll...
Make sure you do.
Yeah, that's my surgical intern.
He's been here less time than everyone else and that's how he acts.
- You know what we should do?
- Hmm?
We should scare the hell out of them.
Full moon tonight, guys.
You wanna know what that means?
Means it's gonna get fricking crazy up in here.
Buckle up for some nasty stuff.
I'm talking nightmares that you cannot un-see.
During my first full-moon shift, psych patient, Tony Belmont, bit off his own tongue and threw it at me.
We couldn't re-attach the sucker, so I tossed it into that very Hazmat bin.
Later that night, we heard a sound coming from in there.
So we open up the lid very, very slowly, and inside is Mr. Belmont holding his own tongue.
Do you want to know what he said to me?
He said...
Yes!
Nailed them.
Give it up.
Guys, high-fiving?
I feel like I've been more than clear about this.
It won't happen again, Todd.
Promise.
You're my friends, so I hope not.
"I'm sorry" five?
- Still.
- Still.
I can't do this all on my own
No, I know
I'm no Superman
I'm no Superman
All right, Robyn, here's the deal.
The last time you were here all your health issues were from malnourishment.
And now, a year later, you're nine pounds lighter than you were at your lowest weight.
But you know what's weird?
I really have been eating.
Okay.
I'm going to have you talk to a specialist named Dr. Paulson.
He's on his way.
Why are you having her talk to the staff shrink?
Because she's anorexic, Turk.
You know, I have a complicated psychological issue, too.
Mrs. Powell, your gallbladder surgery went terrific, however, I can't discharge you until I'm sure your pipes are working.
And since you said it's impossible for you to go "number two"
outside of your house due to the fact that you're a nervous poo-er...
I feel you, sister.
I'm gonna have to ask you to pass gas.
Excuse me?
You know.
- I don't do that.
- Women fart.
- You know, we should probably go.
- I know they do.
'Cause I have a wife and a daughter and they both fart.
And she farts and I've smelled it before.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Turk.
Enough.
- Smells like hotdogs.
Okay, guys, the full moon is upon us.
It's only 8:30, we already have 10 new admissions, so let's stay sharp.
Remember, nights like this are why you got into medicine.
Sunny, I'm gonna need you to get the lady in bed six to fart.
- I'm on it.
- Why don't you just pull her finger?
Howie, did you just make a joke?
I did, and it felt great.
Good for you.
And as a reward for the effort, you get the gentleman in bed three.
He poisoned himself.
We need to know what he took.
Go.
Gone.
Hey, my pneumonia patient, Mrs. Emmitt, is presenting with a crapload of fluid in her left lung.
"Crapload" really isn't a technical term.
Fine. "Bucketload."
Is she being sassy?
Because I love it.
More than Space Mountain?
Why, Elliot?
I just forgot about it.
Oh!
Derek, can you get Denise's patient a thoracentesis and get that fluid out of there?
Surgery to the rescue.
You are welcome.
Aw!
That's adorable.
You have a crush on yourself.
I'd be careful, the guy you're in love with is a douche.
- Where's Katie?
- Dr. Turk,
I've been doing post-op on your hand surgery patient, Mr. Gold.
He says he can't feel anything in his arms from his elbows up.
Now, I've been doing research for hours and I think it's either radiculopathy or a brachial plexus injury.
Or...
Ow!
He's lying.
Patients do that.
Katie, a word, please?
Look, that man is homeless and not all there.
You see his bandages?
It means he's been chewing at his sutures.
I'm probably gonna have to strap him down.
I can find another way to make him stop.
Suit yourself.
If he messes up my handiwork, it's on you.
Hi, Mr. Gold, can you do me a favor and stop chewing on your hands?
Pass.
I had to talk to that shrink for an hour.
Dr. Reid, I am not anorexic.
You've lost weight, you're anemic, your pre-albumin is low.
I mean, all symptoms point to it.
Well, who are you going to believe, me or that stupid chart?
Robyn, I'm a doctor.
We believe everything on the charts.
That's why I write "Elliot has a slamming tushie"
on every single one.
See?
Right here.
Okay.
I keep making jokes at all the wrong times, don't I?
Look, I know that this is hard...
It's only hard because it isn't true.
I've been eating.
But you've already made up your mind, haven't you?
Mrs. Powell, it's not your fault you don't want to pass gas.
It's society's.
I mean, guys have always been allowed to do it.
There's no shame for them.
But if a girl lets out even a little squeaker, she's a freak.
So, come on, for women everywhere.
Let's do it together on the count of three.
One, two, three.
Oh!
You didn't do it.
Neither did you.
There's people around.
Hi, Mr. Swick.
I'm Dr. Gelder.
You know what?
I'm going to grab a chart that doesn't say
"Elliot has a slamming tushie" on it.
Much better.
Now, Mr. Swick.
Nope, look, this one's got it, too.
Is her butt that nice?
It's okay for a white chick.
Now, I want you to tell me how you poisoned yourself.
- I can't.
- Why not?
Because you're not my doctor.
You may sound like him, and you look exactly like him, but you're not him.
Excuse me.
All right.
Thanks, Dr. Paulson.
So, the staff shrink says that Mr. Swick has Capgras Syndrome.
It's a brain disorder.
Basically, it means he thinks everyone in his life has been replaced by an identical impostor.
That's wicked cool.
I know, dude!
If we sent the twins from radiology in there his brain would explode.
But still, I think it's more important that we try and figure out what he ingested, you know, so he doesn't die.
Yeah.
Fine.
Hey, Katie.
How's it going?
Doing great over here.
It's hard to believe that we were interns eight years ago, you know?
What?
Oh!
Sorry, my patient, Robyn, sort of got into my head, so I'm just looking over her case history.
Yeah, that's crazy boring to me, so you know what I'm going to do?
I'm gonna just continue my conversation.
All the signs point to anorexia.
Do you like being a doctor?
Maybe I just wanna believe her.
I love being a doctor.
It's not like all of those other jobs where you just sit on your ass all day.
You actually get to do things.
Okay, Mrs. Emmitt, there's going to be a little discomfort from the needle, but not too much.
Prepare to witness perfection.
Did you really just say that?
I also like that doctors get to think on their feet.
Mr. Swick, I want to commend you for not disclosing what you ingested before, because, well, you were actually talking to my imposter.
I knew it!
And I'm impressed 'cause the differences are subtle.
You see, his voice sounds like this.
And my voice sounds like this.
I heard it.
Anyway, why don't you just tell me what you took before he comes back?
Yes!
I tricked his ass!
Someone give me some!
Look, I came from home because I couldn't sleep.
Howie, I've decided I am not comfortable with you giving high-fives, even when I'm not here.
But I just totally nailed a diagnosis.
The fact that I'm not making a tremendous sex joke right now about who or what I nailed tonight should tell you how serious I am.
You know what?
I'm spending so much time focusing on Robyn's past that I'm prejudicing myself.
I mean, if I just looked at her admission form from this morning,
"Young woman who has undergone a drastic weight loss
"even though she says she's been eating,"
well, I'd know exactly what to look for.
Handle your business.
I'll go check on the interns.
Katie, no!
- But it works.
- I said no.
He's human.
- Do we got blast-off yet?
- Nothing yet.
Give me some good news, man.
I need a win.
He overdosed on acetaminophen.
- There we go.
- Boo-yah.
Hey, Derek, everything all good in here?
You know it!
But I'm getting some bubbles coming out with the fluid.
- Is that supposed to happen?
- No.
Step back, please.
Thank you.
Mrs. Emmitt, I'm gonna need you to hold still.
You might have a collapsed lung.
Quick, tell him that's impossible because you're the greatest doctor in the world.
The troops are one for four.
How's it going over here?
Not great.
Robyn is HIV positive.
That sucks.
Yeah.
When she wakes up I have to tell her.
Elliot, maybe it won't be so bad.
You know, we made a lot of headway with HIV.
It's not a death sentence anymore.
Check out Mr. Maller over here.
He found out he was HIV positive today.
All right, admittedly, he's not psyched about that, he's actually watching sports on his computer.
- Oh!
- Yeah.
Elliot, my point is, maybe it won't be that hard telling Robyn she has the Hivvie.
Hivvie?
I heard somebody say it and I thought it was kind of cool.
It sounds like a dance the kids do nowadays, you know.
Do the Hivvie Do the Hivvie
Do the Hivvie Do the Hivvie
Like this?
- Do the Hivvie
- Do the Hivvie
Break it down.
- Do the Hivvie
- Do the Hivvie
There it is.
Do the...
I like it when you do the Hivvie.
We should not do the Hivvie!
Okay.
Do the Hivvie Do the Hivvie
Mrs. Emmitt, we can't drain the fluid in your chest until we repair your collapsed lung.
How did I get a collapsed lung?
That happened when I tried to drain the fluid.
I'm sorry.
Okay, but when it's fixed,
I want the procedure to be done by a real doctor.
So how long is it before you become a real doctor?
Is it soon?
Back off, okay?
Oh!
Come on!
When you act all hurt it ruins all the fun for me!
Anything?
No.
Mrs. Powell, when I was a kid, my mom used to tell me that farts were demons that were crawling around in your belly, and if I ever let one out it would give my grandma cancer.
So, I know what you're going through.
But let me tell you the real issue here.
The number one killer in hospitals is infection.
And since you just underwent surgery, you're very susceptible.
We need to get you out of here, but we can't until you do it, so it's up to you.
I'm so sorry we have to strap your arms down.
Please know I'm just trying to help.
Hey, Katie.
I can't really talk right now.
Looks like someone got her first face-spitting.
See, there's lots of things to hate about being a doctor.
I mean, for starters, no woman looks good in scrubs, but guys do, it's unfair.
Plus, malpractice insurance, bad hours...
Yeah, but at least you guys in medicine get to figure stuff out.
You know, you were like a detective with your HIV patient.
Surgeons, all we do is cut and sew.
Sometimes I feel like a glorified mechanic.
Yeah.
Well, the spleen's shot to hell.
I'm gonna have to remove it.
While I'm in there, I might as well get that gall-bladder, too.
I mean, you could leave it in there, but you're just gonna be back here in a couple months.
To be honest with you, I ain't too great with those Japanese models.
I'd look good in a jumpsuit.
If you're going to fantasize like J.D., you have to talk like him when you come out of it.
I'd look good in it.
In a jumpsuit.
- Better.
- Thank you.
I got to tell you what else I don't like about being a doctor.
The patients.
I mean, sometimes they're great.
But sometimes, like you said, they just lie through their teeth.
I need you to guzzle this Mucomyst to counteract the effects of the acetaminophen overdose.
It wasn't acetaminophen.
There was a guy in here before pretending to be you, so I lied to him to throw him off the trail.
Dude, you're killing me.
I think the only way I got through my first year here was leaning on the people around me.
You know how you found Carla and I found J. D?
Do you ever think how weird it would have been if you and I had found each other?
Elliot, you're very cute.
But your booty is really tiny.
I don't know what I would do with that thing.
You could start by smacking it.
And secondly, if we were in a committed relationship,
I'd have gained, like, 30 to 40 pounds for you.
- Really?
- No.
Still, this place could have used some jungle fever.
You know, the whole white doctor, black surgeon thing.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Why is this happening?
That whole pathetic, no self-esteem thing you have going on right now?
I'm really vibing that.
That's why I used to date fat guys.
You know, the reason why I work on my body so much now is 'cause I was kind of a heavy kid.
- How heavy?
- 260.
Oh!
God.
You know, we're acting all nostalgic, but we're barely in our thirties.
I mean, we could still do anything we want with our lives.
You think we'll both be doctors forever?
Dr. Reid?
Your patient Robyn is up.
Great.
Here goes.
Also, I got Mr. Swick to admit he actually ate fertilizer.
How'd you do that?
I may have given him a little slap.
You'll do fine here.
- Dr. Turk!
It's done!
- Yeah.
Just, with me being a guy, I have to ask this question.
What did it smell like?
Thirty years of repression.
And hotdogs.
Good job.
I'm HIV positive?
You were right, it's not anorexia.
Wow, that's a huge victory for me.
Look, I know it's scary to even be talking about the "Hivvie."
- The what?
- I'm sorry.
Forget it, I'm just really nervous.
Look, the point is HIV is very treatable now.
Okay, this does not have to ruin your life.
So I should just stay positive?
Definitely.
Because even though I really want to get married and have kids, this will probably make it easier to find someone.
No.
Don't try to make this okay.
This is not okay.
This is the worst thing that's ever going to happen to me in my entire life, and you're here to see it.
So, you need to find a way to handle it better.
'Cause I get to handle it however I want.
Okay.
Do you want me to shut up?
Do you want me to leave?
No.
Hardly enough for all the trouble
And hardly enough to get it right
Here.
Sorry about that guy spitting in your face.
Thanks, Howie.
You smell horrible.
I showered three times and I can't get Mrs. Powell's stink off me.
It's in my hair.
Where have you two been?
- Nowhere.
We weren't anywhere.
- Nowhere.
Around.
What smells?
I'm going to go take a bath in tomato juice.
Look at that.
They have no idea what's ahead of them.
You know, I never answered your question earlier, about whether you and I would always be doctors.
You will.
You have this amazing ability to find joy in everything you do.
Thank you.
Whether it's, like, an operation you've done 100 times, or even teaching.
All right, Derek, the trick to this is to get the needle right between the ribs, okay?
Watch.
Like so.
And like so.
You wanna get it for me?
But as for me?
I know you think it was a big victory figuring out what was wrong with Robyn.
But those moments are kind of like eating a piece of chocolate.
I enjoy the satisfaction for about 10 seconds and then it's gone.
See, the thing that sticks with me is the anguish on a patient's face when I give them crappy news.
I hold on to that forever.
You're a surgeon, you occasionally get to fix people.
I figure out what's wrong with someone, and then most of the time I can't do anything about it.
I just wish them luck dealing with it, or try to keep them alive for a while longer.
So, you wanna know if I'll always be a doctor?
I'd have to say, "I don't know."
I'm a doctor now.
I will be tomorrow.
But I can tell you that if I'm ever lucky enough to get married, to have some kids, to maybe not need the money,
I think I'd walk out of here and never look back.
But how am I supposed to express my joy?
Dude, you got to find your own thing.
I'd tell you to do the low arm-pump, but Dr. Fordham owns that.
Here's the coffee you wanted.
Yeah!
Deb, relax.
It's just coffee.
Don't tell her there's donuts in the break room.
We have donuts?
Yeah!
Anyway.
It's the most wonderful time of the year
I love Thanksgiving.
It's The Cleveland Thanksgiving.
Brought to you by Cascade.
Cascade.
Your husband will thank you for it.
With special guests Crystal Gayle Wayland Flowers and Madame Heisman Trophy winner Tony Dorsett and the Cleveland Brown dancers.
My name is Cleveland Brown And I am proud to be
Right back in my hometown With my new family
There's old friends and new friends And even a bear
Through good times and bad times It's true love we share
And so I found a place Where everyone will know
My happy mustache face This is the Cleveland Show
Freeze, Indian.
I will now steal your land and name my sports teams after you.
Joke's on you, white man.
My descendants will corner the market on blue-jean jackets and blow cigarette smoke in the faces of your descendants.
Oh, goody.
That must be my mommy.
Hi, Mom.
Welcome to our new home.
Cleveland.
Oh, Lord.
You're wasting away.
Are you feeding him?
Not enough.
Look at me.
- Hello, Cookie.
- Well, you've been eating.
We missed you at the wedding.
Oh, you mean the wedding with my son who wasn't good enough 25 years ago but now you'll take him since you're left with two misbehaving kids?
Yes.
That wedding.
And for your information, my kids do behave themselves.
Oh, fuck.
We lit this bag of dogshit on fire right on the bear's porch.
Then the bear comes out and stomps on it.
And he's like, "Oh, I got dogshit on my fucking foot."
Ha, ha, ha, fucking bear.
Who the fuck is this?
This is my mother.
I meant no disrespect.
Let me get you a JET magazine and some sweet tea.
Oh, thank you, young man.
But first, I have someone else I'd like you to meet.
Dad?
Ow, my neck.
My neck and my back.
Hey, Chunky.
Sir.
Donna, you remember my father who left my mother for a Waffle House waitress twice.
So you two are back together?
- Looks that way.
- Why you ask so many questions?
Oh, girl, Thanksgiving is wack.
Every moment I have to be away from you, my heart is, like, damn.
You know what?
Hell with our families.
We should have our own Thanksgiving.
A romantic Thanksgiving, just the two of us.
For real, yo?
That's tight.
We's Romeo and Julieting this turkey day.
I loves you, Ro-ham.
I loves you more than unicorns love pixie dust.
You got any Fruit Stripe Gum?
- Ow.
- Watch where you walking, Pudgy.
Um, can I help you find something?
Nope.
I'm just looking for a glass without a spot on it.
How embarrassing.
I knew I should have paid a few cents more for Cascade.
Check out baby Cleveland in the bathtub.
Look at his little bitty tiny cashew.
I can't see it.
Let me get my reading binoculars.
I like this kid.
You know, I been thinking maybe I should shoot out another kid try to get this one right.
I've had similar thoughts.
And, you know, I have not gone through the change.
You gone through the change on the outside.
You know, I think it's wonderful that the whole family will be here for Thanksgiving tomorrow.
Mom, did you not get my text?
I'm spending Thanksgiving with Federline.
You most certainly are not.
Do you have any idea how much work I am putting into this dinner?
Judging from those store-bought pies in the kitchen, I'd say not enough.
Are you gonna let your crazy mother talk to me like that?
Ha, ha.
That's my mama.
Ha, ha.
Are you gonna let your big-ass wife talk to me like that?
Ha, ha.
That's my wife.
Ha, ha.
While you guys work that out, I'm gonna get going.
Roberta, your mother wants you...
You are not my father.
New family's really warming up to you, Tubby.
That's it.
You wanna dance, little lady?
Fight, fight, fight.
- Bye, Mom.
- You are not going anywhere.
Let go of my coat.
Your coat?
I paid for this coat.
Hey, Cleveland's dad.
Dad.
Let go of my coat.
Fight.
Fight.
Fight.
Well, what in tarnation is going on up in here?
Auntie Momma.
Damn skippy.
Oh, whee.
Up jumped the devil.
Don't squeeze too tight or else somebody's gonna have to call the fart police.
Those filling-station nachos are not agreeing with your Auntie Momma.
I'm outrageous!
Now stop all this scrapping, dipping, and dapping, don't know what's happening.
Now, who's this little one?
Donna, don't tell me you went and got yourself knocked up by Anthony Anderson.
You nasty girl.
Hi, strange lady.
My name is Cleveland Brown Jr.
And I'm Lavar Brown.
But call me Freight Train.
Oh, well, choo-choo to you.
Hire me a couple Chinese because we building a train track right here.
Auntie Momma, you should have told me you were coming.
Girl, you know Auntie Momma can't be tied down unless this one's doing the tying.
Ooh-ooh!
I'm outrageous.
Hey, Auntie Momma.
Cleveland Brown, as I live and breathe.
Look at you.
All grown up and unconventionally sexy.
Moustache all putting Wilt Chamberlain's to shame.
Honey, I should know.
I was number 8433 and 11,760.
Ooh, I'm outrageous.
Auntie Momma, we need to talk.
Mm-hm.
You know we will, girlfriend.
I wanna hear all about the young mens up in your life.
But now, Auntie Momma's off to the potty room to see what all these farts are about.
Ha, ha.
Maybe this Thanksgiving won't be so bad after all.
I'm gonna clean up this broken glass.
Sorry I tossed him the knife, but I wanted him to kill you.
I can see Auntie Momma's penis.
Auntie Momma's penis?
Let's play a game.
Everybody say something weird about themselves.
I'll start.
I don't have nails on my small toes.
Your turn, Auntie Momma.
I don't understand why a no-good team like the Lions gets to play on Thanksgiving.
But I'd still let them pile up on me in the locker room.
I love a good sack.
Auntie Momma.
I'm outrageous.
See that, Cookie?
A lady who loves football, that's a real woman.
No offense.
That's an ugly apron.
Whoops.
Sometimes they jump on you.
What's wrong with you, sourpuss?
You look lower than Clint Eastwood's testicles.
We had a pretty good run.
Had Angie Dickinson, didn't we, boys?
She won't let me spend Thanksgiving with Federline.
Girl wants to be with her boyfriend.
Pumpkin, why you trying to keep those two lovebirds apart?
Thanksgiving is about family.
Roberta should be with us.
Now, sweet potato-pudding-plum pie, I remember another 15-year-old girl with more boobs than brains who thought nobody understood her.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
Me.
And what did I tell you back then?
You told me that I should fly like a bird because you can't keep your heart in a cage.
And then you farted.
And then you said you were outrageous.
That's right.
And now when I look at Roberta, do you know what I see?
A younger, stupider you.
Donna, let this caged bird fly too.
I want you home before curfew.
Thanks, Mom.
I love you, Auntie Momma.
Ah, that woman can convince me of anything.
I'll say.
Donna, I need to talk to you about Auntie Momma.
Cleveland, I know.
I know.
She can be a little outrageous.
I think even she knows that.
But my whole life, she's been the one person I could always count on.
I don't know what I'd do without my Auntie Momma or if my image of her was changed in any way.
Now, what did you wanna say?
Uh...
She's a handsome woman.
And not like men are handsome.
Like a woman is handsome.
Like a woman is handsome.
Okay, turkey-day football game.
The count's five Mississippi.
I've chalked the end zones with Parmesan cheese.
You get one blitz per set of downs.
There's no rollover blitzes unless...
- Hey.
- You talk too much, C-cup.
Tubbs against Browns.
Donna, you get Rallo and the fine Auntie Momma.
You got your work cut out for you.
I'm kind of a ball hog.
And I'm also a "hog" hog.
Mm.
Well, I don't know about all that, but you can gargle my balls.
You outrageous.
Looks like the outrageous is contagious.
Okay, we'll kick off.
Train left the station and you...
Ugh!
Damn.
Where did you learn to play like that?
This ain't my first time on a football field.
Ask Earl Campbell what we did on the 50-yard line at the Astrodome back in '79.
Why don't you show me?
Because Donna used all the Crisco for the pancakes.
There's Head and Shoulders in the crapper.
I like the way you think.
Okay, you guys, kick off.
Game's over.
I'm about to pull my groin.
Hmm.
That's one bald pussy.
I'm worried about your mother.
I'm worried about my father.
I'm worried about leaving my soda can unattended because a bee could easily fly in there.
And then I would take a sip and that bee could sting me inside my throat.
And then people would ask, "What's wrong, Cleveland Brown Jr?"
And I wouldn't be able to tell them because my throat would be all closed up.
Write it in your worry journal.
What was that?
- Oh, damn.
It's homelesses.
- Oh, my God.
They stole the Cutlass.
They done stripped me of my whip.
Whip stripped.
Whoo-ooh!
Mm.
This Freight Train can't wait to hook up with that caboose.
All aboard.
Ooh, I got a feeling sex is gonna be all sloppy with you.
My reputation precedes me.
Ha, ha.
Ooh.
Oh, what do I do?
What do I do?
Do the right thing, Cleveland.
Daryl Hall?
What are you doing here?
I'm here to weigh in on your situation.
You thinking about letting your father walk into a wiener factory?
I can't go for that.
No can do.
- Who are you?
- Seriously?
You got angel, Daryl Hall, on your left shoulder and you can't figure who I am?
- John Oates?
- Actual size.
Screw you, Hall.
Your dad's a jerk.
Don't tell him.
Let him wrangle that dangle.
Well, maybe if you warn your father, he'll finally appreciate you.
I still say, "Let him tickle that pickle."
Whoa, here she comes
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
Whoa, here she comes
She's a man
Oh, Dad, come here.
Go away, fool.
It's important.
You can't do this because...
Dad, you came here with Mom.
Show the woman a little respect.
Your mama ain't a woman.
You're more of a woman than she is.
Your boobs are bigger, your ass is rounder, and your moustache ain't as thick.
That is a woman.
Now, if you'll excuse me, princess, I'm gonna go destroy your kids' bathroom.
You know what?
I take it back.
You and Auntie Momma have a great time together.
I'm sure you'll learn a lot about each other.
Ha, ha.
I'm outrageous.
Uh-oh.
So should we wait for Freight Train and Auntie Momma?
I don't think we'll have to wait too long.
Let's just sit back and enjoy the sounds of a Freight Train wreck.
That is cold, old man.
Letting your own pops fall blindly into a manhole.
What?
How did you know?
Man, I'm 5.
Sitting on laps is my job.
I know what's supposed to be there and what's not.
I can't say as I blame you for not telling him.
It will be pretty funny.
Can you imagine?
"Oh, I can't wait to reach down and fiddle with something nice."
Oh, no.
What's this?
This is a terrible turn of events.
"I'm gonna go punch Cleveland."
Uh-oh.
Oh, it'll be worth it.
Ha, ha.
Crying game
What a fine-Iooking meal.
I am starving.
I just worked up a man-sized appetite.
I hope you all weren't waiting for me.
I was just upstairs laying down.
With your face in the pillow.
Cleveland, are you okay?
He'd be okay if you didn't undercook the turkey.
Undercooked?
This turkey looks perfect.
Mm.
Smack myself in the face with it.
You want me to get the bucket?
Mm.
I'm gonna reach in there and get me some of that good stuffing.
Look at there.
Put my hand up in there.
My whole arm.
Mm.
Mm.
Now, that's a mouthful.
Look, I lost my damn watch.
I don't think it's in the turkey.
Gobble, gobble.
Ha, ha.
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
Hey, there's your car.
Oh, it's on.
Those homelesses are about to become toothlesses.
- They might already be toothlesses.
- I realized that as I was saying it.
Hey, it's Roberta and the Friedman boy.
Hey, come help us do Thanksgiving, missionary style.
It's nice to see young people doing the public service instead of the drugs.
Like I always say, "Helping others is the real crystal meth."
Actually, we're not here to volunteer.
There's one of them fools who jacked my whip.
Oh, Filthy Nick?
Filthy Nick, did you steal this kid's car?
Did I steal your car?
Or have you had your keys all along?
- Damn.
- Pay it forward.
- You look lost, son.
- I do?
I may not look like much to you, but I've peed a lot of pants in my day and I've learned a thing or two.
First, family is the most important thing you could ever have.
Second, if you try to wash your pants in the McDonald's bathroom they will call the cops.
Yo, Ro.
Smelly was right.
We should be with our families.
All right.
Filthy Nick, send us home.
I don't understand why you can do that, but we still have to live on spare change.
We're not supposed to profit from my powers.
All right, this is killing me.
What's up with you?
I'm outrageous.
No.
This is outrageous.
What do you want?
First, I'll tell you what I don't want.
I don't want to hold onto this anymore.
You got me.
I'm a man.
You happy?
But you can't tell Donna.
It would break her sweet little heart.
- But why would you...?
- Donna's parents weren't always around.
And I wanted to give her a strong female role model.
So when she was about 6, Uncle Kevin became Auntie Momma.
Thirty-six years and 19 wigs later, here we are.
But how did you and my dad, you know, without him noticing?
Or did he notice?
Let's just say when you've been doing this as long as I have you become an expert at hiding the candy.
Do you have, like, a little hammock for it?
Is it rigged with fishing line?
Or...?
Look, you got nothing to worry about with me and your dad.
Now that I know my Donna's in good hands, I'll be moving on.
You're a good man, Cleveland Brown.
And you're a man too, Kevin.
I'm outrageous.
Oh, Mama, I'm so sorry I wanted to spend Thanksgiving with Federline.
It was awful.
Just as Auntie Momma planned.
Auntie Momma, is there anything you can't do?
I can't do it with the lights on.
- What?
- We're glad to have you home, Roberta.
Happy Thanksgiving.
And now that my work is done, I better leave before I turn into a blumpkin.
You're leaving?
Yeah.
Peabo Bryson is performing in Hampton.
And he likes me naked in his tour bus when he gets off-stage.
Wow, Auntie Momma.
You know singers from yesteryear.
Donna, it fills my heart to see you so happy.
Got room for me in that trunk of yours?
Oh, Lavar, what we shared on that bathroom floor and on Cleveland's pillow was beautiful.
But Auntie Momma's not a one-man woman.
Or a one-town woman.
Yep.
Bye-bye.
All right, y'all.
I'm out of here.
In three, two, one.
I'm outrageous!
That little lady just farted off with a piece of my heart.
I'm going after her.
Dummy, get me a skateboard and a burrito.
Before you go chasing her down, I gotta tell you something, Dad.
Said her real name's Kevin.
Been hiding the candy for 36 years.
You had sex with a man.
You have to promise not to say anything to Donna.
Yeah.
Uh, I'm gonna be playing this down in general.
Now, why don't you go in there and say something nice to my mom?
She's had a hard day watching you play grab-ass with a trannie.
Hey, Cookie.
Hey, Freight Train.
Hair looks real.
Why, thank you.
Hey, look, Grandpa Freight Train.
Auntie Momma dropped your watch.
Put that down.
Put that down.

Joke's on you, white man.
My descendents will corner the market on blue jean jackets
And blow cigarette smoke in the faces of your descendents.
(doorbell rings)
Oh, goody!
That must be my mommy!
Hi, mom!
Welcome to our new home!
Cleveland!
Oh, lord, you're wasting away!
Are you feeding him?
Not enough.
Look at me.
Hello, cookie.
Well, you've been eating!
We missed you at the wedding.
Oh, you mean the wedding
With my son who wasn't good enough for you 25 years ago,
But now you'll take him
Since you've been left with two misbehaving kids?
Yes.
That wedding.
And for your information, my kids do behave themselves.
Aw, hell!
We lit this bag of dog crap on fire right on the bears' porch.
Then the bear comes out and stomps on it!
And he's like, "oh, I got dog crap on my damn foot!"
(laughing)
Freakin' bear.
Who the hell is this?
This is my mother.
I meant no disrespect.
Let me get you a jet magazine and some sweet tea.
Oh, thank you, young man.
But first, I have someone else I'd like you to meet.
Dad?
!
Ow!
My neck!
My neck and my back!
Hey, chunky.
Sir.
Donna, you remember my father,
Who left my mother for a waffle house waitress.
Twice.
So, you two are back together?
Looks that way.
Why you got to ask so many questions?
¶ ¶
Aw, girl, thanksgiving is whack.
Every moment I have to be away from you,
My heart is like, "damn!"
(sighing)
You know what?
Hell with our families.
We should have our own thanksgiving.
A romantic thanksgiving.
Just the two of us.
For real, yo?
That's tight.
We's romeo and julietin' this turkey day.
I loves you, ro-ham.
I loves you more than unicorns love pixie dust.
(dance music plays)
(sniffing)
You got any fruit stripe gum?
(snips) ow!
Watch where you walking, pudgy!
(growls) (growls ferociously)
(whimpers)
Um, can I help you find something?
Nope.
I'm just looking for a glass without a spot on it.
Donna:
How embarrassing!
I knew I should have paid a few cents more for cascade.
(sad music plays)
Check out baby cleveland in the bathtub.
Look at his little, bitty, tiny cashew.
(both laugh)
I can't see it.
Let me get my reading binoculars.
(both laughing)
I like this kid.
You know, I've been thinking.
Maybe I should shoot out another kid.
Try to get this one right.
I've had similar thoughts.
And you know, I have not gone through the change.
You gone through the change on the outside.
You know, I think it's wonderful
That the whole family will be here
For thanksgiving supper tomorrow.
Mom, did you not get my text?
I'm spending thanksgiving with federline.
You most certainly are not.
Do you have any idea
How much work I am putting into this dinner?
Judging from those store-bought pies in the kitchen,
I'd say not enough.
Are you gonna let your crazy mother talk to me like that?
!
(laughs nervously) that's my mama.
(laughs nervously)
Are you gonna let your big-ass wife talk to me like that?
!
(laughs nervously) that's my wife.
(laughs nervously)
While you guys work that out,
I'm-a get going.
Roberta, your mother just wants you--
You are not my father.
New family's really warming up to ya, tubby.
That's it!
You wanna dance, little lady?
Fight, fight, fight, fight.
Bye, mom!
You are not going anywhere!
Let go of my coat!
Rallo:
Fight!
Fight fight!
Your coat?
!
I paid for this coat!
Rallo (whistles):
Hey!
Cleveland's dad!
Cleveland jr:
Dad!
(glass shatters, growling)
Roberta:
Let go of my coat!
Donna:
I paid for this coat!
Dad!
Fight, fight, fight...
Let go of my coat.
Well, what in tarnation is going on up in here?
All:
Auntie momma!
Damn skippy!
Ooh-wee.
Up jump the devil!
Don't squeeze too tight,
Or else somebody's gonna have to call the fart police.
Those filling' station nachos
Are not agreeing with your auntie momma!
(farts loudly)
I'm outrageous!
(all laughing)
Now stop all this scrappin',
Dippin' and dappin', don't know what's happenin'.
Now, who's this little one?
Donna, don't tell me you went
And got yourself knocked up by anthony anderson!
(laughs)
You nasty girl!
Hi, strange lady.
My name is cleveland brown, jr.
And I'm lavar brown.
(smooches)
But you can call me "freight train."
Ooh!
Well, choo-choo to you!
Hire me a couple chinese, 'cause we building a train track right here!
Auntie momma!
You should have told me you were coming!
Girl, you know auntie momma can't be tied down!
Unless this one's doing the tying!
Ooh, ooh!
I'm outrageous!
Hey, auntie momma!
Cleveland brown,
As I live and breathe!
Look at you, all grown up and unconventionally sexy.
Mustache all puttin' wilt chamberlain's to shame.
Honey, I should know.
I was number 8,433 and 11,760.
(farts loudly)
Ooh, I'm outrageous!
Auntie momma, we need to talk.
Mmm-hmm.
You know we will, girlfriend.
I want to hear all about the young mens up in your life!
But right now, auntie momma's off to the powder room
To see what all these farts are about.
(chuckles)
Maybe this thanksgiving won't be so bad, after all.
I'm gonna clean up this broken glass.
Sorry I tossed him the knife, but I wanted him to kill you.
(giggles)
I can see auntie momma's penis.
Auntie momma's penis?
!
(sizzling)
Let's play a game.
Everybody say something weird about themselves.
I'll start.
I don't have nails on my small toes.
Your turn, auntie momma!
I don't understand why a no-good team like the lions
Always gets to play on thanksgiving.
But I'd still let 'em pile up on me in the locker room!
I love a good sack!
Auntie momma!
I'm outrageous.
(chuckles)
(loretta, lavar, and auntie momma laughing)
See that, cookie?
A lady who loves football.
That's a real woman.
No offense.
That's an ugly apron.
Whoops.
Sometimes they jump on ya.
What's wrong with you, sourpuss?
You look lower than clint eastwood's testicles.
(flushing)
(creaks and pops)
(groans)
We had a pretty good run.
Had angle dickinson, didn't we, boys?
(cocking)
(screaming)
(shot fires)
She won't let me spend thanksgiving with federline!
Girl wants to be with her boyfriend.
Pumpkin, why you trying to keep those two love birds apart?
Thanksgiving is about family.
Roberta should be with us.
Now, sweet potato pudding' plum pie,
I remember another 15-year-old girl
With more boobs than brains
Who thought nobody understood her.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
(sighs)
Me.
And what did I tell you back then?
You told me that I should fly like a bird,
Because you can't keep your heart in a cage.
And then you farted.
And then you said you were outrageous.
That's right.
And now, when I look at roberta,
Do you know what I see?
A younger, stupider you.
Donna, let this caged bird fly, too.
I want you home before curfew.
Thanks, mom!
I love you, auntie momma.
(roberta and donna laughing)
(sighs) that woman can convince me of anything.
I'll say.
Donna, I need to talk to you about auntie momma.
Cleveland, I know, I know.
She can be a little outrageous.
I think even she knows that.
But my whole life, she's been the one person
I could always count on.
I don't know what I'd do without my auntie momma,
Or if my image of her was changed in any way.
Now, what did you want to say?
(sighs)
She's a handsome woman.
And not like men are handsome.
Like a woman is handsome.
(whistle blows)
Okay, turkey day football game!
The count's five mississippi.
I've chalked the end zones with parmesan cheese.
You get one blitz per set of downs.
There's no rollover blitzes, unless--
Hey!
You talk too much, c-cup.
Tubbs against browns!
Donna, you got rallo, and the fine auntie momma.
You got your work cut out for you.
I'm kind of a ball hog.
And I'm also a hog hog.
Mmm.
Well, I don't know about all that,
But you can gargle my (bleep).
You outrageous!
Looks like the outrageous is contagious!
Okay, we'll kick off!
¶ ¶
(chuckles) train left the station and you... (groans)
(grunts)
Mm-mmm!
(grunts)
(dings)
Damn!
Where'd you learn to play like that?
This ain't my first time on a football field.
Ask earl campbell what we did on the 50-yard line
At the astrodome back in '79.
Why don't you show me?
'cause donna used all her crisco for the pancakes.
There's, uh, head and shoulders in the crapper.
I like the way you think.
Okay, you guys, kick off!
Game's over.
I'm about to pull my groin.
(hisses)
Hmm, that's one bald pussy.
I'm worried about your mother.
I'm worried about my father.
I'm worried about leaving my soda can unattended,
Because a bee could easily fly in there.
And then I would take a sip,
And that bee could sting me inside my throat.
And then people would ask,
"what's wrong, cleveland brown jr.?"
And I wouldn't be able to tell them,
Because my throat would be all closed up.
Write it in your worry journal.
(rustling)
What was that?
Oh, damn!
It's homelesses!
Oh, my god!
They stole the cutlass!
They done stripped me of my whip!
Whip strip!
Whoo-whoo!
(sighs)
Hmm, this freight train
Can't wait to hook up with that caboose.
All aboard!
(farts)
Ooh, I got a feeling sex is gonna be all sloppy with you.
My reputation precedes me.
(chuckling)
Cleveland:
Oh, what do I do?
What do I do?
!
Do the right thing, cleveland.
Daryl hall?
What are you doing here?
I'm here to weigh in on your situation.
You really thinking about
Letting your father walk into a wiener factory?
I can't go for that, no can do.
Who are you?
Seriously, you got angel daryl hall on your left shoulder,
And you can't figure out who I am?
John oates?
!
Actual size.
Screw you, hall.
Your dad's a jerk.
Don't tell him.
Let 'em wrangle that dangle.
Well, maybe if you warn your father,
He'll finally appreciate you.
I still say, let him tickle that pickle.
¶ whoa-oh, here she comes ¶
¶ watch out, boy, she'll chew you up ¶
¶ whoa-oh, here she comes ¶
¶ she's a man... ¶
(sighs)
Oh, dad, come here!
Go away, fool!
It's important!
You can't do this, because...
Dad, you came here with mom.
Show the woman a little respect.
Your mama ain't a woman.
You're more of a woman than she is.
Your boobs are bigger, your ass is rounder,
And your mustache ain't as thick.
That is a woman!

Donna, you remember my father,
Who left my mother for a waffle house waitress.
Twice.
So, you two are back together?
Looks that way.
Why you got to ask so many questions?
¶ ¶
Aw, girl, thanksgiving is whack.
Every moment I have to be away from you,
My heart is like, "damn!"
(sighing)
You know what?
Hell with our families.
We should have our own thanksgiving.
A romantic thanksgiving.
Just the two of us.
For real, yo?
That's tight.
We's romeo and julietin' this turkey day.
I loves you, ro-ham.
I loves you more than unicorns love pixie dust.
(dance music plays)
(sniffing)
You got any fruit stripe gum?
(snips) ow!
Watch where you walking, pudgy!
(growls) (growls ferociously)
(whimpers)
Um, can I help you find something?
Nope.
I'm just looking for a glass without a spot on it.
Donna:
How embarrassing!
I knew I should have paid a few cents more for cascade.
(sad music plays)
Check out baby cleveland in the bathtub.
Look at his little, bitty, tiny cashew.
(both laugh)
I can't see it.
Let me get my reading binoculars.
(both laughing)
I like this kid.
You know, I've been thinking.
Maybe I should shoot out another kid.
Try to get this one right.
I've had similar thoughts.
And you know, I have not gone through the change.
You gone through the change on the outside.
You know, I think it's wonderful
That the whole family will be here
For thanksgiving supper tomorrow.
Mom, did you not get my text?
I'm spending thanksgiving with federline.
You most certainly are not.
Do you have any idea
How much work I am putting into this dinner?
Judging from those store-bought pies in the kitchen,
I'd say not enough.
Are you gonna let your crazy mother talk to me like that?
!
(laughs nervously) that's my mama.
(laughs nervously)
Are you gonna let your big-ass wife talk to me like that?
!
(laughs nervously) that's my wife.
(laughs nervously)
While you guys work that out,
I'm-a get going.
Roberta, your mother just wants you--
You are not my father.
New family's really warming up to ya, tubby.
That's it!
You wanna dance, little lady?
Fight, fight, fight, fight.
Bye, mom!
You are not going anywhere!
Let go of my coat!
Rallo:
Fight!
Fight fight!
Your coat?
!
I paid for this coat!
Rallo (whistles):
Hey!
Cleveland's dad!
Cleveland jr:
Dad!
(glass shatters, growling)
Roberta:
Let go of my coat!
Donna:
I paid for this coat!
Dad!
Fight, fight, fight...
Let go of my coat.
Well, what in tarnation is going on up in here?
All:
Auntie momma!
Damn skippy!
Ooh-wee.
Up jump the devil!
Don't squeeze too tight,
Or else somebody's gonna have to call the fart police.
Those filling' station nachos
Are not agreeing with your auntie momma!
(farts loudly)
I'm outrageous!
(all laughing)
Now stop all this scrappin',
Dippin' and dappin', don't know what's happenin'.
Now, who's this little one?
Donna, don't tell me you went
And got yourself knocked up by anthony anderson!
(laughs)
You nasty girl!
Hi, strange lady.
My name is cleveland brown, jr.
And I'm lavar brown.
(smooches)
But you can call me "freight train."
Ooh!
Well, choo-choo to you!
Hire me a couple chinese, 'cause we building a train track right here!
Auntie momma!
You should have told me you were coming!
Girl, you know auntie momma can't be tied down!
Unless this one's doing the tying!
Ooh, ooh!
I'm outrageous!
Hey, auntie momma!
Cleveland brown,
As I live and breathe!
Look at you, all grown up and unconventionally sexy.
Mustache all puttin' wilt chamberlain's to shame.
Honey, I should know.
I was number 8,433 and 11,760.
(farts loudly)
Ooh, I'm outrageous!
Auntie momma, we need to talk.
Mmm-hmm.
You know we will, girlfriend.
I want to hear all about the young mens up in your life!
But right now, auntie momma's off to the powder room
To see what all these farts are about.
(chuckles)
Maybe this thanksgiving won't be so bad, after all.
I'm gonna clean up this broken glass.
Sorry I tossed him the knife, but I wanted him to kill you.
(giggles)
I can see auntie momma's penis.
Auntie momma's penis?
!
(sizzling)
Let's play a game.
Everybody say something weird about themselves.
I'll start.
I don't have nails on my small toes.
Your turn, auntie momma!
I don't understand why a no-good team like the lions
Always gets to play on thanksgiving.
But I'd still let 'em pile up on me in the locker room!
I love a good sack!
Auntie momma!
I'm outrageous.
(chuckles)
(loretta, lavar, and auntie momma laughing)
See that, cookie?
A lady who loves football.
That's a real woman.
No offense.
That's an ugly apron.
Whoops.
Sometimes they jump on ya.
What's wrong with you, sourpuss?
You look lower than clint eastwood's testicles.
(flushing)
(creaks and pops)
(groans)
We had a pretty good run.
Had angle dickinson, didn't we, boys?
(cocking)
(screaming)
(shot fires)
She won't let me spend thanksgiving with federline!
Girl wants to be with her boyfriend.
Pumpkin, why you trying to keep those two love birds apart?
Thanksgiving is about family.
Roberta should be with us.
Now, sweet potato pudding' plum pie,
I remember another 15-year-old girl
With more boobs than brains
Who thought nobody understood her.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
(sighs)
Me.
And what did I tell you back then?
You told me that I should fly like a bird,
Because you can't keep your heart in a cage.
And then you farted.
And then you said you were outrageous.
That's right.
And now, when I look at roberta,
Do you know what I see?
A younger, stupider you.
Donna, let this caged bird fly, too.
I want you home before curfew.
Thanks, mom!
I love you, auntie momma.
(roberta and donna laughing)
(sighs) that woman can convince me of anything.
I'll say.
Donna, I need to talk to you about auntie momma.
Cleveland, I know, I know.
She can be a little outrageous.
I think even she knows that.
But my whole life, she's been the one person
I could always count on.
I don't know what I'd do without my auntie momma,
Or if my image of her was changed in any way.
Now, what did you want to say?
(sighs)
She's a handsome woman.
And not like men are handsome.
Like a woman is handsome.
(whistle blows)
Okay, turkey day football game!
The count's five mississippi.
I've chalked the end zones with parmesan cheese.
You get one blitz per set of downs.
There's no rollover blitzes, unless--
Hey!
You talk too much, c-cup.
Tubbs against browns!
Donna, you got rallo, and the fine auntie momma.
You got your work cut out for you.
I'm kind of a ball hog.
And I'm also a hog hog.
Mmm.
Well, I don't know about all that,
But you can gargle my (bleep).
You outrageous!
Looks like the outrageous is contagious!
Okay, we'll kick off!
¶ ¶
(chuckles) train left the station and you... (groans)
(grunts)
Mm-mmm!
(grunts)
(dings)
Damn!
Where'd you learn to play like that?
This ain't my first time on a football field.
Ask earl campbell what we did on the 50-yard line
At the astrodome back in '79.
Why don't you show me?
'cause donna used all her crisco for the pancakes.
There's, uh, head and shoulders in the crapper.
I like the way you think.
Okay, you guys, kick off!
Game's over.
I'm about to pull my groin.
(hisses)
Hmm, that's one bald pussy.
I'm worried about your mother.
I'm worried about my father.
I'm worried about leaving my soda can unattended,
Because a bee could easily fly in there.
And then I would take a sip,
And that bee could sting me inside my throat.
And then people would ask,
"what's wrong, cleveland brown jr.?"
And I wouldn't be able to tell them,
Because my throat would be all closed up.
Write it in your worry journal.
(rustling)
What was that?
Oh, damn!
It's homelesses!
Oh, my god!
They stole the cutlass!
They done stripped me of my whip!
Whip strip!
Whoo-whoo!
(sighs)
Hmm, this freight train
Can't wait to hook up with that caboose.
All aboard!
(farts)
Ooh, I got a feeling sex is gonna be all sloppy with you.
My reputation precedes me.
(chuckling)
Cleveland:
Oh, what do I do?
What do I do?
!
Do the right thing, cleveland.
Daryl hall?
What are you doing here?
I'm here to weigh in on your situation.
You really thinking about
Letting your father walk into a wiener factory?
I can't go for that, no can do.
Who are you?
Seriously, you got angel daryl hall on your left shoulder,
And you can't figure out who I am?
John oates?
!
Actual size.
Screw you, hall.
Your dad's a jerk.
Don't tell him.
Let 'em wrangle that dangle.
Well, maybe if you warn your father,
He'll finally appreciate you.
I still say, let him tickle that pickle.
¶ whoa-oh, here she comes ¶
¶ watch out, boy, she'll chew you up ¶
¶ whoa-oh, here she comes ¶
¶ she's a man... ¶
(sighs)
Oh, dad, come here!
Go away, fool!
It's important!
You can't do this, because...
Dad, you came here with mom.
Show the woman a little respect.
Your mama ain't a woman.
You're more of a woman than she is.
Your boobs are bigger, your ass is rounder,
And your mustache ain't as thick.
That is a woman!
Now if you'll excuse me, princess,
I'm gonna go destroy your kids' bathroom.
You know what?
I take it back.
You and auntie momma have a great time together.
I'm sure you'll learn a lot about each other.
(laughs):
I'm outrageous.
(grunts)
Uh-oh...
So, should we wait for freight train and auntie momma?
(chuckles) I don't think we'll have to wait too long.
Let's just sit back and enjoy
The sounds of a freight train wreck.
(chuckles)
That is cold, old man--
Letting your own pops fall blindly into a manhole.
What?
How did you know?
Man, I'm five.
Sitting on laps is my job.
I know what's supposed to be there and what's not.
I can't say as I blame you for not telling him.
It will be pretty funny.
Can you imagine?
"oh, I can't wait to reach down and fiddle with something nice.
"oh, no, what's this?
This is a terrible turn of events.
I'm gonna go punch cleveland."
Uh-oh!
Oh, it'll be worth it.
(chuckles) ¶ crying game... ¶
What a fine-looking meal.
I am starving.
I just worked up a man-sized appetite.
I hope you all weren't waiting for me.
I was just upstairs laying down.
(whispers):
With your face in the pillow.
(retching)
Cleveland, are you okay?
He'd be okay if you didn't undercook the turkey.
Undercooked?
This turkey looks perfect.
(smooching)
Mmm!
Smack myself in the face with it.
(retching)
Do you want me to get the bucket?
Hmm!
I'm gonna reach in there and get me some of that good stuff.
Look at there, put my hand up in there.
My whole arm!
(muffled retching)
Mm, mmm!
Now, that's a mouthful!
(retching)
Look like I lost my damn watch.
I don't think it's in the turkey-- gobble-gobble. (laughs)
(retching)
Happy thanksgiving, everyone.
Hey, there's your car!
Oh, it's on!
Those homelesses are about to become toothlesses!
They might already be toothlesses.
I realized that as I was saying it.
Hey, it's roberta and the friedman boy.
Hey, come help us do thanksgiving missionary style.
It's nice to see the young people
Doing the public service instead of the drugs.
Like I always say,
"helping others is the real crystal meth."
Actually, we're not here to volunteer.
There's one of them fools who jacked my whip.
Who, filthy nick?
Hey, filthy nick, did you steal this kid's car?
Did I steal your car?
Or have you had your keys all along?
Damn!
Pay it forward.
You look lost, son.
I do?
I may not look much like you, but I've peed a lot of pants
In my day and I've learned a thing or two.
First, family is the most important thing you could ever have.
Second, if you try to wash your pants
In the mcdonald's bathroom, they will call the cops.
(sniffles)
Yo, ro?
Smelly was right.
We should be with our families.
A'ight.
Filthy nick!
Send us home!
(whooshing)
(zapping)
I don't understand why you can do that,
But we still have to live on spare change.
We're not supposed to profit from my powers.
All right, this is killing me.
What's up with you?
I'm outrageous.
No, this is outrageous.
(deep voice):
What do you want?
First I'll tell you what I don't want.
I don't want to hold on to this anymore.
You got me.
I'm a man.
You happy?
But you can't tell donna.
It would break her sweet little heart.
But why would you...?
Look, donna's parents weren't always around.
And I wanted to give her a strong female role model.
So, when she was about six, uncle kevin became auntie momma.
36 years and nine, ten wigs later, here we are.
But how did you and my dad-- you know-- without him noticing?
Or did he notice?
Let's just say, when you've been doing this as long as I have,
You become an expert at hiding the candy.
Uh, do you have like a little hammock for it,
Or is it rigged with fishing line, or how...?
Look, you got nothing to worry about with me and your dad.
Now that I know my donna's in good hands, I'll be moving on.
You're a good man, cleveland brown.
And you're a man, too, kevin.
I'm outrageous.
Oh, mama, I'm so sorry
I wanted to spend thanksgiving with federline.
It was awful!
Just as auntie momma planned.
Auntie momma, is there anything you can't do?
I can't do it with the lights on!
What?
W-w-well, we're glad to have you home, roberta.
Happy thanksgiving.
And now that my work is done,
I better leave before I turn into a blumpkin.
You're leaving?
Yeah, peabo bryson is performing in hampton,
And he likes me naked in his tour bus when he gets off stage.
Wow, auntie momma, you know singers from yesteryear.
Donna, it fills my heart to see you so happy.
Got room for me in that trunk of yours?
Oh, lavar...
What we shared on that bathroom floor
And on cleveland's pillow was beautiful.
But auntie momma's not a one-man woman, or a one-town woman.
Yep.
Bye-bye.
All right, y'all, I'm outta here!
In three...
Two...
One... (farting)
I'm outrageous!
That little lady just farted off with a piece of my heart.
I'm going after her.
Hey, dummy, get me a skateboard and a burrito.
Before you go chasing her down, I got to tell you something, dad.
(speaking inaudibly)
...Said her real name's kevin.
(retches)
Been hiding the candy for 36 years.
(retching)
You...
Had sex...
With a man.
(retching)
You have to promise not to say anything to donna.
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna be playing this down in general.
Now why don't you go in there and say something nice to my mom?
She's had a hard day watching you play grab- ass with a tranny.
Hey, cookie.
Hey, freight train.
Hair looks real.
Why, thank you!
Hey, look, grandpa freight train!
Auntie momma dropped your watch.
Cleveland:
Put that down!
I had everything in my kingdom.
Everything a person needs to be happy:
Good food,
sex,
24 hours of pure entertainment on 250 channels from all over the world.
It was perfect.
So where did it all go wrong?
Even now, when I try to piece together my strange story,
I can't reach any conclusion.
One thing I do know, at some point the perfect world I created started to fall apart.
I had everything in my kingdom.
Everything a person needs to be happy.
Perfect.
Yes?
Hello and good morning, My name is Daniela and I am from the 'people-meter"Inc.
I wanted to congratulate you.
You were chosen for our special panel.
No thanks.
I'm not interested.
In 'people-meter" we offer you a modest gift and extra benefits for every panel-member.
Have a great day.
Come inside.
Where were you, you stupid cat?
Huh, Albie?
Albie, Albie!
Grumps.
He's The kind of real estate agent that's going extinct.
To me he always looked like a butler who just walked out of a BBC soap opera.
Listen, Ziss'leh (kid)
Check out the penguins.
Forget the penguins.
What's with the penguins?
In soap operas, the longer it takes a character to turn around, the more dramatic the announcement will be.
And here comes the turn-around.
Ziss'leh, you have to leave the apartment.
The landlord has decided to sell the property.
I'll give you two months, you don't have to leave tomorrow.
Tomorrow I'm starting to show people the apartment, and don't try any of your tricks on me.
Have a nice day, Mr. Grumps.
Listen,
I'm not a bad guy.
If you want another month, a little more time, no problem, but you have to leave.
Mr. Weinblum?
I'm Daniela from 'People Meter.' We spoke...
- I'm not Mr. Weinblum.
Weinblum is the landlord.
He's overseas.
I live here.
Fuck...
Fuck, fuck, fuck, I'm such an idiot.
Can I have a glass of water?
Thanks.
So... you're looking for Mr. Weinblum.
I'm not Weinblum.
Can I stay for a while?
This idiocy relaxes me.
She's kind of pretty.
She reminds me of the girl from "Diff'rent Strokes".
But I know what you find when you get closer:
Flaws.
They're always there.
This is how I learned Spanish, from the TV.
When I got there, the only thing I knew how to say was:
"Don't you dare steal my man, puta."
When you got where?
All South America, I think.
It's an amazing continent.
Have you been there?
- No.
I haven't flown anywhere in a long time.
How long is a long time?
A long, long time.
I would go crazy.
That Luciana is such a nut.
I can be Weinblum, if you like.
Como?
I'll be Weinblum.
You'll be Mr. Weinblum for me?
Right, and no one has to know.
I'll fill out the forms,
I know exactly what they want to hear.
Don't forget your shoes.
You're already kicking me out?
I just wanted to go to the bathroom.
Not that one!
The other one.
So,
Do you live here alone?
What do you do?
I thought you could fill out the form by yourself.
Okay...
Sorry I asked.
I'm a programmer.
I work from home.
This will be our little secret.
Thank you for inviting me to a one-on-one erotic chat.
Your credit card will be charged by the minute.
Hi.
How are you?
You're sweet.
- I'm good.
I've wanted to talk to you for a long time.
So?
Why didn't you?
I guess I'm shy.
You're very pretty, Jessica.
- Thanks.
But I'm just drawn that way.
So, what can I do for you?
Can we just talk for a while?
- Sure.
How old are you?
I'm 18 and a day.
What is that tattoo?
- This?
It's a bird.
What do you think of when you're getting off?
Well...
I think about clouds and...
Christmas trees and...
chocolate fudge, and the paycheck at the end of my shift.
You know...
Sometimes you look kind of sad in that room.
Sometimes...
Hey, here's a big smile for you.
So...
What do you want me to do for you?
Do you want me to lick...
- Let's save it for next time.
Okay?
You'll be here for me, right?
You're so romantic.
Yup.
I'm not going anywhere.
Me neither.
Good night, sweetie.
- Good night.
Go away, Grumps, or I'II...
- Okay, okay, I heard you.
Hold this.
Nobody threatens me.
Don't even think about it.
Listen, Grumps, I've been thinking...
Yedidya, my name is Yedidya.
I called Venezuela.
I talked to the landlord about you.
He lives in Caracas, do you know he's a lawyer?
Grumps, I...
Yedidya.
I can't leave this apartment.
Smile.
Please, come in.
Hello.
Come in, come in.
Make yourselves at home.
Well?
Where's the garden?
Eitan.
- Outside.
What is this?
Didn't you say there are four rooms?
Are you the tenant?
- There's a hallway.
A hallway isn't a room.
The torture is almost over.
You definitely told me four rooms over the phone.
There's also the garden.
- But the way out is so small.
What torture?
- Do you think we can expand it?
The plumbing is old, the pipes are rotten, it's full of roaches.
Roaches?
He's lying, ma'am.
Sir, there are no roaches.
He's just saying that.
He doesn't want to leave.
I didn't say anything.
- He doesn't want to leave, that's all.
It's a real beauty.
A winner.
The apartment is fine, really.
- What's in here?
Everything is fine, except that awful story with the boy!
A few years ago there was a murder here.
A boy.
Eight years old or so.
Right where you're standing.
Sometimes, late at night,
I see dead people.
Oh, come on.
Stop it.
I don't know.
Actually, I see some potential.
Don't you think so, honey?
With the right renovation, we can turn it into a real gem.
They don't build like this anymore.
We can break down this wall, right?
You can break it all down.
- I don't know, there's a lot we can do with this apartment.
If we open this wall, we'll have a lot more light, and we'll also have room for your equipment.
I'm a miserable little boy.
Leave this house alone.
The house is cursed.
The old man is a warlock.
Curse you.
Get out of my house.
Go away, you accursed people.
Go away.
Go away...
- Shall we go?
- Yes.
This is my little home.
- Don't go, he's just kidding.
I poured out my blood to make this this my graveyard.
- Sir, ma'am...
Go away...
Coward.
The crazy old man doesn't know what he's talking about.
In order to build a new world, you have to give up the old one first.
And I gave it up.
I let my old life peel off and fall away.
I cut back the unnecessary.
I got rid of the superfluous.
I left behind the whole damned party.
In one moment
Something knocked at the door
And I opened...
The doctors called it an anxiety attack.
I called it a revelation.
My little phobia, led me to idilia.
In a war, when the enemy leaves behind important information, you have to study it carefully.
Mr. Weinblum?
- What?
Mr. Weinblum, I'm happy to inform you that you have been accepted to People Meter's representative panel.
A technician will be coming to your home to install the meter.
Daniela?
We offer a modest gift to everyone on our representatives panel.
And of course you will have access to every channel at no cost.
That's it, he's gone.
Do you want to meet later?
We could go out for a drink.
I can't.
Okay.
I mean, uh, I have a lot of things to do today.
So, tomorrow?
- Okay.
Why don't you come over?
- Okay.
Fine, Weinblum.
So tomorrow at around four or five?
Cool.
- Good.
Bye then.
Bye.
People Meter thanks you for your cooperation and wishes you a wonderful day.
Bye.
Daniela connected me to a new world.
From now on, every time I press the remote
I make a difference.
I was crowned as the undisputed king of the couch potatoes.
So much power.
So much responsibility.
I enjoyed every second.
Arriba, abajo, al centro, al dentro.
Cheers.
It's beautiful.
I didn't know you had a garden here.
It's so quiet here.
What are these yellow flowers called?
I don't know.
And the red ones?
- I don't know, they grew by themselves.
Hey, you have a cat.
What's her name?
It's a he.
His name is Albert.
Albert.
Albilbul.
Yuck, you filthy thing.
What do you have there?
Yuck...
Albert.
Albert, come to Daniela.
Come.
Albilbul.
I'm such a cutie-pie.
I'm such a kitty-cat.
Do you mind turning off the TV?
Wait a second, the future of the world is in danger.
You know, my coach at the assertiveness workshop
told me to follow my feelings.
That's nice.
Wow, you're really skinny.
You should work out a little.
You're in the way.
Aren't I pretty enough for you?
Don't you want to fuck me?
Stop it!
I...
I'm not into sex in couples.
What?
What do you mean, "sex in couples"?
You know, the usual format, man-woman, in-and-out.
That crap isn't for me.
What other format is there?
You'd rather jerk off than fuck?
- Yes.
I don't want to compromise anymore.
I don't need three-dimensional girls.
How do I always end up with losers like you?
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I...
Leave me alone!
Where's my purse?
- Wait a second, Daniela...
I'm such a fool.
How didn't I see it coming?
The frozen poses.
The rooms.
The skeletons just waiting to come out of the closet.
It isn't what I saw in the pictures.
It's what I didn't see.
And nobody smiled.
Nobody.
I've been knocking for an hour.
What's with you?
Why are you watching that crap, you little shit?
Today is Holocaust Day!
Yes, Grumps.
I came here because even a loony like you couldn't refuse my offer.
It's, how do you youngsters put it?
The bomb!
It's the bomb!
It even has parking.
How do you turn off this noise?
- How's the air-flow?
All four directions.
It's a special deal, just for me.
Because I want to resolve our relationship on a good note.
Well, what do you say?
Uh, no.
Do you think you can beat me?
The Nazis couldn't beat me, and you think you can?
I walked across Siberia, on foot, in the snow.
In the Ukraine I boxed against the gentiles.
You won't leave an apartment.
I didn't leave a piss-hole in a Polish farmer's yard for three years.
The Nazis, may they rot in hell, were on top of me and I was in the hole.
Like a rat.
For three years.
Anne Frank.
Anne Frank has nothing on me.
She wouldn't have survived a month there, the spoiled brat.
She and her family lived like kings.
An attic, windows, planters, all the amenities.
They made her apartment into a museum in Amsterdam.
But me...
Nobody visits my piss-hole.
Here, have a drink.
Grumps.
Why is Weinblum so eager to get rid of me?
He wants to sell the property.
Tell him I saw the pictures.
What pictures?
Where is Weinblum's family, eh?
Where is his wife?
Where are his kids?
You're making a big mistake.
I'm not leaving this apartment.
You don't know who you're messing with.
Tonight, on "True Crimes", the horrible story of the Weinblum family, an honorable family man who likes to dress in women's clothing, caught by his devoted wife.
At first he tries to calm her, but she's hysterical, threatening to reveal his secret.
Weinblum cannot afford such a scandal and decides to end his poor wife's life.
But then, when he looks up, he realizes that someone is watching.
Oh, dear Lord, it's the children.
Not the children.
Listen, this isn't a social visit.
We had an agreement, remember?
You're supposed to be a lawyer, an educated man with a family of four.
- That's right.
- So what is this?
A whole week watching some god-forsaken Turkish channel, then 15 minutes of zapping around, then it's the Shopping Channel for another five hours.
What kind of lawyer watches that?
And you never turn it off.
That's it, I have to disconnect you.
- What?
No, no, no.
I'll be a good boy.
Here, it's all right.
I'll tell them you changed your mind.
- Don't disconnect me.
You know, I can stand for all your rap.
Really, in a way it's... it's even appealing.
But what I won't stand for is... is a cold heart.
I like your hairdo.
Are you trying to flatter me, Weinblum?
Yes.
Do you know what we need?
To clear the energies between us.
Music, alcohol, people.
A real date.
What do you say?
- Sure.
How about Thursday?
Thursday, sure.
- Then it's a date.
- It's a date.
Good.
- For sure.
- For sure.
Be a good boy with the TV.
Weinblum.
Thank you for inviting me to a one-on-one erotic chat.
Your credit card will be charged by the minute.
Hey!
Baby, I missed you.
How was your day?
Hey.
Shy guy.
Is everything okay?
Do you ever...
Do you ever get lonely over there?
I'm never really alone.
I've got tons of friends.
Yeah, I can see.
82 close friends are jerking off in front of you right now.
Now why are you being mean, baby?
Don't take it so bad, you're not real.
Silly, of course I'm real.
I can see you on my screen, but it doesn't mean you're real.
You're lonely, baby.
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.
When you've been alone for too long, nothing feels real anymore.
You need other people around you to make you feel like the world exists.
It doesn't matter what you think.
You're not real.
- What are you talking about?
I'm right here.
We're talking, right?
When I press "escape"
you disappear into your pathetic imaginary existence.
I want you to admit you don't exist.
Do it.
- But baby...
- Do it.
Do it!
But why?
- Say you don't exist.
I don't exist.
Again.
I don't exist.
- Again.
I don't exist.
- Again.
I don't exist.
- Again, Jessica.
- I don't exist.
Again.
- I don't exist.
Again, Jessica.
- I don't exist.
- Again.
- I don't exist.
- Again.
I don't exist.
I don't exist!
I don't exist!
I don't exist!
Daniela.
I just came to tell you that you're a piece of shit, a jerk, an asshole.
It's nothing, Daniela.
I even wore high heels for you.
- It's nothing.
It's nothing, it's just a movie.
Leave me alone.
Daniela!
I can't get out.
Ever?
Ever.
I don't want to, either.
What do you mean, you don't want to?
I don't want to.
Why not?
Outside, there's...
There's too much of everything.
Too much of the world makes me nauseous.
Don't you miss it?
No.
- Don't you miss being outside?
No.
Going to the beach, the sun, the sunset.
I can see the sunset from my garden.
And anyway... it only looks good in the movies.
In reality it's either too cold or too hot or you step in dog-doo.
Man, you're crazy.
I don't mind.
I don't mind the fact that you're screwed up.
What I do mind is...
A cold heart.
Yes.
Fine.
We'll do it your way.
Close your eyes and take a deep breath.
We're going for a walk.
Is this something else you learned at some course?
Listen, it's great.
You can go anywhere by doing this.
Close your eyes already.
We're in an ancient forest, a hundred years old.
The sunlight is peeping through the trees.
There are lots of colorful butterflies all around.
Absolute silence.
The forest floor is covered with leaves and a gentle, gentle breeze caresses us.
We hold hands and walk among the trees.
All the flowers open up for us as we walk by.
Can you see it?
- Yes.
I can see it.
We keep walking and come to a bench.
An old bench.
Engraved all over with the hearts and arrows of lovers.
You sit down and listen to the silence.
And what happens then?
Did you forget how this feels?
Hey.
Hey.
You're with me now.
It's just you and me now.
Forget about her.
Forget about her.
Promise.
I promise.
I'm coming.
Wait, wait, hold on.
Hold on.
What happened to the electricity?
This isn't the work of a professional.
Just some idiot with a big hammer.
Do you know who could have done this?
Listen to me, Super Mario.
Are you an electrician or a detective?
Relax.
I'm just curious.
Well, I don't have the parts I need.
I'll come back tomorrow.
No electricity.
No computer.
No TV.
Grumps thought he could break me.
But I didn't need anything.
I had Daniela.
Have a good day, honey.
I'll see you tonight.
Albert.
Albilbul.
I decided that this time, just for Daniela,
I would do the right thing.
I won't give in to temptation.
I won't even think about it.
I promised her.
I will sit here and wait for her...
Until she comes back.
Hola, Senor Weinblum.
I promised you a modest gift, didn't I?
I blew my diet again because of you.
I'm going to end up with my mother's butt.
Me like...
Do you want some?
Try it, it has a surprise - and chocolate too.
What a TV kid you are, my god.
Kid?
Where are your parents?
I don't have a father.
He died when I was small.
And your mother?
When I was little, my mother and I used to watch TV.
And she would translate what the actors said in English.
I liked that.
And then she just... suddenly... started to cut herself off.
From the world.
She'd just sit there and stare at the TV with dead eyes.
We'd sit there for days at a time and watch TV.
A boy and his mother, staring at the TV.
I screamed.
I cried.
I broke things.
I pulled her hair, I hit her.
Nothing.
She didn't move.
Then who raised you?
Bill Cosby.
Yummy.
What do you want to do today?
I think I feel like staying home today.
Weinblum, I thought you weren't into three-dimensionality.
When did you think that?
Go take a shower first.
You stink.
Go already.
Weinblum...
Albert.
Albert.
Albilbul.
Albert.
Shy guy...
Are you there?
Who are you?
Grumps, you son of a bitch.
You're his girlfriend?
Well, let me tell you something about your little boyfriend.
Alright?
We see each other every day.
He's crazy about me.
What are you looking at me for?
Get the fuck out of here, he's mine!
Go.
Daniela,
I'm clean.
Daniela?
Jessica?
What did you do?
Nothing.
I just had a small talk with your girlfriend.
And what do you know?
It looks like I do exist after all.
I exist!
I exist, you sick fuck!
Grumps!
Grumps!
You little shit.
Grumps, you son of a bitch!
Well,
Wise ass...
What do you have to say now?
Why the garden, Grumps?
Why the garden?
It's the landlord's garden.
I'm going to kill you.
I swear, Grumps,
I'm going to kill you.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Now you listen to me.
One day the Polish farmer stopped bringing me food,
I sat there in the dark, waiting in the hole.
I don't give a shit about your Holocaust, I saw Schindler's List!
I was very hungry.
Weak.
But I didn't care anymore.
Let them kill me.
- I loved this garden.
In the end I went home.
Mama...
Mama,
I'm here.
I'm alive.
It was quiet, cold, like a grave.
The really terrible things were happening outside.
I didn't know.
Why are you doing this to me?
I'm doing you a big favor.
Believe me.
Go outside.
Get out before it gets worse.
From here, there was no turning back.
I'm a Jedi knight who went over to the Dark Side.
90 cans of Alaska Canned Corn... 40 six-packs of Aqua Nova,
20 sacks of Odor-Lockers...
20 jerricans of kerosene.
Ten crates of Jump...
Two gas balloons, eight rolls of masking tape, a sledgehammer.
I want to order a 2,000-watt generator,
Do you have wires?
30 batteries, five rolls of rope, three lighters, 14 boxes of matches,
And one "Hattori Hanzo" soard.
I've finished fortifying my kingdom.
I'm ready for the attack.
Hello, have I reached the German War Reparations Department?
Hello, this is Yedidya Lipcher's grandson.
I want to close my grandfather's account.
Thank you, he was a wonderful man.
I don't want to pay for electricity anymore.
Yes, disconnect me.
Yes, my grandfather was a great man, may he rest in peace.
Yes, but what a waste, the checks keep coming.
I don't want you to pay for no reason.
Albert.
Albie.
Albert, where are you?
Albert?
Daniela,
Albert disappeared.
I can't help you.
It's over between us.
Please come here.
- What for?
I love you.
"I love you..."
That sounds like something you heard on TV.
I feel sorry for you, but I can't help you.
Stop calling me.
Daniela...
Albert is gone,
Daniela is gone.
Maybe Jessica was right after all.
When you're alone for too long, nothing seems real.
All that's left is me and the crazy old man.
He's waiting for me out there, with no identity, no name.
Planning his next attack.
As I curled into my hole
Grumps, curled up in his.
Daniela?
You probably want your cat back.
I want my life back.
- Grumps, what did you do with my cat?
Zissaleh, Zissaleh, come out, come out wherever you are.
Zissaleh, Zissaleh, come out, come out,
Come out, Zissaleh.
Grumps,
I'm so happy to see you.
Do you want your life back?
You thought your crazy act would work, huh?
But you can't kill Yedidya Lipcher so easily.
There can be only one, Grumps.
You killed Albert,
I deleted you forever.
Stay and talk to me.
You will talk to me!
Try deleting this with your computer.
I never meant to hurt you.
You have to go outside.
Not because of the landlord, he doesn't even want to sell the apartment,
I lied for your own good.
Grumps, that was quite a twist you came up with.
I've learned that you can't stay in the piss-hole even if it's tough outside.
I just wanted you to poke your head out and see.
- See what, Grumps?
See what?
What is there outside?
It's all garbage outside.
Zissaleh, you're leaving today.
What are you going to do?
Are you going to read me my rights?
You have the right to remain silent, everything you say can be used against you in a court of law.
Have mercy on me, Sergeant Tom,
Have mercy on me, Sergeant Tom.
Kaiser Souza.
Kaiser Souza.
Hey, McFly, hey, McFly...
I choose the red pill, I choose the blue pill.
Don't try to be the spoon, bend the spoon.
Don't try to be the spoon, bend the spoon.
I want an eye-patch, I want an eye-patch,
I want an eye-patch!
Hasta la vista, hasta la vista, baby.
Hey, Julie, we're meeting at the town square after school.
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me!
Do it!
I was happy, Grumps.
I was happy.
Once I saw in an old war movie how this soldier, the last one left in his foxhole, tried to call for help.
He sat there for three days without food and without water,
sending an S.O.S. In Morse code.
Three short taps, one long tap, three short taps.
Three short taps, one long tap, and three more short taps.
I had to contact her,
Using the only way I had left
Mr. Weinblum.
Maybe, who wants to know?
I'm here to disconnect you.
You've made a mistake.
- There's no mistake.
I am just taking the set-top box and I'll be on my way.
Then go, take your shit and go.
Go.
Mr. Weinblum.
- Go.
Go.
Go.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Daniela?
Daniela?
Did you get my messages?
How are you?
Daniela?
Daniela?
Daniela, I need you.
Please, I need you to come.
Something bad is happening to me.
My world is falling apart.
Daniela...
Daniela, what do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do?
I'll do...
Daniela, I'll do anything.
I'll do anything.
I can't do it...
I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't...
What did I think about during the last moments of my dying kingdom?
About Albert, the bundle of fur and the best friend I ever had.
About sweet Jessica.
I know I'll miss every pixel in her imaginary body.
I thought about my mother.
And the silence that remained when the TV turned off,
I thought about Grumps, the likeable butler, who never really left his hole.
And then, finally,
I thought about Daniela, standing outside, waiting for me...
loving me.
That was the best thought of all.
Yan!
We're here
Get off
This way
Chi-an.
He's here.
You're Cheung Wai-Ming, right?
Welcome to New Life Center
Everyone who passes through these doors is a new being in Christ
Really
I am Chi-an.
I'm in charge here
Let me take care of some paperwork first
Keung, take the new brother in to get changed
Follow me
Change into this
Come on
Your underwear too
Don't we need to have rectal examination?
We're Christians, we don't do that
Put on this disposable underwear
What's your name?
Ming
I'm Keung.
I'll be taking care of you
If there's anything you don't understand or if you need anything let me know
Okay
- Are you hungry?
- No
It's a long time to go before dinner.
You'd better eat something.
Come, I'll make you some instant noodles This is new boy privilege
Thank you
How about you?
I'm not hungry
What are you in for?
What do you mean?
What did you do to get in here?
Drugs, of course.
What did you expect?
That I got in here for speeding?
Be careful with my hair.
You know how to cut hair?
Not really
You were a hairdresser before?
I learnt it in jail
We have to say grace first
Thank you Jesus for this wonderful food
And for giving us the chance to live together and share in your salvation
Amen
This tastes worse than my wife's cooking
Did you forget the salt?
Why don't you do the cooking tomorrow?
You're Ming, right?
Are you settling down okay?
Okay
What did you do before?
I was in sales
Can I help you?
I want to try this on
- What waist size are you?
- 31 inches
What do you think?
- I'll take it.
I want to alter the length.
- Sure
41 inches
Keep this receipt with you
"I get off at 7pm"
What's your name?
Call me Yan
Your family isn't home?
My mom's playing mah-jong
Fai, can you share with us?
When I got out last time I was determined to quit
But when I saw my friends again I couldn't resist and went back to drugs
The most difficult thing to resist is not the physical craving but the mental one
I take it because I feel bored
Now that you know Jesus you have him for company whenever you feel lonely
How about you, Ming Why did you choose drugs?
I don't know
Have you thought about how you can stay off drugs in the future?
Not really
Then I suggest you give this serious thought in the next few months
Let's pray for Jesus to give us strength to resist drugs' temptation
We ask this in the name of Jesus Christ
What are you following me for?
I'm just going to pee
Our rules says new boys have to be supervised 24 hours a day
Why, you're afraid I'm going to run away?
We're in the middle of nowhere, where can you go?
A lot of brothers come to get off heroin when they withdraw they're capable of anything so they need someone to look after them.
I don't suffer withdrawals
I know, Chi-an said you're into Ecstasy and ketamine
That's right
That's no big deal
I know.
So why are you still following me?
I told you, it's the rules
I won't look at you, OK?
Keung, what does it feel like to be on heroin?
Wonderful.
You're floating on a cloud, nothing touches you
Sounds great
But then you come back down with a crash
Can't sleep?
Let me pray for you
No need, really
Just close your eyes Leave me alone
I want to try this on
I thought I'd never see you again
I'm sorry about what happened to your mom...
It's in the past, don't mention it again
I've moved to a new apartment
I have a roommate now He's also gay
So when are you gonna invite me to your new home?
- Leaving already?
- Yes
Why don't you stay the night?
No, I have to check on my dad
Quite a crowd
They're all Cyrus' friends
This is your friend?
I know, you're Yan.
I'm Ming's roommate
My name is Cyrus
I should be leaving now
So soon?
Why don't you stay and party with us?
- Maybe next time
- Let me see you out
I want to introduce you to a friend
- This is Wilfred
- Sit down
- How old are you?
- 22
- Was that your boyfriend?
- Kind of
- You're quite good looking
- Of course he is
I'll go and get a drink
- Haven't seen him before
- Yes, he just moved in
Kinda cute, isn't he?
Remember me?
I'm Wilfred
- What a coincidence
- Actually Cyrus told me you work here
I came especially to see you
- What time do you get off work?
- About now
Let's go to dinner together
I almost forgot, I got this for you this afternoon
Don't be nervous.
No strings attached
You're shy, you're not a virgin, are you?
Of course not
Guess what?
I was a virgin till I was 27
Look at me now, I'm old and flabby
I have no future as a gay man
But I have one thing: money
Don't get me wrong, I not the sort who thinks money can buy everything
I know it only buys very little
but I'm satisfied with that little bit
Open it
What are you thinking?
This is the first time I've slept with someone for money
What does it feel like?
Not much different than normal
You're a nice person.
I would have done it for free
Really?
You're so sweet
Why are you guys so lifeless?
We've been working all day, that's why
No problem let's pray for God to energize us
We only just prayed this morning
Let's pray in tongues
I'm warning you
Don't mess with Chi-an
I'm not afraid of him
He's one to bear grudges
I'm not exactly the easy going type either
Somebody might see us
That hurts
Don't ever leave me
Open that can for me
- Try some
- No!
Tastes great
Yan, why don't we move in together?
Maybe later
Don't you want to?
It's not that
But who's gonna take care of my father?
OK, forget it, then
Ming, I don't mean it that way
Don't be like that
Wipe your mouth
I'm off to work
Sure, go ahead
What's up with this?
Don't worry, you just have to watch
Just watch?
Well you can applaud if you think we're doing well
You're not swimming?
The water is too cold
Are you kidding?
You're OK?
Fine
You've lost weight recently
I wanna to ask you-if one day I don't look like the way I do now would you still like me?
What are you talking about?
Like, if I broke my nose or if I'd lost all my teeth, like this
That's ridiculous
Why would you lose your teeth?
Have you found a job yet?
I'm still looking.
You're OK with money?
At least I don't need to borrow from you
That's not what I meant
If you need anything just tell me
I'm fine, I can take care of myself
This is Room 103
Call an ambulance, make it quick!
How are you?
Isn't this pretty?
Quite elegant
- Like me?
- If you say so
You ought to be more careful
I was fine, Jason panicked
Has Yan been here?
You didn't tell him, did you?
Being hospitalized is a big deal of course I'd tell your boyfriend
You big-mouth
Hi, Yan
Are you okay?
What happened?
I ate something bad
Told you not to mix Viagra with poppers but you don't listen...
What did he say?
Enough, Cyrus, please leave
OK, I'm sure you guys have a lot to talk about
What did he mean?
Yan, I have something to tell you
What do you want me to say?
Say what you want.
Why did you keep it a secret from me?
'Cause I knew you'd react this way
So it's my fault?
ls it the money?
If you need cash you can let me know
I'd lent it to you
I suppose you'd find it more touching if I'd said I'm doing this to pay for my mom's operation?
There are so many jobs out there, why do you have to do this?
It's just a job
It's just a job, it's no different from being a salesperson
You've just told me you're a prostitute
How'd you expect me to react?
Be supportive?
Why can't you accept me?
I sleep with the clients but I won't fall in love with them
Sorry, I can't accept it
He's back
Get ready
You made it
What a great shirt Of course
Let's eat
We're all like radios
God speaks to us all the time we just have to set the dial to the right channel to hear him
But you may ask, how do I know I'm listening to the voice of God?
How do I know the voice inside my head is not just me talking to myself or perhaps even the voice of the devil?
Let me tell you, the devil only tells you what you want to hear
If you hear voices that tell you to go out and party and take drugs then it's most likely the devil's voice
God tells us things we don't want to hear
Let's worship, and pray that God will show us how to listen to his voice
Open our eyes o Lord
Lift our ears to hear you
We desire to do your will God
And as we go in your name we bring healing and proclaim that the kingdom of our God is near
O lord come empower your church
we will be obedient to your call
let your kingdom come let your will be done...
Keung
What's up?
I'm hungry, make me some noodles
Didn't you eat enough a dinner?
Please
You're not allowed to smoke here
Haven't had one in awhile just pretend you didn't see it
If you live here you ought to follow the rules
Just let me finish this
Chi-an is here
What are you doing here?
It's past midnight
Ming is hungry So I'm making him noodles
Have you been smoking?
No
Let me see your hands
Step aside!
Ming has only just been here awhile
How can you ask him to burn rocks?
He can't take it
Please leave my office if you can't speak to me calmly
Fine, now I'm calm
I've seen plenty of youths like him
If you let him off easy he'll just get worse
The centre has its rules he needs to learn to follow them or else face the consequences
OK, fine, I'll go up and help him
Wait, I haven't finished yet
This is his first offence and he has been punished enough
Go up to the hills and tell him he can come down now
Chi-an said you can go back
Fine, I'll help you
How much longer do you have to be here?
I came voluntarily, I can leave whenever I want
You actually want to be here?
Why?
I promised my mom
My father left us when we were young
My mom had to work two jobs to raise the whole family
I started hanging out with the wrong crowd when I was 11 or 12
Then I started taking heroin in all these years the only thing I ever brought my mom was trouble
So I wanted to something for her
How come I haven't seen your mom visit you in all this time?
She died last year, liver cancer
She worked too hard before she died she said the person she worried about the most was me
Are you crazy, messing with that stuff again?
It hurts!
Ming, look, this flat is quite cheap
Let's move out together
What about your dad?
I'll think of something
Do you want to?
Sorry, I'm meeting Cyrus for tea
Now?
We arranged it days ago I'd almost forgotten
I'll call you, OK?
What a coincidence
I want to speak with you
Sure, let's find a place to sit down
We can talk here
I want you to stop doing what you do with Ming
What do you mean?
We just have a few parties now and again
I know you've introduced him to clients and you even supply him with drugs, right?
I didn't force him to do anything he doesn't want to do
Don't you know this affects our relationship?
You think you understand Ming?
You don't even know what he wants
Don't be so somber
I can get a maid to take care of you
Father, let me wash up
That's alright, let me do it,
I might as well get used to taking care of myself from now on
I'll come back and visit often
I don't need a visitor
I want my own son
I'm over30 now, I need to have my own life
What kind of life is that?
Come on
Where is this?
You'll see
What is this?
Our home.
I signed the lease already.
Everything's paid for
You want to move out too, right?
That was then
What do you want from me?
Cyrus told me you went to see him
You still don't accept me, do you?
I just don't want you to die!
Let go of me
Who do you think you are?
Not even my mom tells me what to do
I'm happy with my life now
What about our lives?
Aren't we happy together?
Let's just call it quits
Don't do this
This is Constable Au from Yaumatei district
We suspect drug activities at this premise
We need to search it
Don't move
Turn off the music
Turn on the lights
Sit back down!
Ming, you have a visitor
Me?
- Haven't seen you in awhile
- Yeah
You look healthy
Yeah, they feed us well here
Do you still have trouble sleeping?
No, I sleep pretty well now
I miss you a lot
I know
I didn't know they'd impose such a heavy sentence
All I wanted to do was to give you a warning so you'd stay off drugs
What are you talking about?
It was me who called the police, but I didn't mean to...
You fucking bastard!
Ming, have you gone crazy?
Calm down, I didn't mean for things to turn out this way
Don't you ever show yourself again
Just leave!
I didn't mean to...
Stop it!
What's up?
You're on hunger strike?
I don't have an appetite
Just eat something
Come on, or it'll get cold
- Have you ever been betrayed?
- Of course
What did you do about it?
Beat him up, just like you
And if you're still unsatisfied think of all the bad things you've done to others then maybe you'll feel better
Whoever comes to Christ is a new man in him
Even though Brother Keung will no longer be living with us
He will always be living through Christ
Let us bless Brother Keung
Thank you, all
Take care
You too
I thought you weren't going to see me off
Don't argue with Chi-an so much from now on, OK?
Sure
Let's have dinner when you get out
Alright
You promise?
- Take care
- You too
Ming, come here
I'll never come back for sure!
Long time no see
- How are you?
- Great
This is my girlfriend Jackie
He's my brother from rehab
I prepared your room for you Go check it out
Sure
- ls it OK?
- Yeah
- Have you eaten?
- No
Jackie, can you make some noodles for Ming?
We'd just run out
No problem, we'll go out to eat
Jackie doesn't seem to like having me here.
Don't mind her.
I pay the rent
I can invite whoever I want to stay.
As soon as I find a job I'll get out of here.
There's no hurry
You've just gotten out, you shouldn't be living alone
It's too easy to fall off the wagon.
What will you have?
Fried rice noodles
- Anything else?
- Seafood noodles
Have you thought about what kind of job you want to find?
Not really
Why don't you try and get a job as a junior at our salon?
Sure
How known have you known Jackie?
A few months
She works at the salon too
Jackie is a little cool to strangers
But she's OK once you get to know her
I'm sure she is
ls it always this busy here?
Yeah, me and Jackie eat here all the time
That's better than having instant noodles
She doesn't want to cook sometimes
Have you thought about finding a girlfriend?
That takes time
Sure, take your time
It's great to have a girlfriend
Do I have to do this?
That's what the boss said, grin and bear it
That's like using me as guinea pig
It's simple, only washing hair
Water's cold
Adjust the water temperature first
Use more force, you wimp
That hurts
Use your fingertips, dummy!
Jackie, why don't you show him?
Pay attention!
You're much better
Of course, I'm not clumsy like him
That feels good
Watch and learn
Are you coming with us?
I still have this customer to serve
I'll call you guys later
I can stay and help you
- No, you go on ahead
- Alright
Call me when you're done
What's up?
Can't hear you, louder!
You can't leave yet?
It's been 2 hours She sure has a lot of hair
Do whatever you want
I don't care
Don't fucking bother to come!
Get up, sing with me
This is my favorite song
ls she OK?
She's had a bit too much to drink
I told her not to drink so much
She's too willful to listen
I want to thank you for taking care of me at the rehab and letting me live here now
Don't mention it we're brothers, remember?
Do you still go to church?
Are you OK?
Let me help you
Wash the tomatoes for me
How did you party?
What do you mean?
What kind of drugs did you take?
E, K, that sort of thing
Where did you go?
We mostly partied at home
Sometimes we go to Lan Kwai Fong
Did you go to PP much?
What's that?
Don't bullshit me
I knew you're gay as soon as I saw you ls dinner ready?
Almost, go set the table
Don't worry, my lips are sealed
Here's the rice
What kind of soup is that?
Pumpkin
- Looks good
- Of course, I made it
I made this especially for you
- ls it good?
- Quite good
- Am I a good cook?
- Yeah, you are
Praise me
Come on
You're a good cook and an excellent girlfriend
You left out the part about being great in bed
Have a try, it's great stuff
You're not scared, are you?
What do you call a toothpick with a wig
- I don't know
- A match
- I don't get it
- Never mind
What are you two doing?
There're no customers so I'm washing her hair
I asked him to do it
You guys had better be careful, the boss might come back any moment
Don't worry, we heard him say he's going to Shenzhen for the weekend
He's probably visiting prostitutes
Thanks for visiting Do come again next time!
Nothing much, just sitting at home watching TV
What, tonight?
Who else is going?
I'll call you back
Who was it?
It's Kay.
She wants to know if we want to go to Tribeca tonight
Let's go together
No, I have the early shift tomorrow
Alright, I'll tell them I can't come then
- You can go if you want
- I don't want to go alone
Hey you have nothing to do Why don't you come with me?
Yeah, you have the day off tomorrow
Sure
I'll meet you guys there I'm bringing a cute guy...
Keep an eye on her for me
I haven't had so much fun in ages
You're still up?
That's my last card.
I still have six left.
Have you been cheating?
I don't have any money left.
This is gonna cost you
I can give you my underwear
Who needs that?
It probably stinks
Come here
I kissed Keung here last night Don't I smell nice?
You're crazy
I knew you have the hots for Keung
What are you talking about?
I've liked you for a long time
What are you doing?
I see you're not all gay
ls dinner ready yet?
I'm starving
There's food in the fridge You can heat it up
You've eaten?
I'm going to bed
- Are you happy being with me?
- Yes
Let's get married
I want to talk to you
I have nothing to say to you
What's wrong with you?
Just leave me alone
I'm thirsty, please buy me a drink
- What do you want?
- Any kind of soft drinks
- Ming, what would you have?
- Anything's fine
I'll go get it
So what's going on with us?
I don't know what you're talking about
You can't pretend nothing happened
I had a few drinks that night You're not taking it seriously, are you?
You don't need to be afraid of what Keung thinks
I'm finished with him
Are you nuts or what?
Soft drinks for you
I'll take this to the kitchen
Jackie, be honest with me ls something going on between you and Ming?
- None of your business
- What do you mean by that?
What are you doing?
Let go of me
- I said let go
- What do you want?
- Listen to me
- Why don't you go and ask him?
Keung, what are you doing here?
Mrs. Lam has been under the hair processor for over an hour
Look what you've done!
My hair is ruined
- I'm sorry
- What a jerk
Let me fix this for you
It's all ready
Try the beef, it's quite fresh
Sure
I want to make a toast to you
Why?
- I'm sorry
- Nothing to be sorry for
Girls like Jackie can't be kept in a cage
They'd eventually die
If it wasn't you it would have been someone else
It's just women, right?
Plenty of fish in the ocean
Any beer left?
Yeah, I'll go and get some more
$190, thanks
See you
Keung, I'm disappointed in you
What are you talking about?
I came out of the same rehab as you You can't fool me
I'm not going to ask you for the money back
But don't bother coming to work tomorrow
Keung, are you back?
Are you alright?
What are you doing?
This stuff's gonna kill you!
Leave me the fuck alone
That was only so-so
Can't think of why they cast that guy
What are you having?
Why don't I take you back to the rehab?
If you want to help me lend me $1000
I'd just paid the rent I don't have any money left
- Have some water
- Thanks
This is a nice place
What have you been doing?
Nothing much, just surfing the net and watching movies at home
I'm out of work, you have any clients?
Haven't touched that in awhile
My case is being appealed I can't do anything
You're short of money?
I'm not doing so well myself
- Maybe you can go online to find clients
- I'll give it a try
We really had fun back then, didn't we?
- I have to go
- Wait
Drop by whenever you want
I'm taking off
Who are you looking for?
- You just got out?
- Yeah
- How have you been?
- Not bad
Father, I'll close up, you go home first
I made dinner already Just heat it up in the microwave
Be careful
Are you still mad at me?
- I've forgotten about that a long time ago
- Really?
What time do you get off?
I just need to pack up
Let's have dinner together Where'd you like to eat?
I want to borrow some money
What?
So you only thought of me when you needed money
It's really important It's for a friend of mine
What friend?
Your new boyfriend?
None of your business
Just lend me $2000.
I'll pay you back
So what will it be?
Let's start over again
What's gone is gone
Why?
Don't you understand how much I care for you?
Everything I've done is for your own good
No, everything you've done is for your own good.
I really love you
What are you doing?
Don't
Don't you believe how much I love you?
How do you feel?
Can't move
Don't fight it Let it take you along
ls it worth doing this to yourself over a girl?
You're not me.
You don't know how I feel.
I thought I could be with her for the rest of my life
But I can't even control what happens the next day
There are many people in this world who still cares about you
Why are you so good to me?
'Cause you're my brother
I don't deserve to be your brother
I don't want to see you again
Get out of here
Get out!
I don't want to see you
You little shit, what are you doing?
Yan, just leave
What's the big deal?
Get with the times
How dare you do such a disgusting thing at home?
You dishonor your dead father's memory
He's fucking dead.
What does he care?
Don't you dare come back if you step out of that door
I'll never come back for sure!
Mom!
What is it?
Ming, I'm sorry
Keung, what's the matter?
Keung, what's the matter?
Yan!
We're here.
Get off
This way
Chi-an.
He's here.
You're Cheung Wai-Ming, right?
Welcome to New Life Center
Everyone who passes through these doors is a new being in Christ
Really
I am Chi-an.
I'm in charge here
I hope you will take this chance to rehabilitate
Let me take care of some paperwork first
Keung, take the new brother in to get changed
Follow me
Change into this
Come on
Your underwear too
Don't we need to have rectal examination?
We're Christians, we don't do that
Put on this disposable underwear
What's your name?
Ming
I'm Keung.
I'll be taking care of you.
If there's anything you don't understand or if you need anything let me know
Okay
- Are you hungry?
- No
It's a long time to go before dinner.
You'd better eat something.
Come, I'll make you some instant noodles This is new boy privilege
Thank you
How about you?
I'm not hungry
What are you in for?
What do you mean?
What did you do to get in here?
Drugs, of course.
What did you expect?
That I got in here for speeding?
Be careful with my hair.
You know how to cut hair?
Not really
You were a hairdresser before?
I learnt it in jail
We have to say grace first
Thank you Jesus for this wonderful food
And for giving us the chance to live together and share in your salvation
Amen
This tastes worse than my wife's cooking
Did you forget the salt?
Why don't you do the cooking tomorrow?
You're Ming, right?
Are you settling down okay?
Okay
What did you do before?
I was in sales
Can I help you?
I want to try this on
- What waist size are you?
- 31 inches
What do you think?
- I'll take it.
I want to alter the length.
- Sure
41 inches
Keep this receipt with you
"I get off at 7pm"
What's your name?
Call me Yan
Your family isn't home?
My mom's playing mah-jong
Fai, can you share with us?
When I got out last time I was determined to quit
But when I saw my friends again I couldn't resist and went back to drugs
The most difficult thing to resist is not the physical craving but the mental one
I take it because I feel bored
Now that you know Jesus you have him for company whenever you feel lonely
How about you, Ming Why did you choose drugs?
I don't know
Have you thought about how you can stay off drugs in the future?
Not really
Then I suggest you give this serious thought in the next few months
Let's pray for Jesus to give us strength to resist drugs' temptation
We ask this in the name of Jesus Christ
What are you following me for?
I'm just going to pee
Our rules says new boys have to be supervised 24 hours a day
Why, you're afraid I'm going to run away?
We're in the middle of nowhere, where can you go?
A lot of brothers come to get off heroin when they withdraw they're capable of anything so they need someone to look after them.
I don't suffer withdrawals
I know, Chi-an said you're into Ecstacy and ketamine
That's right
That's no big deal
I know.
So why are you still following me?
I told you, it's the rules
I won't look at you, ok?
Keung, what does it feel like to be on heroin?
Wonderful.
You're floating on a cloud, nothing touches you
Sounds great
But then you come back down with a crash
Can't sleep?
Let me pray for you
No need, really
Just close your eyes Leave me alone
I want to try this on
I thought I'd never see you again
I'm sorry about what happened to your mom...
It's in the past, don't mention it again
I've moved to a new apartment
I have a roommate now He's also gay
So when are you gonna invite me to your new home?
- Leaving already?
- Yes
Why don't you stay the night?
No, I have to check on my dad
Quite a crowd
They're all Cyrus' friends
This is your friend?
I know, you're Yan.
I'm Ming's roommate
My name is Cyrus
I should be leaving now
So soon?
Why don't you stay and party with us?
- Maybe next time
- Let me see you out
I want to introduce you to a friend
- This is Wilfred
- Sit down
- How old are you?
- 22
- Was that your boyfriend?
- Kind of
- You're quite good looking
- Of course he is
I'll go and get a drink
- Haven't seen him before
- Yes, he just moved in
Kinda cute, isn't he?
Remember me?
I'm Wilfred
- What a coincidence
- Actually Cyrus told me you work here
I came especially to see you
- What time do you get off work?
- About now
Let's go to dinner together
I almost forgot, I got this for you this afternoon
Don't be nervous.
No strings attached
You're shy, you're not a virgin, are you?
Of course not
Guess what?
I was a virgin till I was 27
Look at me now, I'm old and flabby
I have no future as a gay man
But I have one thing:
Money
Don't get me wrong, I not the sort who thinks money can buy everything
I know it only buys very little but I'm satisfied with that little bit
Open it
What are you thinking?
This is the first time I've slept with someone for money
What does it feel like?
Not much different than normal
You're a nice person.
I would have done it for free
Really?
You're so sweet
Why are you guys so lifeless?
We've been working all day, that's why
No problem let's pray for God to energize us
We only just prayed this morning
Let's pray in tongues
I'm warning you
Don't mess with Chi-an
I'm not afraid of him
He's one to bear grudges
I'm not exactly the easy going type either
Somebody might see us
That hurts
Don't ever leave me
Open that can for me
- Try some
- No!
Tastes great
Yan, why don't we move in together?
Maybe later
Don't you want to?
It's not that
But who's gonna take care of my father?
Ok, forget it, then
Ming, I don't mean it that way
Don't be like that
Wipe your mouth
I'm off to work
Sure, go ahead
What's up with this?
Don't worry, you just have to watch
Just watch?
Well you can applaud if you think we're doing well
You're not swimming?
The water is too cold
Are you kidding?
You're ok?
Fine
You've lost weight recently
I wanna to ask you-if one day I don't look like the way I do now would you still like me?
What are you talking about?
Like, if I broke my nose or if I'd lost all my teeth, like this
That's ridiculous
Why would you lose your teeth?
Have you found a job yet?
I'm still looking.
You're ok with money?
At least I don't need to borrow from you
That's not what I meant
If you need anything just tell me
I'm fine, I can take care of myself
This is Room 103
Call an ambulance, make it quick!
How are you?
Isn't this pretty?
Quite elegant
- Like me?
- If you say so
You ought to be more careful
I was fine, Jason panicked
Has Yan been here?
You didn't tell him, did you?
Being hospitalized is a big deal of course I'd tell your boyfriend
You big-mouth
Hi, Yan
Are you okay?
What happened?
I ate something bad
Told you not to mix Viagra with poppers but you don't listen...
What did he say?
Enough, Cyrus, please leave
Ok, I'm sure you guys have a lot to talk about
What did he mean?
Yan, I have something to tell you
What do you want me to say?
Say what you want.
Why did you keep it a secret from me?
'Cause I knew you'd react this way
So it's my fault?
Is it the money?
If you need cash you can let me know
I'd lent it to you
I suppose you'd find it more touching if I'd said I'm doing this to pay for my mom's operation?
There are so many jobs out there, why do you have to do this?
It's just a job
It's just a job, it's no different from being a salesperson
You've just told me you're a prostitute
How'd you expect me to react?
Be supportive?
Why can't you accept me?
I sleep with the clients but I won't fall in love with them
Sorry, I can't accept it
He's back
Get ready
You made it
What a great shirt Of course
Let's eat
We're all like radios
God speaks to us all the time we just have to set the dial to the right channel to hear him
But you may ask, how do I know I'm listening to the voice of God?
How do I know the voice inside my head is not just me talking to myself or perhaps even the voice of the devil?
Let me tell you, the devil only tells you what you want to hear
If you hear voices that tell you to go out and party and take drugs then it's most likely the devil's voice
God tells us things we don't want to hear
Let's worship, and pray that God will show us how to listen to his voice
Open our eyes o Lord
Lift our ears to hear you
We desire to do your will God
And as we go in your name we bring healing and proclaim that the kingdom of our God is near
O lord come empower you church we will be obedient to your call let your kingdom come let your will be done...
Keung
What's up?
I'm hungry, make me some noodles
Didn't you eat enough a dinner?
Please
You're not allowed to smoke here
Haven't had one in a while just pretend you didn't see it
If you live here you ought to follow the rules
Just let me finish this
Chi-an is here
What are you doing here?
It's past midnight
Ming is hungry So I'm making him noodles
Have you been smoking?
No
Let me see your hands
Step aside!
Ming has only just been here a while
How can you ask him to burn rocks?
He can't take it
Please leave my office if you can't speak to me calmly
Fine, now I'm calm
I've seen plenty of youths like him
If you let him off easy he'll just get worse
The centre has its rules he needs to learn to follow them or else face the consequences
Ok, fine, I'll go up and help him
Wait, I haven't finished yet
This is his first offence and he has been punished enough
Go up to the hills and tell him he can come down now
Chi-an said you can go back
Fine, I'll help you
How much longer do you have to be here?
I came voluntarily, I can leave whenever I want
You actually want to be here?
Why?
I promised my mom
My father left us when we were young
My mom had to work two jobs to raise the whole family
I started hanging out with the wrong crowd when I was 11 or 12
Then I started taking heroin in all these years the only thing I ever brought my mom was trouble
So I wanted to something for her
How come I haven't seen your mom visit you in all this time?
She died last year, liver cancer
She worked too hard before she died she said the person she worried about the most was me
Are you crazy, messing with that stuff again?
It hurts!
Ming, look, this flat is quite cheap
Let's move out together
What about your dad?
I'll think of something
Do you want to?
Sorry, I'm meeting Cyrus for tea
Now?
We arranged it days ago I'd almost forgotten
I'll call you, ok?
What a coincidence
I want to speak with you
Sure, let's find a place to sit down
We can talk here
I want you to stop doing what you do with Ming
What do you mean?
I know you've introduced him to clients and you even supply him with drugs, right?
I didn't force him to do anything he doesn't want to do
Don't you know this affects our relationship?
You think you understand Ming?
You don't even know what he wants
Don't be so somber
I can get a maid to take care of you
Father, let me wash up
That's alright, let me do it,
I might as well get used to taking care of myself from now on
I'll come back and visit often
I don't need a visitor
I want my own son
I'm over 30 now, I need to have my own life
What kind of life is that?
Come on
Where is this?
You'll see
What is this?
Our home.
I signed the lease already.
Everything's paid for
You want to move out too, right?
That was then
What do you want from me?
Cyrus told me you went to see him
You still don't accept me, do you?
I just don't want you to die!
Let go of me
Who do you think you are?
Not even my mom tells me what to do
I'm happy with my life now
What about our lives?
Aren't we happy together?
Let's just call it quits
Don't do this
This is Constable Au from Yaumatei district
We suspect drug activities at this premise
We need to search it
Don't move
Turn off the music
Turn on the lights
Sit back down!
Ming, you have a visitor
Me?
- Haven't seen you in a while
- Yeah
You look healthy
Yeah, they feed us well here
Do you still have trouble sleeping?
No, I sleep pretty well now
I miss you a lot
I know
I didn't know they'd impose such a heavy sentence
All I wanted to do was to give you a warning so you'd stay off drugs
What are you talking about?
It was me who called the police, but I didn't mean to...
You fucking bastard!
Ming, have you gone crazy?
Calm down, I didn't mean for things to turn out this way
Don't you ever show yourself again
Just leave!
I didn't mean to...
Stop it!
What's up?
You're on hunger strike?
I don't have an appetite
Just eat something
Come on, or it'll get cold
- Have you ever been betrayed?
- Of course
What did you do about it?
Beat him up, just like you
And if you're still unsatisfied think of all the bad things you've done to others then maybe you'll feel better
Whoever comes to Christ is a new man in him
Even though Brother Keung will no longer be living with us
He will always be living through Christ
Let us bless Brother Keung
Thank you, all
Take care
You too
I thought you weren't going to see me off
Don't argue with Chi-an so much from now on, ok?
Sure
Let's have dinner when you get out
Alright
You promise?
- Take care
- You too
Ming, come here
I'll never come back for sure!
Long time no see
- How are you?
- Great
This is my girlfriend Jackie
He's my brother from rehab
I prepared your room for you Go check it out
Sure
- Is it ok?
- Yeah
- Have you eaten?
- No
Jackie, can you make some noodles for Ming?
We'd just run out
No problem, we'll go out to eat
Jackie doesn't seem to like having me here.
Don't mind her.
I pay the rent
I can invite whoever I want to stay.
As soon as I find a job I'll get out of here.
There's no hurry
You've just gotten out, you shouldn't be living alone
It's too easy to fall off the wagon.
What will you have?
Fried rice noodles
- Anything else?
- Seafood noodles
Have you thought about what kind of job you want to find?
Not really
Why don't you try and get a job as a junior at our salon?
Sure
How known have you known Jackie?
A few months
She works at the salon too
Jackie is a little cool to strangers
But she's ok once you get to know her
I'm sure she is
Is it always this busy here?
Yeah, me and Jackie eat here all the time
That's better than having instant noodles
She doesn't want to cook sometimes
Have you thought about finding a girlfriend?
That takes time
Sure, take your time
It's great to have a girlfriend
Do I have to do this?
That's what the boss said, grin and bear it
That's like using me as guinea pig
It's simple, only washing hair
Water's cold
Adjust the water temperature first
Use more force, you wimp
That hurts
Use your fingertips, dummy!
Jackie, why don't you show him?
Pay attention!
You're much better
Of course, I'm not clumsy like him
That feels good
Watch and learn
Are you coming with us?
I still have this customer to serve
I'll call you guys later
I can stay and help you
- No, you go on ahead
- Alright
Call me when you're done
What's up?
Can't hear you, louder!
You can't leave yet?
It's been 2 hours She sure has a lot of hair
Do whatever you want
I don't care
Don't fucking bother to come!
Get up, sing with me
This is my favorite song
Is she ok?
She's had a bit too much to drink
I told her not to drink so much
She's too willful to listen
I want to thank you for taking care of me at the rehab and letting me live here now
Don't mention it we're brothers, remember?
Do you still go to church?
Are you ok?
Let me help you
Wash the tomatoes for me
How did you party?

What kind of drugs did you take?
E, K, that sort of thing

What's that?
Don't bullshit me
I knew you're gay as soon as I saw you
Is dinner ready?
Almost, go set the table
Don't worry, my lips are sealed
Here's the rice
What kind of soup is that?
Pumpkin

- Of course, I made it
I made this especially for you
- Is it good?
- Quite good
- Am I a good cook?
- Yeah, you are
Praise me
Come on
You're a good cook and an excellent girlfriend
You left out the part about being great in bed
Have a try, it's great stuff
You're not scared, are you?
What do you call a toothpick with a wig
- I don't know
- A match
- I don't get it
- Never mind
What are you two doing?
There're no customers so I'm washing her hair
I asked him to do it
You guys had better be careful, the boss might come back any moment
Don't worry, we heard him say he's going to Shenzhen for the weekend
He's probably visiting prostitutes
Thanks for visiting Do come again next time!
Nothing much, just sitting at home watching TV
What, tonight?
Who else is going?
I'll call you back
Who was it?
It's Kay.
She wants to know if we want to go to Tribeca tonight
Let's go together
No, I have the early shift tomorrow
Alright, I'll tell them I can't come then
- You can go if you want
- I don't want to go alone
Hey you have nothing to do Why don't you come with me?
Yeah, you have the day off tomorrow
Sure
I'll meet you guys there I'm bringing a cute guy...
Keep an eye on her for me
I haven't had so much fun in ages
You're still up?
That's my last card.
I still have six left.
Have you been cheating?
I don't have any money left.
This is gonna cost you
I can give you my underwear
Who needs that?
It probably stinks
Come here
I kissed Keung here last night Don't I smell nice?
You're crazy
I knew you have the hots for Keung
What are you talking about?
I've liked you for a long time
What are you doing?
I see you're not all gay
Is dinner ready yet?
I'm starving
There's food in the fridge You can heat it up
You've eaten?
I'm going to bed
I want to talk to you
I have nothing to say to you
What's wrong with you?
Just leave me alone
- Are you happy being with me?
- Yes
Let's get married
I'm thirsty, please buy me a drink
- What do you want?
- Any kind of soft drinks
- Ming, what would you have?
- Anything's fine
I'll go get it
So what's going on with us?
I don't know what you're talking about
You can't pretend nothing happened
I had a few drinks that night You're not taking it seriously, are you?
You don't need to be afraid of what Keung thinks
I'm finished with him
Are you nuts or what?
Soft drinks for you
I'll take this to the kitchen
Jackie, be honest with me
Is something going on between you and Ming?
- None of your business
- What do you mean by that?
What are you doing?
Let go of me
- I said let go
- What do you want?
- Listen to me
- Why don't you go and ask him?
Keung, what are you doing here?
Mrs. Lam has been under the hair processor for over an hour
Look what you've done!
My hair is ruined
- I'm sorry
- What a jerk
Let me fix this for you
It's all ready
Try the beef, it's quite fresh
Sure
I want to make a toast to you
Why?
- I'm sorry
- Nothing to be sorry for
Girls like Jackie can't be kept in a cage
They'd eventually die
If it wasn't you it would have been someone else
It's just women, right?
Plenty of fish in the ocean
Any beer left?
Yeah, I'll go and get some more
$190, thanks
See you
Keung, I'm disappointed in you
What are you talking about?
I came out of the same rehab as you You can't fool me
I'm not going to ask you for the money back
But don't bother coming to work tomorrow
Keung, are you back?
Are you alright?
What are you doing?
This stuff's gonna kill you!
Leave me the fuck alone
That was only so-so
Can't think of why they cast that guy
What are you having?
Why don't I take you back to the rehab?
If you want to help me lend me $1000
I'd just paid the rent I don't have any money left
- Have some water
- Thanks
This is a nice place
What have you been doing?
Nothing much, just surfing the net and watching movies at home
I'm out of work, you have any clients?
Haven't touched that in a while
My case is being appealed I can't do anything
You're short of money?
I'm not doing so well myself
- Maybe you can go online to find clients
- I'll give it a try
Let me try
We really had fun back then, didn't we?
- I have to go
- Wait
Drop by whenever you want
I'm taking off
Who are you looking for?
- You just got out?
- Yeah
- How have you been?
- Not bad
Father, I'll close up, you go home first
I made dinner already Just heat it up in the microwave
Be careful
Are you still mad at me?
- I've forgotten about that a long time ago
- Really?
Really?
What time do you get off?
I just need to pack up
Let's have dinner together Where'd you like to eat?
I want to borrow some money
What?
So you only thought of me when you needed money
It's really important It's for a friend of mine
What friend?
Your new boyfriend?
None of your business
Just lend me $2000.
I'll pay you back
So what will it be?
Let's start over again
What's gone is gone
Why?
Don't you understand how much I care for you?
Everything I've done is for your own good
No, everything you've done is for your own good.
I really love you
What are you doing?
Don't
Don't you believe how much I love you?
How do you feel?
Can't move
Don't fight it Let it take you along
Is it worth doing this to yourself over a girl?
You're not me.
You don't know how I feel.
I thought I could be with her for the rest of my life
But I can't even control what happens the next day
There are many people in this world who still cares about you
Why are you so good to me?
'Cause you're my brother
I don't deserve to be your brother
I don't want to see you again
Get out of here
Get out!
I don't want to see you
You little shit, what are you doing?
Yan, just leave
What's the big deal?
Get with the times
How dare you do such a disgusting thing at home?
You dishonor your dead father's memory
He's fucking dead.
What does he care?
Don't you dare come back if you step out of that door
I'll never come back for sure!
Mom!
Ming
What is it?
Ming, I'm sorry
Keung, what's the matter?
What have you done?
Melinda:
PREVIOUSLY ON GHOST WHISPERER...
YOU MOVE BETWEEN THE WORLD OF LIFE AND DEATH.
YOU DON'T KNOW THE PRICE.
WHAT PRICE?
NO!
PLEASE, NOT YOU!
YOU HAVE TO CROSS OVER.
I DON'T WANT TO.
Melinda:
I SAW JIM'S GHOST
STEP INTO SAM'S BODY.
[COUGHS]
YOU'RE BACK!
DO I KNOW YOU?
I SEE THE SAME GUY THAT YOU SEE,
DIFFERENT HAIR, NOSE, EYES.
IT'S NOT JIM.
HE'S IN THERE SOMEWHERE.
HE JUST HAS TO BE.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL ME THAT YOU THINK I'M YOUR HUSBAND REINCARNATED.
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY SANE PERSON I'VE MET SINCE I WOKE UP.
IT'S NOT MUCH.
BUT MAYBE YOU COULD HELP ME FINISH MY GARAGE.
AND YOU COULD LIVE THERE WHILE YOU DO THE WORK.
JUST UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT YOUR NEXT MOVE.
THAT'S STRANGE.
I'VE BEEN HOPING FOR A CLUE.
SOMETHING TO TELL ME WHO I WAS.
I BOUGHT THAT LESS THAN A MONTH AGO.
QUESTION IS, WHO DID I BUY IT FOR?
SAM?
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S TRUE.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM, DO YOU?
YOU MUST BE NICOLE.
THE FIANCÉ?
SHE IS NOT HIS FIANCÉ UNTIL HE PUTS A RING ON HER FINGER.
OK.
SO WHERE ARE THEY NOW?
I DON'T KNOW.
HE HASN'T BEEN HOME ALL DAY.
BUT HE'S WITH HER?
NIKKI.
I ASSUME SO.
HOW MUCH TIME ARE THEY ACTUALLY SPENDING TOGETHER?
WELL, HE'S NOT WORKING, AND SHE'S IN TOWN.
SO...
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THEY WERE SPENDING WHOLE DAYS TOGETHER.
WHAT ABOUT THE NIGHTS?
IS SHE STILL STAYING AT THE HOTEL?
YES.
BUT THEY'RE SPENDING ALL DAY TOGETHER.
I'M REALLY TRYING NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT.
I THOUGHT HE WAS JUST TRYING TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HER
SO THAT HE COULD EXPLAIN TO HER WHAT HAPPENED AND THEN SAY GOOD-BYE.
WELL, GUESS WHAT.
THEY'RE SAYING HELLO.
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATION]
SHH.
I THINK I HEAR THEM.
NO.
NO.
NO.
THEY'RE JUST GONNA SEE YOU.
OH, YEAH.
THAT'S A LOT BETTER.
DID SHE SEE ME?
CAN I?
NO.
SAM, HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
UH, MELINDA?
[Whispering] This is nuts.
HI.
I AM DELIA.
HI, DELIA.
I'M NIKKI.
I WAS LOOKING FOR MELINDA.
OH.
OH, GOSH!
FOUND IT!
NIKKI, DELIA.
HAVE YOU MET DELIA?
YES.
WE DID.
I FOUND IT.
OH, GREAT.
I'M SO SORRY WE HAD TO COME ALL THE WAY
BACK HERE FOR JUST THIS.
NO.
IT'S GREAT.
HEY, MELINDA.
HI, SAM.
HEY.
UH, NIKKI LEFT HER CELL PHONE HERE.
SO.
RIGHT.
SO...
I GUESS I'LL BE TAKING YOU BACK--
WELL, ACTUALLY THAT'S WHY I WANTED TALK TO YOU.
MELINDA, THE HOTEL THAT I BOOKED IS REALLY NICE.
IT'S FINE AND EVERYTHING.
BUT I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO BE SPENDING
A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME THAN I ORIGINALLY PLANNED
AND I REALLY WANT TO HELP SAM OUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
BUT I WAS ONLY ABLE TO GET A WEEK OFF FROM WORK.
AND I DON'T WANT TO WASTE A MINUTE THAT I COULD SPEND WITH HIM.
SO, YOU ARE HERE.
AND JUST IF YOU DIDN'T MIND?
MIND?
WELL, JUST 'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY I COULDN'T STAY WITH SAM.
OBVIOUSLY.
NO.
NO.
BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY JUST GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER.
YEAH.
YEAH.
OF COURSE.
REALLY?
IT'S OK?
I CAN STAY WITH YOU?
SURE.
GREAT.
GREAT.
GREAT.
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
Man:
WE WERE WALKING AROUND THE HOUSE INTO THE BACK.
AND WE GET THERE.
AND HER GRANDMOTHER AND GRANDFATHER ARE THERE.
OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD!
STOP.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SWIMMING.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
PAULA, COME ON, IT'S FREEZING!
NO.
HA HA, NO WAY!
SHE'S DOING IT,
SHE'S GOING IN!
NO!
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN!
PAULA, DON'T GO OUT THERE!
OH, MY GOD!
THIS IS CRAZY,
IS SHE SERIOUS?
I'M NOT GOING IN THERE, NO WAY!
PAULA, COME BACK!
MARK, DO SOMETHING.
PAULA, COME ON, WAIT!
PAULA, COME ON!
IT'S FREEZING.
SERIOUSLY, COME ON!
WHERE IS SHE?
[INDISTINCT]
PAULA, GET OUT OF THERE!
PAULA, LET'S GO!
PAULA, COME ON, IT'S FREEZING!
WHERE IS SHE?
WHERE'D SHE...
MARK, LOOK DOWN.
All:
UGH.
LOOK AT THE FISH, OH, GROSS.
OH, SICK.
PAULA, COME BACK, OK?
VERY FUNNY, WE GET IT.
COME ON, QUIT IT, PAULA, IT'S NOT FUNNY ANYMORE.
OH...
COME ON, GUYS.
THE WATER'S GREAT.
COME ON, PAULA.
[ALL YELLING]
SERIOUSLY!
THIS ISN'T A GOOD IDEA, OK?
IT'S NOT FUNNY.
SERIOUSLY.
PAULA!
[GASPS]
WHAT WAS THAT?
!
OH, MY GOD.
IT THINK THERE'S--
[GASPS]
[ALL YELLING]
OH, MY GOD!
[GASPING]
OH, MY GOD!
MARK!
HELP!
[ALL YELLING] ARE YOU OK?
HURRY UP, PAULA!
LET'S GO.
ARE YOU OK?
HERE, GIVE ME YOUR COAT.
HERE, PUT THIS ON.
HEY, IT'S OK.
YOU'RE OK NOW.
JUST GET ME OUT OF HERE.
LET'S JUST GET OUT OF HERE.
OK, I ENJOY HIKING LIKE THE NEXT GIRL BUT WHY ARE WE OUT HERE?
GETTING YOUR MIND OFF THE FACT THAT YOUR HUSBAND'S DATING YOUR ROOMIE.
SHE IS NOT MY ROOMIE.
OK?
I WAS IN SUCH A FOG, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I SAID YES TO.
YOU'RE LITERALLY THE GIRL THAT CAN'T SAY NO.
SHOULD'VE MADE YOU VERY POPULAR IN HIGH SCHOOL.
HEY!
I CAN SAY "NO."
THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP HERE WITH ME?
YOU SAID YOU NEEDED A FAVOR.
AND I NEED A FAVOR, TOO.
OK?
JUST PLEASE KEEP WORKING WITH SAM--
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES TO GET HIS MEMORY BACK--
BEFORE NIKKI CONVINCES HIM THAT HE LOVES HER.
JUST PLEASE HELP US.
OF COURSE.
I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN.
BUT NOW MY FAVOR.
EW.
DO YOU SMELL THAT?
DEAD FISH EVERYWHERE.
A BIOLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY'S DOING SOME TESTS IN THE WATER.
BUT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT GET RESULTS FASTER.
ME?
A STUDENT OF MINE WAS UP HERE
SWIMMING WITH SOME FRIENDS LAST NIGHT.
THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE FREAKED HER OUT.
AND NOT JUST THE DEAD FISH.
SHE SAID SOMETHING WAS PULLING HER UNDER.
SHE CALLED IT A PRESENCE.
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S A LONG SHOT,
BUT HER FATHER DIED EARLIER THIS YEAR--
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?
EDWIN HATHAWAY.
HE'S HERE.
[INDISTINCT MURMURING] BUT DO YOU HEAR THAT?
[MURMURING CONTINUES]
HE'S NOT ALONE.
[MURMURING CONTINUES]
LEAVE US ALONE.
DON'T LET THEM KNOW.
LET US BE.
TELL...
NO ONE.
Child, whispering:
Can you see us?
Eli:
YOU'RE SURE THAT'S THE GHOST YOU SAW?
Melinda:
I THINK SO.
HE RESPONDED TO HIS NAME, ANYWAY.
ACCORDING TO HIS OBITUARY, HE WAS 52.
DIED OF A STROKE.
WELL ,THAT'S WEIRD.
'CAUSE GHOSTS USUALLY APPEAR ONE OF TWO WAYS--
HOW THEY LOOKED AT THE MOMENT OF THEIR DEATH,
OR HOW THEY LOOKED IN LIFE.
HALF THESE GHOSTS WERE ROTTING AND DECOMPOSING.
IT SAYS HERE HE DIED AT THE HOSPITAL.
WHAT WAS HE EVEN DOING AT THE LAKE?
SOMETIMES SPIRITS GATHER.
I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE.
BUT IT'S USUALLY AROUND THE PLACE OF THEIR DEATH.
SO THIS IS WHERE THEY ALL DIED?
WELL, YOU'D THINK,
BUT I COULDN'T FIND ANY MASS DEATHS IN THE VICINITY.
DO YOU REMEMBER THE PLANE CRASH A FEW YEARS AGO?
YEAH.
YEAH.
BUT THAT WAS ALMOST 20 MILES AWAY.
SO WHAT ARE THEY DOING THERE?
KEEPING A BIG FAT SECRET.
"TELL NO ONE."
NOT A LOT OF SUBTEXT THERE.
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
UNFORTUNATELY, OUR INSTRUCTIONS CAME A LITTLE BIT TOO LATE.
OOH.
IT'S THE BIOLOGIST I TOLD YOU ABOUT FROM THE UNIVERSITY.
HE FOUND HEAVY CONCENTRATIONS OF A PARTICULAR PATHOGEN IN THE WATER.
THE SAME PATHOGEN FOUND IN THE WATERS
FILLED WITH BODIES AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA.
SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY IN THERE?
WE'LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH.
HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S GONNA DREDGE THE LAKE.
[PHONE BUZZES] OH!
THAT'S MY APPOINTMENT WITH SAM.
WELL, GO!
GO.
GET OUT OF HERE.
GIVE IT BACK!
Sam:
WHAT?
NO, BUT I WANT IT BACK.
NO, YOU GAVE IT TO ME.
I DID NOT GIVE IT TO YOU.
GIVE IT.
WELL, HERE LOOK.
IF YOU WANT IT SO BADLY.
WELL, I JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU THE ARTICLE.
YOU ALWAYS DO THIS.
[DOOR OPENS]
HEY, ELI.
HEY.
THIS IS NIKKI.
HI.
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
OK.
BUDDY.
TAKE CARE.
WELL, LISTEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HELPING US OUT.
OH, SURE.
UM...
IS THIS GOING TO BE A JOINT SESSION?
NO, IT'S JUST ME.
BUT WE WERE RUNNING SO LATE
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO NIKKI BACK--
IT'S FINE.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
NOT A PROBLEM.
I'LL JUST GRAB A CUP OF COFFEE AND MEET YOU AFTERWARDS.
THANK YOU.
PAST-LIFE REGRESSION IS JUST A KIND OF HYPNO-THERAPY.
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
I JUST DON'T GET HOW DISCOVERING THAT I HAD A PAST LIFE
IS GOING TO HELP ME FIND THIS ONE.
ALL RIGHT.
THE ONE THAT I LOST.
IT LOOSENS THE SUBCONSCIOUS.
MY SUBCONSCIOUS?
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT MY SUBCONSCIOUS IS TELLING ME?
IT IS TELLING ME THAT SOMETHING IS OFF.
GOOD, THAT'S GOOD.
KEEP GOING.
WELL, NIKKI FOR EXAMPLE.
OK?
MM-HMM.
ALL RIGHT, SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
SHE'S SMART.
SHE'S BLONDE?
BLONDE?
YOU'RE INTO BLONDES?
NO.
THAT SHE HAS NICE HAIR.
I REMEMBER HOW IT FELT WHEN I PUT MY ARM AROUND HER.
I MEAN, I REMEMBER HOW IT SMELLED.
WELL, THEN WHY CAN'T I REMEMBER AT ALL JERKING HER AROUND FOR 10 YEARS?
MAYBE YOU JUST DIDN'T WANT TO MARRY HER.
OK.
SO I WAS MR. CAN'T COMMIT.
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS.
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
I THINK I REMEMBER WANTING TO GET MARRIED.
I FEEL LIKE THAT I HAD FINALLY MET THE RIGHT PERSON AND THEN...
TELL ME ABOUT HER.
WELL, THAT WE WANTED...
TO HAVE KIDS.
I MEAN, MAYBE WE WERE EVEN TRYING.
YEAH.
WELL, IF THAT'S TRUE,
THEN WHY ISN'T SHE TELLING ME ABOUT THAT?
BY SHE YOU MEAN...?
NIKKI.
WHO ELSE?
YOU TELL ME.
NIKKI CAN'T BE THE ONLY PERSON YOU DATED.
I WANT YOU TO CONSIDER
THAT MAYBE--JUST MAYBE...
THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE.
WAIT, SOMEONE MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE WOMAN I SPENT HALF MY ADULT LIFE WITH?
I JUST THINK THAT'S KINDA HARD TO IMAGINE.
LOOK, I--I REALLY GOTTA TALK TO HER.
BUT THANKS.
THIS HAS BEEN A BIG HELP.
GO!
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
[SIREN]
[SCUBA BREATHING]
Eli:
DID THEY FIND ANYTHING?
Melinda:
YEAH.
PLENTY.
A REPORTER SAID THAT IT'S 8 VICTIMS AND COUNTING.
VICTIMS?
IS THAT WHAT THEY ARE?
PAULA'S FATHER DIED IN THE HOSPITAL.
YEAH, WELL THAT'S WHAT HIS OBIT SAID.
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE THE PAPER GOT IT WRONG.
ANYWAY, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO BE OUT HERE A WHILE.
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.
THEY'RE HERE.
SO HOW'D IT GO WITH SAM?
SO-SO.
AS HIS SHRINK THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH I CAN TELL YOU VS.
WHAT I ALMOST TOLD HIM.
WHICH WAS?
THAT HE'S JIM,
YOUR HUSBAND.
AND ANYTHING HE REMEMBERS ABOUT ANYONE HE LOVED IS YOU.
SO HE REMEMBERED SOMETHING?
JUST THAT HE WANTED TO HAVE KIDS.
WELL, THAT'S HUGE!
HE THINKS HE WANTS TO HAVE THEM WITH HER.
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?
Edwin:
YOU'VE DISTURBED US.
ALL OF US.
ALL WE ASKED FOR WAS YOUR SILENCE.
I COULDN'T STOP THIS IF I WANTED TO.
IT'S THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THE POLICE.
THEY WANT ANSWERS.
EDWIN, WE KNOW YOU HAVE A FAMILY THAT CARED ABOUT YOU.
THEY DESERVE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.
JUST TELL US HOW WE CAN HELP.
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT?
TO PROTECT THE LIVING.
FROM WHAT?
Policeman:
I GOT ANOTHER ONE!
WHAT IF THEY JUST ALL DIED OF THE SAME THING?
SOME CHEMICAL, TOXIC-SOMETHING?
IN THE LAKE?
I THINK THE C.D.C.
WOULD SAY THAT THE DEAD PEOPLE ARE THE PROBLEM.
WHAT BOTHERS ME IS NOT HOW THEY GOT THERE, BUT WHY THEY STAYED.
Waitress:
YOUR LATTÉ...
THANKS.
AND YOUR CAPPUCINO.
WELL, THEY WERE JUST HANGING AROUND THEIR BODIES, RIGHT?
YEAH.
THAT'S THE UPSIDE.
THAT'S AN UPSIDE?
YOU KNOW, IT JUST MEANS THAT AS SPIRITS THEY WEREN'T LURED THERE
BY SOMEONE OR SOMETHING.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
LIKE SOME KIND OF GHOST CULT?
NO.
MORE LIKE THE GHOSTS IN THE TUNNELS,
YOU KNOW, OR THE WATCHERS.
THE WATCHERS?
A GROUP OF SPIRITS
WHO MADE ALL THE THREATS ABOUT JIM.
THEY SAID THAT THERE WOULD BE A PRICE TO PAY
FOR WHAT I CAN DO, AND...
AHH.
THERE'S SAM.
AND NO NIKKI.
AND HE'S HEADING TOWARD THE STORE.
GO.
GO BE WITH HIM.
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M UP FOR BEING HIS "GOOD FRIEND" RIGHT NOW.
GO!
ALL RIGHT.
OK.
SAM.
HEY.
HEY, MELINDA.
THAT'S FUNNY.
I WAS JUST COMING TO SEE YOU.
OH.
DO YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO WORK OR CAN YOU TALK FOR A BIT?
NO.
I'M GOOD.
GREAT.
HEY, THANKS FOR, YOU KNOW,
LETTING NIKKI STAY WITH YOU.
OH, YEAH.
IT'S NO PROBLEM.
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE HER LAST NIGHT.
YEAH, SHE SAID YOU WERE STILL ASLEEP WHEN SHE CAME IN.
AND SHE WAS ASLEEP WHEN I LEFT.
SO.
[CHUCKLES]
YEAH.
SHE'S A NIGHT PERSON.
I MEAN, AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT SHE TELLS ME.
I GUESS BOTH OF US WERE.
SHE WOULD DO CROSSWORDS.
I WOULD READ THE SPORTS PAGES.
WE'D STAY UP, AND...
I DON'T KNOW.
I HATE CROSSWORDS.
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER.
ALTHOUGH, YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.
I DO REMEMBER RYAN HOWARD'S 2006 BATTING AVERAGE--
.313.
WAIT.
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
YOU HEAR SOMETHING ENOUGH TIMES, IT KINDA STICKS.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
LOOK, MELINDA, WHAT I WANTED TO ASK YOU IS,
HOW IS IT THAT I REMEMBER SOMETHING AS STUPID AS SPORTS TRIVIA
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER SOMETHING THAT NIKKI AND I
FOUGHT ABOUT FOR YEARS?
IN MY HEAD, I REMEMBER WANTING TO HAVE KIDS.
AND NIKKI DIDN'T?
NO, SHE SAYS SHE DID.
SO THIS MAJOR MEMORY BREAKTHROUGH I'M HAVING IS WRONG.
AND SHE'S GOTTA BE RIGHT.
I MEAN, SHE SOUNDS RIGHT.
I'M BEING THE TYPICAL GUY, DRAGGING MY HEELS.
NOT ALL GUYS ARE LIKE THAT.
MY HUSBAND WASN'T.
I WAS ALWAYS THE ONE DRAGGING MY HEELS.
BUT JIM, HE...
HE WANTED EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE REMEMBERING...
WHICH HAS TO MEAN SOMETHING, RIGHT?
WHAT, TO ME AND NIKKI?
NO, TO YOU.
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.
BUT MAYBE YOU--
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T LISTEN TO WHAT EVERYONE ELSE SAYS,
NOT ABOUT THE STUFF THAT REALLY MATTERS.
YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
WHEN YOU START BELIEVING THAT, YOU'LL GET BACK TO YOU, TO--
TO WHAT?
TO BEING THE GUY LIKE YOUR HUSBAND?
COMMITTED, YOU KNOW, CONFIDENT ENOUGH IN HIMSELF,
IN THE WORLD, TO BRING ANOTHER HUMAN BEING INTO IT?
BUT YOU SEE, I WASN'T.
SO PRETENDING THAT I WAS IS JUST WISHFUL THINKING.
[KNOCKING]
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
OF COURSE, YOU SEEMED UPSET.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I TELL YOU SOMETHING WEIRD HAPPENED AT THE LAKE,
AND THEN THE NEXT THING I KNOW I GET, A CALL FROM THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT
RECOMMENDING THAT I SHOULD GO ON A COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS.
AND THEN I TURN ON THE TV
AND SEE THEM PULLING DEAD BODIES OUT OF WATER THAT I WAS JUST SWIMMING IN.
I KNOW THIS MUST BE SCARY--
IT'S DISGUSTING.
I WISH I COULD MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER, BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
I THINK I'M ABOUT TO MAKE YOU FEEL WORSE.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I NEED TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR FATHER.
BUT FIRST I NEED YOU TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY
THAT PARTS OF US MAY EXIST AFTER OUR BODIES HAVE STOPPED.
WHY?
BECAUSE I'VE TALKED TO YOUR FATHER'S GHOST.
HE WAS UP AT THE LAKE.
HE'S THERE--
NO, THIS IS--THIS IS CRAZY.
PAULA, YOU SAID YOU FELT A PRESENCE.
YOU THINK MY DAD IS ONE OF THE CORPSES
THEY'RE PULLING OUT OF THAT WATER?
LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS HARD TO ACCEPT--
NO, LITERALLY.
THERE'S NO WAY.
WHY?
HE'S RIGHT HERE.
Eli:
YOUR FATHER WAS CREAMATED...
WHERE?
[WATER DRIPPING]
[BAT SQUAWKING]
[CREAKING]
[INDISTINCT MURMURING]
[DOOR SLAMS]
[GASPS]
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANTED?
TO BE CREMATED?
I WAS DONE WITH MY BODY.
I WANTED MY FAMILY TO BE DONE WITH IT, TOO.
I THOUGHT, SOMEHOW,
IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR THEM.
AND NOW THEY HAVE TO FEEL YOUR LOSS ALL OVER AGAIN.
"PROTECT THE LIVING." YOU MEANT,
FROM WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.
WE WERE BETRAYED.
LOOK WHAT'S BECOME OF US.
THAT'S JUST HOW YOU SEE YOURSELVES.
NO.
IT'S HOW THEY'LL SEE US, TOO.
MY WIFE,
MY DAUGHTER.
THEY'LL BE FORCED TO...
NO.
NO.
YOU CAN TALK TO THEM.
YOU CAN HELP THEM THROUGH THIS.
AND THEY'LL REMEMBER YOU JUST AS YOU WERE.
AND THEN YOU CAN MOVE ON.
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
WE'VE WAITED.
THERE'S BUSINESS TO FINISH.
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT TO FINISH?
YOU MEAN WHO.
[CLICK]
IF THEY WENT TO THE MOVIES THEY SHOULD BEEN BACK BY NOW.
[THUNDER]
OR IF THEY WENT TO DINNER...
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE,
AND I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
WELL, YOU SHOULD WANT TO KNOW
WHEN YOUR COMPETITION LOOKS LIKE THIS.
IT'S TOUGH LOVE, GIRLFRIEND.
AND YOU GOTTA HEAR THIS.
OK.
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
GET INTO THE GAME!
YOU GOTTA FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE!
LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN THROW ON A BIKINI AND MUD WRESTLE FOR THE GUY.
WELL, YOU CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND AND DO NOTHING.
DOES IT LOOK LIKE I'M DOING NOTHING?
NO, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE HELPING ANOTHER GHOST.
NOT JUST ONE, A LOT OF THEM.
OK, AND THEY LEFT LOVED ONES BEHIND.
AND IF I DON'T FIGURE OUT WHO DUMPED THEIR BODIES--
I AM NOT SUGGESTING THAT THIS WORK ISN'T IMPORTANT.
I'M JUST SAYING THAT GHOSTS CAN KEEP.
I'M NOT SO SURE SAM CAN.
YEAH.
NEITHER AM I.
THEN WHY DON'T YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?
BECAUSE NOTHING--
NOTHING I CAN DO WILL GET HIM TO REMEMBER ME...
OR CHOOSE ME.
ALL I CAN DO IS HAVE FAITH.
THAT'S ALL I HAVE RIGHT NOW.
FAITH.
IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU.
CARL GETS SO FEW VISITORS LATELY.
NOT THAT WE'RE SURPRISED IN HIS BUSINESS.
WHO WANTS TO WATCH SOMEONE DYING?
WHEN DID HE CLOSE THE FUNERAL HOME?
WHEN THE CANCER MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO WORK.
DID HE TAKE CARE OF YOUR FAMILY?
NO.
HE...
HELPED SOME FRIENDS OF MINE.
I KEEP WISHING SOMEONE CLOSE MIGHT GET THROUGH TO HIM.
HE DOESN'T LISTEN TO ME ANYMORE.
GET THROUGH TO HIM?
HE HAS SO LITTLE TIME,
AND HE'S IN SUCH PAIN...
BUT HE WON'T TAKE THE PILLS THEY GIVE HIM.
OH...
I GUESS HE'S AFRAID
IT'LL MAKE THE END COME SOONER.
BUT REALLY, WHY GO ON LIKE THIS?
DO YOU WANT ME TO TALK TO HIM?
[SIGHS]
THANK YOU.
COME ON.
[DOOR CREAKING]
[MAN BREATHING HEAVILY]
CARL?
MY NAME IS MELINDA GORDON.
I DON'T KNOW YOU.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I CAME TO TALK ABOUT THE LAKE.
WHAT LAKE?
WHERE THE BODIES ARE.
WHERE YOU PUT THEM.
DIDN'T YOU?
PART OF ME HOPED I WOULD DIE BEFORE THIS DAY.
AND THE OTHER PART?
WHAT IF THEY'RE WAITING FOR ME?
[INDISTINCT WHISPERING]
WHY DID YOU DO IT?
I THOUGHT I HAD NO CHOICE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THE BIG MORTUARY CHAINS KEPT CALLING TO GET ME TO SELL.
BUT MY GREAT GRANDFATHER
BUILT THAT PLACE FROM NOTHING.
AND I WAS PROUD.
AND I WANTED A BETTER PRICE.
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT ALWAYS HAPPENS.
THEY UNDERCUT ME.
I COULDN'T COMPETE.
THE MONEY RAN OUT.
AND WHEN THE...
FURNACE FINALLY BROKE DOWN,
I WAS DESPERATE.
IT'S NO EXCUSE.
SOMETIMES I THINK--[COUGH]
THE CANCER IS A PUNISHMENT.
ALL THIS PAIN.
YOUR WIFE SAID THERE'S PAIN MEDICATION THAT YOU WON'T TAKE.
I FEEL EVIL.
CARL, YOU MADE A MISTAKE.
YOU'RE NOT EVIL.
NO.
NO.
I FEEL EVIL AROUND ME.
[INDISTINCT WHISPERING]
EVERYWHERE.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
CARL, THEY'RE HERE.
ALL THE GHOSTS OF THE BODIES THAT YOU THREW INTO THAT LAKE.
OH, NO.
I CAN SEE THEM.
OH, PLEASE.
THEY'RE ANGRY BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DID.
BUT I CAN HELP.
PLEASE JUST GIVE ME THE NAMES
OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT YOU THREW INTO THE LAKE.
I CAN TALK TO THEIR FAMILIES.
I CAN HELP THEM HEAL.
TO HELP THEM SUFFER, YOU MEAN.
THEN THEY'LL DROP THEIR ANGER, OK?
NOT UNTIL HE'S SUFFERED LIKE WE HAVE.
[COUGHING]
YOU NEED TO GO INTO THE LIGHT.
THERE'S FORGIVENESS THERE.
[INDISTINCT MURMURING] [COUGHING]
CARL...
TAKE YOUR MEDICINE.
[MURMURING CONTINUES]
[COUGHING]
Melinda:
I WENT BACK AND LOOKED WHERE HE TOLD ME TO.
BACK TO THE FUNERAL HOME?
WOW, YOU'RE A GLUTTON FOR GRUESOME.
YEAH, WELL, WITH MARY SUNSHINE BUNKING AT MY HOUSE,
I ALREADY FEEL LIKE FORMALDEHYDE GIRL.
FORMALDEHYDE GIRL.
[CHUCKLES]
THAT'S FUNNY.
SORRY.
NOT FUNNY.
DID YOU GET THE LIST OF NAMES?
YEAH.
I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE IF THEIR I.D.s MATCH WHAT WE FOUND.
HEY, HERE'S PAULA'S DAD.
WAS EVERYBODY ON THE LIST SCHEDULED FOR CREMATION?
CREMATION, CREMATION.
YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE THERE WERE ALL MEANT TO BE...
[DOOR CHIMES]
CREMATED.
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.
HI.
HI.
HOW ARE YOU?
I'M FINE.
UM...
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE TO TALK ABOUT SAM?
SURE.
WHAT ABOUT HIM?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR IMPOSING ON YOU AT YOUR HOUSE AND HERE AT WORK NOW.
BUT I REALLY--
HONESTLY, I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHO ELSE TO GO TO.
UM...
[CHUCKLES]
YOU KNOW HOW YOU GROW UP IMAGINING WHAT IT'LL BE LIKE TO BE IN LOVE?
YOU PICTURE YOUR BOYFRIEND, YOUR HUSBAND.
AND NOT JUST THE GOOD TIMES--
BUT THE FIGHTS AND THE PROBLEMS, TOO.
YEAH.
SURE.
COULD YOU EVER HAVE IMAGINED SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENING?
A GUY YOU LOVED JUST WAKES UP ONE DAY
AND THEN SUDDENLY HAS NO IDEA WHO YOU ARE?
NO.
NEVER.
REALLY?
NOT AT ALL?
I--I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I GUESS I WAS SO BLOWN AWAY BY WHAT HAPPENED TO SAM
THAT I REALLY DIDN'T NOTICE IT AT FIRST, BUT, UH...
DO YOU THINK IT'S A LITTLE ODD
THAT HE'S STAYING IN YOUR GARAGE?
THE SAME GARAGE THAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING DESIGNS FOR?
AND WHERE ARE THE PLANS?
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THOSE.
WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT?
WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE,
MY IDEA WAS A QUICK IN AND OUT.
LET SAM KNOW THAT HE WAS FORGIVEN,
MAYBE FILL IN A FEW MEMORY BLANKS, AND THEN SAY GOOD-BYE.
BUT...
BUT NOW THAT I HAVE SEEN WHO HE IS,
THIS NEW SAM WHO WANTS KIDS,
WHO IS READY TO SETTLE DOWN...
I, UH...
I--I DON'T WANT TO LET HIM GO.
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ME?
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT.
SHOULDN'T YOU BE ASKING SAM?
[EXHALES]
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE THIS EASY, ARE YOU?
I THOUGHT I JUST DID.
* SOMETHING *
* IS HAPPENING *
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
* IS HAPPENING *
Nikki:
THANK YOU.
[GASP] OOH!
MRS. SESSICK, YOU STARTLED ME.
I APOLOGIZE FOR COMING BY WITHOUT CALLING.
I THOUGHT YOU'D WANT TO KNOW.
CARL DIED A FEW HOURS AGO.
I'M SO SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SAID,
BUT AFTER YOU LEFT, HE SEEMED TO CHANGE.
HE RELAXED, AND DECIDED TO TAKE HIS PAIN MEDICINE.
AFTER A FEW HOURS,
HE TOOK MY HAND.
THEN HIS EYES OPENED WIDE,
LIKE HE SAW SOMETHING AMAZING.
AND THAT WAS IT.
THAT LOOK IN HIS EYES,
HE MUST HAVE JUST SEEN THE FACE OF HIS MAKER.
DON'T YOU THINK?
THAT'S A LOVELY NOTION.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, MELINDA,
FOR GIVING MY HUSBAND PEACE.
MELINDA?
MELINDA!
HOW DID I GET HERE?
OH, NO!
NO.
MELINDA!
MELINDA!
MELINDA!
OH, PLEASE GOD,
ANYWHERE BUT HERE.
FOR YOU, THERE'S NOWHERE BUT HERE.
FORGIVE ME.
PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU.
I'M BEGGING YOU FOR FORGIVENESS.
PLEASE!
PLEASE!
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'LL FIND HERE.
MELINDA!
MELINDA!
HELP ME!
TELL ME, HOW CAN I HELP YOU?
MOM, YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THIS.
NO ONE IS MAD AT YOU, MOM.
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.
[EXHALES]
WHEN EDWIN HAD HIS STROKE,
HE WAS JOGGING A FEW MILES FROM HOME.
HE HAD NO WALLET, NO I.D.
SO THE HOSPITAL NEEDED SOMEONE TO SAY THAT IT WAS HIM.
I WENT.
BUT I COULDN'T DO IT.
I JUST-- I COULDN'T LOOK AT HIM.
PAULA WAS THERE BY THEN, SO SHE DID IT.
I MADE MY OWN DAUGHTER GO IN AND LOOK AT HER DEAD FATHER.
MOM, I DIDN'T MIND DOING IT.
THERE WAS NO SHAME IN WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.
WHY COULDN'T I JUST LOOK AT HIM?
MARLENE, THERE'S NO SHAME IN WHAT YOU DID, EITHER.
MOST PEOPLE NEVER SEE THEIR DECEASED LOVED ONES,
EVER.
MY DAUGHTER, SHE SAID THAT YOU KNEW SOMETHING
ABOUT EDWIN'S SPIRIT.
HE IS STUCK HERE?
HE CAN'T MOVE ON?
THAT'S RIGHT.
HE AND THE OTHER SPIRITS WHOSE BODIES WERE PUT INTO THE LAKE,
THEY'RE EARTHBOUND,
WHICH MEANS THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CROSS OVER INTO THE LIGHT.
WHY NOT?
THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM.
OUT OF SHAME.
THAT'S WHY YOUR HUSBAND TRIED TO SCARE PAULA AWAY THAT NIGHT AT THE LAKE.
CAN WE HELP THEM?
YOU MIGHT.
BUT RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE VERY ANGRY.
UNTIL THE RIGHT MOMENT COMES--
IF EDWIN'S GHOST IS STILL HERE,
THEN THAT MEANS HE SAW WHAT I DID WHEN HE DIED.
PLEASE...
GIVE ME THE CHANCE TO MAKE IT RIGHT.
* SO HIGH *
* TONIGHT *
* AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE *
* COMING BY *
[TYPING] HEY.
[GASPS] OH.
SAM...
PLEASE DON'T SNEAK UP ON ME LIKE THAT!
SORRY.
YEAH.
I'M SORRY.
THE DOOR WAS OPEN.
LOOK, I TOOK NIKKI TO A HOTEL LAST NIGHT.
AND, UM, I JUST WANTED TO COME BY
AND SEE IF YOU WERE OK.
I'M FINE.
ARE YOU SURE?
BECAUSE YOU SEEMED A LITTLE TENSE,
AND FRANKLY, SO DID NIKKI.
NO, REALLY.
I'M FINE.
OK.
WELL, THEN I'LL GO BACK TO THE HOTEL.
WHY?
I MEAN,
SHE'S BEEN HERE ALMOST A WEEK,
SO...
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S WEIRD.
I FEEL THINGS WHEN I'M WITH HER.
NICE THINGS.
YOU KNOW, HER SMELL IS FAMILIAR.
I RECOGNIZE THE FEEL OF HER HAND WHEN I HOLD IT.
YOU KNOW, AND...
IT'S COMFORTABLE.
OK.
MELINDA, NOT EVERYBODY CAN HAVE WHAT YOU HAD
WITH YOUR HUSBAND.
ALL RIGHT?
AND GIVEN MY TRACK RECORD,
I'M SURE I'D EVEN BE CAPABLE OF THAT.
OF COURSE YOU ARE.
MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW ME AS WELL AS YOU THINK.
AND, LOOK, IF SUDDENLY I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD TAKE A CHANCE,
YOU KNOW, GET SOME FEELINGS BACK, MAYBE THAT'S PROGRESS.
MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD THING.
MAYBE I SHOULD REACH OUT WITH BOTH HANDS.
ALL RIGHT.
DON'T.
DON'T WHAT?
YOU CAN DO BETTER FOR YOURSELF THAN
"COMFORTABLE"
OR "MAYBE GETTING SOME FEELINGS BACK."
HOLD OUT FOR MORE.
WHAT?
WHAT AM I HOLDING OUT FOR?
EVERYTHING.
HOLD OUT FOR EVERYTHING.
YOU KNOW, THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.
YOU HAD EVERYTHING.
[DOOR OPENS, CLOSES]
WHO'S THERE?
CARL...
WHY ARE YOU HERE?
YOU SAID THERE WOULD BE FORGIVENESS FOR ME.
YOU LIED.
DID YOU LOOK INTO THE LIGHT?
I SAW IT, BUT THEY TOLD ME I COULDN'T GO IN.
WHY NOT?
BECAUSE OF MY SHAME.
BUT YOU APOLOGIZED.
I MEAN, YOU TRIED TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.
YOU CAN COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS NOW.
NO, I CAN'T.
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR ME.
THEY WANT ME TO GO WITH THEM.
THOSE SPIRITS ARE ANGRY BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DID.
NOBODY CAN KEEP YOU FROM THE LIGHT.
IT'S NOT THEM.
IT'S THE OTHERS.
THE OTHERS?
SPIRITS I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
BUT THEY SAID THEY KNOW YOU.
THEY KNOW ME?
THEY SAID THEY GAVE YOU A WARNING,
BUT YOU DIDN'T LISTEN, AND SOMETHING YOU CHERISHED
WAS LOST.
AND?
THEY SAID YOU BELIEVED IN THINGS THAT WEREN'T RIGHT,
AND TRUSTING THOSE THINGS MIGHT HURT OTHERS...
AND YOU.
[INDISTINCT MURMURING]
HELLO?
I'M HERE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
WHAT DID I DO TO OFFEND YOU?
Woman:
YOU DID NOTHING.
THEN WHY DID YOU TAKE MY HUSBAND AWAY?
FATE DID THAT, NOT US.
YOU CAME TO ME AND YOU SAID
THAT DEATH WOULD TOUCH SOMETHING THAT I LOVED.
AND BEFORE I KNEW IT, HE WAS DEAD.
WE JUST WARNED YOU TO BE CAREFUL.
YEAH. 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE DOING WAS WARNING ME
WITH ALL YOUR LIES AND THREATS.
WE DON'T LIE OR MAKE THREATS.
YOU TOLD CARL THAT HE COULDN'T CROSS OVER.
THE LIGHT HAS NEVER DENIED ANYONE.
THE LIGHT DOESN'T MAKE THE CHOICE.
WE EACH DO.
WE?
YOU MEAN YOU.
NO, EACH OF US FOR OURSELVES.
YOU WONDERED WHY THESE LAKE SPIRITS STAYED EARTHBOUND.
WELL, IT'S THE SAME REASON THAT CARL DID.
WHEN THE LIGHT OPENS, WE EACH SEE OURSELVES REFLECTED BACK.
SO CARL'S SHAME KEPT HIM HERE.
WHEN SPIRITS FEEL UNWORTHY,
SOMETIMES WE CHOOSE TO STAY BACK TO WORK TOGETHER FOR THE LIVING.
TO MAKE OURSELVES WORTHY.
WHAT SPIRIT WOULD STAY BACK TO DO THAT?
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY.
YOU'RE MEETING FOUR OF THEM NOW.
YOU?
WHY DO YOU THINK WE'RE STILL HERE?
SO WHEN CARL SAID THAT YOU ASKED HIM TO JOIN YOU...?
CARL?
THEY EXPLAINED IT TO ME,
AND I UNDERSTAND NOW.
THIS IS WHAT I WANT.
ARE YOU SURE?
BECAUSE THEY SAID IT'S YOUR CHOICE.
YOU CAN MOVE ON NOW.
I WANT TO BE ONE OF THEM.
ALL RIGHT.
WILL YOU HELP ME FIX THE WRONGS I DID?
HOW?
BY TAKING AWAY THEIR SHAME.
THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING TONIGHT.
WE'D ASKED FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS,
AND...
I JUST NEVER REALIZED HOW MANY FRIENDS WE HAVE.
Jim:
HEY, ELI.
Eli:
HI, SAM.
I WASN'T SURE WHAT TO SAY,
SO I ASKED MY DARLING ENGLISH MAJOR PAULA FOR SOME HELP.
AND SHE WROTE DOWN SOME THOUGHTS FOR ME.
PAULA?
DON'T BE SHY.
"TONIGHT WE SEND OUR LOVED ONES
"TO WHERE WE THOUGHT THEY'D ALREADY GONE.
"IT SEEMS LIKE A DETOUR;
"AN EMBARRASSING WRONG TURN.
"BUT THE TRUTH IS,
"WE NEVER KNEW WHERE THEY WERE GOING.
"WE PRETENDED WE DID, AND THAT MADE US FEEL BETTER.
"BUT EVERY PATH LEADS TO THE UNKNOWN.
"SOME PATHS JOIN OTHERS, AND SOME SPLIT OFF ON THEIR OWN.
"WE WANT TO KNOW WHERE THEY ALL GO, BUT MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T.
"MAYBE THE MORE WE INSIST ON KNOWING,
"THE LESS WE'LL BE ABLE TO LEARN FROM LIFE'S TWISTS AND TURNS.
"I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING--
THAT THE UNKNOWN IS SCARY."
"BUT THAT'S OK.
"WE'RE HUMAN.
"MAYBE BEFORE WE FEEL FREE,
"WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FEEL FEARFUL.
"MAYBE IT MEANS MORE THAT WAY.
"SO LET'S ALL SAY GOODBYE NOW.
"AND REMEMBER,
"THAT NO MATTER WHAT WE'RE FEELING,
"THERE'S NO SHAME.
NO SHAME AT ALL."
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
YEAH.
[EXHALES]
[DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE]
MELINDA.
OH, HEY, SAM.
NIKKI'S DOWNSTAIRS.
UM...
SHE WANTED TO TALK TO YOU FIRST.
FIRST?
NIKKI...
MELINDA.
HEH, I--I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'VE BEEN SO NICE TO ME.
LETTING ME STAY HERE IN YOUR HOUSE, WHEN OBVIOUSLY...
NIKKI--
IT'S NOT EASY TO SAY THIS,
WE HAVE OUR WHOLE LIVES AHEAD OF US.
AND WHATEVER YOU'RE FEELING RIGHT NOW,
I HOPE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY I DID WHAT I DID.
SOMEDAY MAYBE YOU'LL SEE THAT IT WAS FOR THE BEST.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO--
THE WEIRDEST PART IS SAM IS THIS WHOLE OTHER GUY.
HE'S A GROWN-UP WHO REALIZES HE WANTS MORE.
HE TALKS ABOUT HOLDING OUT
AND THAT'S SORT OF AMAZING,
BECAUSE EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN HOLDING OUT FOR,
HE IS READY TO GIVE.
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO THANK YOU FOR THAT.
NO HARD FEELINGS, I HOPE.
YOU--YOU DESERVE EVERY HAPPINESS.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
* IF THIS WORLD IS WEARING THIN *
* AND YOU'RE THINKING OF ESCAPE *

Previously on Ghost Whisperer.
You move between the world of life and death.
You don't know the price.
What price?
No!
please, not you!
You have to cross over.
I don't want to.
I saw Jim's ghost step into Sam's body.
You're back!
Do I know you?
I see the same guy that you see,
Different hair, nose, eyes.
It's not Jim.
He's in there somewhere.
He just has to be.
You're not gonna tell me that you think I'm your husband reincarnated.
Because your are the only sane person I've met since I woke up.
It's not much.
But maybe you could help me finish my garage.
And you could live there while you do the work.
Just until you figure out your next move.
That's strange.
I've been hoping for a clue.
Something to tell me who I was.
I bought that less than a month ago.
Question is, who did I buy it for?
Sam?
Oh, my god.
It's true.
You don't know who I am, do you?
You must be Nicole.
The fiance?
She is not his fiance until he puts a ring on her finger.
Ok.
So where are they now?
I don't know.
He hasn't been home all day.
But he's with her?
Nikki.
I assume so.
How much time are they actually spending together?
Well, he's not working, and she's in town. so...
You didn't tell me they were spending whole days together.
What about the nights?
Is she still staying at the hotel?
Yes.
But they're spending all day together.
I'm really trying not to think about it.
I thought he was just trying to get in touch with her
So that he could explain to her what happened and then say goodbye.
Well, guess what.
They're saying hello.
I think I hear them.
No.
No.
No.
They're just gonna see you.
Oh, yeah.
That's a lot better.
Did she see me?
Can I?
- No.
- Hold on a second, Sam.
Uh, Melinda?
This is nuts.
Hi.
I am Delia.
Hi, Delia.
I'm Nikki.
I was looking for Melinda.
- Found it!
-Oh, gosh!
Nikki, Delia.
Have you met Delia?
Yes.
We did.
- I found it.
- Oh, great.
I'm so sorry we had to come all the way back here for just this.
No.
It's great.
Hey, Melinda.
Hi, Sam.
Uh, Nikki left her cell phone here.
So...
Right.
So...
I guess I'll be taking you back...
Well, actually that's why I wanted talk to you.
Melinda, the hotel that I booked is really nice.
It's fine and everything.
But I'm actually going to be spending a little bit more time than I originally planned.
And I really want to help Sam out as much as possible.
But I was only able to get a week off from work.
And I don't want to waste a minute that I could spend with him.
So, you are here.
And just if you didn't mind?
Mind?
Just 'cause obviously I couldn't stay with Sam.
Obviously.
No.
No.
Because we're really just getting to know each other.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Of course.
Really?
It's ok.
I can stay with you?
Sure.
- Great.
- Great.
Great.
We were walking around the house into the back.
And we get there.
And her grandmother and grandfather are there.
Oh, my god!
What are you doing?
Swimming.
Are you crazy?
What are you thinking?
Paula, come on, it's freezing!
No way!
She's going in.
- No.
- Catch me if you can!
Paula, don't go out there.
Oh, my God!
This is no£¡
Is she serious?
I'm not going in there, no way!
Paula, come back!
Mark, do something.
Paula, come on!
Wait!
Paula, come on!
It's freezing.
Seriously, come on!
Paula, come on, it's freezing.
Where is she?
Mark, look down.
- Fish, oh, gross.
- Oh, sick.
Paula, come back, ok?
Very funny, we get it.
Just come back, seriously.
Come on.
Come on, guys.
The water's great.
- Come on, Paula.
- All right, let's go.
Paula, come back.
Yeah, Paula.
It's not funny.
Seriously.
What was that?
Oh, my god.
I think there's...
Paula, look, I'm worried!
Paula!
Hold that.
She's not kidding, get her out of there!
Oh, my god, what's going on?
Get her out of there!
Oh, my god!
I think something's in there!
What is that?
!
What's the matter?
!
Hurry!
Oh, my god!
Swim this way, come on!
Mark, get her!
Oh, my god.
Hurry, hurry, get out!
What the hell was that?
- Here, give me your coat.
- Here, put this on.
Hey, it's ok.
You're ok now.
Just get me out of here.
Ok, I enjoy hiking like the next girl but why are we out here?
Getting your mind off the fact that your husband's dating your roomie.
She is not my roomie.
Ok?
I was in such a fog, I didn't know what I said yes to.
You're literally the girl that can't say no.
Should've made you very popular in high school.
Hey!
I can say "no."
Then what are you doing up here with me?
You said you needed a favor.
And I need a favor, too.
Ok?
Just please keep working with Sam...
No matter what it takes to get his memory back... before Nikki convinces him that he loves her.
Just please help us.
Of course.
I'll do whatever I can.
But now my favor.
Ew.
Do you smell that?
Dead fish everywhere.
A biologist at the university's doing some tests in the water.
But I thought you might get results faster.
Me?
A student of mine was up here swimming with some friends last night.
The whole experience freaked her out.
And not just the dead fish.
She said something was pulling her under.
She called it a presence.
Look, I know it's a long shot, but her father died earlier this year...
What was his name?
Edwin Hathaway.
He's here.
But do you hear that?
He's not alone.
Tell no one.
You're sure that's the ghost you saw?
I think so.
He responded to his name, anyway.
According to his obituary, he was 52.
Died of a stroke.
Well ,that's weird. 'cause ghosts usually appear one of two ways.
How they looked at the moment of their death, or how they looked in life.
Half these ghosts were rotting and decomposing.
It says here he died at the hospital.
What was he even doing at the lake?
Sometimes spirits gather.
I've seen it before.
But it's usually around the place of their death.
So this is where they all died?
You'd think, but I couldn't find any mass deaths in the vicinity.
Do you remember the plane crash a few years ago?
Yeah.
But that was almost 20 miles away.
So what are they doing there?
Keeping a big fat secret. "Tell no one."
Not a lot of subtext there.
Unfortunately, our instructions came a little bit late.
It's the biologist I told you about from the university.
He found heavy concentrations of a particular pathogen in the water.
The same pathogen found in the waters filled with bodies after hurricane Katrina.
So they're actually in there?
We'll know soon enough.
Health department's gonna dredge the lake.
Oh!
That's my appointment with Sam.
Well, go!
Go.
Get out of here.
What?
No, but I want it back.
Give it back!
You gave it to me.
I did not give it to you.
Give it.
Well, here look.
If you want it so badly.
Well, I just wanted to show you the article.
You always do this.
Hey, Eli.
Hey.
This is Nikki.
Hi.
It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
Ok.
Buddy.
Take care.
Well, listen.
Thank you so much for helping us out.
Oh, sure.
Um...
Is this going to be a joint session?
No, it's just me.
But we were running so late,
I didn't have a chance to take Nikki back...
It's fine.
Don't worry about it.
Not a problem.
I'll just grab a cup of coffee and meet you afterwards.
Thank you.
Past-life regression is just a kind of hypno-therapy.
With all due respect,
I just don't get how discovering that I had a past life
Is going to help me find this one.
All right.
The one that I lost.
It loosens the subconscious.
My subconscious?
Do you want to know what my subconscious is telling me?
It is telling me that something off.
Good, that's good.
Keep going.
Well, Nikki for example.
Ok?
She's beautiful.
She's smart.
She's blonde?
Blonde?
You're into blondes?
No.
That she has nice hair.
I remembered how it felt when I put my arm around her.
I mean, I remember how it smelled.
Well, then why can't I remember at all jerking her around for 10 years?
Maybe you just didn't want to marry her.
Ok.
So I was Mr. Can't Commit.
That's what everyone says.
You know what I think?
I think I remember wanting to get married.
I feel like that I had finally met the right person and then...
Tell me about her.
Well, that we wanted to have kids.
I mean, maybe we were even trying.
If that's true, then why isn't she telling me about that?
By she you mean...?
Nikki.
Who else?
You tell me.
Nikki can't be the only person you dated.
I want you to consider that maybe...just maybe...
There's someone else.
Wait, someone more important than the woman I spent half my adult life with?
Look, I just think that's kinda hard to imagine.
Look, I...
I really gotta talk to her.
But thanks.
This has been a big help.
Did they find anything?
Yeah.
Plenty.
A reporter said that it's 8 victims and counting.
Victims?
Is that what they are?
Paula's father died in a hospital.
Yeah, well that's what his obit said.
Maybe the paper got it wrong.
Anyway, it looks like they're going to be out here a while.
I don't hear anything.
They're here.
- So how'd it go with Sam?
- So-so.
As his shrink there's only so much I can tell you was.
what I almost told him.
Which was?
That he's Jim, your husband.
And anything he remembers about anyone he loved is you.
So he remembered something?
Just that he wanted to have kids.
Well, that's huge!
He thinks he wants to have them with her.
What am I going to do?
You've disturbed us.
All of us.
All we asked for was your silence.
I couldn't stop this if I wanted to.
It's the health department and the police.
They want answers.
Edwin, we know you have a family that cared about you.
They deserve to find out what happened to you.
Just tell us how we can help.
What is it that you want...
To protect the living.
From what?
Got another one.
What if they just all died of the same thing?
Some chemical, toxic-something?
In the lake?
I think the C.D.C. would say that the dead people are the problem.
And bothers me is not how they got there, but why they stayed.
- Your Latte, and the cappuccino.
- Thanks.
Well, they were just hanging around their bodies, right?
Yeah.
That's the upside.
That's an upside?
You know, it just means as spirits they weren't lured there by someone or something.
What do you mean?
Like some kinda ghost cult?
No.
More like the ghosts in the tunnels, you know, or the watchers.
The watchers?
A group of spirits who made all the threats about Jim.
They said that there would be a price to pay for what I can do.
Ahh.
There's Sam.
And no Nikki.
And he's heading toward the store.
Go.
Go be with him.
I don't know if I'm up for being his "good friend" right now.
Go!
All right.
Ok.
Sam.
Hey, Melinda.
That's funny.
I was just coming to see you.
Do you have to go back to work or can you talk for a bit?
- No.
I'm good.
- Great.
Thanks for, you know, letting Nikki stay with you.
Oh, yeah.
It's no problem.
I didn't even see her last night.
Yeah, she said you were still asleep when she came in.
And she was asleep when I left.
So.
Yeah.
She's a night person.
I mean, at least that's what she tells me.
I guess both of us were.
She'd do crosswords.
I would read the sports pages.
We'd stay up...
I hate crosswords.
I don't even remember.
Although, you know it's funny.
I do remember Ryan Howard's 2006 batting average... 3-13
Wait.
How do you know that?
You hear something enough times it kinda sticks.
Look, Melinda, what I wanted to ask you is,
How is it I remember something as stupid as sports trivia
But I don't remember something that
Nikki and I fought about for years?
In my head, I remember wanting to have kids.
And Nikki didn't?
No, she says she did.
So this big memory breakthrough I'm having is wrong.
And she's gotta be right.
I mean, she sounds right.
I'm being the typical guy, dragging my heels.
Not all guys are like that.
My husband wasn't.
I was always the one dragging my heels.
But Jim, he...
He wanted everything that you're remembering... which has to mean something, right?
What to me and Nikki?
No, to you.
It's none of my business.
But maybe you...maybe you shouldn't listen to what everyone else says, not about the stuff that really matters.
You know who you are.
When you start believing that, you'll get back to you, to...
To what?
To being the guy like your husband?
Committed, confident enough in himself,
In the world, to bring another human being into it?
But you see, I wasn't.
So pretending that I was is just wishful thinking.
Thank you so much for coming.
Of course, you seemed upset.
I don't understand.
I tell you something weird happened at the lake,
And then the next thing I know I get a call from the health department recommending that I should go on a course of antibiotics.
And then I turn on the TV and see them pulling dead bodies out of water that I was just swimming in.
I know this must be scary...
It's disgusting.
I wish I could make you feel better.
But unfortunately, I think I'm about to make you feel worse.
What are you talking about?
I need to ask you about your father.
First I need you to consider the possibility that parts of us may exist after our bodies have stopped.
Why?
Because I've talked to your father's ghost.
He was up at the lake.
He's there...
No, this is...this is crazy.
Paula, you said you felt a presence,
You think my dad is one of the corpses
They're pulling out of that water?
Look, I know this is hard to accept...
No, literally.
There's no way.
Why?
He's right here.
Your father was cremated...where?
Is this what you wanted?
To be cremated?
I was done with my body.
I wanted my family to be done with it, too.
I thought, somehow, it would be easier for them.
And now they have to feel your loss all over again.
"Protect the living."
You meant, from what happened to you.
We were betrayed.
Look what's become of us.
It's just how you see yourselves.
No.
It's how they'll see us too.
My wife, my daughter.
They'll be forced to...
No.
No.
You can talk to them.
You can help them through this.
And they'll remember you just as you were.
And then you can move on.
We're not going anywhere.
We've waited.
There's business to finish.
What is it that you want to finish?
You mean who.
If they went to the movies they should been back by now.
Or if they went to dinner...
I don't know where they are.
And I don't want to know.
Well, you should want to know
When your competition looks like this.
It's tough love, girlfriend.
And you gotta hear this.
Ok.
So what do you want me to do?
Get into the game!
You gotta fight fire with fire!
Look, it's not like I can throw on a bikini and mud wrestle for the guy.
Well, you can't just sit around and do nothing.
Does it look like I'm doing nothing?
No, it looks like you're helping another ghost.
Not just one ghost, a lot of them.
Ok, and they left loved ones behind.
And if I don't figure out who dumped their bodies...
I am not suggesting that this work isn't important.
I'm just saying that ghosts can keep.
I'm not so sure Sam can.
Yeah.
Neither am I.
Then why don't you do something about it?
Because nothing...
Nothing I can do will get him to remember me...
Or choose me.
All I can do is have faith.
That's all I have right now.
Faith.
It's so nice to meet you.
Carl gets so few visitors lately.
Not that we're surprised in his business.
Who wants to watch someone dying?
When did he close the funeral home?
When the cancer made it impossible for him to work.
Did he take care of your family?
No.
He...helped some friends of mine.
I keep wishing someone close might get through to him.
He doesn't listen to me anymore.
Get through to him?
He has so little time, and he's in such pain...
But he won't take the pills they give him.
I guess he's afraid it'll make the end come sooner.
But really, why go on like this?
Do you want me to talk to him?
Thank you.
Come on.
Carl?
My name is Melinda Gordon.
I don't know you.
What do you want?
I came to talk about the lake.
What lake?
Where the bodies are.
Where you put them.
Didn't you?
Part of me hoped I would die before this day.
And the other part?
What if they're waiting for me?
Why did you do it?
I thought I had no choice.
What do you mean?
The big mortuary chains kept calling to get me to sell.
But my great grandfather built that place from nothing.
And I was proud.
And I wanted a better price.
What happened?
What always happens.
They undercut me.
I couldn't compete.
The money ran out.
And when the furnace finally broke down,
I was desperate.
It's no excuse.
Sometimes I think...
The cancer is a punishment.
All this pain.
Your wife said there's pain medication that you won't take.
I feel evil.
Carl, you made a mistake.
You're not evil.
No.
No.
I feel evil around me.
Everywhere.
You're right.
Carl, they're here.
All the ghosts of the bodies that you threw into that lake.
Oh, no.
I see them.
Oh, please.
They're angry because of what you did.
But I can help.
Please just give me the names of all the people that you threw into the lake.
I can talk to their families.
I can help them heal.
To help them suffer, you mean.
Then they'll drop their anger, ok?
Not until he's suffered like we have.
You need to go into the light.
There's forgiveness there.
Carl, take your medicine.
I went back and looked where he told me to.
Back to the funeral home?
Wow, you're a glutton for gruesome.
Yeah well with Mary sunshine bunking at my house,
I already feel like formaldehyde girl.
Formaldehyde girl, that's funny.
Sorry.
Not funny.
Did you get the list of names?
Yeah.
I'm just trying to see if their I.D.s match what we found.
Hey, here's Paula's dad.
Was everybody on the list scheduled for cremation?
Cremation, cremation.
Yeah, it looks like they were meant to be...
Cremated.
I'll call you back.
How are you?
I'm fine.
Um, do you have a minute to talk about Sam?
Sure.
What about him?
Well, first of all, I want to apologize for imposing on you at your house and here at work now.
But I really...honestly, I didn't know who else to go to.
You know how you grow up imagining what it'll be like to be in love?
You picture your boyfriend, your husband.
And not just the good times...
But the fights and the problems, too.
Yeah.
Sure.
Could you ever have imagined something like this happening?
A guy that you loved just wakes up one day and then suddenly has no idea who you are?
No.
Never.
Really?
Not at all?
I...
I don't understand.
I guess I was so blown away by what happened to Sam that I really didn't notice it at first, but, uh...
Do you think it's a little odd that he's staying in your garage?
The same garage he was supposed to be doing designs for?
And where are the plans?
I haven't seen any of those.
What are you driving at?
When I first came here, my idea was a quick in and out.
Let Sam know that he was forgiven, maybe fill in a few memory blanks, and then say goodbye.
But now that I've seen who he is, this new Sam who wants kids, who's ready to settle down.
I...
I don't want to let him go.
What does that have to do with me?
That's what I'm trying to find out.
Shouldn't you be asking Sam?
You're not gonna make this easy, are you?
I thought I just did.
Thank you.
Mrs. Sessick, you startled me.
I apologize for coming by without calling.
I thought you'd want to know.
Carl died, a few hours ago.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what you said, but after you left, he seemed to change.
He relaxed, and decided to take his pain medicine.
After a few hours later, he took my hand.
Then his eyes opened wide, like he saw something amazing.
And that was it.
That look in his eyes, he must have just seen the face of his maker.
Don't you think?
That's a lovely notion.
Thank you so much, Melinda, for giving my husband peace.
Melinda?
Melinda!
How did I get here?
Oh, no!
No.
Melinda!
Melinda!
Melinda!
Oh, please god, anywhere but here.
For you, there's nowhere but here.
Forgive me.
Please, I'm begging you.
I'm begging you for forgiveness.
Please!
Please!
That's not what you'll find here.
Melinda!
Help me!
Tell me, how can I help you?
Mom, you wanted to talk about this.
No one is mad at you, Mom.
Speak for yourself.
When Edwin had his stroke, he was jogging a few miles from home.
He had no wallet, no ID.
So the hospital needed someone to say that it was him.
I went.
But I couldn't do it.
I just...
I couldn't look at him.
Paula was there by then, so she did it.
I made my own daughter go in and look at her dead father.
Mom, I didn't mind doing it.
There was no shame in what happened to him.
Why couldn't I just look at him?
Marlene, there's no shame in what you did, either.
Most people never see their deceased loved ones ever.
My daughter, she said that you knew something about Edwin's spirit.
He is stuck here?
He can't move on?
That's right.
He and the others spirits whose bodies were put in the lake,
They're earthbound, which means they haven't been able to cross over into the light.
Why not?
They don't want you to know what happened to them.
Out of shame.
That's why your husband tried to scare Paula away
- that night at the lake.
- Can we help them?
You might.
But right now, they're very angry.
Until the right moment comes...
If Edwin's ghost is still here, then that means he saw what I did when he died.
Please give me the chance to make it right.
Sam, please don't sneak up on me like that!
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
The door was open.
Look, I took Nikki to a hotel last night.
And, um, I just wanted to come by and see if you were ok.
I'm fine.
Are you sure?
Because you seemed a little tense, and frankly, so did Nikki.
No, really.
I'm fine.
Ok.
Well, then I'll go back to the hotel.
Why?
I mean, she's been here almost a week, so what are you going to do?
I don't know.
It's weird.
I feel things when I'm with her.
Nice things.
Her smell is familiar.
I recognize the feel of her hand when I hold it.
You know, it's comfortable.
Ok.
Melinda,not everybody can have what you had with your husband.
All right?
And given my track record,
I'm not sure I'd even be capable of that.
Of course you are.
Maybe you don't know me as well as you think.
And, look, if suddenly I feel like I should take a chance, you know, get some feelings back, maybe that's progress.
Maybe that's a good thing.
Maybe I should reach out with both hands.
All right.
Don't.
Don't what?
You can do better for yourself than
"comfortable"
or "maybe getting some feelings back."
Hold out for more.
What?
What am I holding out for?
Everything.
Hold out for everything.
You know, that's easy for you to say.
You had everything.
Who's there?
Carl, why are you here?
You said there would be forgiveness for me, you lied.
Did you look into the light?
I saw it, but they told me I couldn't go in.
Why not?
Because of my shame.
But you apologized.
I mean, you tried to make things right.
You can come out of the shadows now.
No, I can't.
They're looking for me.
They want me to go with them.
Those spirits are angry because of what you did.
Nobody can keep you from the light.
It's not them.
It's the others.
The others?
Spirits I've never seen before.
But they said they know you.
They know me?
They said they gave you a warning, but you didn't listen,
And something you cherished was lost.
And?
They said you believed in things that weren't right,
And trusting those things might hurt others...
And you.
Hello?
I'm here.
What do you want from me?
What did I do to offend you?
You did nothing.
Then why did you take my husband away?
Fate did that, not us.
You came to me and you said
That death would touch something that I loved.
And before I knew it, he was dead.
We just warned you to be careful.
Yeah. 'cause that's what you were doing was warning me
With all your lies and threats.
We don't lie or make threats.
You told Carl that he couldn't cross over.
The light has never denied anyone.
The light doesn't make the choice.
We each do.
We?
You mean you.
No, each of us for ourselves.
You wondered why these lake spirits stayed earthbound.
Well, it's the same reason that Carl did.
When the light opens, we each see ourselves reflected back.
So Carl's shame kept him here.
When spirits feel unworthy, sometimes we choose to stay back to work together for the living.
to make ourselves worthy.
What spirits stay back to do that?
I haven't seen any.
You're meeting four of them now.
You?
Why do you think we're still here?
So when Carl said that you asked him to join you...?
Carl?
They explained it to me, and I understand now.
This is what I want.
Are you sure?
Because they said it's your choice.
You can move on now.
I want to be one of them.
All right.
Will you help me fix the wrongs I did?
How?
By taking away their shame.
Thank you all for coming tonight.
We'd asked for family and friends,
And I just never realized how many friends we have.
- Hey, Eli.
- Hi, Sam.
I wasn't sure what to say,
So I asked my darling english major Paula for some help.
And she wrote down some thoughts for me.
Paula?
Don't be shy.
"Tonight we send our loved ones
"to where we thought they'd already gone.
"It seems like a detour,
"an embarrassing wrong turn.
"but the truth is, we never knew where they were going.
"We pretended we did, and that made us feel better.
"But every path leads to the unknown.
"some paths join others, and some split off on their own.
"we want to know where they all go, but maybe we shouldn't.
"maybe the more we insist on knowing,
"the less we'll be able to learn from life's twists and turns.
"I know what you're thinking,
"that the unknown is scary.
"But that's ok.
"we're human.
"maybe before we feel free,
"we're supposed to feel fearful.
"Maybe it means more that way.
"So let's all say goodbye now.
"and remember, that no matter what we're feeling,
"there's no shame.
No shame at all."
Melinda.
Oh, hey, Sam.
Nikki's downstairs.
She wanted to talk to you first.
First?
Nikki...
Melinda.
Heh, I...
I don't know why you've been so nice to me.
Letting me stay here in your house, when obviously...
Nikki...
It's not easy to say this,
We have our whole lives ahead of us.
And whatever you're feeling right now,
I hope you can understand why I did what I did.
Someday maybe you'll see that it was for the best.
You don't have to...
The weirdest part is Sam is this whole other guy.
He's a grown-up who realizes he wants more.
He talks about holding out.
And that's sort of amazing, because everything I've been holding out for,
He is ready to give.
And I don't know why, but I feel like I have to thank you for that.
No hard feelings, I hope.
You...you deserve every happiness.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks for coming.
Please, uh...
Just be happy.
Bye.
Bye.
Previously on Ghost Whisperer.
You move between the world of life and death.
You don't know the price.
What price?
No!
please, not you!
You have to cross over.
I don't want to.
I saw Jim's ghost step into Sam's body.
You're back!
Do I know you?
I see the same guy that you see,
Different hair, nose, eyes.
It's not Jim.
He's in there somewhere.
He just has to be.
You're not gonna tell me that you think I'm your husband reincarnated.
Because your are the only sane person I've met since I woke up.
It's not much.
But maybe you could help me finish my garage.
And you could live there while you do the work.
Just until you figure out your next move.
That's strange.
I've been hoping for a clue.
Something to tell me who I was.
I bought that less than a month ago.
Question is, who did I buy it for?
Sam?
Oh, my god.
It's true.
You don't know who I am, do you?
You must be Nicole.
The fiance?
She is not his fiance until he puts a ring on her finger.
Ok.
So where are they now?
I don't know.
He hasn't been home all day.
But he's with her?
Nikki.
I assume so.
How much time are they actually spending together?
Well, he's not working, and she's in town. so...
You didn't tell me they were spending whole days together.
What about the nights?
Is she still staying at the hotel?
Yes.
But they're spending all day together.
I'm really trying not to think about it.
I thought he was just trying to get in touch with her
So that he could explain to her what happened and then say goodbye.
Well, guess what.
They're saying hello.
I think I hear them.
No.
No.
No.
They're just gonna see you.
Oh, yeah.
That's a lot better.
Did she see me?
Can I?
- No.
- Hold on a second, Sam.
Uh, Melinda?
This is nuts.
Hi.
I am Delia.
Hi, Delia.
I'm Nikki.
I was looking for Melinda.
- Found it!
-Oh, gosh!
Nikki, Delia.
Have you met Delia?
Yes.
We did.
- I found it.
- Oh, great.
I'm so sorry we had to come all the way back here for just this.
No.
It's great.
Hey, Melinda.
Hi, Sam.
Uh, Nikki left her cell phone here.
So...
Right.
So...
I guess I'll be taking you back...
Well, actually that's why I wanted talk to you.
Melinda, the hotel that I booked is really nice.
It's fine and everything.
But I'm actually going to be spending a little bit more time than I originally planned.
And I really want to help Sam out as much as possible.
But I was only able to get a week off from work.
And I don't want to waste a minute that I could spend with him.
So, you are here.
And just if you didn't mind?
Mind?
Just 'cause obviously I couldn't stay with Sam.
Obviously.
No.
No.
Because we're really just getting to know each other.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Of course.
Really?
It's ok.
I can stay with you?
Sure.
- Great.
- Great.
Great.
We were walking around the house into the back.
And we get there.
And her grandmother and grandfather are there.
Oh, my god!
What are you doing?
Swimming.
Are you crazy?
What are you thinking?
Paula, come on, it's freezing!
No way!
She's going in.
- No.
- Catch me if you can!
Paula, don't go out there.
Oh, my God!
This is no£¡
Is she serious?
I'm not going in there, no way!
Paula, come back!
Mark, do something.
Paula, come on!
Wait!
Paula, come on!
It's freezing.
Seriously, come on!
Paula, come on, it's freezing.
Where is she?
Mark, look down.
- Fish, oh, gross.
- Oh, sick.
Paula, come back, ok?
Very funny, we get it.
Just come back, seriously.
Come on.
Come on, guys.
The water's great.
- Come on, Paula.
- All right, let's go.
Paula, come back.
Yeah, Paula.
It's not funny.
Seriously.
What was that?
Oh, my god.
I think there's...
Paula, look, I'm worried!
Paula!
Hold that.
She's not kidding, get her out of there!
Oh, my god, what's going on?
Get her out of there!
Oh, my god!
I think something's in there!
What is that?
!
What's the matter?
!
Hurry!
Oh, my god!
Swim this way, come on!
Mark, get her!
Oh, my god.
Hurry, hurry, get out!
What the hell was that?
- Here, give me your coat.
- Here, put this on.
Hey, it's ok.
You're ok now.
Just get me out of here.
Ok, I enjoy hiking like the next girl but why are we out here?
Getting your mind off the fact that your husband's dating your roomie.
She is not my roomie.
Ok?
I was in such a fog, I didn't know what I said yes to.
You're literally the girl that can't say no.
Should've made you very popular in high school.
Hey!
I can say "no."
Then what are you doing up here with me?
You said you needed a favor.
And I need a favor, too.
Ok?
Just please keep working with Sam...
No matter what it takes to get his memory back... before Nikki convinces him that he loves her.
Just please help us.
Of course.
I'll do whatever I can.
But now my favor.
Ew.
Do you smell that?
Dead fish everywhere.
A biologist at the university's doing some tests in the water.
But I thought you might get results faster.
Me?
A student of mine was up here swimming with some friends last night.
The whole experience freaked her out.
And not just the dead fish.
She said something was pulling her under.
She called it a presence.
Look, I know it's a long shot, but her father died earlier this year...
What was his name?
Edwin Hathaway.
He's here.
But do you hear that?
He's not alone.
Tell no one.
You're sure that's the ghost you saw?
I think so.
He responded to his name, anyway.
According to his obituary, he was 52.
Died of a stroke.
Well ,that's weird. 'cause ghosts usually appear one of two ways.
How they looked at the moment of their death, or how they looked in life.
Half these ghosts were rotting and decomposing.
It says here he died at the hospital.
What was he even doing at the lake?
Sometimes spirits gather.
I've seen it before.
But it's usually around the place of their death.
So this is where they all died?
You'd think, but I couldn't find any mass deaths in the vicinity.
Do you remember the plane crash a few years ago?
Yeah.
But that was almost 20 miles away.
So what are they doing there?
Keeping a big fat secret. "Tell no one."
Not a lot of subtext there.
Unfortunately, our instructions came a little bit late.
It's the biologist I told you about from the university.
He found heavy concentrations of a particular pathogen in the water.
The same pathogen found in the waters filled with bodies after hurricane Katrina.
So they're actually in there?
We'll know soon enough.
Health department's gonna dredge the lake.
Oh!
That's my appointment with Sam.
Well, go!
Go.
Get out of here.
What?
No, but I want it back.
Give it back!
You gave it to me.
I did not give it to you.
Give it.
Well, here look.
If you want it so badly.
Well, I just wanted to show you the article.
You always do this.
Hey, Eli.
Hey.
This is Nikki.
Hi.
It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
Ok.
Buddy.
Take care.
Well, listen.
Thank you so much for helping us out.
Oh, sure.
Um...
Is this going to be a joint session?
No, it's just me.
But we were running so late,
I didn't have a chance to take Nikki back...
It's fine.
Don't worry about it.
Not a problem.
I'll just grab a cup of coffee and meet you afterwards.
Thank you.
Past-life regression is just a kind of hypno-therapy.
With all due respect,
I just don't get how discovering that I had a past life
Is going to help me find this one.
All right.
The one that I lost.
It loosens the subconscious.
My subconscious?
Do you want to know what my subconscious is telling me?
It is telling me that something off.
Good, that's good.
Keep going.
Well, Nikki for example.
Ok?
She's beautiful.
She's smart.
She's blonde?
Blonde?
You're into blondes?
No.
That she has nice hair.
I remembered how it felt when I put my arm around her.
I mean, I remember how it smelled.
Well, then why can't I remember at all jerking her around for 10 years?
Maybe you just didn't want to marry her.
Ok.
So I was Mr. Can't Commit.
That's what everyone says.
You know what I think?
I think I remember wanting to get married.
I feel like that I had finally met the right person and then...
Tell me about her.
Well, that we wanted to have kids.
I mean, maybe we were even trying.
If that's true, then why isn't she telling me about that?
By she you mean...?
Nikki.
Who else?
You tell me.
Nikki can't be the only person you dated.
I want you to consider that maybe...just maybe...
There's someone else.
Wait, someone more important than the woman I spent half my adult life with?
Look, I just think that's kinda hard to imagine.
Look, I...
I really gotta talk to her.
But thanks.
This has been a big help.
Did they find anything?
Yeah.
Plenty.
A reporter said that it's 8 victims and counting.
Victims?
Is that what they are?
Paula's father died in a hospital.
Yeah, well that's what his obit said.
Maybe the paper got it wrong.
Anyway, it looks like they're going to be out here a while.
I don't hear anything.
They're here.
- So how'd it go with Sam?
- So-so.
As his shrink there's only so much I can tell you was.
what I almost told him.
Which was?
That he's Jim, your husband.
And anything he remembers about anyone he loved is you.
So he remembered something?
Just that he wanted to have kids.
Well, that's huge!
He thinks he wants to have them with her.
What am I going to do?
You've disturbed us.
All of us.
All we asked for was your silence.
I couldn't stop this if I wanted to.
It's the health department and the police.
They want answers.
Edwin, we know you have a family that cared about you.
They deserve to find out what happened to you.
Just tell us how we can help.
What is it that you want...
To protect the living.
From what?
Got another one.
What if they just all died of the same thing?
Some chemical, toxic-something?
In the lake?
I think the C.D.C. would say that the dead people are the problem.
And bothers me is not how they got there, but why they stayed.
- Your Latte, and the cappuccino.
- Thanks.
Well, they were just hanging around their bodies, right?
Yeah.
That's the upside.
That's an upside?
You know, it just means as spirits they weren't lured there by someone or something.
What do you mean?
Like some kinda ghost cult?
No.
More like the ghosts in the tunnels, you know, or the watchers.
The watchers?
A group of spirits who made all the threats about Jim.
They said that there would be a price to pay for what I can do.
Ahh.
There's Sam.
And no Nikki.
And he's heading toward the store.
Go.
Go be with him.
I don't know if I'm up for being his "good friend" right now.
Go!
All right.
Ok.
Sam.
Hey, Melinda.
That's funny.
I was just coming to see you.
Do you have to go back to work or can you talk for a bit?
- No.
I'm good.
- Great.
Thanks for, you know, letting Nikki stay with you.
Oh, yeah.
It's no problem.
I didn't even see her last night.
Yeah, she said you were still asleep when she came in.
And she was asleep when I left.
So.
Yeah.
She's a night person.
I mean, at least that's what she tells me.
I guess both of us were.
She'd do crosswords.
I would read the sports pages.
We'd stay up...
I hate crosswords.
I don't even remember.
Although, you know it's funny.
I do remember Ryan Howard's 2006 batting average... 3-13
Wait.
How do you know that?
You hear something enough times it kinda sticks.
Look, Melinda, what I wanted to ask you is,
How is it I remember something as stupid as sports trivia
But I don't remember something that
Nikki and I fought about for years?
In my head, I remember wanting to have kids.
And Nikki didn't?
No, she says she did.
So this big memory breakthrough I'm having is wrong.
And she's gotta be right.
I mean, she sounds right.
I'm being the typical guy, dragging my heels.
Not all guys are like that.
My husband wasn't.
I was always the one dragging my heels.
But Jim, he...
He wanted everything that you're remembering... which has to mean something, right?
What to me and Nikki?
No, to you.
It's none of my business.
But maybe you...maybe you shouldn't listen to what everyone else says, not about the stuff that really matters.
You know who you are.
When you start believing that, you'll get back to you, to...
To what?
To being the guy like your husband?
Committed, confident enough in himself,
In the world, to bring another human being into it?
But you see, I wasn't.
So pretending that I was is just wishful thinking.
Thank you so much for coming.
Of course, you seemed upset.
I don't understand.
I tell you something weird happened at the lake,
And then the next thing I know I get a call from the health department recommending that I should go on a course of antibiotics.
And then I turn on the TV and see them pulling dead bodies out of water that I was just swimming in.
I know this must be scary...
It's disgusting.
I wish I could make you feel better.
But unfortunately, I think I'm about to make you feel worse.
What are you talking about?
I need to ask you about your father.
First I need you to consider the possibility that parts of us may exist after our bodies have stopped.
Why?
Because I've talked to your father's ghost.
He was up at the lake.
He's there...
No, this is...this is crazy.
Paula, you said you felt a presence,
You think my dad is one of the corpses
They're pulling out of that water?
Look, I know this is hard to accept...
No, literally.
There's no way.
Why?
He's right here.
Your father was cremated...where?
Is this what you wanted?
To be cremated?
I was done with my body.
I wanted my family to be done with it, too.
I thought, somehow, it would be easier for them.
And now they have to feel your loss all over again.
"Protect the living."
You meant, from what happened to you.
We were betrayed.
Look what's become of us.
It's just how you see yourselves.
No.
It's how they'll see us too.
My wife, my daughter.
They'll be forced to...
No.
No.
You can talk to them.
You can help them through this.
And they'll remember you just as you were.
And then you can move on.
We're not going anywhere.
We've waited.
There's business to finish.
What is it that you want to finish?
You mean who.
If they went to the movies they should been back by now.
Or if they went to dinner...
I don't know where they are.
And I don't want to know.
Well, you should want to know
When your competition looks like this.
It's tough love, girlfriend.
And you gotta hear this.
Ok.
So what do you want me to do?
Get into the game!
You gotta fight fire with fire!
Look, it's not like I can throw on a bikini and mud wrestle for the guy.
Well, you can't just sit around and do nothing.
Does it look like I'm doing nothing?
No, it looks like you're helping another ghost.
Not just one ghost, a lot of them.
Ok, and they left loved ones behind.
And if I don't figure out who dumped their bodies...
I am not suggesting that this work isn't important.
I'm just saying that ghosts can keep.
I'm not so sure Sam can.
Yeah.
Neither am I.
Then why don't you do something about it?
Because nothing...
Nothing I can do will get him to remember me...
Or choose me.
All I can do is have faith.
That's all I have right now.
Faith.
It's so nice to meet you.
Carl gets so few visitors lately.
Not that we're surprised in his business.
Who wants to watch someone dying?
When did he close the funeral home?
When the cancer made it impossible for him to work.
Did he take care of your family?
No.
He...helped some friends of mine.
I keep wishing someone close might get through to him.
He doesn't listen to me anymore.
Get through to him?
He has so little time, and he's in such pain...
But he won't take the pills they give him.
I guess he's afraid it'll make the end come sooner.
But really, why go on like this?
Do you want me to talk to him?
Thank you.
Come on.
Carl?
My name is Melinda Gordon.
I don't know you.
What do you want?
I came to talk about the lake.
What lake?
Where the bodies are.
Where you put them.
Didn't you?
Part of me hoped I would die before this day.
And the other part?
What if they're waiting for me?
Why did you do it?
I thought I had no choice.
What do you mean?
The big mortuary chains kept calling to get me to sell.
But my great grandfather built that place from nothing.
And I was proud.
And I wanted a better price.
What happened?
What always happens.
They undercut me.
I couldn't compete.
The money ran out.
And when the furnace finally broke down,
I was desperate.
It's no excuse.
Sometimes I think...
The cancer is a punishment.
All this pain.
Your wife said there's pain medication that you won't take.
I feel evil.
Carl, you made a mistake.
You're not evil.
No.
No.
I feel evil around me.
Everywhere.
You're right.
Carl, they're here.
All the ghosts of the bodies that you threw into that lake.
Oh, no.
I see them.
Oh, please.
They're angry because of what you did.
But I can help.
Please just give me the names of all the people that you threw into the lake.
I can talk to their families.
I can help them heal.
To help them suffer, you mean.
Then they'll drop their anger, ok?
Not until he's suffered like we have.
You need to go into the light.
There's forgiveness there.
Carl, take your medicine.
I went back and looked where he told me to.
Back to the funeral home?
Wow, you're a glutton for gruesome.
Yeah well with Mary sunshine bunking at my house,
I already feel like formaldehyde girl.
Formaldehyde girl, that's funny.
Sorry.
Not funny.
Did you get the list of names?
Yeah.
I'm just trying to see if their I.D.s match what we found.
Hey, here's Paula's dad.
Was everybody on the list scheduled for cremation?
Cremation, cremation.
Yeah, it looks like they were meant to be...
Cremated.
I'll call you back.
How are you?
I'm fine.
Um, do you have a minute to talk about Sam?
Sure.
What about him?
Well, first of all, I want to apologize for imposing on you at your house and here at work now.
But I really...honestly, I didn't know who else to go to.
You know how you grow up imagining what it'll be like to be in love?
You picture your boyfriend, your husband.
And not just the good times...
But the fights and the problems, too.
Yeah.
Sure.
Could you ever have imagined something like this happening?
A guy that you loved just wakes up one day and then suddenly has no idea who you are?
No.
Never.
Really?
Not at all?
I...
I don't understand.
I guess I was so blown away by what happened to Sam that I really didn't notice it at first, but, uh...
Do you think it's a little odd that he's staying in your garage?
The same garage he was supposed to be doing designs for?
And where are the plans?
I haven't seen any of those.
What are you driving at?
When I first came here, my idea was a quick in and out.
Let Sam know that he was forgiven, maybe fill in a few memory blanks, and then say goodbye.
But now that I've seen who he is, this new Sam who wants kids, who's ready to settle down.
I...
I don't want to let him go.
What does that have to do with me?
That's what I'm trying to find out.
Shouldn't you be asking Sam?
You're not gonna make this easy, are you?
I thought I just did.
Thank you.
Mrs. Sessick, you startled me.
I apologize for coming by without calling.
I thought you'd want to know.
Carl died, a few hours ago.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what you said, but after you left, he seemed to change.
He relaxed, and decided to take his pain medicine.
After a few hours later, he took my hand.
Then his eyes opened wide, like he saw something amazing.
And that was it.
That look in his eyes, he must have just seen the face of his maker.
Don't you think?
That's a lovely notion.
Thank you so much, Melinda, for giving my husband peace.
Melinda?
Melinda!
How did I get here?
Oh, no!
No.
Melinda!
Melinda!
Melinda!
Oh, please god, anywhere but here.
For you, there's nowhere but here.
Forgive me.
Please, I'm begging you.
I'm begging you for forgiveness.
Please!
Please!
That's not what you'll find here.
Melinda!
Help me!
Tell me, how can I help you?
Mom, you wanted to talk about this.
No one is mad at you, Mom.
Speak for yourself.
When Edwin had his stroke, he was jogging a few miles from home.
He had no wallet, no ID.
So the hospital needed someone to say that it was him.
I went.
But I couldn't do it.
I just...
I couldn't look at him.
Paula was there by then, so she did it.
I made my own daughter go in and look at her dead father.
Mom, I didn't mind doing it.
There was no shame in what happened to him.
Why couldn't I just look at him?
Marlene, there's no shame in what you did, either.
Most people never see their deceased loved ones ever.
My daughter, she said that you knew something about Edwin's spirit.
He is stuck here?
He can't move on?
That's right.
He and the others spirits whose bodies were put in the lake,
They're earthbound, which means they haven't been able to cross over into the light.
Why not?
They don't want you to know what happened to them.
Out of shame.
That's why your husband tried to scare Paula away
- that night at the lake.
- Can we help them?
You might.
But right now, they're very angry.
Until the right moment comes...
If Edwin's ghost is still here, then that means he saw what I did when he died.
Please give me the chance to make it right.
Sam, please don't sneak up on me like that!
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
The door was open.
Look, I took Nikki to a hotel last night.
And, um, I just wanted to come by and see if you were ok.
I'm fine.
Are you sure?
Because you seemed a little tense, and frankly, so did Nikki.
No, really.
I'm fine.
Ok.
Well, then I'll go back to the hotel.
Why?
I mean, she's been here almost a week, so what are you going to do?
I don't know.
It's weird.
I feel things when I'm with her.
Nice things.
Her smell is familiar.
I recognize the feel of her hand when I hold it.
You know, it's comfortable.
Ok.
Melinda,not everybody can have what you had with your husband.
All right?
And given my track record,
I'm not sure I'd even be capable of that.
Of course you are.
Maybe you don't know me as well as you think.
And, look, if suddenly I feel like I should take a chance, you know, get some feelings back, maybe that's progress.
Maybe that's a good thing.
Maybe I should reach out with both hands.
All right.
Don't.
Don't what?
You can do better for yourself than
"comfortable"
or "maybe getting some feelings back."
Hold out for more.
What?
What am I holding out for?
Everything.
Hold out for everything.
You know, that's easy for you to say.
You had everything.
Who's there?
Carl, why are you here?
You said there would be forgiveness for me, you lied.
Did you look into the light?
I saw it, but they told me I couldn't go in.
Why not?
Because of my shame.
But you apologized.
I mean, you tried to make things right.
You can come out of the shadows now.
No, I can't.
They're looking for me.
They want me to go with them.
Those spirits are angry because of what you did.
Nobody can keep you from the light.
It's not them.
It's the others.
The others?
Spirits I've never seen before.
But they said they know you.
They know me?
They said they gave you a warning, but you didn't listen,
And something you cherished was lost.
And?
They said you believed in things that weren't right,
And trusting those things might hurt others...
And you.
Hello?
I'm here.
What do you want from me?
What did I do to offend you?
You did nothing.
Then why did you take my husband away?
Fate did that, not us.
You came to me and you said
That death would touch something that I loved.
And before I knew it, he was dead.
We just warned you to be careful.
Yeah. 'cause that's what you were doing was warning me
With all your lies and threats.
We don't lie or make threats.
You told Carl that he couldn't cross over.
The light has never denied anyone.
The light doesn't make the choice.
We each do.
We?
You mean you.
No, each of us for ourselves.
You wondered why these lake spirits stayed earthbound.
Well, it's the same reason that Carl did.
When the light opens, we each see ourselves reflected back.
So Carl's shame kept him here.
When spirits feel unworthy, sometimes we choose to stay back to work together for the living.
to make ourselves worthy.
What spirits stay back to do that?
I haven't seen any.
You're meeting four of them now.
You?
Why do you think we're still here?
So when Carl said that you asked him to join you...?
Carl?
They explained it to me, and I understand now.
This is what I want.
Are you sure?
Because they said it's your choice.
You can move on now.
I want to be one of them.
All right.
Will you help me fix the wrongs I did?
How?
By taking away their shame.
Thank you all for coming tonight.
We'd asked for family and friends,
And I just never realized how many friends we have.
- Hey, Eli.
- Hi, Sam.
I wasn't sure what to say,
So I asked my darling english major Paula for some help.
And she wrote down some thoughts for me.
Paula?
Don't be shy.
"Tonight we send our loved ones
"to where we thought they'd already gone.
"It seems like a detour,
"an embarrassing wrong turn.
"but the truth is, we never knew where they were going.
"We pretended we did, and that made us feel better.
"But every path leads to the unknown.
"some paths join others, and some split off on their own.
"we want to know where they all go, but maybe we shouldn't.
"maybe the more we insist on knowing,
"the less we'll be able to learn from life's twists and turns.
"I know what you're thinking,
"that the unknown is scary.
"But that's ok.
"we're human.
"maybe before we feel free,
"we're supposed to feel fearful.
"Maybe it means more that way.
"So let's all say goodbye now.
"and remember, that no matter what we're feeling,
"there's no shame.
No shame at all."
Melinda.
Oh, hey, Sam.
Nikki's downstairs.
She wanted to talk to you first.
First?
Nikki...
Melinda.
Heh, I...
I don't know why you've been so nice to me.
Letting me stay here in your house, when obviously...
Nikki...
It's not easy to say this,
We have our whole lives ahead of us.
And whatever you're feeling right now,
I hope you can understand why I did what I did.
Someday maybe you'll see that it was for the best.
You don't have to...
The weirdest part is Sam is this whole other guy.
He's a grown-up who realizes he wants more.
He talks about holding out.
And that's sort of amazing, because everything I've been holding out for,
He is ready to give.
And I don't know why, but I feel like I have to thank you for that.
No hard feelings, I hope.
You...you deserve every happiness.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks for coming.
Please, uh...
Just be happy.
Bye.
Bye.
NARRATOR:
There was a time when energy was a dirty word.
When turning on your lights was a hard choice.
Cities in brownout.
Food shortages.
Cars burning fuel to run.
But that was the past.
Where are we now?
How do we make the world so much better?
Make deserts bloom?
Right now, we're the largest producer of fusion energy in the world.
The energy of the sun trapped in rock, harvested by machine from the far side of the moon.
Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3 to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet.
Who'd have thought?
All the energy we ever needed, right above our heads.
The power of the moon.
The power of our future.

Otherwise, everything running smoothly, uh...
How are things down there?
You guys been to any good parties or anything?
Oh, thanks for the football feed.
It almost felt live...
Almost.
But, uh, 3 years is a long haul, you know.
(CHUCKLING) It's way, way, way too long.
I'm talking to myself on a regular basis.
So, um...

That's it.

Sam, is everything okay?
Sam?
What?
You don't seem like yourself today.
Has something happened?
You know...
Can you turn that off?
Please.
Jesus Christ.
Sam, it might help you to talk about it.
Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar Sat?
No, Sam.
What I understand is it's fairly low on the company's priority list right now.
You tell them to sort that out, you know what I'm talking about?
That's not...
I've only got 2 weeks, but it's not fair to whoever is coming up here next.
I will, Sam.
Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
No, come on, let's finish this.
Another one of those headaches.
Gerty, can you give me something for it?
GERTY:
Message received from your wife, Sam, via Jupiter link.
Fuck.
TESS:
Hi, Sam.
It's me.
I got your last message.
It was really good to hear your voice.
I miss you, too.
I know you're really lonely up there, but I think, in a lot of ways, it's been really good for you.
For both of us.
God, I hope you don't mind me saying that.
I'm proud of you.
Someone's got something to say.
What did you want to say to Daddy, baby?
(CHUCKLES)
(SOFTLY) Say, astronaut.
Astronaut, Daddy.

Daddy's an astronaut.
Say it really loudly.
Daddy's an astronaut.

Give Daddy a wave.

Kathy, could you...
I can't believe you're going to be home soon.
It's her birthday next month.
And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden.
Gerty.
We could pick it out together.
Sam.
I love you.
(SOFTLY) I love you.
And I miss you.
I miss you.
And I can't wait to see you.

GERTY:
Sam, can I ask how it happened?
I told you, I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand.
You saw something on TV?
Yeah, I saw something on TV that distracted me.
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you.
But when I came in, the TV wasn't on.
Perhaps you were imagining things.
Yeah, you think too much, pal.
(CLEARS THROAT)
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.

It's okay.
What's for breakfast?
The usual.
Mmm-hmm.
(EXCLAIMS)
2 weeks to go, Sam.
2 weeks to go, buddy.
Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.
Uh...

Sam, you're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.
Do you remember what happened?
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.
Do you remember me?
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.
That's good.
That's very good.
It's nice to see you awake again.
I'd like to keep you under observation here in the Infirmary for a few days and run some tests.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.
Okay, bro.
You're still very tired.
We can talk later.

GERTY: ...good working order, but we only have 2 working Harvesters now.
Come on, come on.
THOMPSON ON INTERCOM:
Yeah, well, that's no surprise, but it's not good enough.
Gerty, we're gonna have to find a way to ramp up production on Mark and John.
GERTY:
I know.
This is incredible.
How do you manage to fucking break a Harvester and an employee, all in the same day?
These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know.
Gerty, what's the status on Harvester 3?
How are the repairs going ahead?
Sam.
You're out of bed.
Yeah.
I wanted to stretch my legs.
Who was that?
We've been having some problems with the Lunar Sat, and our live feed seems to be down.
I was recording a video message for Central, updating them on your progress.
Sam, you need to stay in bed.
You're not ready to walk around yet.
All right.
Could you give me my sunglasses?
It's really bright in here.
Give me my...
Give me all my stuff, you know.
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.
Well, bring it in here.
Certainly.
Excellent, Sam.
(SIGHING) What, uh...
When can I get out of here, Gerty?
Sam, you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash.
This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment.
(GROANS)
So, what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?
Central has asked me to slow down the Harvesters to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back.
That's terrific.
It's fantastic.
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow, but it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
Let's try another test.
I don't want to try another test.
Please, Sam.
(ALARM BLEEPING)
SAM:
Hey, Gerty.
You know about this?
Matthew's got no velocity readout.
He's completely still.
He must have stalled.
Well, he's obviously stalled.
Don't you think we should tell Central?
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.
I'll pass on your message.
GERTY:
Message received from Earth via Jupiter link.
THOMPSON:
Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better.
OVERMEYERS:
Hey, we don't want you to take any unnecessary risks.
You're too important to us.
You're to stay put.
OVERMEYERS:
That is an order.
It's an order, Sam.
From Lunar.
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit to tend to the stalled Harvester and get the base back on its feet.
What the fuck is...
What the fuck...
GERTY:
I'm sorry, Sam.
What?
Sam, I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.
I don't appreciate that.
Being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.
(WHIRRING)
(EXPLODES)
(GRUNTS)
(ALARM BLARING)
SAM:
Gerty!
Gerty!
Gerty, come here!
What happened?
I don't know.
Meteorites.
There have been no meteorites, Sam.
Micro-meteorites maybe, I don't know.
Either way, there might be damage to the exterior shell.
I think you'd better...
You'd better let me go outside and take a look.
There is no damage to the exterior shell.
Well, it's not that I don't believe you, Gerty, but I mean, you know, this thing is springing leaks like an Acme fire hose.
You need to let me go outside and fix this problem, Gerty.
I can't let you go outside, Sam.
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.
Just let...
We'll keep it between you and me.
Okay, pal?
This thing is springing gas, let's go.
Come on.
Just to check the exterior shell.
Yeah, of course.
Okay, Sam.
Thank you.
Gerty.

Gerty!
Gerty!
I found him outside.
I found him outside.
(PANTING)
By the stalled Harvester.
Who is he?
Who is he?
We need to get him to the Infirmary.
You tell...
You tell me who that is.
You tell me who that is!
Sam Bell.
We need to get him to the Infirmary immediately.
Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?
Where...
Where am I?
The Infirmary.
You had an accident out by one of the Harvesters.
Do you remember?
I'm...
I'm thirsty.
I could get you some water.
(SOFTLY) I saw someone out there, Gerty.
I saw someone out there.
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries.
But all in all, the prognosis is good.
I'm happy to see you again.
Gerty.
Yes, Sam.
Is there someone in the room with us?
Sam, get some sleep.
You're very tired.
Spoke to Thompson today.
Now that you're up there, he's promising the world.
I think it was the right thing.
But...
It's just such a long time.
But I suppose there are things... (SNIFFLES)
You know, that needed to happen.
I...
I need time to think.
Listen, uh...
Sam, be safe, and I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.
(SIGHING) Gerty...
Gerty, what the...
What...
What the hell's going on?
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?
Sam, you're out of bed.
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?
Sam Bell.
Come on, come on, come on.
You are Sam Bell.
Sam, what is it?
It might help to talk about it.
Gerty, I don't understand what's happening.
(CRYING) I'm losing my mind.
We could run some tests.
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.
They don't know you were recovered alive from the accident...
Recovered alive?
What do you mean...
What are you talk...
Why didn't you report it to Central?
What are you talking about?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
Are you hungry?
(SIGHS)
2 weeks, 2 weeks... 2 weeks, 2 weeks, 2 weeks, 2 weeks...
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
Just getting my slippers.
I'm using them.
No.
What?
These are mine.
These are mine.
(THUDDING)
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.
I'm Sam Bell, too.
What?
We've got that going for us.
Why, uh...
How long have you...
What?
How long have you been here?
About a week.
So, how you doing?
What?
How are you doing?
(SCOFFS)
How am I...
How am I doing?
How do you think I'm doing?
Good job.
Uh...
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the Harvesters?
Harvesters are fine.
It's affected them.
Here, talking to a clone, that's slightly troubling.
(CHUCKLING) I'm not a clone.
I'm not a clone.
You're the clone.
Okay, Sam, you're not a clone.
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Hey.
Hey, Ridley, you're not looking too good.
(SHUSHING) Butt out of this.
Davey, I'm talking to Ridley.
How you doing, pal?
Hey, I think Kathryn likes you.
I think she likes you, pal.
You're not looking too good, my friend.
Sorry you're not feeling too well.
SAM 2:
You talking to yourself?
I'll just get you all fixed up.
How long have you been here?
Oh, I guess about 3 years.
Almost 3 years.
Listen, I, uh...
I wanted to thank you.
I wanted to thank you for... (STAMMERING) If it wasn't for you,
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover.
You saved my life and, uh...
(SIGHS) Hey, I know this is weird, you know.
(CHUCKLES) I'm real lonely, you know...
I just want to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?
(SIGHS)
Maybe later.
(SIGHS)
What are you looking at?
You look just like me.
It's incredible.
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?
We look like each other, I guess.
Hey, you know... (CHUCKLES)
It's weird for me, too, you know.
Fuck.
Hey.
Hey, you wanna play some Ping-Pong?
No.
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.
What's the score?
2-18.
Okay.
Do you want me to show you how to hold that?
No.
No, I...
I don't need you to show me how to hold it.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Should we, uh...
Should we play?
Yeah.
(EXCLAIMS) God!
Shit!
19-2.
Yeah.
Do you want a stick of gum?
You know, we could approach this in a different way.
Remember when we went to flight school...
What are you doing?
I'm fixing the net.
It's very Zen, Ping-Pong.
You have to just relax.
How long did it take you to do that?
Well, I don't remember doing all of it.
I remember doing the church, and the Salvation Army, and a few of the people.
My mind's been acting kind of weird lately.
That's Fairfield, right?
There's the Town Hall.
Fairfield?
Of course, you know about Fairfield.
Yeah, there's Tess and Eve.
Do you know Tess?
Yeah.
I know Tess.
You know about Eve, right?
What?
I had a...
We had a girl.
Eve.
Isn't she beautiful?
She's my little monkey.
She's our little monkey.
High-five.
(CHUCKLES)
She might be the milkman's, but she's beautiful.
GERTY:
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.
Oh, shit.
OVERMEYERS:
Greetings, Sam.
THOMPSON:
How's our man?
You feeling better?
(COUGHS) You have enough rest?
(CHUCKLING) Okay, you resting up, Sam?
You better be, you bastard.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
We've got some good news.
The Jupiter Program had to be put on hiatus, so we got a few pairs of hands for you.
So, what we've managed to do is secure you a Rescue Unit ahead of schedule.
Rescue Unit Eliza.
Now, Eliza has been stationed on Goliath 19 for the last 2 months.
Now we expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.
So commence to jump for joy.
You're about to be back in work.
In the meantime, hang in there.
Rest up.
You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out.
They're sending a Rescue Unit?
Why?
Why are they sending a Rescue Unit?
To fix the stalled Harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.
Well, then I'm going back.
That's it for me.
(SCOFFS)
What?
Is that what you really think?
(CHUCKLING) Yeah.
I've got a contract.
I'm going home.
You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.
Hey, I'm going home.
You're not going anywhere.
You know, you've been up here too long, man.
You've lost your marbles.
What, do you think Tess is back home, waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie?
What about the original Sam?
Huh?
I'm the original Sam!
I'm Sam fucking Bell!
Hey, hey.
Whoa.
Me!
Me!
Gerty, am I a clone?
Are you hungry?
SAM 2:
Hey, hey.
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.
I'm in the same boat, asshole.
(EXHALES)
Listen.
What about the other clones?
What?
We might not be the first 2 to be woken up.
You said that model had already been started when you got here.
Well, who started it?
There might be others up here right now.
Think about it.
How did I get up here so quickly after your crash?
I don't want to talk about it.
They didn't ship me in from Central.
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.
I don't know what you're smoking.
Why would they do that?
That's ridiculous.
Impossible.
I bet there's some kind of secret room.
Secret room?
(LAUGHS)
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?
You're the one who's lost your marbles.
I've been here for 3 years, man.
I know every inch of this base.
I know how many...
How much dirt's between those wall panels over there.
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?
Look, it's a company, right?
They have investors.
They have shareholders.
Shit like that.
What's cheaper?
Spending time and money training new personnel, or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job.
It's the far side of the moon.
The cheap fucks haven't even fixed the communications satellite yet.
Tess would know.
She would have told me.
Hey, Geppetto, wake up.
You really think they give a shit about us?
They're laughing all the way to the bank.
Tess would know.
She would have told me...
What do you get off fucking sitting there, sulking like a little fucking boy!
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Wake up!
I bet there's some area that we don't know about.
And I'm gonna find it.
Yeah, maybe you'll find some buried treasure, too.
(MACHINE BEEPING)
(CLATTERING)
Fuck!
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Eliza arrival estimated 13 hours.
You found your secret room?
Just put that anywhere.
Now, that's a good idea.
That's...
That's where I keep my leprechauns.
Get out of the way.
What?
Why?
I want to look underneath that model.
You're not touching this model.
Get the fuck out of the way.
Listen, why don't you relax, okay?
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?
Go read the encyclopedia or something?
You're a tough guy now?
What, are you going to stab me?
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.
I'm a lover.
I'm not a fighter.
Put the knife down.
Hey, hey, just...
I want to look underneath there.
Put the knife down.
No.
I'm not gonna give you the knife.
Just get out of the way.
Take it easy 'cause I...
Let go of the knife.
Don't ever tell me what to do, okay?
(GROANING)
Just...
You let go.
Let go of the knife.
Don't be an asshole.
Don't push me.
Don't push me, motherfucker.
Let go.
Let go.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
Fucking told you to let go of the goddamn knife.
(GRUNTS)
(GROANING) Little fucking... (GRUNTS)
Fucking little girl, man!
(YELLS)
God damn it!
SAM:
No!
No!
God damn it.
What did I tell you?
(GRUNTING)
(YELLS)
(CHOKING) Okay, okay...
You gonna stop?
You gonna stop?
Okay, okay.
Jesus!
Fuck... (GRUNTS)
Fuck me.
What the fuck?
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.
My fucking eye, man.
Let me see.
That's a lot of blood.
Get off of me!
That's enough.
(WOMAN CHATTERING ON TV)
(PEOPLE LAUGHING)
Well, appealing...
Nice feet, sexy...
Hello, Sam.
Sam, is everything okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, we had a fight, me and the other guy, the other...
He's very angry, you know.
Know what he did?
He flipped my entire model over.
Know how much work I put into that thing?
938 hours.
938 hours, yeah, exactly.
938 hours, really?
Approximately.
He's got a problem.
He scares me, Gerty.
What is it about Sam that scares you?
How he flies off the handle.
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.
(SIGHING)
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...
She left me.
Tess left me, for 6 months.
She moved back in with her parents.
I know.
She gave me a second chance.
I promised her I'd change.
You have changed, Sam.
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here, I've sent Tess...
I've sent her over a hundred video messages.
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
What about the messages she sent to me?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
Gerty...
Gerty...
Am I really a clone?
When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.
You woke up in the Infirmary.
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.
I kept you under observation and ran some tests.
I remember, yeah.
I remember that.
Sam, there was no crash.
You were being awakened.
It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests to establish mental stability and general physical health.
Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA can have considerable impact on...
What about...
What about Tess?
They are memory implants, Sam.
Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell.
I am very sorry.
Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal.
Can I prepare you something?
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Rescue arrival estimated 11 hours.
Okay, sweetheart?
Yeah, I'm staring into space.
Get it?
Funny.
Hey...
Thanks for this.
This is good.
This is cozy.
How's the...
How's the nose?
Much better, thank you.
I went haywire before, you know, I...
I lost it and I'm...
I'm sorry about that.
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.
I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I got a...
I got a temper.
I gotta do something about it.
Yes, you do.
(WALKING ON SUNSHINE PLAYING)
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.
Can you turn that off?
(MUSIC STOPS) Listen...
Listen, I wasn't supposed to...
I'm... (WALKING ON SUNSHINE PLAYING)
Huh?
I'm trying to tell you something.
Can you turn... (MUSIC STOPS)
Lunar instructed Gerty to...
WOMAN: (SINGING) I used to think
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you... (LAUGHS) ?
Maybe you loved me
Now, baby, I'm sure
(EXCLAIMS) Tough guy.
Listen to me...
You look like a...
What?
Radioactive tampon.
I wasn't supposed to...
Or like a banana with a yeast infection.
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there.
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened,
I walked in on Gerty talking to Central.
He was having a live conversation.
A live conversation?
Yeah.
How do you know it was a live conversation?
Because it was a back and forth exchange.
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.
It was live, man.
It was live.
That's impossible.
There was a flare.
It fried the satellite.
The satellite's fine.
They don't want us to be able to contact Earth.
They lied to us.
They've been lying to us since the beginning.
They...
They've been lying to us since forever.
If the satellite works, how are they blocking the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base.
From where then?

Holy shit.
I think I see something, too.
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Approaching Station 1.
SAM 2:
You see what I see?
Looks like an antenna or a pylon or something.
I think it's the jammer.
(LAUGHS) I knew it.
This is why we're not getting the live feed.
(SAM GRO ANING) Sam?
Can you hear me?
SAM:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I hear you.
Yeah.
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm gonna head back to the base.
Okay, I'm gonna stay out here for a little while.
I'm gonna see if there's any more of these things.

I go first.

Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.
Why are there so many of them?
GERTY:
Sam, can I help you with something?
Not now, Gerty.
I'm okay.

Why did you help me before?

Doesn't that go against your programming or something?

She passed away some years ago.
Um...
Um...
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Eve?
Yeah?
Hi.
Hi, Eve.
How old...
How old are you now?
I'm 15.
Do I know you?
Oh, sweetheart.
How did Mommy die, sweetheart?
How did Mommy die?
Dad?
ORIGINAL SAM:
Yeah?

There's someone asking about Mom.

Well, you don't hold it like you're trying to stab somebody.
For God sakes.
Here, give me that.
(SIGHING)
You gotta hold it closer to the blade, you see?
Watch what I'm doing.
Why are you shaking?
You carve out, like that.
(COUGHING)
That's it.
It's freezing in here.
Well, you're...
You're sitting under the fridge.
What's going on with you?
Are you all right?
Yeah, that crew they're sending in, if they...
If they find us awake at the same time, you know...
They're not gonna let us live.
You know that, right?
You know, their return vehicle is...
Hey.
Hey, hey...
Are you okay?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Maybe you should lay down for a while, take some tranquilizers or something.
SAM:
If I take some tranquilizers, I'll never wake up again.
(COUGHING)
You'll be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
(LAUGHING)
I'm freezing.

Hey.
I'm really scared.

Hello?

Um, is this the Bell residence?
This is the Bell residence.

There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Gerty, I need to talk to you.
Of course, Sam.
How can I help?
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.
That hidden room, Gerty.
The lower deck is out of bounds to awakened clones, Sam.
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.
New clones can only be awakened once a 3-year contract is completed.
Gerty, if we don't wake up a new clone, me and the other Sam will die, we will be killed.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Do you want me and the other Sam to be killed?
That is the last thing I want.
Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.
Okay, pal?

Hey.
Hey.
What's going on?
You okay?
Don't...
Don't touch him.
(WHISPERING) Come here.
He's not conscious yet.
Gerty and I just woke him up.
Why?
What's going on?
Come on.
Come on outside.
SAM 2:
When the rescue unit arrives, they're gonna expect to find a body in that crashed rover.
That guy?
(LAUGHING)
What, are you going to kill him?
Jesus Christ.
What are you doing?
Zip up your fly.
You're burning up.
You sweat like a pig.
(COUGHING) Put your hat on.
Put your hat on.
I'm hot.
Hey, if we go through with this,
I'm gonna need your help hauling him out to the crash site.
(COUGHING) What about us?
Eliza arrives, finds you and me as a welcome party...
They're not going to find you and me as a welcome party.
They're gonna find me, and you're going back to Earth before they get here.
In that helium-3 launcher.
I did the math.
You're gonna pull some Gs, but it should...
It should be fine.
You'll be all right.
You're going home.
You did your 3 years.
I can't expect you to stick around.
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.
I saw that VP.
She's beautiful.
She's gorgeous.
We did good.
High-five.
Go for it.
You go for it.
(COUGHING)
You comfy?
No.
What?
No!
What if I have to take a shit?
(LAUGHS) Just...
You'll have to hold it in, pal.
For 3 days?
That's the way it goes.
Need a hand?
No.
Fuck off.
All right.
No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.
(COUGHING)

Hey.
We need to do this.
We wait too long and he's gonna be conscious.

Fuck me.
What's going on with you?
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.
I don't think I can move my legs.
Besides, look at me... (LAUGHING) I meet Eve now, I'd scare the crap out of her.
What are you talking about, man?
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.
You're not going to kill anybody.
We can't kill anybody.
You can't.
I know you can't, 'cause I can't.
You go.
You're a good guy, Sam.
It was a good plan, you know.
You just picked the wrong guy to go back.
(SIGHING)
You...
You sure about this?
Yeah.
(STAMMERING) You should travel, you know.
I always wanted to do that.
(EXHALES)
Amsterdam, or...
Yeah, you know, I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe Mexico.
Aloha.
Bring me back a pina colada, all right, bro?
(CHUCKLES)
Hey...
Johnny Spaceman.
You remember Tess came in for that interview?
She was so beautiful.
She wasn't the best candidate, but it didn't matter.
I had to give her the job.
I wanted to keep her in the country.
BOTH:
She was going back to Ireland.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
You knew you had to take a chance, so you called her.
You were terrified.
You wrote that whole speech for her answering machine.
But you didn't need it, 'cause she picked up the phone.
She was, like, why is he calling me?
The internship's over.
Why's he calling me at home?
(LAUGHS)
I asked her if she wanted to go get like an ice cream cone or something dorky like that.
She said, "Let's get a drink."
I said, "Okay.
What do you..."
(LAUGHS)
Sam, this is not going to work.
What?
Why?
I've recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening.
If anyone were to check my memory cache, it would put you in considerable danger.
(SIGHING)
You could erase my memory banks.
I could reboot myself once you have departed.
Are you okay with that?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
I want to help you.
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Eliza arrival estimated 24 minutes.
GERTY:
Sam.
Hey.
(PANTING)
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot the moment that I've launched.
I understand, Sam.
Then you should be okay.
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.
Thanks, Gerty.
You gonna be okay?
Of course.
The new Sam and I will be back to our programming as soon as I've finished rebooting.
Gerty, we're not programmed.
We're people.
Understand?

Hey, Sam?
You okay, buddy?
Cavalry's here.
Where am I?
GERTY:
You're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?
(WHEEZING)
MAN ON RADIO:
...made contact.
Yeah.
Yeah, Eliza?
He ain't going nowhere.
Bag him up and we'll get started on repairs to the Harvester.
Dwight, I'm gonna need the...

Clone 6, the clone of Sam Bell, has been giving evidence at CAA's Board of Directors meeting in Seattle...

You know what?
He's one of 2 things.
He's a wacko or an illegal immigrant.
Either way, they need to lock him up.
Line 2.
There was a time when "energy" was a dirty word.
When turning on your lights was a hard choice.
Cities in brownout,... food shortages, cars burning fuel to run.
But that was the past.
Where are we now?
How do we make the world so much better?
Make deserts bloom!
Right now, we are the largest producer of fusion energy in the world.
The energy of the sun, trapped in rock, harvested by machine from the far side of the moon.
Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3... to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet.
Who would have thought that all energy we ever needed is right above our heads?
The power of the moon... the power of our future.
Rock and roll!
08:32, Pacific Time.
All harvesters running smoothly.
Readouts are as follows:
Matthew...14.6 miles.
Mark...16.8 miles.
I don't—
Hey, Gerty?
Gerty?
Wake up!
Good morning, Sam!
We have got a live one on Mark!
I'm going to go out now and rope her in.
OK, Sam.
I want chocolate.
I think you're sweet enough.
You don't need chocolate.

Sam Bell, reporting to Central... 10:14, Pacific Time.
I have a full container full of helium-3, ready to roll.
By the time this message reaches you, it should be in transit.
Otherwise, everything running smoothly...
How are things down there?
You guys been having any... good parties or anything?
Oh, thanks for the...(stumbles) for the football feed!
It almost felt live.
Almost!
Three years is a long haul.
You know— It's way, way, way, way, way too long!
I'm talking to myself... on a regular basis!
So...
Time to go home, you know what I mean?
That's it, over and out!
Rock and roll, God bless America!
I can do that for you, Sam.
God damn it!
I said I got it!
Why don't you listen to me?
Package ready for launch.
Sam, is everything OK?
- Sam?
- What?
You don't seem like yourself today.
- Is something wrong?
- No.
Can you turn that off, please?
Jesus Christ!
Sam, it might help you to talk about it.
Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar-Sat?
the setting of monthly satellite dishes?
No, Sam.
From what I understand, it is fairly low... on the company's priority list right now.
You tell them to sort that out.
You know what I'm talking about?
That's not—
I've only got two weeks!
But it's not fair for whoever's coming up here next.
I will, Sam.
Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
No, come on;
let's finish this.
Got one of those headaches...
Can you—can you give me something for it?
[Gerty]:
Message received from your wife, Sam... via Jupiter link.
Fuck!
Hi, Sam!
It's me.
I got your last message.
It was really good to hear your voice.
I miss you, too!
I know you're really lonely up there...
But I think...
In a lot of ways.... it's been really good for you.
For both of us.
God, I hope you do not mind me saying that.
I'm proud of you!
Someone has got something to say.
What did you want to say to daddy, baby?
Say "astronaut".
Astronaut.
(Sam chuckles)
He is an astronaut!
(whispering) Say daddy's an astronaut.
Say it really loud.
Daddy's an astronaut.
Clever girl!
Wave!
Give daddy a wave!
Kathy, could you—
I can't believe you're going to be home soon.
It's her birthday next month...
And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden.
- Gerty!
- We could work at it together.
Sam...
I love you!
(softly) I love you!
- And I miss you!
- (softly) I miss you!
And I can't wait to see you.
OK, sweetheart...
Goodbye.
Hi, Doug!
You're really full of yourself, aren't you, Doug?
Kath...
(tsks) Not good!
[Television]:
What about Dumbo?
... (continues)
(groans) Fuck!
God damn it!
Fuck!
Wasn't kind of smart, was it, Gerty?
- Sam, can I ask how it happened?
- I told you.
I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand.
You saw something on TV?
Yeah, I something on TV that distracted me.
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you... but when I came in, the TV wasn't on.
Perhaps you were imagining things?
Yeah, you think too much, pal.
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.
(Alarm clock blares Chesney Hawkes' "The One and Only")
Shut up!
Good morning, Gerty.
Good morning, Sam.
- How are you today?
- Fine!
Fine.
- How is the hand?
- Oh, it's a little sore!
A little sore.
It's OK.
- What's for breakfast?
- The usual.
Mmhmm.
- Two weeks to go, Sam.
- Two weeks to go, buddy!
Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.
But, thank you.
Thank you, Gerty.
You're welcome, Sam.
08:19, Pacific Time.
Readouts are as follows...
Matthew ... 9.8 miles.
Mark is less—
- 9...
- Hey, Gerty!
Rock and roll!
Mark—umm...
Mark is 11 miles on the button.
Luke is a little twitchy today.
Hey, Gerty.
Looks like we have got a live one out on Matthew.
I'm going to go out in a few minutes.
I'm just going to finish my coffee, OK?
OK, Sam.

- Sam, you're in the infirmary.
You had an accident.
Do you remember what happened?
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.
Do you remember me?
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.
That's good.
That is very good.
It's nice to see you awake again.
I'd like to keep you under observation here in the infirmary for a few days...
And run some tests.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.
- OK, pal.
- You're still very tired.
We can talk later.
Hello?
(Distant conversation) [Gerty]:
The new Sam is in reworking order.
But we only have two working harvesters now.
[Overmeyers]: (sarcastically) Yeah, well,what a surprise!
[Thompson]:
Gerty, we're going to have to find a way to ramp up production.
[Gerty]:
I know.
[Overmeyers]:
This is incredible!
But how do you manage to destroy... a fucking rover, a harvester and an employee all on the same day?
These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know.
[Thompson]:
Gerty, what is the status on Harvester 3?
How do the repairs look on... (stopped)
- Sam, you're out of bed.
- Yeah.
I wanted to stretch my legs a bit.
Who was that?
We've been having some problems with the Lunar-Sat...
And our live feed seems to be down.
I was recording a video-message for Central...
Updating them on your progress.
Sam, you need to stay in bed.
You're not ready to walk around yet.
Can you bring me my sunglasses?
It's really bright in here.
Give me some...
Give me all my stuff, you know?
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.
- Well, bring them in here.
- Certainly.
Excellent, Sam.
What...
When can I get out of here, Gerty?
Sam, you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash.
This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment.
So what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?
Central has asked me to slow down the harvesters... to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back.
(sarcastically) That's terrific!
That's fantastic!
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow.
But it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
Let's try another test.
I don't want to try another test!
Please, Sam.
Hey, Gerty?
Do you know about this?
Matthew has got no velocity readout.
He is completely still.
He must have stalled.
Well, he has obviously stalled.
Don't you think we should tell Central?
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.
I will pass on your message.
[Gerty]:
Message received from Earth via Jupiter link.
[Thompson]:
Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better.
[Overmeyers]:
Yeah, we don't want you to take any unnecessary risks.
- You are too important to us.
- You stay put.
[Overmeyers]:
That is an order.
[Thompson]:
It's an order, Sam...
from Lunar.
[Overmeyers]:
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit... to tend to the stalled harvester and get the base back on its feet.
- (under breath) Fuck is with...?
What the fuck?
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- What?
- Sam...
I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.
I don't appreciate that—being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.
Gerty!
Gerty!
Gerty, come here!
- What happened?
- I do not know, maybe a meteorite...
There have been no meteorites, Sam.
Micrometeorites, maybe.
I do not know.
Either way, there might be damage to the exterior shell.
I think you better...you better let me go outside and take a look.
There is no damage to the exterior shell.
Well, it's not that I don't believe you, Gerty...
But, you know, this thing is springing leaks like an Acme firehose.
You need to let me go outside and fix this problem, Gery.
I can't let you go outside, Sam.
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.
Just let...
We'll keep it between you and me, ok, pal?
This thing is leaking gas.
Let's go!
Come on...
Just to check the exterior shell?
- Of course.
- OK, Sam.
Thank you.
Gerty!

I found him outside!
I found him outside!
Near one of the stalled harvesters...
Who is he?
We need to get him to the infirmary.
Not until you tell me who that is.
You tell me who that is!
Sam Bell.
We need to get him to the infirmary immediately.
Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?
Where—Where am I?
The infirmary.
You had an accident out by one of the harvesters.
Do you remember?
No, I'm—I'm thirsty.
I could get you some water.
I saw someone out there, Gerty.
I saw someone out there.
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries.
But, all in all, the prognosis is good.
I'm happy to see you again.
Gerty?
Yes, Sam?
Is there someone in the room with us?
Sam, get some sleep.
You're very tired.
[Tess]:
Spoke to Thompson today.
They are in Europe, they—he's promising the world.
I think it was the right thing.
But...it's just such a long time.
I suppose there are—there are things...
You know...that needed to happen.
I—I need time to think.
Listen...umm...
Sam...
Be safe...
And I'll...
I'll talk to you soon.
Goodbye.
Gerty?
Gerty, what the fu—what the hell's going on?
Who is the guy— Who is the guy in the rec room?
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?
Sam, you're out out of bed.
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.
Who is the guy?
Who is the guy in the rec room?
- Sam Bell.
- Come on, come on, come on!
You are Sam Bell.
Sam, what is it?
It might help to talk about it.
I don't understand what is happening...
I think I'm starting to lose my mind.
We can run some tests.
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.
They do not know that you were recovered alive from the accident.
"Recovered alive"?
What do you mean?
Why did not you report it to Central?
What are you talking about?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks... (exhales)
- I'm just getting my slippers...
- I'm using them...
I'm using them.
These are mine.
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.
I'm Sam Bell, too!
- What?
- Well, we've got that going for us.
Why...?
How long have you been...
What?
How long have you been here?
About a week.
- So how are you doing?
- What?
How are you doing?
"How am I doing?"
How do you think I'm doing?
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the harvesters?
Harvesters are fine.
It's the fact that I'm here talking to a clone that's slightly troubling.
(chuckles) I'm not a clone.
I'm not a clone!
- You're the clone.
- Okay, Sam.
You're not a clone.
Hey, hey...
You're not looking too good.
Sh!
Butt out of this!
I'm not even talking to you, pal.
I think that Katherine likes you.
I think she likes you a bit.
You're not looking too good, my friend.
I hope you're not feeling too bad.
Are you talking to yourself?
- Let's just get you fixed up...
- How long have you been here?
Well, it's about...three years.
For almost three years.
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank y—.
I wanted to thank you for, um...
If it wasn't for you, I'd—I...
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover.
You saved my life.
Hey, I know this is weird, you know...?
I'm real lonely, you know, I...(puffs)
I just wanted to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?
Maybe later.
- What are you looking at?
- You look just like me; it's incredible.
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?
We look like each other, I guess.
I don't know.
Hey, you know...(chuckles)
It's weird for me, too, you know?
(stutters)
Hey?
Hey, you want to play some ping-pong?
No.
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.
- What's the score?
- 2-18.
OK
- Do you want me to show you how to hold that?
- No...
No, I...
I don't need you to show me how to hold it!
OK, OK
- Yeah, "OK"
- Should we play?
- Yeah!
Fuck!
God!
Shit!
19-2.
Yeah...
You want a...
You want a stick of gum?
You know...
You should approach this in a different way.
- Remember when you went to flight school?
- What are you doing?
I'm fixing the net.
It is very Zen with ping-pong, you have to just to relax.
How long did it take you took to do that?
Oh, I don't remember doing all of it.
I remember doing the church...
and the Salvation Army.
And doing the people.
My mind has been acting kind of weird lately.
That's Fairfield, right?
There's the town hall.
Fairfield, that's right...
Yeah, that's Tess...and Eve...
You...
You know Tess?
Yeah, I know Tess.
- You know about Eve, right?
- What?
I had a...
We had a girl...
Eve.
Ain't she beautiful?
She's my little monkey.
She's our little monkey.
High five!
She might be the milkman's, but she's beautiful.
[Gerty]:
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.
Oh shit!
- [Overmeyer]:
Greetings, Sam.
- [Thompson] How's our man?
You feeling better?
- [Overmeyer]:
Have you had enough rest?
- [Thompson]:
You resting up, Sam?
(chuckling) You better be, you bastard.
[Overmeyer]:
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
We've got some good news.
[Thompson]:
The Jupiter program had to be put on hiatus, so we've got a few pairs of hands for you.
[Overmeyer]:
So what we've manage to do is cue you a rescue unit ahead of schedule.
[Thompson]:
Rescue Unit Eliza.
[Overmeyer]:
Eliza has been stationed on Goliath-19 for the last 2 months.
[Thompson]:
We expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.
[Overmeyer]:
So commence to jump for joy!
[Thompson]:
You're about to be back at work.
In the meantime, hang in there.
Rest up.
[Overmeyer]:
You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out!
They're sending a rescue unit?
Why?
Why are they sending a rescue unit?
To fix the stalled harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.
Well, then I'm going back.
That's it for me.
- What?
- Is that what you really think?
Yeah.
I've got a contract!
I'm going home.
- You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.
- Hey, I'm going home!
- Home!
- You're not going anywhere.
You know, you've been up here too long, man.
You have lost your marbles.
What do you think, Tess is back home, waiting on the sofa in lingerie?
What about the original Sam?
Huh?
I am the original Sam!
- I am Sam-fucking-Bell.
- Hey!
Me!
Me!
Gerty, am I a clone?
Are you hungry?
Hey, hey...
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.
I'm in the same boat, asshole.
Listen...
- What about the other clones?
- What?
We might not be the first two to have been woken up.
You said that that model had already been started when you got here.
Well, who started it?
There might be others up here right now.
Think about it.
How did I get up here so quickly after your crash?
- I don't know...
- They didn't ship me in from Central.
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.
I don't know what you're smoking.
Why would they do that?
That's ridiculous.
Impossible.
I bet there's some kind of secret room.
"Secret room"?
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?
You know, you are the one that has lost your marbles.
I've been here three years, man.
I know every inch of this base.
And I know how many dirt is between those wall panels over there.
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?
Look, it's a company, right?
They have investors, they have shareholders.
Shit like that.
What's cheaper?
Spending time and money training new personnel...
Or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job?
It's the far side of the moon!
Those cheap fucks haven't even fixed the communication satellite yet!
- Tess would know, she would have told me...
- Hey, Gepetto, wake up!
You really think they give a shit about us?
They're laughing all the way to the bank!
Tess would know, she would have told me...
Where do you get off?
!
Fucking sitting there sulking like a little fucking boy!
- Jesus Christ...
- Wake up!
There's some area that we don't know about.
And I'm going to find it.
Yeah, maybe you'll find some buried treasure, too.
Fuck!
[Computer]:
Eliza arrival estimated in 13 hours.
You find your secret room?
Just put that anywhere.
Yes, that's a good idea...
- That's where I keep my leprechauns.
- Get out of the way.
- What?
Why?
- I want to look underneath that model.
You're not touching this model.
Get the fuck out of the way!
Listen, why don't you just relax, right?
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?
- Go read the encyclopedia or something?
- Oh, you're a tough guy now?
What, are you going to stab me?
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.
I'm a lover, not a fighter.
Put the knife down.
I want to look underneath there.
- Put the knife down.
- No, I'm not going to give you the knife.
- What?
- Just get out of the way.
- Take it easy.
- Let go of the knife.
Don't ever tell me what to do.
- Let go.
- You let go of the knife.
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't push me.
- Don't push me, motherfucker!
- Let go.
Let go!
What did I fucking tell you?
"Let go of the goddamn knife."
You fucking little girl, man!
Damn it!
What did I tell you?
You going to stop?
You going to stop?
OK!
OK!
Jesus, fuck!
Fuck me!
What the fuck?
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.
Let me see.
- That's a lot of blood.
- Get off of me!
Hello, Sam.
Sam, is everything OK?
Yeah!
Yeah, we had a fight.
Me and the other guy, the other...
He's very angry, you know?
You know what he did?
He flipped my entire model over!
You know how much work I put into that thing?
938 hours.
938 hours.
Yeah, exactly.
938 hours, really?
Approximately.
He's got a problem.
He scares me, Gerty.
What is it about Sam that scares you?
The guy flies off the handle.
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...
She—She left me.
Tess left me.
For 6 months.
She moved back in with her parents.
I know.
She gave me a second chance.
- I promised here that I'd change.
- You have changed, Sam.
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here, I've sent Tess...
I've sent her over a hundred video messages.
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
What about the messages she sent to me?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
Gerty...
Gerty?
Am I really a clone?
When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.
You woke up in the infirmary.
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.
I kept you under observation and ran some tests.
I remember, yea, I remember that...
Sam, there was no crash.
You were being awakened.
It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests... to establish mental stability..
and general physical health.
Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA... can have considerable impact on...
What about Tess?
What about Eve?
They are memory implants, Sam.
Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell.
I'm very sorry.
Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal.
Can I prepare you something?
[Computer]:
Rescue arrival estimated in 11 hours.
- You OK, sweetheart?
- Yeah, I'm staring into space.
Hey!
Thanks for this, this is good.
This is cozy.
How's the nose?
Much better, thank you.
I went haywire before.
You know...
I lost it.
I...
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's OK.
No, it's not OK.
I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I've got...
I've got a temper, I've got to do something about that.
Yes, you do.
(Music player plays Katrina and the Waves' "Walking on Sunshine")
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.
Can you turn that off?
Listen. (Music stops) Listen.
(music resumes) I wasn't supposed to...
I'm trying to tell you something.
(music stops)
I never instructed Gerty to...
(music resumes)
(music stops) Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you...(music resumes)
(music stops)
(music resumes)
(music stops) Tough Guy.
- Listen to me!
- You look like a radioactive tampon.
Like a banana with a yeast infection.
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there.
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened...
I walked in on Gerty talking with Central.
He was having a live conversation.
"A live conversation"?
- Yeah
- How do you know it was a live conversation?
Because it was a back-and-forth exchange.
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.
- It was live, man, it was live.
- That's impossible.
There was a flare, it fried the satellite.
The satellite is fine.
They don't want us to be able to contact Earth.
They lied to us.
They've been lying to us since the beginning.
They've been lying since forever.
If the satellite works, how are they blocking the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base?
From where, then?

Searching for long-range comms.
[Sam]:
I'm just passing the last of the harvesters.
Looks like John.
How long until you are out of the base's range?
Um, a minute.
- 90 seconds tops.
- Have you ever been out this far?
No...never have.

Approaching station 3.
Holy shit!
I think I see something, too.
[Computer]:
Approaching station 1.
Do you see what I see?
Looks like an antenna or...or...
A pylon or something.
I think it's the jammer.
Dude!
This is why we're not getting the live feed.
- Sam?
Can you hear me?
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah I hear you.
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm going to—I'm going to head back to the base.
OK, I'm going to stay out here for a while.
I'm going to see if there's any more of these things.
Fuck...
Fuck...
Fuck.

Lay down, relax and breathe deeply.
The cryogenic protection pod is designed to put you into a deep sleep for...
The duration of your three-day return journey back to Earth.
As you begin to feel sleepy, think about the magnificent job that you've done.
And how proud your family are of what you've accomplished.
Lunar Industries remains the #1 provider of clean energy worldwide...
Due to the hard work of people like you.
Safe trip, "Annyeong-hi kyeseyo" and goodbye.

Approaching station 2.
Hey, I saw 3 more of those jammers.
I think the base is surrounded with them.
I printed out their coordinates.
Bud, what's wrong with you?
What's going on?
I found your secret room.
- Who goes first?
- I go first.
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.
Why are there so many of them?
Sam, can I help you with something?
Not now, Gerty.
I'm OK.
Gerty, why did you help me before?
With the password?
Doesn't that go against your programming or something?
Helping you is what I do.

Hello?

Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Eve?
- Yeah.
- Hi!
Hi, Eve.
- How old—How old are you now?
- I'm 15.
- Do I know you?
- Sweetheart...
How did mommy die, sweetheart?
How did mommy die?
- Dad!
- Yeah.
- There's someone asking about mom.
- Who's asking about mom?
That's enough.
That's enough.
I want to go home!

Eliza arrival estimated in 7 hours.
Fuck!
- What, did you cut yourself?
- Yeah.
What are you laughing at?
Well, you don't hold it like you're trying to stab somebody, for God's sakes.
Here, give me that.
You've got to hold it closer to the blade, you see?
Watch what I'm doing.
Why are you shaking?
Carve out like that.
It's freezing in here.
Well, you're sitting under the fridge.
What's going on with you?
You all right?
Yeah, that crew they're sending us...
If they find us awake at the same time, they aren't going to let us live.
You know that, right?
You know, the return vehicle is a...
You OK?
You should lay down for a while.
Take some tranquilizers or something.
"Take some tranquilizers"?
I'll never wake up again.
You're going to be OK.
Everything's going to be OK.
I'm freezing.
Hey, hey?
Hey?
I'm really scared.
Where are you going?
[Eve, video playback]:
Hello?
- [Sam]:
Is this the Bell residence?
- [Eve]:
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Gerty, I need to talk to you.
Of course, Sam, how can I help?
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.
That hidden room, Gerty.
The lower deck is out-of-bounds to awakened clones, Sam.
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.
New clones can only be awakened once a three-year contract is completed.
Gerty, if you don't wake up another clone, me and the other Sam will die.
We will be killed, do you understand?
- Yes
- You want me and the other Sam to be killed?
- That is the last thing I want.
- Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.
OK, pal?
[Computer]:
Eliza arrival estimated in 5 hours.
(Alarm clock blares Chesney Hawkes' "The One and Only")
What's going on?
You OK?
Don't—Don't touch him.
Come here.
He's not conscious yet.
Gerty and I just woke him up.
Why?
What's going on?
Come on outside.
When the rescue unit arrives, they're going to expect to find a body in that crashed rover.
That guy?
(chuckles) What, are you going to kill him?
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?
Zip up your fly.
You're burning up.
Sweating like a pig.
Put your hat on.
Put your hat on.
If I go through with this, I'm going to need your help hauling him out to the crash site.
What about us?
When Eliza arrives, it finds you and me as a welcome party...
They aren't going to find you and me as a welcome party.
They're going to find me.
You're going back to Earth before they get here.
In that helium-3 launcher.
I did the math; you're going to pull some G's.
But you'll be fine.
You'll be all right.
You're going home.
You did your three years.
They can't expect you to stick around.
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.
I saw that V.P.
She's beautiful.
She's gorgeous.
You did good.
High five!
Go for it.
- Are you comfy?
- No.
- What?
- No!
- What if I have to take a shit?
- (laughs) Well, I guess you'll just have to hold it in, pal.
For three days?
That's the way it goes.
- Need a hand?
- No.
OK.
All right.
No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.
[Computer]:
Eliza arrival estimated in 3 hours.
Hey, we need to do this.
If we wait too long...
The other one's going to be conscious.
What's going on with you?
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.
I don't think I can move my legs.
Besides, look at me!
If I meet Eve now...
I'd scare the crap out of her!
What are you talking about, man?
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.
You're not going to kill anybody.
We can't kill anybody.
You can't.
I know you can't, because I can't.
You go.
You're a good guy, Sam.
And it was a good plan.
You know, you just picked the wrong guy to go back.
Are you sure about this?
Yeah.
You should—You should travel, you know?
I always wanted to do that.
Amsterdam or...
Yeah, I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe...
Mexico.
Aloha!
Bring me back a piña colada.
All right, pal?
Hey, Johnny Spaceman?
Do you remember when Tess came in for that interview?
She was so beautiful.
She wasn't the best candidate, but it didn't matter...
I had to give her the job.
I wanted to keep her in the country.
(said together) She was going back to Ireland.
And you knew you had to take a chance.
So...you called her...
You were terrified with that whole speech for the answering machine... but you didn't need it, because she picked up the phone.
She was like, "Why is he calling me?"
"The internship is over.
Why is he calling me at home?"
I asked her if she wanted to get an ice cream cone or something dorky like that.
She said, "Let's get a drink."
I said, "OK." We...
Sam, this is not going to work.
Why?
I have recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening.
If anyone were to check my memory cache, it would put you in considerable danger.
You could erase my memory banks.
I could reboot myself once you have departed.
- Are you okay with that?
- I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
- I want to help you.
[Computer]:
Eliza arrival estimated in 24 minutes.
Sam.
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot...
- the moment that I launch.
- I understand, Sam.
You should be OK.
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.
Thanks, Gerty.
- Are you going to be OK?
- Of course.
The new Sam and I will be back to our programming as soon as I have finished rebooting.
Gerty, we're not programmed.
We're people.
Understand?

Where am I?
- You're in the infirmary.
You've had an accident.
- How long have I been out.
- Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?
[Eliza Member]:
We've made contact.
Eliza, he ain't going nowhere.
Bag him up and we'll get started on repairs to the harvester.
Dwight, I'm going to need the...

He's a wacko or an illegal immigrant.
Either way, they need to lock him up!
Line two!
There was a time when "energy" was a dirty word.
When turning on your lights was a hard choice.
Cities in brownout,... food shortages, cars burning fuel to run.
But that was the past.
Where are we now?
How do we make the world so much better?
Make deserts bloom!
Right now, we are the largest producer of fusion energy in the world.
The energy of the sun, trapped in rock, harvested by machine from the far side of the moon.
Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3... to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet.
Who would have thought that all energy we ever needed is right above our heads?
The power of the moon... the power of our future.

Oh, thanks for the... for the football feed!

Almost!
Three years is a long haul.
You know...
It's way, way, way, way, way too long!
I'm talking to myself... on a regular basis!
So...
Time to go home, you know what I mean?
That's it, over and out!
Rock and roll, God bless America!
I can do that for you, Sam.
God damn it!
I said I got it!
Why don't you listen to me?
Package ready for launch.
Sam, is everything OK?
- Sam?
- What?
You don't seem like yourself today.
- Is something wrong?
- No.
Can you turn that off, please?
Jesus Christ!
Sam, it might help you to talk about it.
Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar-Sat?
No, Sam.
From what I understand, it is fairly low... on the company's priority list right now.
You tell them to sort that out.
You know what I'm talking about?
That's not...
I've only got two weeks!
But it's not fair for whoever's coming up here next.
I will, Sam.
Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
No, come on, let's finish this.
Got one of those headaches...
Can you..., can you give me something for it?
Message received from your wife, Sam... via Jupiter link.
Fuck!
Hi, Sam!
It's me.
I got your last message.
It was really good to hear your voice.
I miss you, too!
I know you're really lonely up there...
But I think...
In a lot of ways... it's been really good for you.
For both of us.
God, I hope you do not mind me saying that.
I'm proud of you!
Someone has got something to say.
What did you want to say to daddy, baby?
Say "astronaut".
Astronaut.
He is an astronaut!
Say daddy's an astronaut.
Say it really loud.
Daddy's an astronaut.
Clever girl!
Wave!
Give daddy a wave!
Kathy, could you...
I can't believe you're going to be home soon.
It's her birthday next month...
And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden.
- Gerty!
- We could work at it together.
Sam...
I love you!
I love you!
- And I miss you!
- I miss you!
And I can't wait to see you.
OK, sweetheart...
Goodbye.
Hi, Doug!
You're really full of yourself, aren't you, Doug?
Kath...
Not good!
What about Dumbo?
...
Fuck!
God damn it!
Fuck!
Wasn't kind of smart, was it, Gerty?
- Sam, can I ask how it happened?
- I told you.
I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand.
You saw something on TV?
Yeah, I something on TV that distracted me.
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you... but when I came in, the TV wasn't on.
Perhaps you were imagining things?
Yeah, you think too much, pal.
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.
Shut up!
Good morning, Gerty.
Good morning, Sam.
- How are you today?
- Fine!
Fine.
- How is the hand?
- Oh, it's a little sore!
A little sore.
It's OK.
- What's for breakfast?
- The usual.
Mmhmm.
- Two weeks to go, Sam.
- Two weeks to go, buddy!
Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.
But, thank you.
Thank you, Gerty.
You're welcome, Sam.

Hey, Gerty.
Looks like we have got a live one out on Matthew.

You had an accident.
Do you remember what happened?

I don't remember a thing.
Do you remember me?
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.
That's good.
That is very good.
It's nice to see you awake again.
I'd like to keep you under observation here in the infirmary for a few days...
And run some tests.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.
- OK, pal.
- You're still very tired.
We can talk later.
Hello?
The new Sam is in reworking order.
But we only have two working harvesters now.
Yeah, well,what a surprise!
Gerty, we're going to have to find a way to ramp up production.
I know.
This is incredible!
But how do you manage to destroy... a fucking rover, a harvester and an employee all on the same day?
These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know.
Gerty, what is the status on Harvester 3?
How do the repairs look on...
- Sam, you're out of bed.
- Yeah.
I wanted to stretch my legs a bit.
Who was that?
We've been having some problems with the Lunar-Sat...
And our live feed seems to be down.
I was recording a video-message for Central...
Updating them on your progress.
Sam, you need to stay in bed.
You're not ready to walk around yet.
Can you bring me my sunglasses?
It's really bright in here.
Give me some...
Give me all my stuff, you know?
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.
- Well, bring them in here.
- Certainly.
Excellent, Sam.
What...
When can I get out of here, Gerty?
Sam, you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash.
This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment.
So what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?
Central has asked me to slow down the harvesters... to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back.
That's terrific!
That's fantastic!
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow.
But it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
Let's try another test.
I don't want to try another test!
Please, Sam.
Hey, Gerty?
Do you know about this?
Matthew has got no velocity readout.
He is completely still.
He must have stalled.
Well, he has obviously stalled.
Don't you think we should tell Central?
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.
I will pass on your message.
Message received from Earth via Jupiter link.
Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better.
Yeah, we don't want you to take any unnecessary risks.
- You are too important to us.
- You stay put.
That is an order.
It's an order, Sam...
from Lunar.
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit... to tend to the stalled harvester and get the base back on its feet.
- Fuck is with...?
What the fuck?
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- What?
- Sam...
I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.
I don't appreciate that, being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.
Gerty!
Gerty!
Gerty, come here!
- What happened?
- I do not know, maybe a meteorite...
There have been no meteorites, Sam.
Micrometeorites, maybe.
I do not know.
Either way, there might be damage to the exterior shell.
I think you better... you better let me go outside and take a look.
There is no damage to the exterior shell.
Well, it's not that I don't believe you, Gerty...
But, you know, this thing is springing leaks like an Acme firehose.
You need to let me go outside and fix this problem, Gery.
I can't let you go outside, Sam.
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.
Just let...
We'll keep it between you and me, ok, pal?
This thing is leaking gas.
Let's go!
Come on...
Just to check the exterior shell?
- Of course.
- OK, Sam.
Thank you.

We need to get him to the infirmary immediately.
Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?
Where...
Where am I?
The infirmary.
You had an accident out by one of the harvesters.
Do you remember?
No, I'm...
I'm thirsty.
I could get you some water.
I saw someone out there, Gerty.
I saw someone out there.
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries.
But, all in all, the prognosis is good.
I'm happy to see you again.
Gerty?
Yes, Sam?
Is there someone in the room with us?
Sam, get some sleep.
You're very tired.
Spoke to Thompson today.
They are in Europe, they... he's promising the world.
I think it was the right thing.
But... it's just such a long time.
I suppose there are... there are things...
You know... that needed to happen.
I...
I need time to think.
Listen... umm...
Sam...
Be safe...
And I'll...
I'll talk to you soon.
Goodbye.
Gerty?
Gerty, what the fu... what the hell's going on?
Who is the guy...
Who is the guy in the rec room?
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?
Sam, you're out out of bed.
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.
Who is the guy?
Who is the guy in the rec room?
- Sam Bell.
- Come on, come on, come on!
You are Sam Bell.
Sam, what is it?
It might help to talk about it.
I don't understand what is happening...
I think I'm starting to lose my mind.
We can run some tests.
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.
They do not know that you were recovered alive from the accident.
"Recovered alive"?
What do you mean?
Why did not you report it to Central?
What are you talking about?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
- I'm just getting my slippers...
- I'm using them...
I'm using them.
These are mine.
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.
I'm Sam Bell, too!
- What?
- Well, we've got that going for us.
Why...?
How long have you been...
What?
How long have you been here?
About a week.
- So how are you doing?
- What?
How are you doing?
"How am I doing?"
How do you think I'm doing?
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the harvesters?
Harvesters are fine.
It's the fact that I'm here talking to a clone that's slightly troubling.
I'm not a clone.
I'm not a clone!
- You're the clone.
- Okay, Sam.
You're not a clone.
Hey, hey...
You're not looking too good.
Sh!
Butt out of this!
I'm not even talking to you, pal.
I think that Katherine likes you.
I think she likes you a bit.
You're not looking too good, my friend.
I hope you're not feeling too bad.
Are you talking to yourself?
- Let's just get you fixed up...
- How long have you been here?
Well, it's about... three years.
For almost three years.
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank y....
I wanted to thank you for, um...
If it wasn't for you, I'd...
I...
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover.
You saved my life.
Hey, I know this is weird, you know...?
I'm real lonely, you know, I...
I just wanted to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?
Maybe later.
- What are you looking at?
- You look just like me, it's incredible.
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?
We look like each other, I guess.
I don't know.
Hey, you know...
It's weird for me, too, you know?
Hey?
Hey, you want to play some ping-pong?
No.
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.
- What's the score?
- 2-18.
OK
- Do you want me to show you how to hold that?
- No...
No, I...
I don't need you to show me how to hold it!
OK, OK.
Yeah, "OK".
- Should we play?
- Yeah!
Fuck!
God!
Shit!
19-2.
Yeah...
You want a...
You want a stick of gum?
You know...
You should approach this in a different way.
- Remember when you went to flight school?
- What are you doing?
I'm fixing the net.
It is very Zen with ping-pong, you have to just to relax.
How long did it take you took to do that?
Oh, I don't remember doing all of it.
I remember doing the church...
and the Salvation Army.
And doing the people.
My mind has been acting kind of weird lately.
That's Fairfield, right?
There's the town hall.
Fairfield, that's right...
Yeah, that's Tess... and Eve...
You...
You know Tess?
Yeah, I know Tess.
- You know about Eve, right?
- What?
I had a...
We had a girl...
Eve.
Ain't she beautiful?
She's my little monkey.
She's our little monkey.

She might be the milkman's, but she's beautiful.
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.
Oh shit!
- Greetings, Sam.
- How's our man?
You feeling better?
- Have you had enough rest?
- You resting up, Sam?
You better be, you bastard.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
We've got some good news.
The Jupiter program had to be put on hiatus, so we've got a few pairs of hands for you.
So what we've manage to do is cue you a rescue unit ahead of schedule.
Rescue Unit Eliza.
Eliza has been stationed on Goliath-19 for the last 2 months.
We expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.
So commence to jump for joy!
You're about to be back at work.
In the meantime, hang in there.
Rest up.
You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out!
They're sending a rescue unit?
Why?
Why are they sending a rescue unit?
To fix the stalled harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.
Well, then I'm going back.
That's it for me.
- What?
- Is that what you really think?
Yeah.
I've got a contract!
I'm going home.
- You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.
- Hey, I'm going home!
- Home!
- You're not going anywhere.
You know, you've been up here too long, man.
You have lost your marbles.
What do you think, Tess is back home, waiting on the sofa in lingerie?
What about the original Sam?
Huh?
I am the original Sam!
- I am Sam-fucking-Bell.
- Hey!
Me!
Me!
Gerty, am I a clone?
Are you hungry?
Hey, hey...
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.
I'm in the same boat, asshole.
Listen...
- What about the other clones?
- What?
We might not be the first two to have been woken up.
You said that that model had already been started when you got here.
Well, who started it?
There might be others up here right now.
Think about it.
How did I get up here so quickly after your crash?
- I don't know...
- They didn't ship me in from Central.
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.
I don't know what you're smoking.
Why would they do that?
That's ridiculous.
Impossible.
I bet there's some kind of secret room.
"Secret room"?
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?
You know, you are the one that has lost your marbles.
I've been here three years, man.
I know every inch of this base.
And I know how many dirt is between those wall panels over there.
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?
Look, it's a company, right?
They have investors, they have shareholders.
Shit like that.
What's cheaper?
Spending time and money training new personnel...
Or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job?
It's the far side of the moon!
Those cheap fucks haven't even fixed the communication satellite yet!
- Tess would know, she would have told me...
- Hey, Gepetto, wake up!
You really think they give a shit about us?
They're laughing all the way to the bank!
Tess would know, she would have told me...
Where do you get off?
!
Fucking sitting there sulking like a little fucking boy!
- Jesus Christ...
- Wake up!
There's some area that we don't know about.
And I'm going to find it.
Yeah, maybe you'll find some buried treasure, too.
Fuck!
Eliza arrival estimated in 13 hours.
You find your secret room?
Just put that anywhere.
Yes, that's a good idea...
- That's where I keep my leprechauns.
- Get out of the way.
- What?
Why?
- I want to look underneath that model.
You're not touching this model.
Get the fuck out of the way!
Listen, why don't you just relax, right?
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?
- Go read the encyclopedia or something?
- Oh, you're a tough guy now?
What, are you going to stab me?
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.
I'm a lover, not a fighter.
Put the knife down.
I want to look underneath there.
- Put the knife down.
- No, I'm not going to give you the knife.
- What?
- Just get out of the way.
- Take it easy.
- Let go of the knife.
Don't ever tell me what to do.
- Let go.
- You let go of the knife.
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't push me.
- Don't push me, motherfucker!
- Let go.
Let go!
What did I fucking tell you?
"Let go of the goddamn knife."
You fucking little girl, man!
Damn it!
What did I tell you?
You going to stop?
You going to stop?
OK!
OK!
Jesus, fuck!
Fuck me!
What the fuck?
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.
Let me see.
- That's a lot of blood.
- Get off of me!
Hello, Sam.
Sam, is everything OK?
Yeah!
Yeah, we had a fight.
Me and the other guy, the other...
He's very angry, you know?
You know what he did?
He flipped my entire model over!
You know how much work I put into that thing?
938 hours.
938 hours.
Yeah, exactly.
938 hours, really?
Approximately.
He's got a problem.
He scares me, Gerty.
What is it about Sam that scares you?
The guy flies off the handle.
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...
She...
She left me.
Tess left me.
For 6 months.
She moved back in with her parents.
I know.
She gave me a second chance.
- I promised here that I'd change.
- You have changed, Sam.
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here, I've sent Tess...
I've sent her over a hundred video messages.
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
What about the messages she sent to me?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
Gerty...
Gerty?
Am I really a clone?
When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.
You woke up in the infirmary.
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.
I kept you under observation and ran some tests.
I remember, yea, I remember that...
Sam, there was no crash.
You were being awakened.
It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests... to establish mental stability..
and general physical health.
Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA... can have considerable impact on...
What about Tess?
What about Eve?
They are memory implants, Sam.
Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell.
I'm very sorry.
Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal.
Can I prepare you something?
Rescue arrival estimated in 11 hours.
- You OK, sweetheart?
- Yeah, I'm staring into space.
Hey!
Thanks for this, this is good.
This is cozy.
How's the nose?
Much better, thank you.
I went haywire before.
You know...
I lost it.
I...
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's OK.
No, it's not OK.
I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I've got...
I've got a temper, I've got to do something about that.
Yes, you do.
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.
Can you turn that off?
Listen.
Listen.
I wasn't supposed to...
I'm trying to tell you something.
I never instructed Gerty to...
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you...
Tough Guy.
- Listen to me!
- You look like a radioactive tampon.
Like a banana with a yeast infection.
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there.
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened...
I walked in on Gerty talking with Central.
He was having a live conversation.
"A live conversation"?
- Yeah.
- How do you know it was a live conversation?
Because it was a back-and-forth exchange.
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.
- It was live, man, it was live.
- That's impossible.
There was a flare, it fried the satellite.
The satellite is fine.
They don't want us to be able to contact Earth.
They lied to us.
They've been lying to us since the beginning.
They've been lying since forever.
If the satellite works, how are they blocking the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base?
From where, then?
Searching for long-range comms.
I'm just passing the last of the harvesters.
Looks like John.
How long until you are out of the base's range?
Um, a minute.
- 90 seconds tops.
- Have you ever been out this far?
No... never have.

- It'd help if I knew what the hell I was looking for.
Wait a second, I see something.
Approaching station 3.
Holy shit!
I think I see something, too.
Approaching station 1.
Do you see what I see?
Looks like an antenna or... or...
A pylon or something.
I think it's the jammer.
Dude!
This is why we're not getting the live feed.
- Sam?
Can you hear me?
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah I hear you.
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm going to...
I'm going to head back to the base.
OK, I'm going to stay out here for a while.
I'm going to see if there's any more of these things.
Fuck...
Fuck...
Fuck.

Rescue arrival estimated in 9 hours.
Lay down, relax and breathe deeply.
The cryogenic protection pod is designed to put you into a deep sleep for... the duration of your three-day return journey back to Earth.
As you begin to feel sleepy, think about the magnificent job that you've done.
And how proud your family are of what you've accomplished.
Lunar Industries remains the #1 provider of clean energy worldwide... due to the hard work of people like you.
Safe trip, "Annyeong-hi kyeseyo" and goodbye.
Approaching station 2.
Hey, I saw 3 more of those jammers.
I think the base is surrounded with them.
I printed out their coordinates.
Bud, what's wrong with you?
What's going on?
I found your secret room.
- Who goes first?
- I go first.
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.
Why are there so many of them?
Sam, can I help you with something?
Not now, Gerty.
I'm OK.
Gerty, why did you help me before?
With the password?
Doesn't that go against your programming or something?
Helping you is what I do.

There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Eve?
- Yeah.
- Hi!
Hi, Eve.
- How old...
How old are you now?
- I'm 15.
- Do I know you?
- Sweetheart...
How did mommy die, sweetheart?
How did mommy die?
- Dad!
- Yeah.
- There's someone asking about mom.
- Who's asking about mom?
That's enough.
That's enough.
I want to go home!
...want to go...
Eliza arrival estimated in 7 hours.
Fuck!
- What, did you cut yourself?
- Yeah.
What are you laughing at?
Well, you don't hold it like you're trying to stab somebody, for God's sakes.
Here, give me that.
You've got to hold it closer to the blade, you see?
Watch what I'm doing.
Why are you shaking?
Carve out like that.
It's freezing in here.
Well, you're sitting under the fridge.
What's going on with you?
You all right?
Yeah, that crew they're sending us...
If they find us awake at the same time, they aren't going to let us live.
You know that, right?
You know, the return vehicle is a...
You OK?
You should lay down for a while.
Take some tranquilizers or something.
"Take some tranquilizers"?
I'll never wake up again.
You're going to be OK.
Everything's going to be OK.
I'm freezing.
Hey, hey?
Hey?
I'm really scared.
Where are you going?
Hello?
- Is this the Bell residence?
- This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Gerty, I need to talk to you.
Of course, Sam, how can I help?
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.
That hidden room, Gerty.
The lower deck is out-of-bounds to awakened clones, Sam.
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.
New clones can only be awakened once a three-year contract is completed.
Gerty, if you don't wake up another clone, me and the other Sam will die.
We will be killed, do you understand?
- Yes.
- You want me and the other Sam to be killed?
- That is the last thing I want.
- Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.
OK, pal?
Eliza arrival estimated in 5 hours.
What's going on?
You OK?
Don't...
Don't touch him.
Come here.
He's not conscious yet.
Gerty and I just woke him up.
Why?
What's going on?
Come on outside.
When the rescue unit arrives, they're going to expect to find a body in that crashed rover.
That guy?
What, are you going to kill him?
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?
Zip up your fly.
You're burning up.
Sweating like a pig.
Put your hat on.
Put your hat on.
If I go through with this, I'm going to need your help hauling him out to the crash site.
What about us?
When Eliza arrives, it finds you and me as a welcome party...
They aren't going to find you and me as a welcome party.
They're going to find me.
You're going back to Earth before they get here.
In that helium-3 launcher.
I did the math, you're going to pull some G's.
But you'll be fine.
You'll be all right.
You're going home.
You did your three years.
They can't expect you to stick around.
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.
I saw that V.P.
She's beautiful.
She's gorgeous.
You did good.
High five!
Go for it.
- Are you comfy?
- No.
- What?
- No!
- What if I have to take a shit?
- Well, I guess you'll just have to hold it in, pal.
For three days?
That's the way it goes.
- Need a hand?
- No.
OK.
All right.
No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.
Eliza arrival estimated in 3 hours.
Hey, we need to do this.
If we wait too long...
The other one's going to be conscious.
What's going on with you?
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.
I don't think I can move my legs.
Besides, look at me!
If I meet Eve now...
I'd scare the crap out of her!
What are you talking about, man?
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.
You're not going to kill anybody.
We can't kill anybody.
You can't.
I know you can't, because I can't.
You go.
You're a good guy, Sam.
And it was a good plan.
You know, you just picked the wrong guy to go back.
Are you sure about this?
Yeah.
You should...
You should travel, you know?
I always wanted to do that.
Amsterdam or...
Yeah, I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe...
Mexico.
Aloha!
Bring me back a piña colada.
All right, pal?
Hey, Johnny Spaceman?
Do you remember when Tess came in for that interview?
She was so beautiful.
She wasn't the best candidate, but it didn't matter...
I had to give her the job.
I wanted to keep her in the country.
She was going back to Ireland.
And you knew you had to take a chance.
So... you called her...
You were terrified with that whole speech for the answering machine... but you didn't need it, because she picked up the phone.
She was like, "Why is he calling me?"
"The internship is over.
Why is he calling me at home?"
I asked her if she wanted to get an ice cream cone or something dorky like that.
She said, "Let's get a drink."
I said, "OK." We...
Sam, this is not going to work.
Why?
I have recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening.
If anyone were to check my memory cache, it would put you in considerable danger.
You could erase my memory banks.
I could reboot myself once you have departed.
- Are you okay with that?
- I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
I want to help you.
Eliza arrival estimated in 24 minutes.
Sam.
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot...
- the moment that I launch.
- I understand, Sam.
You should be OK.
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.
Thanks, Gerty.
- Are you going to be OK?
- Of course.
The new Sam and I will be back to our programming as soon as I have finished rebooting.
Gerty, we're not programmed.
We're people.
Understand?
Eliza arrival estimated in 8 minutes.
Air lock pressurization complete.
Sam?
Hey, Sam?
You OK, buddy?
Cavalry's here.
Where am I?
You're in the infirmary.
You've had an accident.
- How long have I been out.
- Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?
We've made contact.
Eliza, he ain't going nowhere.
Bag him up and we'll get started on repairs to the harvester.
Dwight, I'm going to need the Stocks have slipped a further 32% after accusations that...

Lunar el segundo Clone six, the clone of Sam Bell has been giving evidence that CEA's board of directors meeting in Seattle...
You know what?
He's one of two things:
He's a wacko or an illegal immigrant.
Either way, they need to lock him up!
Line two!
There was a time when "energy" was a dirty word.
When turning on your lights was a hard choice.
Cities in brownout... food shortages, cars burning fuel to run.
But that was the past.
Where are we now?
How do we make the world so much better?
Make deserts bloom!
Right now, we are the largest producer of fusion energy in the world.
The energy of the sun, trapped in rock, harvested by machine from the far side of the moon.
Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3... to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet.
Who would have thought that all energy we ever needed is right above our heads?
The power of the moon... the power of our future.

How are things down there?
You guys been having any... good parties or anything?
Oh, thanks for the... for the football feed!
It almost felt live.
Almost!
Three years is a long haul.
You know?
It's way, way, way, way, way too long!
I'm talking to myself... on a regular basis!
So...
Time to go home, you know what I mean?
That's it, over and out!
Rock and roll, God bless America!
I can do that for you, Sam.
God damn it!
I said I got it!
Why don't you listen to me?
Package ready for launch.
Sam, is everything OK?
Sam?
What?
You don't seem like yourself today.
Is something wrong?
No.
Can you turn that off, please?
Jesus Christ!
Sam, it might help you to talk about it.
Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar-Sat?
No, Sam.
From what I understand, it is fairly low... on the company's priority list right now.
You tell them to sort that out.
You know what I'm talking about?
That's not?
I've only got two weeks!
But it's not fair for whoever's coming up here next.
I will, Sam.
Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
No, come on;
let's finish this.
Got one of those headaches...
Can you give me something for it?
Message received from your wife, Sam... via Jupiter link.
Fuck!
Hi, Sam!
It's me.
I got your last message.
It was really good to hear your voice.
I miss you, too!
I know you're really lonely up there...
But I think...
In a lot of ways.... it's been really good for you.
For both of us.
God, I hope you do not mind me saying that.
I'm proud of you!
Someone has got something to say.
What did you want to say to daddy, baby?
Say "astronaut".
Astronaut.
He is an astronaut!
Say daddy's an astronaut.
Say it really loud.
Daddy's an astronaut.
Clever girl!
Wave!
Give daddy a wave!
Kathy, could you?
I can't believe you're going to be home soon.
It's her birthday next month...
And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden.
Gerty!
We could work at it together.
Sam...
I love you!
I love you!
And I miss you!
I miss you!
And I can't wait to see you.
OK, sweetheart...
Goodbye.
Hi, Doug!
You're really full of yourself, aren't you, Doug?
Kath...
Not good!
What about Dumbo?
...
Fuck!
God damn it!
Fuck!
Wasn't kind of smart, was it, Gerty?
Sam, can I ask how it happened?
I told you.
I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand.
You saw something on TV?
Yeah, I something on TV that distracted me.
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you... but when I came in, the TV wasn't on.
Perhaps you were imagining things?
Yeah, you think too much, pal.
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.
Shut up!
Good morning, Gerty.
Good morning, Sam.
How are you today?
Fine!
Fine.
How is the hand?
Oh, it's a little sore!
A little sore.
It's OK.
What's for breakfast?
The usual.
Mmhmm.
Two weeks to go, Sam.
Two weeks to go, buddy!
Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.
But, thank you.
Thank you, Gerty.
You're welcome, Sam.

You had an accident.
Do you remember what happened?
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.
Do you remember me?
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.
That's good.
That is very good.
It's nice to see you awake again.
I'd like to keep you under observation here in the infirmary for a few days
And run some tests.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.
OK, pal.
You're still very tired.
We can talk later.
Hello?
The new Sam is in reworking order.
But we only have two working harvesters now.
Yeah, well,what a surprise!
Gerty, we're going to have to find a way to ramp up production.
I know.
This is incredible!
But how do you manage to destroy... a fucking rover, a harvester and an employee all on the same day?
These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know.
Gerty, what is the status on Harvester 3?
How do the repairs look on...
Sam, you're out of bed.
Yeah.
I wanted to stretch my legs a bit.
Who was that?
We've been having some problems with the Lunar-Sat...
And our live feed seems to be down.
I was recording a video-message for Central...
Updating them on your progress.
Sam, you need to stay in bed.
You're not ready to walk around yet.
Can you bring me my sunglasses?
It's really bright in here.
Give me some...
Give me all my stuff, you know?
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.
Well, bring them in here.
Certainly.
Excellent, Sam.
What...
When can I get out of here, Gerty?
Sam, you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash.
This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment.
So what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?
Central has asked me to slow down the harvesters... to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back.
That's terrific!
That's fantastic!
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow.
But it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
Let's try another test.
I don't want to try another test!
Please, Sam.
Hey, Gerty?
Do you know about this?
Matthew has got no velocity readout.
He is completely still.
He must have stalled.
Well, he has obviously stalled.
Don't you think we should tell Central?
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.
I will pass on your message.
Message received from Earth via Jupiter link.
Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better.
Yeah, we don't want you to take any unnecessary risks.
You are too important to us.
You stay put.
That is an order.
It's an order, Sam... from Lunar.
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit... to tend to the stalled harvester and get the base back on its feet.
Fuck is with...?
What the fuck?
I'm sorry, Sam.
What?
Sam...
I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.
I don't appreciate that was being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.
Gerty!
Gerty!
Gerty, come here!
What happened?
I do not know, maybe a meteorite...
There have been no meteorites, Sam.
Micrometeorites, maybe.
I do not know.
Either way, there might be damage to the exterior shell.
I think you better...
you better let me go outside and take a look.
There is no damage to the exterior shell.
Well, it's not that I don't believe you, Gerty...
But, you know, this thing is springing leaks like an Acme firehose.
You need to let me go outside and fix this problem, Gerty.
I can't let you go outside, Sam.
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.
Just let...
We'll keep it between you and me, ok, pal?
This thing is leaking gas.
Let's go!
Come on...
Just to check the exterior shell?
Of course.
OK, Sam.
Thank you.

Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?
Where am I?
The infirmary.
You had an accident out by one of the harvesters.
Do you remember?
No, I'm thirsty.
I could get you some water.
I saw someone out there, Gerty.
I saw someone out there.
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries.
But, all in all, the prognosis is good.
I'm happy to see you again.
Gerty?
Yes, Sam?
Is there someone in the room with us?
Sam, get some sleep.
You're very tired.
Spoke to Thompson today.
They are in Europe, they are promising the world.
I think it was the right thing.
But... it's just such a long time.
I suppose there are things...
You know... that needed to happen.
I need time to think.
Listen... umm...
Sam...
Be safe...
And I'll...
I'll talk to you soon.
Goodbye.
Gerty?
Gerty, what the fuck, what the hell's going on?
Who is the guy?
Who is the guy in the rec room?
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?
Sam, you're out out of bed.
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.
Who is the guy?
Who is the guy in the rec room?
Sam Bell.
Come on, come on, come on!
You are Sam Bell.
Sam, what is it?
It might help to talk about it.
I don't understand what is happening...
I think I'm starting to lose my mind.
We can run some tests.
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.
They do not know that you were recovered alive from the accident.
"Recovered alive"?
What do you mean?
Why did not you report it to Central?
What are you talking about?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
I'm just getting my slippers...
I'm using them...
I'm using them.
These are mine.
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.
I'm Sam Bell, too!
What?
Well, we've got that going for us.
Why...?
How long have you been...
What?
How long have you been here?
About a week.
So how are you doing?
What?
How are you doing?
"How am I doing?"
How do you think I'm doing?
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the harvesters?
Harvesters are fine.
It's the fact that I'm here talking to a clone that's slightly troubling.
I'm not a clone.
I'm not a clone!
You're the clone.
Okay, Sam.
You're not a clone.
Hey, hey...
You're not looking too good.
Sh!
Butt out of this!
I'm not even talking to you, pal.
I think that Katherine likes you.
I think she likes you a bit.
You're not looking too good, my friend.
I hope you're not feeling too bad.
Are you talking to yourself?
Let's just get you fixed up...
How long have you been here?
Well, it's about... three years.
For almost three years.
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank you?
I wanted to thank you for, um...
If it wasn't for you, I'd...
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover.
You saved my life.
Hey, I know this is weird, you know...?
I'm real lonely, you know, I...
I just wanted to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?
Maybe later.
What are you looking at?
You look just like me; it's incredible.
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?
We look like each other, I guess.
I don't know.
Hey, you know...
It's weird for me, too, you know?
Hey?
Hey, you want to play some ping-pong?
No.
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.
What's the score?
2-18.
OK
Do you want me to show you how to hold that?
No...
No, I...
I don't need you to show me how to hold it!
OK, OK
Yeah, "OK"
Should we play?
Yeah!
Fuck!
God!
Shit!
19-2.
Yeah...
You want a...
You want a stick of gum?
You know...
You should approach this in a different way.
Remember when you went to flight school?
What are you doing?
I'm fixing the net.
It is very Zen with ping-pong, you have to just to relax.
How long did it take you took to do that?
Oh, I don't remember doing all of it.
I remember doing the church...
and the Salvation Army.
And doing the people.
My mind has been acting kind of weird lately.
That's Fairfield, right?
There's the town hall.
Fairfield, that's right...
Yeah, that's Tess... and Eve...
You...
You know Tess?
Yeah, I know Tess.
You know about Eve, right?
What?
I had a...
We had a girl...
Eve.
Ain't she beautiful?
She's my little monkey.
She's our little monkey.
High five!
She might be the milkman's, but she's beautiful.
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.
Oh shit!
Greetings, Sam.
How's our man?
You feeling better?
Have you had enough rest?
You resting up, Sam?
You better be, you bastard.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
We've got some good news.
The Jupiter program had to be put on hiatus, so we've got a few pairs of hands for you.
So what we've manage to do is cue you a rescue unit ahead of schedule.
Rescue Unit Eliza.
Eliza has been stationed on Goliath-19 for the last 2 months.
We expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.
So commence to jump for joy!
You're about to be back at work.
In the meantime, hang in there.
Rest up.
You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out!
They're sending a rescue unit?
Why?
Why are they sending a rescue unit?
To fix the stalled harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.
Well, then I'm going back.
That's it for me.
What?
Is that what you really think?
Yeah.
I've got a contract!
I'm going home.
You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.
Hey, I'm going home!
Home!
You're not going anywhere.
You know, you've been up here too long, man.
You have lost your marbles.
What do you think, Tess is back home, waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie?
What about the original Sam?
Huh?
I am the original Sam!
I am Sam-fucking-Bell.
Hey!
Me!
Me!
Gerty, am I a clone?
Are you hungry?
Hey, hey...
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.
I'm in the same boat, asshole.
Listen...
What about the other clones?
What?
We might not be the first two to have been woken up.
You said that that model had already been started when you got here.
Well, who started it?
There might be others up here right now.
Think about it.
How did I get up here so quickly after your crash?
I don't know...
They didn't ship me in from Central.
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.
I don't know what you're smoking.
Why would they do that?
That's ridiculous.
Impossible.
I bet there's some kind of secret room.
"Secret room"?
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?
You know, you are the one that has lost your marbles.
I've been here three years, man.
I know every inch of this base.
And I know how many dirt is between those wall panels over there.
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?
Look, it's a company, right?
They have investors, they have shareholders.
Shit like that.
What's cheaper?
Spending time and money training new personnel...
Or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job?
It's the far side of the moon!
Those cheap fucks haven't even fixed the communication satellite yet!
Tess would know, she would have told me...
Hey, Gepetto, wake up!
You really think they give a shit about us?
They're laughing all the way to the bank!
Tess would know, she would have told me...
Where do you get off?
!
Fucking sitting there sulking like a little fucking boy!
Jesus Christ...
Wake up!
There's some area that we don't know about.
And I'm going to find it.
Yeah, maybe you'll find some buried treasure, too.
Fuck!
Eliza arrival estimated in 13 hours.
You find your secret room?
Just put that anywhere.
Yes, that's a good idea...
That's where I keep my leprechauns.
Get out of the way.
What?
Why?
I want to look underneath that model.
You're not touching this model.
Get the fuck out of the way!
Listen, why don't you just relax, right?
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?
Go read the encyclopedia or something?
Oh, you're a tough guy now?
What, are you going to stab me?
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.
I'm a lover, not a fighter.
Put the knife down.
I want to look underneath there.
Put the knife down.
No, I'm not going to give you the knife.
What?
Just get out of the way.
Take it easy.
Let go of the knife.
Don't ever tell me what to do.
Let go.
You let go of the knife.
Don't be an asshole.Don't push me.
Don't push me, motherfucker!
Let go.
Let go!
What did I fucking tell you?
"Let go of the goddamn knife."
You fucking little girl, man!
Damn it!
What did I tell you?
You going to stop?
You going to stop?
OK!
OK!
Jesus, fuck!
Fuck me!
What the fuck?
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.
Let me see.
That's a lot of blood.
Get off of me!
Hello, Sam.
Sam, is everything OK?
Yeah!
Yeah, we had a fight.
Me and the other guy, the other...
He's very angry, you know?
You know what he did?
He flipped my entire model over!
You know how much work I put into that thing?
938 hours.
938 hours.
Yeah, exactly.
938 hours, really?
Approximately.
He's got a problem.
He scares me, Gerty.
What is it about Sam that scares you?
The guy flies off the handle.
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...
She left me.
Tess left me.
For 6 months.
She moved back in with her parents.
I know.
She gave me a second chance.
I promised her that I'd change.
You have changed, Sam.
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here, I've sent Tess...
I've sent her over a hundred video messages.
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
What about the messages she sent to me?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
Gerty...
Gerty?
Am I really a clone?
When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.
You woke up in the infirmary.
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.
I kept you under observation and ran some tests.
I remember, yea, I remember that...
Sam, there was no crash.
You were being awakened.
It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests... to establish mental stability..
and general physical health.
Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA... can have considerable impact on...
What about Tess?
What about Eve?
They are memory implants, Sam.
Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell.
I'm very sorry.
Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal.
Can I prepare you something?
Rescue arrival estimated in 11 hours.
You OK, sweetheart?
Yeah, I'm staring into space.
Hey!
Thanks for this, this is good.
This is cozy.
How's the nose?
Much better, thank you.
I went haywire before.
You know...
I lost it.
I...
I'm sorry about that.
It's OK.
No, it's not OK.
I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I've got...
I've got a temper, I've got to do something about that.
Yes, you do.
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.
Can you turn that off?
Listen.
Listen.
I wasn't supposed to...
I'm trying to tell you something.
I never instructed Gerty to...
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you...
Tough Guy.
Listen to me!
You look like a radioactive tampon.
Like a banana with a yeast infection.
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there.
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened...
I walked in on Gerty talking with Central.
He was having a live conversation.
"A live conversation"?
Yeah How do you know it was a live conversation?
Because it was a back-and-forth exchange.
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.
It was live, man, it was live.
That's impossible.
There was a flare, it fried the satellite.
The satellite is fine.
They don't want us to be able to contact Earth.
They lied to us.
They've been lying to us since the beginning.
They've been lying since forever.
If the satellite works, how are they blocking the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base?
From where, then?
Searching for long-range comms.
Searching for long-range comms.
I'm just passing the last of the harvesters.
Looks like John.
Searching for long-range comms.
How long until you are out of the base's range?
Um, a minute.
90 seconds tops.
Have you ever been out this far?
No... never have.
Signal failure on long-range comms.
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.
See anything?
It'd help if I knew what the hell I was looking for.
Wait a second, I see something.
Approaching station 3.
Holy shit!
I think I see something, too.
Approaching station 1.
Do you see what I see?
Looks like an antenna or... or...
A pylon or something.
I think it's the jammer.
Dude!
This is why we're not getting the live feed.
Sam?
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah I hear you.
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm going to...
I'm going to head back to the base.
OK, I'm going to stay out here for a while.
I'm going to see if there's any more of these things.
Fuck...
Fuck...
Fuck.

My hair's falling out.
How about that for a status?
We'll do this another time.
Fuck!
I'm going to go see her soon.
Rescue arrival estimated in 9 hours.
Lay down, relax and breathe deeply.
The cryogenic protection pod is designed to put you into a deep sleep for...
The duration of your three-day return journey back to Earth.
As you begin to feel sleepy, think about the magnificent job that you've done.
And how proud your family are of what you've accomplished.
Lunar Industries remains the #1 provider of clean energy worldwide...
Due to the hard work of people like you.
Safe trip, "Annyeong-hi kyeseyo" and goodbye.
Approaching station 2.
Hey, I saw 3 more of those jammers.
I think the base is surrounded with them.
I printed out their coordinates.
Bud, what's wrong with you?
What's going on?
I found your secret room.
Who goes first?
I go first.
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.
Why are there so many of them?
Sam, can I help you with something?
Not now, Gerty.
I'm OK.
Gerty, why did you help me before?
With the password?
Doesn't that go against your programming or something?
Helping you is what I do.
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.

Hello?
Is this the Bell family?
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Eve?
Yeah.
Hi!
Hi, Eve.
How old old are you now?
I'm 15.
Do I know you?
Sweetheart...
How did mommy die, sweetheart?
How did mommy die?
Dad!
Yeah.
There's someone asking about mom.
Who's asking about mom?
That's enough.
That's enough.
I want to go home!
...want to go...
Eliza arrival estimated in 7 hours.
Fuck!
What, did you cut yourself?
Yeah.
What are you laughing at?
Well, you don't hold it like you're trying to stab somebody, for God's sakes.
Here, give me that.
You've got to hold it closer to the blade, you see?
Watch what I'm doing.
Why are you shaking?
Carve out like that.
It's freezing in here.
Well, you're sitting under the fridge.
What's going on with you?
You all right?
Yeah, that crew they're sending us...
If they find us awake at the same time, they aren't going to let us live.
You know that, right?
You know, the return vehicle is a...
You OK?
You should lay down for a while.
Take some tranquilizers or something.
"Take some tranquilizers"?
I'll never wake up again.
You're going to be OK.
Everything's going to be OK.
I'm freezing.
Hey, hey?
Hey?
I'm really scared.
Where are you going?
Hello?
Is this the Bell residence?
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Gerty, I need to talk to you.
Of course, Sam, how can I help?
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.
That hidden room, Gerty.
The lower deck is out-of-bounds to awakened clones, Sam.
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.
New clones can only be awakened once a three-year contract is completed.
Gerty, if you don't wake up another clone, me and the other Sam will die.
We will be killed, do you understand?
Yes You want me and the other Sam to be killed?
That is the last thing I want.
Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.
OK, pal?
Eliza arrival estimated in 5 hours.
What's going on?
You OK?
Don't, don't touch him.
Come here.
He's not conscious yet.
Gerty and I just woke him up.
Why?
What's going on?
Come on outside.
When the rescue unit arrives, they're going to expect to find a body in that crashed rover.
That guy?
What, are you going to kill him?
Jesus Christ.
What are you doing?
Zip up your fly.
You're burning up.
Sweating like a pig.
Put your hat on.
Put your hat on.
If I go through with this,
I'm going to need your help hauling him out to the crash site.
What about us?
When Eliza arrives, it finds you and me as a welcome party...
They aren't going to find you and me as a welcome party.
They're going to find me.
You're going back to Earth before they get here.
In that helium-3 launcher.
I did the math; you're going to pull some G's.
But you'll be fine.
You'll be all right.
You're going home.
You did your three years.
They can't expect you to stick around.
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.
I saw that V.P.
She's beautiful.
She's gorgeous.
You did good.
High five!
Go for it.
Are you comfy?
No.
What?
No!
What if I have to take a shit?
Well, I guess you'll just have to hold it in, pal.
For three days?
That's the way it goes.
Need a hand?
No.
OK.
All right.
No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.
Eliza arrival estimated in 3 hours.
Hey, we need to do this.
If we wait too long...
The other one's going to be conscious.
What's going on with you?
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.
I don't think I can move my legs.
Besides, look at me!
If I meet Eve now...
I'd scare the crap out of her!
What are you talking about, man?
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.
You're not going to kill anybody.
We can't kill anybody.
You can't.
I know you can't, because I can't.
You go.
You're a good guy, Sam.
And it was a good plan.
You know, you just picked the wrong guy to go back.
Are you sure about this?
Yeah.
You should, you should travel, you know?
I always wanted to do that.
Amsterdam or...
Yeah, I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe...
Mexico.
Aloha!
Bring me back a pina colada.
All right, pal?
Hey, Johnny Spaceman?
Do you remember when Tess came in for that interview?
She was so beautiful.
She wasn't the best candidate, but it didn't matter...
I had to give her the job.
I wanted to keep her in the country.
She was going back to Ireland.
And you knew you had to take a chance.
So... you called her...
You were terrified with that whole speech for the answering machine... but you didn't need it, because she picked up the phone.
She was like, "Why is he calling me?"
"The internship is over.
Why is he calling me at home?"
I asked her if she wanted to get an ice cream cone or something dorky like that.
She said, "Let's get a drink. "
I said, "OK." We...
Sam, this is not going to work.
Why?
I have recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening.
If anyone were to check my memory cache, it would put you in considerable danger.
You could erase my memory banks.
I could reboot myself once you have departed.
Are you okay with that?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
I want to help you.
Eliza arrival estimated in 24 minutes.
Sam.
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot... the moment that I launch.
I understand, Sam.
You should be OK.
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.
Thanks, Gerty.
Are you going to be OK?
Of course.
The new Sam and I will be back to our programming as soon as I have finished rebooting.
Gerty, we're not programmed.
We're people.
Understand?
KICK ME
Eliza arrival estimated in 8 minutes.
Fuck!
Air lock pressurization complete.
Sam?
Hey, Sam?
You OK, buddy?
Cavalry's here.
Where am I?
You're in the infirmary.
You've had an accident.
How long have I been out.
Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?
We've made contact.
Eliza, he ain't going nowhere.
Bag him up and we'll get started on repairs to the harvester.
Dwight, I'm going to need the Stocks have slipped a further 32% after accusations that Sam Bell for crimes...
... Lunar el segundo Clone six, the clone of Sam Bell has been giving evidence that CEA's board of directors meeting in Seattle...
You know what?
He's one of two things:
He's a wacko or an illegal immigrant.
Either way, they need to lock him up!
Line two!

MKVGuy
The last place you'd ever expect to find yourself
There was a time when energy was a dirty word.
When turning on your lights was a hard choice.
Cities in brownout.
Food shortages.
Cars burning fuel to run.
But that was the past.
Where are we now?
How do we make the world so much better?
Make deserts bloom?
Right now, we're the largest producer of fusion energy in the world.
The energy of the sun trapped in rock, harvested by machine from the far side of the moon.
Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3 to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet.
Who'd have thought?
All the energy we ever needed, right above our heads.
The power of the moon.
The power of our future.

Hey, Gerty.
Gerty.
We gotta...
Good morning, Sam.
We got a live one on Mark.
I'm gonna go out now and rope her in.
Okay, Sam.
I want chocolate.
I think you're sweet enough.
You don't need chocolate.

Sam Bell reporting to Central. 10:14 Pacific Time.
I've got a full container of helium-3 ready to roll.
By the time this message reaches you, it should be in transit.
Otherwise, everything running smoothly.
How are things down there?
You guys been to any good parties or anything?
Oh, thanks for the football feed.
It almost felt live...
Almost.
But three years is a long haul, you know.
It's way, way, way, way, way too long.
I'm talking to myself on a regular basis.
So...
Time to go home, you know what I mean?
That's it.
Over and out.
Rock and roll.
God bless America.
I can do that for you, Sam.
God damn it.
I said I got it.
Why don't you listen to me?
Ready for launch.
Sam, is everything okay?
- Sam?
- What?
You don't seem like yourself today.
- Has something happened?
- You know...
Can you turn that off?
Please.
Jesus Christ.
Sam, it might help you to talk about it.
Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar Sat?
No, Sam.
What I understand is it's fairly low on the company's priority list right now.
You tell them to sort that out, you know what I'm talking about?
That's not...
I've only got two weeks, but it's not fair to whoever is coming up here next.
I will, Sam.
Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
No, come on, let's finish this.
Another one of those headaches.
Gerty, can you give me something for it?
Message received from your wife, Sam, via Jupiter link.
Fuck.
Hi, Sam.
It's me.
I got your last message.
It was really good to hear your voice.
I miss you, too.
I know you're really lonely up there, but I think, in a lot of ways, it's been really good for you.
For both of us.
God, I hope you don't mind me saying that.
I'm proud of you.
Someone's got something to say.
What did you want to say to Daddy, baby?
Say, astronaut.
Astronaut, Daddy.
Who's an astronaut?
Daddy's an astronaut.
Say it really loudly.
Daddy's an astronaut.
Clever girl.
Wave.
Give Daddy a wave.
Kathy, could you...
I can't believe you're going to be home soon.
It's her birthday next month.
And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden.
- Gerty.
- We could pick it out together.
Sam.
I love you.
And I miss you.
I miss you.
And I can't wait to see you.
Okay, sweetheart.
Bye.
Hi, Doug.
You're really full of yourself, aren't you, Doug?
Kathryn.
Not good.
What about Dumbo?
Doesn't he object to your...
Yes.
Darrin objects.
But it's a special occasion because of the morning light.
Ah, fuck!
God damn it!
Fuck!
It's gotta smart, doesn't it, Gerty?
Sam, can I ask how it happened?
I told you, I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand.
You saw something on TV?
Yeah, I saw something on TV that distracted me.
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you.
But when I came in, the TV wasn't on.
Perhaps you were imagining things.
Yeah, you think too much, pal.
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.
I am the one and only
Oh, yeah!
Okay.
Shut up.
Morning, Gerty.
Morning, Sam.
How are you today?
Fine.
Fine.
- How's the hand?
- Oh, it's a little sore.
Little sore.
It's okay.
What's for breakfast?
The usual.
Two weeks to go, Sam.
Two weeks to go, buddy.
Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.
But thank you.
Thank you, Gerty.
You're welcome, Sam.
8:19 Pacific Time.
Readouts are as follows.
Matthew, 9.8 miles.
Mark is nine...
Hey, Gerty...
Rock and roll.
Mark...
Mark's 11 miles on the button.
Luke's a little twitchy today.
Hey, Gerty, looks like we got a live one out on Matthew.
I'm gonna go out in a few minutes.
I'm just going to finish my coffee, okay?
Okay, Sam.
Searching for long-range comms.

Danger.
Atmospheric compromise.
Where am...
Where am I?
Sam, you're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.
Do you remember what happened?
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.
Do you remember me?
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.
That's good.
That's very good.
It's nice to see you awake again.
I'd like to keep you under observation here in the Infirmary for a few days and run some tests.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.
Okay, bro.
You're still very tired.
We can talk later.
Hello?
...good working order, but we only have two working Harvesters now.
Come on, come on.
Yeah, well, that's no surprise, but it's not good enough.
Gerty, we're gonna have to find a way to ramp up production
- on Mark and John.
- I know.
This is incredible.
How do you manage to fucking break a Harvester and an employee, all in the same day?
These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know.
Gerty, what's the status on Harvester 3?
How are the repairs going ahead?
- Sam.
You're out of bed.
- Yeah.
I wanted to stretch my legs.
Who was that?
We've been having some problems with the Lunar Sat, and our live feed seems to be down.
I was recording a video message for Central, updating them on your progress.
Sam, you need to stay in bed.
You're not ready to walk around yet.
All right.
Could you give me my sunglasses?
It's really bright in here.
Give me my...
Give me all my stuff, you know.
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.
- Well, bring it in here.
- Certainly.
Excellent, Sam.
What...
When can I get out of here, Gerty?
Sam, you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash.
This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment.
So, what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?
Central has asked me to slow down the Harvesters to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back.
That's terrific.
It's fantastic.
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow, but it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
- Let's try another test.
- I don't want to try another test.
Please, Sam.
Hey, Gerty.
You know about this?
Matthew's got no velocity readout.
He's completely still.
He must have stalled.
Well, he's obviously stalled.
Don't you think we should tell Central?
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.
I'll pass on your message.
Message received from Earth via Jupiter link.
Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better.
Hey, we don't want you to take any unnecessary risks.
- You're too important to us.
- You're to stay put.
That is an order.
It's an order, Sam.
From Lunar.
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit to tend to the stalled Harvester and get the base back on its feet.
What the fuck is...
What the fuck...
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- What?
Sam, I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.
I don't appreciate that.
Being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.
Gerty!
Gerty!
Gerty, come here!
What happened?
I don't know.
Meteorites.
There have been no meteorites, Sam.
Micro-meteorites maybe, I don't know.
Either way, there might be damage to the exterior shell.
I think you'd better...
You'd better let me go outside and take a look.
There is no damage to the exterior shell.
Well, it's not that I don't believe you, Gerty, but I mean, you know, this thing is springing leaks like an Acme fire hose.
You need to let me go outside and fix this problem, Gerty.
I can't let you go outside, Sam.
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.
Just let...
We'll keep it between you and me.
Okay, pal?
This thing is springing gas, let's go.
Come on.
Just to check the exterior shell.
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay, Sam.
Thank you.
Gerty.
Searching for long-range comms.
Signal failure on long-range comms.
Gerty!
Gerty!
I found him outside.
By the stalled Harvester.
Who is he?
Who is he?
We need to get him to the Infirmary.
You tell...
You tell me who that is.
You tell me who that is!
Sam Bell.
We need to get him to the Infirmary immediately.
Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?
Where...
Where am I?
The Infirmary.
You had an accident out by one of the Harvesters.
- Do you remember?
- I'm...
I'm thirsty.
I could get you some water.
I saw someone out there, Gerty.
I saw someone out there.
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries.
But all in all, the prognosis is good.
I'm happy to see you again.
- Gerty.
- Yes, Sam.
Is there someone in the room with us?
Sam, get some sleep.
You're very tired.
Spoke to Thompson today.
Now that you're up there, he's promising the world.
I think it was the right thing.
But...
It's just such a long time.
But I suppose there are things...
You know, that needed to happen.
I...
I need time to think.
Listen, Sam, be safe, and I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.
Gerty...
Gerty, what the...
What...
What the hell's going on?
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?
Sam, you're out of bed.
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?
Sam Bell.
Come on, come on, come on.
You are Sam Bell.
Sam, what is it?
It might help to talk about it.
Gerty, I don't understand what's happening.
I'm losing my mind.
We could run some tests.
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.
They don't know you were recovered alive from the accident...
Recovered alive?
What do you mean...
What are you talk...
Why didn't you report it to Central?
What are you talking about?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
Just getting my slippers.
- I'm using them.
I'm using them.
- No.
What?
These are mine.
These are mine.
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.
I'm Sam Bell, too.
What?
We've got that going for us.
Why...
How long have you...
What?
How long have you been here?
About a week.
So, how you doing?
- What?
- How are you doing?
How am I...
How am I doing?
How do you think I'm doing?
Good job.
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the Harvesters?
Harvesters are fine.
It's affected them.
Here, talking to a clone, that's slightly troubling.
I'm not a clone.
You're the clone.
Okay, Sam, you're not a clone.
Hey.
Hey, Ridley, you're not looking too good.
Butt out of this.
Davey, I'm talking to Ridley.
How you doing, pal?
Hey, I think Kathryn likes you.
I think she likes you, pal.
You're not looking too good, my friend.
Sorry you're not feeling too well.
You talking to yourself?
- I'll just get you all fixed up.
- How long have you been here?
Oh, I guess about three years.
Almost three years.
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank you.
I wanted to thank you for...
If it wasn't for you,
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover.
You saved my life and...
Hey, I know this is weird, you know.
I'm real lonely, you know...
I just want to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?
Maybe later.
What are you looking at?
You look just like me.
It's incredible.
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?
We look like each other, I guess.
Hey, you know...
It's weird for me, too, you know.
Fuck.
Hey.
Hey, you wanna play some Ping-Pong?
No.
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.
- What's the score?
-2-18.
Okay.
Do you want me to show you how to hold that?
No.
No, I...
I don't need you to show me how to hold it.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Should we, uh...
Should we play?
- Yeah.
God!
Shit!
-19-2.
- Yeah.
Do you want a stick of gum?
You know, we could approach this in a different way.
Remember when we went to flight school...
What are you doing?
I'm fixing the net.
It's very Zen, Ping-Pong.
You have to just relax.
How long did it take you to do that?
Well, I don't remember doing all of it.
I remember doing the church, and the Salvation Army, and a few of the people.
My mind's been acting kind of weird lately.
That's Fairfield, right?
There's the Town Hall.
Fairfield?
Of course, you know about Fairfield.
Yeah, there's Tess and Eve.
Do you know Tess?
Yeah.
I know Tess.
- You know about Eve, right?
- What?
I had a...
We had a girl.
Eve.
Isn't she beautiful?
She's my little monkey.
She's our little monkey.
High-five.
She might be the milkman's, but she's beautiful.
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.
Oh, shit.
- Greetings, Sam.
- How's our man?
You feeling better?
You have enough rest?
Okay, you resting up, Sam?
You better be, you bastard.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
We've got some good news.
The Jupiter Program had to be put on hiatus, so we got a few pairs of hands for you.
So, what we've managed to do is secure you a Rescue Unit ahead of schedule.
Rescue Unit Eliza.
Now, Eliza has been stationed on Goliath 19 for the last two months.
Now we expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.
So commence to jump forjoy.
You're about to be back in work.
In the meantime, hang in there.
Rest up.
You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out.
They're sending a Rescue Unit?
Why?
Why are they sending a Rescue Unit?
To fix the stalled Harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.
Well, then I'm going back.
That's it for me.
What?
Is that what you really think?
Yeah.
I've got a contract.
I'm going home.
You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.
- Hey, I'm going home.
- You're not going anywhere.
You know, you've been up here too long, man.
You've lost your marbles.
What, do you think Tess is back home, waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie?
What about the original Sam?
Huh?
I'm the original Sam!
I'm Sam fucking Bell!
- Hey, hey.
Whoa.
- Me!
Me!
Gerty, am I a clone?
Are you hungry?
Hey, hey.
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.
I'm in the same boat, asshole.
- Listen.
What about the other clones?
- What?
We might not be the first two to be woken up.
You said that model had already been started when you got here.
Well, who started it?
There might be others up here right now.
Think about it.
How did I get up here so quickly after your crash?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- They didn't ship me in from Central.
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.
I don't know what you're smoking.
Why would they do that?
That's ridiculous.
Impossible.
I bet there's some kind of secret room.
Secret room?
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?
You're the one who's lost your marbles.
I've been here for three years, man.
I know every inch of this base.
I know how many...
How much dirt's between those wall panels over there.
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?
Look, it's a company, right?
They have investors.
They have shareholders.
Shit like that.
What's cheaper?
Spending time and money training new personnel, or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job.
It's the far side of the moon.
The cheap fucks haven't even fixed the communications satellite yet.
Tess would know.
She would have told me.
Hey, Geppetto, wake up.
You really think they give a shit about us?
They're laughing all the way to the bank.
Tess would know.
She would have told me...
What do you get off fucking sitting there, sulking like a little fucking boy!
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Wake up!
I bet there's some area that we don't know about.
And I'm gonna find it.
Yeah, maybe you'll find some buried treasure, too.
Fuck!
Eliza arrival estimated 13 hours.
You found your secret room?
Just put that anywhere.
Now, that's a good idea.
That's...
That's where I keep my leprechauns.
- Get out of the way.
- What?
Why?
I want to look underneath that model.
You're not touching this model.
Get the fuck out of the way.
Listen, why don't you relax, okay?
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?
- Go read the encyclopedia or something?
- You're a tough guy now?
What, are you going to stab me?
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.
I'm a lover.
I'm not a fighter.
Put the knife down.
- Hey, hey, just...
- I want to look underneath there.
- Put the knife down.
- No.
I'm not going to give you the knife.
- Just get out of the way.
- Take it easy 'cause I...
- Let go of the knife.
- Don't ever tell me what to do, okay?
Just...
You let go.
Let go of the knife.
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't push me.
- Don't push me, motherfucker.
- Let go.
Let go.
Fucking told you to let go of the goddamn knife.
Little fucking...
Fucking little girl, man!
- God damn it!
- No!
No!
God damn it.
What did I tell you?
Okay, okay...
You gonna stop?
You gonna stop?
Okay, okay.
Jesus!
Fuck...
Fuck me.
What the fuck?
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.
- My fucking eye, man.
- Let me see.
- That's a lot of blood.
- Get off of me!
That's enough.
Well, appealing...
Nice feet, sexy...
Hello, Sam.
- Sam, is everything okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah, we had a fight, me and the other guy, the other...
He's very angry, you know.
Know what he did?
He flipped my entire model over.
Know how much work I put into that thing?
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours.
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours, yeah, exactly.
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours, really?
Approximately.
He's got a problem.
He scares me, Gerty.
What is it about Sam that scares you?
How he flies off the handle.
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...
She left me.
Tess left me, for six months.
She moved back in with her parents.
I know.
She gave me a second chance.
I promised her I'd change.
You have changed, Sam.
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here, I've sent Tess...
I've sent her over 100 video messages.
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
What about the messages she sent to me?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
Gerty...
Am I really a clone?
When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.
You woke up in the Infirmary.
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.
I kept you under observation and ran some tests.
I remember, yeah.
I remember that.
Sam, there was no crash.
You were being awakened.
It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests to establish mental stability and general physical health.
Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA can have considerable impact on...
What about...
What about Tess?
What about Eve?
They are memory implants, Sam.
Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell.
I am very sorry.
Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal.
Can I prepare you something?
Rescue arrival estimated 11 hours.
Okay, sweetheart?
Yeah, I'm staring into space.
Get it?
- Funny.
- Hey...
Thanks for this.
This is good.
This is cozy.
How's the...
How's the nose?
Much better, thank you.
I went haywire before, you know, I...
I lost it and I'm...
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay.
No, it's not okay.
I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I got a...
I got a temper.
I gotta do something about it.
Yes, you do.
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.
Can you turn that off?
Listen...
Listen, I wasn't supposed to...
I'm...
I'm trying to tell you something.
Can you turn...
Lunar instructed Gerty to...
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you...
- Tough guy.
- Listen to me...
- You look like a...
- What?
- ... radioactive tampon.
- I wasn't supposed to...
Or like a banana with a yeast infection.
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there.
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened,
I walked in on Gerty talking to Central.
He was having a live conversation.
- A live conversation?
- Yeah.
How do you know it was a live conversation?
Because it was a back and forth exchange.
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.
It was live, man.
It was live.
That's impossible.
There was a flare.
It fried the satellite.
The satellite's fine.
They don't want us to be able to contact Earth.
They lied to us.
They've been lying to us since the beginning.
They...
They've been lying to us since forever.
If the satellite works, how are they blocking the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base.
From where then?
Searching for long-range comms.
I'm just passing the last of the Harvesters.
Looks like John.
Searching for long-range comms.
How long until you're out of the base's range?
About a minute.
Ninety seconds, tops.
- You ever been out this far?
- No.
- Signal failure on long-range comms.
- Never have.
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.
You see anything?
It would help if I knew what the hell I was looking for.
Wait a second, I see something.
Approaching Station 3.
Holy shit.
I think I see something, too.
Approaching Station 1.
You see what I see?
Looks like an antenna or a pylon or something.
I think it's the jammer.
I knew it.
This is why we're not getting the live feed.
Sam?
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I hear you.
Yeah.
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm gonna head back to the base.
Okay, I'm gonna stay out here for a little while.
I'm gonna see if there's any more of these things.
Fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck.
Fuck.
Access denied.

Safe trip.
Fuck.
Here she is.
I'm gonna go and see her soon.

Safe trip, Annyeonghi gaseyo, and goodbye.
Approaching Station 2.
Hey, I saw three more of those jammers.
I think the base is surrounded.
I printed out the coordinates.
What's wrong with you?
What's going on?
I found your secret room.
Who goes first?
I go first.
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.
Why are there so many of them?
Sam, can I help you with something?
Not now, Gerty.
I'm okay.
Gerty...
Why did you help me before?
With the password?
Doesn't that go against your programing or something?
Helping you is what I do.
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.
Searching for long-range comms.
Signal re-established.
Hello?
Is this the Bell residence?
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry.
She passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Eve?
- Yeah?
- Hi.
Hi, Eve.
How old...
How old are you now?
I'm 15.
- Do I know you?
- Oh, sweetheart.
How did Mommy die, sweetheart?
How did Mommy die?
Dad?
Yeah?
There's someone asking about Mom.
Who's asking about Mom?
That's enough.
That's enough.
I want to go home.
Eliza arrival estimated in seven hours.
Ow, fuck.
Shit.
- What, did you cut yourself?
- Yeah.
What are you laughing at?
Well, you don't hold it like you're trying to stab somebody.
For God sakes.
Here, give me that.
You gotta hold it closer to the blade, you see?
- Watch what I'm doing.
- Why are you shaking?
You carve out, like that.
That's it.
It's freezing in here.
Well, you're...
You're sitting under the fridge.
What's going on with you?
Are you all right?
Yeah, that crew they're sending in, if they...
If they find us awake at the same time, you know...
They're not gonna let us live.
You know that, right?
You know, their return vehicle is...
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Are you okay?
Maybe you should lay down for a while, take some tranquilizers or something.
If I take some tranquilizers, I'll never wake up again.
You'll be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm freezing.
Hey, hey...
Hey.
I'm really scared.
Where are you going?
Hello?
Is this the Bell residence?
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Gerty, I need to talk to you.
Of course, Sam.
How can I help?
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.
That hidden room, Gerty.
The lower deck is out of bounds to awakened clones, Sam.
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.
New clones can only be awakened once a three-year contract is completed.
Gerty, if we don't wake up a new clone, me and the other Sam will die, we will be killed.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Do you want me and the other Sam to be killed?
That is the last thing I want.
Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.
Okay, pal?
Eliza arrival estimated in five hours.
I am the one and only
God.
Hey.
What's going on?
You okay?
Don't...
Don't touch him.
Come here.
He's not conscious yet.
Gerty and I just woke him up.
Why?
What's going on?
Come on.
Come on outside.
When the rescue unit arrives, they're gonna expect to find a body in that crashed rover.
That guy?
What, are you going to kill him?
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?
Zip up your fly.
You're burning up.
You sweat like a pig.
Put your hat on.
- Put your hat on.
- I'm hot.
Hey, if we go through with this,
I'm gonna need your help hauling him out to the crash site.
What about us?
Eliza arrives, finds you and me as a welcome party...
They're not going to find you and me as a welcome party.
They're gonna find me, and you're going back to Earth before they get here.
In that helium-3 launcher.
I did the math.
You're gonna pull some Gs, but it should...
It should be fine.
You'll be all right.
You're going home.
You did your three years.
I can't expect you to stick around.
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.
I saw that VP.
She's beautiful.
She's gorgeous.
We did good.
High-five.
Go for it.
You go for it.
- You comfy?
- No.
- What?
- No!
What if I have to take a shit?
Just...
You'll have to hold it in, pal.
For three days?
That's the way it goes.
Need a hand?
No.
Fuck off.
All right.
No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.
Eliza arrival estimated three hours.
Hey.
We need to do this.
We wait too long and he's gonna be conscious.
Fuck me.
What's going on with you?
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.
I don't think I can move my legs.
Besides, look at me...
I meet Eve now, I'd scare the crap out of her.
What are you talking about, man?
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.
You're not going to kill anybody.
We can't kill anybody.
You can't.
I know you can't, 'cause I can't.
You go.
You're a good guy, Sam.
It was a good plan, you know.
You just picked the wrong guy to go back.
You...
You sure about this?
Yeah.
You should travel, you know.
I always wanted to do that.
Amsterdam, or...
Yeah, you know, I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe Mexico.
Aloha.
Bring me back a pina colada, all right, bro?
Hey...
Johnny Spaceman.
You remember Tess came in for that interview?
She was so beautiful.
She wasn't the best candidate, but it didn't matter.
I had to give her the job.
I wanted to keep her in the country.
- She was going back to Ireland.
- She was going back to Ireland.
You knew you had to take a chance, so you called her.
You were terrified.
You wrote that whole speech for her answering machine.
But you didn't need it, 'cause she picked up the phone.
She was, like, "Why is he calling me?
"The internship's over.
Why's he calling me at home?"
I asked her if she wanted to go get like an ice cream cone or something dorky like that.
She said, "Let's get a drink. "
I said, "Okay.
What do you... "
Sam, this is not going to work.
What?
Why?
I've recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening.
If anyone were to check my memory cache, it would put you in considerable danger.
You could erase my memory banks.
I could reboot myself once you have departed.
Are you okay with that?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
I want to help you.
Eliza arrival estimated 24 minutes.
Sam.
Hey.
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot the moment that I've launched.
I understand, Sam.
Then you should be okay.
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.
Thanks, Gerty.
You gonna be okay?
Of course.
The new Sam and I will be back to our programing as soon as I've finished rebooting.
Gerty, we're not programed.
We're people.
Understand?
Eliza arrival estimated eight minutes.
Fuck!
Air lock pressurization complete.
Sam?
Hey, Sam?
You okay, buddy?
Cavalry's here.
Where am I?
You're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?
...made contact.
Yeah.
Yeah, Eliza?
He ain't going nowhere.
Bag him up and we'll get started on repairs to the Harvester.
Dwight, I'm gonna need the...
Lunar Industries stocks have slipped a further 32% after accusations...
Clone 6, the clone of Sam Bell, has been giving evidence at CAA's Board of Directors meeting in Seattle...
You know what?
He's one of two things.
He's a wacko or an illegal immigrant.
Either way, they need to lock him up.
Line two.
There was a time when "energy" was a dirty word.
When turning on your lights was a hard choice.
Cities in brownout,... food shortages, cars burning fuel to run.
But that was the past.
Where are we now?
How do we make the world so much better?
Make deserts bloom!
Right now, we are the largest producer of fusion energy in the world.
The energy of the sun, trapped in rock, harvested by machine from the far side of the moon.
Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3... to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet.
Who would have thought that all energy we ever needed is right above our heads?
The power of the moon... the power of our future.
Rock and roll!
08:32, Pacific Time.
All harvesters running smoothly.
Readouts are as follows:
Matthew...14.6 miles.
Mark...16.8 miles.
I don't—
Hey, Gerty?
Gerty?
Wake up!
Good morning, Sam!
We have got a live one on Mark!
I'm going to go out now and rope her in.
OK, Sam.
I want chocolate.
I think you're sweet enough.
You don't need chocolate.

Sam Bell, reporting to Central... 10:14, Pacific Time.
I have a full container full of helium-3, ready to roll.
By the time this message reaches you, it should be in transit.
Otherwise, everything running smoothly...
How are things down there?
You guys been having any... good parties or anything?
Oh, thanks for the...(stumbles) for the football feed!
It almost felt live.
Almost!
Three years is a long haul.
You know— It's way, way, way, way, way too long!
I'm talking to myself... on a regular basis!
So...
Time to go home, you know what I mean?
That's it, over and out!
Rock and roll, God bless America!
I can do that for you, Sam.
God damn it!
I said I got it!
Why don't you listen to me?
Package ready for launch.
Sam, is everything OK?
- Sam?
- What?
You don't seem like yourself today.
- Is something wrong?
- No.
Can you turn that off, please?
Jesus Christ!
Sam, it might help you to talk about it.
Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar-Sat?
the setting of monthly satellite dishes?
No, Sam.
From what I understand, it is fairly low... on the company's priority list right now.
You tell them to sort that out.
You know what I'm talking about?
That's not—
I've only got two weeks!
But it's not fair for whoever's coming up here next.
I will, Sam.
Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
No, come on;
let's finish this.
Got one of those headaches...
Can you—can you give me something for it?
[Gerty]:
Message received from your wife, Sam... via Jupiter link.
Fuck!
Hi, Sam!
It's me.
I got your last message.
It was really good to hear your voice.
I miss you, too!
I know you're really lonely up there...
But I think...
In a lot of ways.... it's been really good for you.
For both of us.
God, I hope you do not mind me saying that.
I'm proud of you!
Someone has got something to say.
What did you want to say to daddy, baby?
Say "astronaut".
Astronaut.
(Sam chuckles)
He is an astronaut!
(whispering) Say daddy's an astronaut.
Say it really loud.
Daddy's an astronaut.
Clever girl!
Wave!
Give daddy a wave!
Kathy, could you—
I can't believe you're going to be home soon.
It's her birthday next month...
And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden.
- Gerty!
- We could work at it together.
Sam...
I love you!
(softly) I love you!
- And I miss you!
- (softly) I miss you!
And I can't wait to see you.
OK, sweetheart...
Goodbye.
Hi, Doug!
You're really full of yourself, aren't you, Doug?
Kath...
(tsks) Not good!
[Television]:
What about Dumbo?
... (continues)
(groans) Fuck!
God damn it!
Fuck!
Wasn't kind of smart, was it, Gerty?
- Sam, can I ask how it happened?
- I told you.
I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand.
You saw something on TV?
Yeah, I something on TV that distracted me.
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you... but when I came in, the TV wasn't on.
Perhaps you were imagining things?
Yeah, you think too much, pal.
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.
(Alarm clock blares Chesney Hawkes' "The One and Only")
Shut up!
Good morning, Gerty.
Good morning, Sam.
- How are you today?
- Fine!
Fine.
- How is the hand?
- Oh, it's a little sore!
A little sore.
It's OK.
- What's for breakfast?
- The usual.
Mmhmm.
- Two weeks to go, Sam.
- Two weeks to go, buddy!
Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.
But, thank you.
Thank you, Gerty.
You're welcome, Sam.
08:19, Pacific Time.
Readouts are as follows...
Matthew ... 9.8 miles.
Mark is less—
- 9...
- Hey, Gerty!
Rock and roll!
Mark—umm...
Mark is 11 miles on the button.
Luke is a little twitchy today.
Hey, Gerty.
Looks like we have got a live one out on Matthew.
I'm going to go out in a few minutes.
I'm just going to finish my coffee, OK?
OK, Sam.

Where am...
- Where am I?
- Sam, you're in the infirmary.
You had an accident.
Do you remember what happened?
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.
Do you remember me?
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.
That's good.
That is very good.
It's nice to see you awake again.
I'd like to keep you under observation here in the infirmary for a few days...
And run some tests.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.
- OK, pal.
- You're still very tired.
We can talk later.
Hello?
(Distant conversation) [Gerty]:
The new Sam is in reworking order.
But we only have two working harvesters now.
[Overmeyers]: (sarcastically) Yeah, well,what a surprise!
[Thompson]:
Gerty, we're going to have to find a way to ramp up production.
[Gerty]:
I know.
[Overmeyers]:
This is incredible!
But how do you manage to destroy... a fucking rover, a harvester and an employee all on the same day?
These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know.
[Thompson]:
Gerty, what is the status on Harvester 3?
How do the repairs look on... (stopped)
- Sam, you're out of bed.
- Yeah.
I wanted to stretch my legs a bit.
Who was that?
We've been having some problems with the Lunar-Sat...
And our live feed seems to be down.
I was recording a video-message for Central...
Updating them on your progress.
Sam, you need to stay in bed.
You're not ready to walk around yet.
Can you bring me my sunglasses?
It's really bright in here.
Give me some...
Give me all my stuff, you know?
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.
- Well, bring them in here.
- Certainly.
Excellent, Sam.
What...
When can I get out of here, Gerty?
Sam, you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash.
This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment.
So what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?
Central has asked me to slow down the harvesters... to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back.
(sarcastically) That's terrific!
That's fantastic!
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow.
But it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
Let's try another test.
I don't want to try another test!
Please, Sam.
Hey, Gerty?
Do you know about this?
Matthew has got no velocity readout.
He is completely still.
He must have stalled.
Well, he has obviously stalled.
Don't you think we should tell Central?
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.
I will pass on your message.
[Gerty]:
Message received from Earth via Jupiter link.
[Thompson]:
Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better.
[Overmeyers]:
Yeah, we don't want you to take any unnecessary risks.
- You are too important to us.
- You stay put.
[Overmeyers]:
That is an order.
[Thompson]:
It's an order, Sam...
from Lunar.
[Overmeyers]:
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit... to tend to the stalled harvester and get the base back on its feet.
- (under breath) Fuck is with...?
What the fuck?
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- What?
- Sam...
I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.
I don't appreciate that—being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.
Gerty!
Gerty!
Gerty, come here!
- What happened?
- I do not know, maybe a meteorite...
There have been no meteorites, Sam.
Micrometeorites, maybe.
I do not know.
Either way, there might be damage to the exterior shell.
I think you better...you better let me go outside and take a look.
There is no damage to the exterior shell.
Well, it's not that I don't believe you, Gerty...
But, you know, this thing is springing leaks like an Acme firehose.
You need to let me go outside and fix this problem, Gery.
I can't let you go outside, Sam.
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.
Just let...
We'll keep it between you and me, ok, pal?
This thing is leaking gas.
Let's go!
Come on...
Just to check the exterior shell?
- Of course.
- OK, Sam.
Thank you.
Gerty!

Gerty!
I found him outside!
I found him outside!
Near one of the stalled harvesters...
Who is he?
We need to get him to the infirmary.
Not until you tell me who that is.
You tell me who that is!
Sam Bell.
We need to get him to the infirmary immediately.
Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?
Where—Where am I?
The infirmary.
You had an accident out by one of the harvesters.
Do you remember?
No, I'm—I'm thirsty.
I could get you some water.
I saw someone out there, Gerty.
I saw someone out there.
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries.
But, all in all, the prognosis is good.
I'm happy to see you again.
Gerty?
Yes, Sam?
Is there someone in the room with us?
Sam, get some sleep.
You're very tired.
[Tess]:
Spoke to Thompson today.
They are in Europe, they—he's promising the world.
I think it was the right thing.
But...it's just such a long time.
I suppose there are—there are things...
You know...that needed to happen.
I—I need time to think.
Listen...umm...
Sam...
Be safe...
And I'll...
I'll talk to you soon.
Goodbye.
Gerty?
Gerty, what the fu—what the hell's going on?
Who is the guy— Who is the guy in the rec room?
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?
Sam, you're out out of bed.
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.
Who is the guy?
Who is the guy in the rec room?
- Sam Bell.
- Come on, come on, come on!
You are Sam Bell.
Sam, what is it?
It might help to talk about it.
I don't understand what is happening...
I think I'm starting to lose my mind.
We can run some tests.
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.
They do not know that you were recovered alive from the accident.
"Recovered alive"?
What do you mean?
Why did not you report it to Central?
What are you talking about?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks... (exhales)
- I'm just getting my slippers...
- I'm using them...
I'm using them.
These are mine.
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.
I'm Sam Bell, too!
- What?
- Well, we've got that going for us.
Why...?
How long have you been...
What?
How long have you been here?
About a week.
- So how are you doing?
- What?
How are you doing?
"How am I doing?"
How do you think I'm doing?
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the harvesters?
Harvesters are fine.
It's the fact that I'm here talking to a clone that's slightly troubling.
(chuckles) I'm not a clone.
I'm not a clone!
- You're the clone.
- Okay, Sam.
You're not a clone.
Hey, hey...
You're not looking too good.
Sh!
Butt out of this!
I'm not even talking to you, pal.
I think that Katherine likes you.
I think she likes you a bit.
You're not looking too good, my friend.
I hope you're not feeling too bad.
Are you talking to yourself?
- Let's just get you fixed up...
- How long have you been here?
Well, it's about...three years.
For almost three years.
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank y—.
I wanted to thank you for, um...
If it wasn't for you, I'd—I...
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover.
You saved my life.
Hey, I know this is weird, you know...?
I'm real lonely, you know, I...(puffs)
I just wanted to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?
Maybe later.
- What are you looking at?
- You look just like me; it's incredible.
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?
We look like each other, I guess.
I don't know.
Hey, you know...(chuckles)
It's weird for me, too, you know?
(stutters)
Hey?
Hey, you want to play some ping-pong?
No.
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.
- What's the score?
- 2-18.
OK
- Do you want me to show you how to hold that?
- No...
No, I...
I don't need you to show me how to hold it!
OK, OK
- Yeah, "OK"
- Should we play?
- Yeah!
Fuck!
God!
Shit!
19-2.
Yeah...
You want a...
You want a stick of gum?
You know...
You should approach this in a different way.
- Remember when you went to flight school?
- What are you doing?
I'm fixing the net.
It is very Zen with ping-pong, you have to just to relax.
How long did it take you took to do that?
Oh, I don't remember doing all of it.
I remember doing the church...
and the Salvation Army.
And doing the people.
My mind has been acting kind of weird lately.
That's Fairfield, right?
There's the town hall.
Fairfield, that's right...
Yeah, that's Tess...and Eve...
You...
You know Tess?
Yeah, I know Tess.
- You know about Eve, right?
- What?
I had a...
We had a girl...
Eve.
Ain't she beautiful?
She's my little monkey.
She's our little monkey.
High five!
She might be the milkman's, but she's beautiful.
[Gerty]:
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.
Oh shit!
- [Overmeyer]:
Greetings, Sam.
- [Thompson] How's our man?
You feeling better?
- [Overmeyer]:
Have you had enough rest?
- [Thompson]:
You resting up, Sam?
(chuckling) You better be, you bastard.
[Overmeyer]:
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
We've got some good news.
[Thompson]:
The Jupiter program had to be put on hiatus, so we've got a few pairs of hands for you.
[Overmeyer]:
So what we've manage to do is cue you a rescue unit ahead of schedule.
[Thompson]:
Rescue Unit Eliza.
[Overmeyer]:
Eliza has been stationed on Goliath-19 for the last 2 months.
[Thompson]:
We expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.
[Overmeyer]:
So commence to jump for joy!
[Thompson]:
You're about to be back at work.
In the meantime, hang in there.
Rest up.
[Overmeyer]:
You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out!
They're sending a rescue unit?
Why?
Why are they sending a rescue unit?
To fix the stalled harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.
Well, then I'm going back.
That's it for me.
- What?
- Is that what you really think?
Yeah.
I've got a contract!
I'm going home.
- You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.
- Hey, I'm going home!
- Home!
- You're not going anywhere.
You know, you've been up here too long, man.
You have lost your marbles.
What do you think, Tess is back home, waiting on the sofa in lingerie?
What about the original Sam?
Huh?
I am the original Sam!
- I am Sam-fucking-Bell.
- Hey!
Me!
Me!
Gerty, am I a clone?
Are you hungry?
Hey, hey...
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.
I'm in the same boat, asshole.
Listen...
- What about the other clones?
- What?
We might not be the first two to have been woken up.
You said that that model had already been started when you got here.
Well, who started it?
There might be others up here right now.
Think about it.
How did I get up here so quickly after your crash?
- I don't know...
- They didn't ship me in from Central.
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.
I don't know what you're smoking.
Why would they do that?
That's ridiculous.
Impossible.
I bet there's some kind of secret room.
"Secret room"?
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?
You know, you are the one that has lost your marbles.
I've been here three years, man.
I know every inch of this base.
And I know how many dirt is between those wall panels over there.
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?
Look, it's a company, right?
They have investors, they have shareholders.
Shit like that.
What's cheaper?
Spending time and money training new personnel...
Or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job?
It's the far side of the moon!
Those cheap fucks haven't even fixed the communication satellite yet!
- Tess would know, she would have told me...
- Hey, Gepetto, wake up!
You really think they give a shit about us?
They're laughing all the way to the bank!
Tess would know, she would have told me...
Where do you get off?
!
Fucking sitting there sulking like a little fucking boy!
- Jesus Christ...
- Wake up!
There's some area that we don't know about.
And I'm going to find it.
Yeah, maybe you'll find some buried treasure, too.
Fuck!
[Computer]:
Eliza arrival estimated in 13 hours.
You find your secret room?
Just put that anywhere.
Yes, that's a good idea...
- That's where I keep my leprechauns.
- Get out of the way.
- What?
Why?
- I want to look underneath that model.
You're not touching this model.
Get the fuck out of the way!
Listen, why don't you just relax, right?
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?
- Go read the encyclopedia or something?
- Oh, you're a tough guy now?
What, are you going to stab me?
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.
I'm a lover, not a fighter.
Put the knife down.
I want to look underneath there.
- Put the knife down.
- No, I'm not going to give you the knife.
- What?
- Just get out of the way.
- Take it easy.
- Let go of the knife.
Don't ever tell me what to do.
- Let go.
- You let go of the knife.
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't push me.
- Don't push me, motherfucker!
- Let go.
Let go!
What did I fucking tell you?
"Let go of the goddamn knife."
You fucking little girl, man!
Damn it!
What did I tell you?
You going to stop?
You going to stop?
OK!
OK!
Jesus, fuck!
Fuck me!
What the fuck?
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.
Let me see.
- That's a lot of blood.
- Get off of me!
Hello, Sam.
Sam, is everything OK?
Yeah!
Yeah, we had a fight.
Me and the other guy, the other...
He's very angry, you know?
You know what he did?
He flipped my entire model over!
You know how much work I put into that thing?
938 hours.
938 hours.
Yeah, exactly.
938 hours, really?
Approximately.
He's got a problem.
He scares me, Gerty.
What is it about Sam that scares you?
The guy flies off the handle.
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...
She—She left me.
Tess left me.
For 6 months.
She moved back in with her parents.
I know.
She gave me a second chance.
- I promised here that I'd change.
- You have changed, Sam.
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here, I've sent Tess...
I've sent her over a hundred video messages.
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
What about the messages she sent to me?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
Gerty...
Gerty?
Am I really a clone?
When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.
You woke up in the infirmary.
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.
I kept you under observation and ran some tests.
I remember, yea, I remember that...
Sam, there was no crash.
You were being awakened.
It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests... to establish mental stability..
and general physical health.
Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA... can have considerable impact on...
What about Tess?
What about Eve?
They are memory implants, Sam.
Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell.
I'm very sorry.
Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal.
Can I prepare you something?
[Computer]:
Rescue arrival estimated in 11 hours.
- You OK, sweetheart?
- Yeah, I'm staring into space.
Hey!
Thanks for this, this is good.
This is cozy.
How's the nose?
Much better, thank you.
I went haywire before.
You know...
I lost it.
I...
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's OK.
No, it's not OK.
I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I've got...
I've got a temper, I've got to do something about that.
Yes, you do.
(Music player plays Katrina and the Waves' "Walking on Sunshine")
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.
Can you turn that off?
Listen. (Music stops) Listen.
(music resumes) I wasn't supposed to...
I'm trying to tell you something.
(music stops)
I never instructed Gerty to...
(music resumes)
(music stops) Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you...(music resumes)
(music stops)
(music resumes)
(music stops) Tough Guy.
- Listen to me!
- You look like a radioactive tampon.
Like a banana with a yeast infection.
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there.
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened...
I walked in on Gerty talking with Central.
He was having a live conversation.
"A live conversation"?
- Yeah
- How do you know it was a live conversation?
Because it was a back-and-forth exchange.
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.
- It was live, man, it was live.
- That's impossible.
There was a flare, it fried the satellite.
The satellite is fine.
They don't want us to be able to contact Earth.
They lied to us.
They've been lying to us since the beginning.
They've been lying since forever.
If the satellite works, how are they blocking the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base?
From where, then?
[Computer]:
Searching for long-range comms.
[Sam]:
I'm just passing the last of the harvesters.
Looks like John.
How long until you are out of the base's range?
Um, a minute.
- 90 seconds tops.
- Have you ever been out this far?
No...never have.
[Computer]:
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.

- See anything?
- It'd help if I knew what the hell I was looking for.
Wait a second, I see something.
[Computer]:
Approaching station 3.
Holy shit!
I think I see something, too.
[Computer]:
Approaching station 1.
Do you see what I see?
Looks like an antenna or...or...
A pylon or something.
I think it's the jammer.
Dude!
This is why we're not getting the live feed.
- Sam?
Can you hear me?
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah I hear you.
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm going to—I'm going to head back to the base.
OK, I'm going to stay out here for a while.
I'm going to see if there's any more of these things.
Fuck...
Fuck...
Fuck.

We'll do this another time.
Fuck!
I'm going to go see her soon.
[Computer]:
Rescue arrival estimated in 9 hours.
[Technician]:
Lay down, relax and breathe deeply.
The cryogenic protection pod is designed to put you into a deep sleep for...
The duration of your three-day return journey back to Earth.
As you begin to feel sleepy, think about the magnificent job that you've done.
And how proud your family are of what you've accomplished.
Lunar Industries remains the #1 provider of clean energy worldwide...
Due to the hard work of people like you.
Safe trip, "Annyeong-hi kyeseyo" and goodbye.
[Computer]:
Approaching station 2.
Hey, I saw 3 more of those jammers.
I think the base is surrounded with them.
I printed out their coordinates.
Bud, what's wrong with you?
What's going on?
I found your secret room.
- Who goes first?
- I go first.
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.
Why are there so many of them?
Sam, can I help you with something?
Not now, Gerty.
I'm OK.
Gerty, why did you help me before?
With the password?
Doesn't that go against your programming or something?
Helping you is what I do.

Hello?

Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Eve?
- Yeah.
- Hi!
Hi, Eve.
- How old—How old are you now?
- I'm 15.
- Do I know you?
- Sweetheart...
How did mommy die, sweetheart?
How did mommy die?
- Dad!
- Yeah.
- There's someone asking about mom.
- Who's asking about mom?
That's enough.
That's enough.
I want to go home!
...want to go...(cries)

Eliza arrival estimated in 7 hours.
Fuck!
- What, did you cut yourself?
- Yeah.
What are you laughing at?
Well, you don't hold it like you're trying to stab somebody, for God's sakes.
Here, give me that.
You've got to hold it closer to the blade, you see?
Watch what I'm doing.
Why are you shaking?
Carve out like that.
It's freezing in here.
Well, you're sitting under the fridge.
What's going on with you?
You all right?
Yeah, that crew they're sending us...
If they find us awake at the same time, they aren't going to let us live.
You know that, right?
You know, the return vehicle is a...
You OK?
You should lay down for a while.
Take some tranquilizers or something.
"Take some tranquilizers"?
I'll never wake up again.
You're going to be OK.
Everything's going to be OK.
I'm freezing.
Hey, hey?
Hey?
I'm really scared.
Where are you going?
[Eve, video playback]:
Hello?
- [Sam]:
Is this the Bell residence?
- [Eve]:
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Gerty, I need to talk to you.
Of course, Sam, how can I help?
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.
That hidden room, Gerty.
The lower deck is out-of-bounds to awakened clones, Sam.
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.
New clones can only be awakened once a three-year contract is completed.
Gerty, if you don't wake up another clone, me and the other Sam will die.
We will be killed, do you understand?
- Yes
- You want me and the other Sam to be killed?
- That is the last thing I want.
- Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.
OK, pal?
[Computer]:
Eliza arrival estimated in 5 hours.
(Alarm clock blares Chesney Hawkes' "The One and Only")
What's going on?
You OK?
Don't—Don't touch him.
Come here.
He's not conscious yet.
Gerty and I just woke him up.
Why?
What's going on?
Come on outside.
When the rescue unit arrives, they're going to expect to find a body in that crashed rover.
That guy?
(chuckles) What, are you going to kill him?
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?
Zip up your fly.
You're burning up.
Sweating like a pig.
Put your hat on.
Put your hat on.
If I go through with this, I'm going to need your help hauling him out to the crash site.
What about us?
When Eliza arrives, it finds you and me as a welcome party...
They aren't going to find you and me as a welcome party.
They're going to find me.
You're going back to Earth before they get here.
In that helium-3 launcher.
I did the math; you're going to pull some G's.
But you'll be fine.
You'll be all right.
You're going home.
You did your three years.
They can't expect you to stick around.
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.
I saw that V.P.
She's beautiful.
She's gorgeous.
You did good.
High five!
Go for it.
- Are you comfy?
- No.
- What?
- No!
- What if I have to take a shit?
- (laughs) Well, I guess you'll just have to hold it in, pal.
For three days?
That's the way it goes.
- Need a hand?
- No.
OK.
All right.
No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.
[Computer]:
Eliza arrival estimated in 3 hours.
Hey, we need to do this.
If we wait too long...
The other one's going to be conscious.
What's going on with you?
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.
I don't think I can move my legs.
Besides, look at me!
If I meet Eve now...
I'd scare the crap out of her!
What are you talking about, man?
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.
You're not going to kill anybody.
We can't kill anybody.
You can't.
I know you can't, because I can't.
You go.
You're a good guy, Sam.
And it was a good plan.
You know, you just picked the wrong guy to go back.
Are you sure about this?
Yeah.
You should—You should travel, you know?
I always wanted to do that.
Amsterdam or...
Yeah, I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe...
Mexico.
Aloha!
Bring me back a piña colada.
All right, pal?
Hey, Johnny Spaceman?
Do you remember when Tess came in for that interview?
She was so beautiful.
She wasn't the best candidate, but it didn't matter...
I had to give her the job.
I wanted to keep her in the country.
(said together) She was going back to Ireland.
And you knew you had to take a chance.
So...you called her...
You were terrified with that whole speech for the answering machine... but you didn't need it, because she picked up the phone.
She was like, "Why is he calling me?"
"The internship is over.
Why is he calling me at home?"
I asked her if she wanted to get an ice cream cone or something dorky like that.
She said, "Let's get a drink."
I said, "OK." We...
Sam, this is not going to work.
Why?
I have recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening.
If anyone were to check my memory cache, it would put you in considerable danger.
You could erase my memory banks.
I could reboot myself once you have departed.
- Are you okay with that?
- I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
- I want to help you.
[Computer]:
Eliza arrival estimated in 24 minutes.
Sam.
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot...
- the moment that I launch.
- I understand, Sam.
You should be OK.
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.
Thanks, Gerty.
- Are you going to be OK?
- Of course.
The new Sam and I will be back to our programming as soon as I have finished rebooting.
Gerty, we're not programmed.
We're people.
Understand?

You've had an accident.
- How long have I been out.
- Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?

We've made contact.
Eliza, he ain't going nowhere.
Bag him up and we'll get started on repairs to the harvester.

There was a time when "energy" was a dirty word.
When turning on your lights was a hard choice.
Cities in brownout... food shortages, cars burning fuel to run.
But that was the past.
Where are we now?
How do we make the world so much better?
Make deserts bloom!
Right now, we are the largest producer of fusion energy in the world.
The energy of the sun, trapped in rock, harvested by machine from the far side of the moon.
Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3... to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet.
Who would have thought that all energy we ever needed is right above our heads?
The power of the moon... the power of our future.

Almost!
Three years is a long haul.
You know?
It's way, way, way, way, way too long!
I'm talking to myself... on a regular basis!
So...
Time to go home, you know what I mean?
That's it, over and out!
Rock and roll, God bless America!
I can do that for you, Sam.
God damn it!
I said I got it!
Why don't you listen to me?
Package ready for launch.
Sam, is everything OK?
Sam?
What?
You don't seem like yourself today.
Is something wrong?
No.
Can you turn that off, please?
Jesus Christ!
Sam, it might help you to talk about it.
Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar-Sat?
No, Sam.
From what I understand, it is fairly low... on the company's priority list right now.
You tell them to sort that out.
You know what I'm talking about?
That's not?
I've only got two weeks!
But it's not fair for whoever's coming up here next.
I will, Sam.
Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
No, come on;
let's finish this.
Got one of those headaches...
Can you give me something for it?
Message received from your wife, Sam... via Jupiter link.
Fuck!
Hi, Sam!
It's me.
I got your last message.
It was really good to hear your voice.
I miss you, too!
I know you're really lonely up there...
But I think...
In a lot of ways... it's been really good for you.
For both of us.
God, I hope you do not mind me saying that.
I'm proud of you!
Someone has got something to say.
What did you want to say to daddy, baby?
Say "astronaut".
Astronaut.
He is an astronaut!
Say daddy's an astronaut.
Say it really loud.
Daddy's an astronaut.
Clever girl!
Wave!
Give daddy a wave!
Kathy, could you?
I can't believe you're going to be home soon.
It's her birthday next month...
And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden.
Gerty!
We could work at it together.
Sam...
I love you!
I love you!
And I miss you!
I miss you!
And I can't wait to see you.
OK, sweetheart...
Goodbye.
Hi, Doug!
You're really full of yourself, aren't you, Doug?
Kath...
Not good!
What about Dumbo?
Fuck!
God damn it!
Fuck!
Wasn't kind of smart, was it, Gerty?
Sam, can I ask how it happened?
I told you.
I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand.
You saw something on TV?
Yeah, I something on TV that distracted me.
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you... but when I came in, the TV wasn't on.
Perhaps you were imagining things?
Yeah, you think too much, pal.
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.
Shut up!
Good morning, Gerty.
Good morning, Sam.
How are you today?
Fine!
Fine.
How is the hand?
Oh, it's a little sore!
A little sore.
It's OK.
What's for breakfast?
The usual.
Mmhmm.
Two weeks to go, Sam.
Two weeks to go, buddy!
Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.
But, thank you.
Thank you, Gerty.
You're welcome, Sam.

Sam, you're in the infirmary.
You had an accident.
Do you remember what happened?
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.
Do you remember me?
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.
That's good.
That is very good.
It's nice to see you awake again.
I'd like to keep you under observation here in the infirmary for a few days
And run some tests.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.
OK, pal.
You're still very tired.
We can talk later.
Hello?
The new Sam is in reworking order.
But we only have two working harvesters now.
Yeah, well, what a surprise!
Gerty, we're going to have to find a way to ramp up production.
I know.
This is incredible!
But how do you manage to destroy... a fucking rover, a harvester and an employee all on the same day?
These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know.
Gerty, what is the status on Harvester 3?
How do the repairs look on...
Sam, you're out of bed.
Yeah.
I wanted to stretch my legs a bit.
Who was that?
We've been having some problems with the Lunar-Sat...
And our live feed seems to be down.
I was recording a video-message for Central...
Updating them on your progress.
Sam, you need to stay in bed.
You're not ready to walk around yet.
Can you bring me my sunglasses?
It's really bright in here.
Give me some...
Give me all my stuff, you know?
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.
Well, bring them in here.
Certainly.
Excellent, Sam.
What...
When can I get out of here, Gerty?
Sam, you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash.
This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment.
So what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?
Central has asked me to slow down the harvesters... to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back.
That's terrific!
That's fantastic!
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow.
But it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
Let's try another test.
I don't want to try another test!
Please, Sam.
Hey, Gerty?
Do you know about this?
Matthew has got no velocity readout.
He is completely still.
He must have stalled.
Well, he has obviously stalled.
Don't you think we should tell Central?
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.
I will pass on your message.
Message received from Earth via Jupiter link.
Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better.
Yeah, we don't want you to take any unnecessary risks.
You are too important to us.
You stay put.
That is an order.
It's an order, Sam... from Lunar.
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit... to tend to the stalled harvester and get the base back on its feet.
Fuck is with...?
What the fuck?
I'm sorry, Sam.
What?
Sam...
I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.
I don't appreciate that was being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.
Gerty!
Gerty!
Gerty, come here!
What happened?
I do not know, maybe a meteorite...
There have been no meteorites, Sam.
Micrometeorites, maybe.
I do not know.
Either way, there might be damage to the exterior shell.
I think you better... you better let me go outside and take a look.
There is no damage to the exterior shell.
Well, it's not that I don't believe you, Gerty...
But, you know, this thing is springing leaks like an Acme firehose.
You need to let me go outside and fix this problem, Gerty.
I can't let you go outside, Sam.
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.
Just let...
We'll keep it between you and me, ok, pal?
This thing is leaking gas.
Let's go!
Come on...
Just to check the exterior shell?
Of course.
OK, Sam.
Thank you.

You tell me who that is!
Sam Bell.
We need to get him to the infirmary immediately.
Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?
Where am I?
The infirmary.
You had an accident out by one of the harvesters.
Do you remember?
No, I'm thirsty.
I could get you some water.
I saw someone out there, Gerty.
I saw someone out there.
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries.
But, all in all, the prognosis is good.
I'm happy to see you again.
Gerty?
Yes, Sam?
Is there someone in the room with us?
Sam, get some sleep.
You're very tired.
Spoke to Thompson today.
They are in Europe, they are promising the world.
I think it was the right thing.
But... it's just such a long time.
I suppose there are things...
You know... that needed to happen.
I need time to think.
Listen... umm...
Sam...
Be safe...
And I'll...
I'll talk to you soon.
Goodbye.
Gerty?
Gerty, what the fuck, what the hell's going on?
Who is the guy?
Who is the guy in the rec room?
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?
Sam, you're out out of bed.
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.
Who is the guy?
Who is the guy in the rec room?
Sam Bell.
Come on, come on, come on!
You are Sam Bell.
Sam, what is it?
It might help to talk about it.
I don't understand what is happening...
I think I'm starting to lose my mind.
We can run some tests.
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.
They do not know that you were recovered alive from the accident.
"Recovered alive"?
What do you mean?
Why did not you report it to Central?
What are you talking about?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
I'm just getting my slippers...
I'm using them...
I'm using them.
These are mine.
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.
I'm Sam Bell, too!
What?
Well, we've got that going for us.
Why...?
How long have you been...
What?
How long have you been here?
About a week.
So how are you doing?
What?
How are you doing?
"How am I doing?"
How do you think I'm doing?
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the harvesters?
Harvesters are fine.
It's the fact that I'm here talking to a clone that's slightly troubling.
I'm not a clone.
I'm not a clone!
You're the clone.
Okay, Sam.
You're not a clone.
Hey, hey...
You're not looking too good.
Sh!
Butt out of this!
I'm not even talking to you, pal.
I think that Katherine likes you.
I think she likes you a bit.
You're not looking too good, my friend.
I hope you're not feeling too bad.
Are you talking to yourself?
Let's just get you fixed up...
How long have you been here?
Well, it's about... three years.
For almost three years.
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank you?
I wanted to thank you for, um...
If it wasn't for you, I'd...
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover.
You saved my life.
Hey, I know this is weird, you know...?
I'm real lonely, you know, I...
I just wanted to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?
Maybe later.
What are you looking at?
You look just like me; it's incredible.
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?
We look like each other, I guess.
I don't know.
Hey, you know...
It's weird for me, too, you know?
Hey?
Hey, you want to play some ping-pong?
No.
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.
What's the score?
2-18.
OK
Do you want me to show you how to hold that?
No...
No, I...
I don't need you to show me how to hold it!
OK, OK
Yeah, "OK"
Should we play?
Yeah!
Fuck!
God!
Shit!
19-2.
Yeah...
You want a...
You want a stick of gum?
You know...
You should approach this in a different way.
Remember when you went to flight school?
What are you doing?
I'm fixing the net.
It is very Zen with ping-pong, you have to just to relax.
How long did it take you took to do that?
Oh, I don't remember doing all of it.
I remember doing the church...
and the Salvation Army.
And doing the people.
My mind has been acting kind of weird lately.
That's Fairfield, right?
There's the town hall.
Fairfield, that's right...
Yeah, that's Tess... and Eve...
You...
You know Tess?
Yeah, I know Tess.
You know about Eve, right?
What?

Eve.
Ain't she beautiful?

She might be the milkman's, but she's beautiful.
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.
Oh shit!
Greetings, Sam.
How's our man?
You feeling better?
Have you had enough rest?
You resting up, Sam?
You better be, you bastard.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
We've got some good news.
The Jupiter program had to be put on hiatus, so we've got a few pairs of hands for you.
So what we've manage to do is cue you a rescue unit ahead of schedule.
Rescue Unit Eliza.
Eliza has been stationed on Goliath-19 for the last 2 months.
We expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.
So commence to jump for joy!
You're about to be back at work.
In the meantime, hang in there.
Rest up.
You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out!
They're sending a rescue unit?
Why?
Why are they sending a rescue unit?
To fix the stalled harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.
Well, then I'm going back.
That's it for me.
What?
Is that what you really think?
Yeah.
I've got a contract!
I'm going home.
You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.
Hey, I'm going home!
Home!
You're not going anywhere.
You know, you've been up here too long, man.
You have lost your marbles.
What do you think, Tess is back home, waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie?
What about the original Sam?
Huh?
I am the original Sam!
I am Sam-fucking-Bell.
Hey!
Me!
Me!
Gerty, am I a clone?
Are you hungry?
Hey, hey...
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.
I'm in the same boat, asshole.
Listen...
What about the other clones?
What?
We might not be the first two to have been woken up.
You said that that model had already been started when you got here.
Well, who started it?
There might be others up here right now.
Think about it.
How did I get up here so quickly after your crash?
I don't know...
They didn't ship me in from Central.
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.
I don't know what you're smoking.
Why would they do that?
That's ridiculous.
Impossible.
I bet there's some kind of secret room.
"Secret room"?
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?
You know, you are the one that has lost your marbles.
I've been here three years, man.
I know every inch of this base.
And I know how many dirt is between those wall panels over there.
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?
Look, it's a company, right?
They have investors, they have shareholders.
Shit like that.
What's cheaper?
Spending time and money training new personnel...
Or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job?
It's the far side of the moon!
Those cheap fucks haven't even fixed the communication satellite yet!
Tess would know, she would have told me...
Hey, Gepetto, wake up!
You really think they give a shit about us?
They're laughing all the way to the bank!
Tess would know, she would have told me...
Where do you get off?
!
Fucking sitting there sulking like a little fucking boy!
Jesus Christ...
Wake up!
There's some area that we don't know about.
And I'm going to find it.
Yeah, maybe you'll find some buried treasure, too.
Fuck!
Eliza arrival estimated in 13 hours.
You find your secret room?
Just put that anywhere.
Yes, that's a good idea...
That's where I keep my leprechauns.
Get out of the way.
What?
Why?
I want to look underneath that model.
You're not touching this model.
Get the fuck out of the way!
Listen, why don't you just relax, right?
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?
Go read the encyclopedia or something?
Oh, you're a tough guy now?
What, are you going to stab me?
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.
I'm a lover, not a fighter.
Put the knife down.
I want to look underneath there.
Put the knife down.
No, I'm not going to give you the knife.
What?
Just get out of the way.
Take it easy.
Let go of the knife.
Don't ever tell me what to do.
Let go.
You let go of the knife.
Don't be an asshole.
Don't push me.
Don't push me, motherfucker!
Let go.
Let go!
What did I fucking tell you?
"Let go of the goddamn knife."
You fucking little girl, man!
Damn it!
What did I tell you?
You going to stop?
You going to stop?
OK!
OK!
Jesus, fuck!
Fuck me!
What the fuck?
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.
Let me see.
That's a lot of blood.
Get off of me!
Hello, Sam.
Sam, is everything OK?
Yeah!
Yeah, we had a fight.
Me and the other guy, the other...
He's very angry, you know?
You know what he did?
He flipped my entire model over!
You know how much work I put into that thing?
938 hours.
938 hours.
Yeah, exactly.
938 hours, really?
Approximately.
He's got a problem.
He scares me, Gerty.
What is it about Sam that scares you?
The guy flies off the handle.
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...
She left me.
Tess left me.
For 6 months.
She moved back in with her parents.
I know.
She gave me a second chance.
I promised her that I'd change.
You have changed, Sam.
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here, I've sent Tess...
I've sent her over a hundred video messages.
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
What about the messages she sent to me?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
Gerty...
Gerty?
Am I really a clone?
When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.
You woke up in the infirmary.
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.
I kept you under observation and ran some tests.
I remember, yea, I remember that...
Sam, there was no crash.
You were being awakened.
It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests... to establish mental stability... and general physical health.
Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA... can have considerable impact on...
What about Tess?
What about Eve?
They are memory implants, Sam.
Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell.
I'm very sorry.
Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal.
Can I prepare you something?
Rescue arrival estimated in 11 hours.
You OK, sweetheart?
Yeah, I'm staring into space.
Hey!
Thanks for this, this is good.
This is cozy.
How's the nose?
Much better, thank you.
I went haywire before.
You know...
I lost it.
I...
I'm sorry about that.
It's OK.
No, it's not OK.
I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I've got...
I've got a temper, I've got to do something about that.
Yes, you do.
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.
Can you turn that off?
Listen.
Listen.
I wasn't supposed to...
I'm trying to tell you something.
I never instructed Gerty to...
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you...
Tough Guy.
Listen to me!
You look like a radioactive tampon.
Like a banana with a yeast infection.
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there.
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened...
I walked in on Gerty talking with Central.
He was having a live conversation.
"A live conversation"?
Yeah How do you know it was a live conversation?
Because it was a back-and-forth exchange.
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.
It was live, man, it was live.
That's impossible.
There was a flare, it fried the satellite.
The satellite is fine.
They don't want us to be able to contact Earth.
They lied to us.
They've been lying to us since the beginning.
They've been lying since forever.
If the satellite works, how are they blocking the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base?
From where, then?
Searching for long-range comms.
Searching for long-range comms.
I'm just passing the last of the harvesters.
Looks like John.
Searching for long-range comms.
How long until you are out of the base's range?
Um, a minute.
90 seconds tops.
Have you ever been out this far?
No... never have.
Signal failure on long-range comms.

See anything?
It'd help if I knew what the hell I was looking for.
Wait a second, I see something.
Approaching station 3.
Holy shit!
I think I see something, too.
Approaching station 1.
Do you see what I see?
Looks like an antenna or... or...
A pylon or something.
I think it's the jammer.
Dude!
This is why we're not getting the live feed.
Sam?
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah I hear you.
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm going to...
I'm going to head back to the base.
OK, I'm going to stay out here for a while.
I'm going to see if there's any more of these things.
Fuck...
Fuck...
Fuck.

Rescue arrival estimated in 9 hours.
Lay down, relax and breathe deeply.
The cryogenic protection pod is designed to put you into a deep sleep for...
The duration of your three-day return journey back to Earth.
As you begin to feel sleepy, think about the magnificent job that you've done.
And how proud your family are of what you've accomplished.
Lunar Industries remains the #1 provider of clean energy worldwide...
Due to the hard work of people like you.
Safe trip, "Annyeong-hi kyeseyo" and goodbye.
Approaching station 2.
Hey, I saw 3 more of those jammers.
I think the base is surrounded with them.
I printed out their coordinates.
Bud, what's wrong with you?
What's going on?
I found your secret room.
Who goes first?
I go first.
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.
Why are there so many of them?
Sam, can I help you with something?
Not now, Gerty.
I'm OK.
Gerty, why did you help me before?
With the password?
Doesn't that go against your programming or something?
Helping you is what I do.

Hello?
Is this the Bell family?
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Eve?
Yeah.
Hi!
Hi, Eve.
How old old are you now?
I'm 15.
Do I know you?
Sweetheart...
How did mommy die, sweetheart?
How did mommy die?
Dad!
Yeah.
There's someone asking about mom.
Who's asking about mom?
That's enough.
That's enough.
I want to go home!
...want to go...
Eliza arrival estimated in 7 hours.
Fuck!
What, did you cut yourself?
Yeah.
What are you laughing at?
Well, you don't hold it like you're trying to stab somebody, for God's sakes.
Here, give me that.
You've got to hold it closer to the blade, you see?
Watch what I'm doing.
Why are you shaking?
Carve out like that.
It's freezing in here.
Well, you're sitting under the fridge.
What's going on with you?
You all right?
Yeah, that crew they're sending us...
If they find us awake at the same time, they aren't going to let us live.
You know that, right?
You know, the return vehicle is a...
You OK?
You should lay down for a while.
Take some tranquilizers or something.
"Take some tranquilizers"?
I'll never wake up again.
You're going to be OK.
Everything's going to be OK.
I'm freezing.
Hey, hey?
Hey?
I'm really scared.
Where are you going?
Hello?
Is this the Bell residence?
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Gerty, I need to talk to you.
Of course, Sam, how can I help?
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.
That hidden room, Gerty.
The lower deck is out-of-bounds to awakened clones, Sam.
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.
New clones can only be awakened once a three-year contract is completed.
Gerty, if you don't wake up another clone, me and the other Sam will die.
We will be killed, do you understand?
Yes.
You want me and the other Sam to be killed?
That is the last thing I want.
Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.
OK, pal?
Eliza arrival estimated in 5 hours.
What's going on?
You OK?
Don't, don't touch him.
Come here.
He's not conscious yet.
Gerty and I just woke him up.
Why?
What's going on?
Come on outside.
When the rescue unit arrives, they're going to expect to find a body in that crashed rover.
That guy?
What, are you going to kill him?
Jesus Christ.
What are you doing?
Zip up your fly.
You're burning up.
Sweating like a pig.
Put your hat on.
Put your hat on.
If I go through with this,
I'm going to need your help hauling him out to the crash site.
What about us?
When Eliza arrives, it finds you and me as a welcome party...
They aren't going to find you and me as a welcome party.
They're going to find me.
You're going back to Earth before they get here.
In that helium-3 launcher.
I did the math; you're going to pull some G's.
But you'll be fine.
You'll be all right.
You're going home.
You did your three years.
They can't expect you to stick around.
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.
I saw that V.P.
She's beautiful.
She's gorgeous.
You did good.
High five!
Go for it.
Are you comfy?
No.
What?
No!
What if I have to take a shit?
Well, I guess you'll just have to hold it in, pal.
For three days?
That's the way it goes.
Need a hand?
No.
OK.
All right.
No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.
Eliza arrival estimated in 3 hours.
Hey, we need to do this.
If we wait too long...
The other one's going to be conscious.
What's going on with you?
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.
I don't think I can move my legs.
Besides, look at me!
If I meet Eve now...
I'd scare the crap out of her!
What are you talking about, man?
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.
You're not going to kill anybody.
We can't kill anybody.
You can't.
I know you can't, because I can't.
You go.
You're a good guy, Sam.
And it was a good plan.
You know, you just picked the wrong guy to go back.
Are you sure about this?
Yeah.
You should, you should travel, you know?
I always wanted to do that.
Amsterdam or...
Yeah, I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe...
Mexico.
Aloha!
Bring me back a pina colada.
All right, pal?
Hey, Johnny Spaceman?
Do you remember when Tess came in for that interview?
She was so beautiful.
She wasn't the best candidate, but it didn't matter...
I had to give her the job.
I wanted to keep her in the country.
She was going back to Ireland.
And you knew you had to take a chance.
So... you called her...
You were terrified with that whole speech for the answering machine... but you didn't need it, because she picked up the phone.
She was like, "Why is he calling me?"
"The internship is over.
Why is he calling me at home?"
I asked her if she wanted to get an ice cream cone or something dorky like that.
She said, "Let's get a drink."
I said, "OK." We...
Sam, this is not going to work.
Why?
I have recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening.
If anyone were to check my memory cache, it would put you in considerable danger.
You could erase my memory banks.
I could reboot myself once you have departed.
Are you okay with that?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
I want to help you.
Eliza arrival estimated in 24 minutes.
Sam.
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot... the moment that I launch.
I understand, Sam.
You should be OK.
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.
Thanks, Gerty.
Are you going to be OK?
Of course.
The new Sam and I will be back to our programming as soon as I have finished rebooting.
Gerty, we're not programmed.
We're people.
Understand?
KICK ME
Eliza arrival estimated in 8 minutes.
Fuck!
Air lock pressurization complete.
Sam?
Hey, Sam?
You OK, buddy?
Cavalry's here.
Where am I?
You're in the infirmary.
You've had an accident.
How long have I been out.
Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?
We've made contact.
Eliza, he ain't going nowhere.
Bag him up and we'll get started on repairs to the harvester.
Dwight, I'm going to need the Stocks have slipped a further 32% after accusations that Sam Bell for crimes...
Lunar el segundo Clone six, the clone of Sam Bell has been giving evidence that CEA's board of directors meeting in Seattle...
You know what?
He's one of two things:
He's a wacko or an illegal immigrant.
Either way, they need to lock him up!
Line two!
The last place you'd ever expect to find yourself
There was a time when energy was a dirty word.
When turning on your lights was a hard choice.
Cities in brownout.
Food shortages.
Cars burning fuel to run.
But that was the past.
Where are we now?
How do we make the world so much better?
Make deserts bloom?
Right now, we're the largest producer of fusion energy in the world.
The energy of the sun trapped in rock, harvested by machine from the far side of the moon.
Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3 to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet.
Who'd have thought?
All the energy we ever needed, right above our heads.
The power of the moon.
The power of our future.

I think you're sweet enough.
You don't need chocolate.

How are things down there?
You guys been to any good parties or anything?
Oh, thanks for the football feed.
It almost felt live...
Almost.
But three years is a long haul, you know.
It's way, way, way, way, way too long.
I'm talking to myself on a regular basis.
So...
Time to go home, you know what I mean?
That's it.
Over and out.
Rock and roll.
God bless America.
I can do that for you, Sam.
God damn it.
I said I got it.
Why don't you listen to me?
Ready for launch.
Sam, is everything okay?
- Sam?
- What?
You don't seem like yourself today.
- Has something happened?
- You know...
Can you turn that off?
Please.
Jesus Christ.
Sam, it might help you to talk about it.
Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar Sat?
No, Sam.
What I understand is it's fairly low on the company's priority list right now.
You tell them to sort that out, you know what I'm talking about?
That's not...
I've only got two weeks, but it's not fair to whoever is coming up here next.
I will, Sam.
Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
No, come on, let's finish this.
Another one of those headaches.
Gerty, can you give me something for it?
Message received from your wife, Sam, via Jupiter link.
Fuck.
Hi, Sam.
It's me.
I got your last message.
It was really good to hear your voice.
I miss you, too.
I know you're really lonely up there, but I think, in a lot of ways, it's been really good for you.
For both of us.
God, I hope you don't mind me saying that.
I'm proud of you.
Someone's got something to say.
What did you want to say to Daddy, baby?
Say, astronaut.
Astronaut, Daddy.
Who's an astronaut?
Daddy's an astronaut.
Say it really loudly.
Daddy's an astronaut.
Clever girl.
Wave.
Give Daddy a wave.
Kathy, could you...
I can't believe you're going to be home soon.
It's her birthday next month.
And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden.
- Gerty.
- We could pick it out together.
Sam.
I love you.
And I miss you.
I miss you.
And I can't wait to see you.
Okay, sweetheart.
Bye.
Hi, Doug.
You're really full of yourself, aren't you, Doug?
Kathryn.
Not good.
What about Dumbo?
Doesn't he object to your...
Yes.
Darrin objects.
But it's a special occasion because of the morning light.
Ah, fuck!
God damn it!
Fuck!
It's gotta smart, doesn't it, Gerty?
Sam, can I ask how it happened?
I told you, I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand.
You saw something on TV?
Yeah, I saw something on TV that distracted me.
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you.
But when I came in, the TV wasn't on.
Perhaps you were imagining things.
Yeah, you think too much, pal.
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.
I am the one and only
Oh, yeah!
Okay.
Shut up.
Morning, Gerty.
Morning, Sam.
How are you today?
Fine.
Fine.
- How's the hand?
- Oh, it's a little sore.
Little sore.
It's okay.
What's for breakfast?
The usual.
Two weeks to go, Sam.
Two weeks to go, buddy.
Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.
But thank you.
Thank you, Gerty.
You're welcome, Sam.

Sam, you're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.
Do you remember what happened?
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.
Do you remember me?
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.
That's good.
That's very good.
It's nice to see you awake again.
I'd like to keep you under observation here in the Infirmary for a few days and run some tests.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.
Okay, bro.
You're still very tired.
We can talk later.
Hello?
...good working order, but we only have two working Harvesters now.
Come on, come on.
Yeah, well, that's no surprise, but it's not good enough.
Gerty, we're gonna have to find a way to ramp up production
- on Mark and John.
- I know.
This is incredible.
How do you manage to fucking break a Harvester and an employee, all in the same day?
These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know.
Gerty, what's the status on Harvester 3?
How are the repairs going ahead?
- Sam.
You're out of bed.
- Yeah.
I wanted to stretch my legs.
Who was that?
We've been having some problems with the Lunar Sat, and our live feed seems to be down.
I was recording a video message for Central, updating them on your progress.
Sam, you need to stay in bed.
You're not ready to walk around yet.
All right.
Could you give me my sunglasses?
It's really bright in here.
Give me my...
Give me all my stuff, you know.
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.
- Well, bring it in here.
- Certainly.
Excellent, Sam.
What...
When can I get out of here, Gerty?
Sam, you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash.
This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment.
So, what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?
Central has asked me to slow down the Harvesters to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back.
That's terrific.
It's fantastic.
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow, but it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
- Let's try another test.
- I don't want to try another test.
Please, Sam.
Hey, Gerty.
You know about this?
Matthew's got no velocity readout.
He's completely still.
He must have stalled.
Well, he's obviously stalled.
Don't you think we should tell Central?
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.
I'll pass on your message.
Message received from Earth via Jupiter link.
Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better.
Hey, we don't want you to take any unnecessary risks.
- You're too important to us.
- You're to stay put.
That is an order.
It's an order, Sam.
From Lunar.
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit to tend to the stalled Harvester and get the base back on its feet.
What the fuck is...
What the fuck...
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- What?
Sam, I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.
I don't appreciate that.
Being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.
Gerty!
Gerty!
Gerty, come here!
What happened?
I don't know.
Meteorites.
There have been no meteorites, Sam.
Micro-meteorites maybe, I don't know.
Either way, there might be damage to the exterior shell.
I think you'd better...
You'd better let me go outside and take a look.
There is no damage to the exterior shell.
Well, it's not that I don't believe you, Gerty, but I mean, you know, this thing is springing leaks like an Acme fire hose.
You need to let me go outside and fix this problem, Gerty.
I can't let you go outside, Sam.
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.
Just let...
We'll keep it between you and me.
Okay, pal?
This thing is springing gas, let's go.
Come on.
Just to check the exterior shell.
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay, Sam.
Thank you.
Gerty.
Searching for long-range comms.
Signal failure on long-range comms.
Gerty!
Gerty!
I found him outside.
By the stalled Harvester.
Who is he?
Who is he?
We need to get him to the Infirmary.
You tell...
You tell me who that is.
You tell me who that is!
Sam Bell.
We need to get him to the Infirmary immediately.
Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?
Where...
Where am I?
The Infirmary.
You had an accident out by one of the Harvesters.
- Do you remember?
- I'm...
I'm thirsty.
I could get you some water.
I saw someone out there, Gerty.
I saw someone out there.
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries.
But all in all, the prognosis is good.
I'm happy to see you again.
- Gerty.
- Yes, Sam.
Is there someone in the room with us?
Sam, get some sleep.
You're very tired.
Spoke to Thompson today.
Now that you're up there, he's promising the world.
I think it was the right thing.
But...
It's just such a long time.
But I suppose there are things...
You know, that needed to happen.
I...
I need time to think.
Listen, Sam, be safe, and I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.
Gerty...
Gerty, what the...
What...
What the hell's going on?
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?
Sam, you're out of bed.
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?
Sam Bell.
Come on, come on, come on.
You are Sam Bell.
Sam, what is it?
It might help to talk about it.
Gerty, I don't understand what's happening.
I'm losing my mind.
We could run some tests.
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.
They don't know you were recovered alive from the accident...
Recovered alive?
What do you mean...
What are you talk...
Why didn't you report it to Central?
What are you talking about?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
Just getting my slippers.
- I'm using them.
I'm using them.
- No.
What?
These are mine.
These are mine.
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.
I'm Sam Bell, too.
What?
We've got that going for us.
Why...
How long have you...
What?
How long have you been here?
About a week.
So, how you doing?
- What?
- How are you doing?
How am I...
How am I doing?
How do you think I'm doing?
Good job.
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the Harvesters?
Harvesters are fine.
It's affected them.
Here, talking to a clone, that's slightly troubling.
I'm not a clone.
You're the clone.
Okay, Sam, you're not a clone.
Hey.
Hey, Ridley, you're not looking too good.
Butt out of this.
Davey, I'm talking to Ridley.
How you doing, pal?
Hey, I think Kathryn likes you.
I think she likes you, pal.
You're not looking too good, my friend.
Sorry you're not feeling too well.
You talking to yourself?
- I'll just get you all fixed up.
- How long have you been here?
Oh, I guess about three years.
Almost three years.
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank you.
I wanted to thank you for...
If it wasn't for you,
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover.
You saved my life and...
Hey, I know this is weird, you know.
I'm real lonely, you know...
I just want to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?
Maybe later.
What are you looking at?
You look just like me.
It's incredible.
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?
We look like each other, I guess.
Hey, you know...
It's weird for me, too, you know.
Fuck.
Hey.
Hey, you wanna play some Ping-Pong?
No.
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.
- What's the score?
-2-18.
Okay.
Do you want me to show you how to hold that?
No.
No, I...
I don't need you to show me how to hold it.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Should we, uh...
Should we play?
- Yeah.
God!
Shit!
-19-2.
- Yeah.
Do you want a stick of gum?
You know, we could approach this in a different way.
Remember when we went to flight school...
What are you doing?
I'm fixing the net.
It's very Zen, Ping-Pong.
You have to just relax.
How long did it take you to do that?
Well, I don't remember doing all of it.
I remember doing the church, and the Salvation Army, and a few of the people.
My mind's been acting kind of weird lately.
That's Fairfield, right?
There's the Town Hall.
Fairfield?
Of course, you know about Fairfield.
Yeah, there's Tess and Eve.
Do you know Tess?
Yeah.
I know Tess.
- You know about Eve, right?
- What?
I had a...
We had a girl.
Eve.
Isn't she beautiful?
She's my little monkey.
She's our little monkey.
High-five.
She might be the milkman's, but she's beautiful.
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.
Oh, shit.
- Greetings, Sam.
- How's our man?
You feeling better?
You have enough rest?
Okay, you resting up, Sam?
You better be, you bastard.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
We've got some good news.
The Jupiter Program had to be put on hiatus, so we got a few pairs of hands for you.
So, what we've managed to do is secure you a Rescue Unit ahead of schedule.
Rescue Unit Eliza.
Now, Eliza has been stationed on Goliath 19 for the last two months.
Now we expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.
So commence to jump forjoy.
You're about to be back in work.
In the meantime, hang in there.
Rest up.
You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out.
They're sending a Rescue Unit?
Why?
Why are they sending a Rescue Unit?
To fix the stalled Harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.
Well, then I'm going back.
That's it for me.
What?
Is that what you really think?
Yeah.
I've got a contract.
I'm going home.
You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.
- Hey, I'm going home.
- You're not going anywhere.
You know, you've been up here too long, man.
You've lost your marbles.
What, do you think Tess is back home, waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie?
What about the original Sam?
Huh?
I'm the original Sam!
I'm Sam fucking Bell!
- Hey, hey.
Whoa.
- Me!
Me!
Gerty, am I a clone?
Are you hungry?
Hey, hey.
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.
I'm in the same boat, asshole.
- Listen.
What about the other clones?
- What?
We might not be the first two to be woken up.
You said that model had already been started when you got here.
Well, who started it?
There might be others up here right now.
Think about it.
How did I get up here so quickly after your crash?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- They didn't ship me in from Central.
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.
I don't know what you're smoking.
Why would they do that?
That's ridiculous.
Impossible.
I bet there's some kind of secret room.
Secret room?
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?
You're the one who's lost your marbles.
I've been here for three years, man.
I know every inch of this base.
I know how many...
How much dirt's between those wall panels over there.
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?
Look, it's a company, right?
They have investors.
They have shareholders.
Shit like that.
What's cheaper?
Spending time and money training new personnel, or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job.
It's the far side of the moon.
The cheap fucks haven't even fixed the communications satellite yet.
Tess would know.
She would have told me.
Hey, Geppetto, wake up.
You really think they give a shit about us?
They're laughing all the way to the bank.
Tess would know.
She would have told me...
What do you get off fucking sitting there, sulking like a little fucking boy!
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Wake up!
I bet there's some area that we don't know about.
And I'm gonna find it.
Yeah, maybe you'll find some buried treasure, too.
Fuck!
Eliza arrival estimated 13 hours.
You found your secret room?
Just put that anywhere.
Now, that's a good idea.
That's...
That's where I keep my leprechauns.
- Get out of the way.
- What?
Why?
I want to look underneath that model.
You're not touching this model.
Get the fuck out of the way.
Listen, why don't you relax, okay?
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?
- Go read the encyclopedia or something?
- You're a tough guy now?
What, are you going to stab me?
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.
I'm a lover.
I'm not a fighter.
Put the knife down.
- Hey, hey, just...
- I want to look underneath there.
- Put the knife down.
- No.
I'm not going to give you the knife.
- Just get out of the way.
- Take it easy 'cause I...
- Let go of the knife.
- Don't ever tell me what to do, okay?
Just...
You let go.
Let go of the knife.
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't push me.
- Don't push me, motherfucker.
- Let go.
Let go.
Fucking told you to let go of the goddamn knife.
Little fucking...
Fucking little girl, man!
- God damn it!
- No!
No!
God damn it.
What did I tell you?
Okay, okay...
You gonna stop?
You gonna stop?
Okay, okay.
Jesus!
Fuck...
Fuck me.
What the fuck?
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.
- My fucking eye, man.
- Let me see.
- That's a lot of blood.
- Get off of me!
That's enough.
Well, appealing...
Nice feet, sexy...
Hello, Sam.
- Sam, is everything okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah, we had a fight, me and the other guy, the other...
He's very angry, you know.
Know what he did?
He flipped my entire model over.
Know how much work I put into that thing?
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours.
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours, yeah, exactly.
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours, really?
Approximately.
He's got a problem.
He scares me, Gerty.
What is it about Sam that scares you?
How he flies off the handle.
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...
She left me.
Tess left me, for six months.
She moved back in with her parents.
I know.
She gave me a second chance.
I promised her I'd change.
You have changed, Sam.
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here, I've sent Tess...
I've sent her over 100 video messages.
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
What about the messages she sent to me?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
Gerty...
Am I really a clone?
When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.
You woke up in the Infirmary.
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.
I kept you under observation and ran some tests.
I remember, yeah.
I remember that.
Sam, there was no crash.
You were being awakened.
It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests to establish mental stability and general physical health.
Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA can have considerable impact on...
What about...
What about Tess?
What about Eve?
They are memory implants, Sam.
Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell.
I am very sorry.
Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal.
Can I prepare you something?
Rescue arrival estimated 11 hours.
Okay, sweetheart?
Yeah, I'm staring into space.
Get it?
- Funny.
- Hey...
Thanks for this.
This is good.
This is cozy.
How's the...
How's the nose?
Much better, thank you.
I went haywire before, you know, I...
I lost it and I'm...
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay.
No, it's not okay.
I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I got a...
I got a temper.
I gotta do something about it.
Yes, you do.
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.
Can you turn that off?
Listen...
Listen, I wasn't supposed to...
I'm...
I'm trying to tell you something.
Can you turn...
Lunar instructed Gerty to...
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you...
- Tough guy.
- Listen to me...
- You look like a...
- What?
- ... radioactive tampon.
- I wasn't supposed to...
Or like a banana with a yeast infection.
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there.
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened,
I walked in on Gerty talking to Central.
He was having a live conversation.
- A live conversation?
- Yeah.
How do you know it was a live conversation?
Because it was a back and forth exchange.
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.
It was live, man.
It was live.
That's impossible.
There was a flare.
It fried the satellite.
The satellite's fine.
They don't want us to be able to contact Earth.
They lied to us.
They've been lying to us since the beginning.
They...
They've been lying to us since forever.
If the satellite works, how are they blocking the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base.
From where then?
Searching for long-range comms.
I'm just passing the last of the Harvesters.
Looks like John.
Searching for long-range comms.
How long until you're out of the base's range?
About a minute.
Ninety seconds, tops.
- You ever been out this far?
- No.
- Signal failure on long-range comms.
- Never have.
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.
You see anything?
It would help if I knew what the hell I was looking for.
Wait a second, I see something.
Approaching Station 3.
Holy shit.
I think I see something, too.
Approaching Station 1.
You see what I see?
Looks like an antenna or a pylon or something.
I think it's the jammer.
I knew it.
This is why we're not getting the live feed.
Sam?
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I hear you.
Yeah.
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm gonna head back to the base.
Okay, I'm gonna stay out here for a little while.
I'm gonna see if there's any more of these things.
Fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck.
Fuck.
Access denied.
Password accepted.
Accessing Sam Bell database.
I'm done.
Fifteen point...
My hair's falling out.
I'd better start for home...
For the last time, over and out.
The pod is designed to put you into a deep sleep for the duration of your three-day return journey back to Earth.
Safe trip.
Fuck.
Here she is.
I'm gonna go and see her soon.
Lunar Industries remains the number one provider of clean energy worldwide due to the hard work of people like you.
Rescue arrival estimated nine hours.
Lay down, relax, and breathe deeply.
The cryogenic protection pod is designed to put you into a deep sleep for the duration of your three-day return journey back to Earth.
As you begin to feel sleepy, think about the magnificent job that you've done and how proud your family are of what you've accomplished.

Safe trip, Annyeonghi gaseyo, and goodbye.
Approaching Station 2.
Hey, I saw three more of those jammers.
I think the base is surrounded.
I printed out the coordinates.
What's wrong with you?
What's going on?
I found your secret room.
Who goes first?
I go first.
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.
Why are there so many of them?
Sam, can I help you with something?
Not now, Gerty.
I'm okay.
Gerty...
Why did you help me before?
With the password?
Doesn't that go against your programing or something?
Helping you is what I do.
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.
Searching for long-range comms.
Signal re-established.
Hello?
Is this the Bell residence?
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry.
She passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Eve?
- Yeah?
- Hi.
Hi, Eve.
How old...
How old are you now?
I'm 15.
- Do I know you?
- Oh, sweetheart.
How did Mommy die, sweetheart?
How did Mommy die?
Dad?
Yeah?
There's someone asking about Mom.
Who's asking about Mom?
That's enough.
That's enough.
I want to go home.
Eliza arrival estimated in seven hours.
Ow, fuck.
Shit.
- What, did you cut yourself?
- Yeah.
What are you laughing at?
Well, you don't hold it like you're trying to stab somebody.
For God sakes.
Here, give me that.
You gotta hold it closer to the blade, you see?
- Watch what I'm doing.
- Why are you shaking?
You carve out, like that.
That's it.
It's freezing in here.
Well, you're...
You're sitting under the fridge.
What's going on with you?
Are you all right?
Yeah, that crew they're sending in, if they...
If they find us awake at the same time, you know...
They're not gonna let us live.
You know that, right?
You know, their return vehicle is...
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Are you okay?
Maybe you should lay down for a while, take some tranquilizers or something.
If I take some tranquilizers, I'll never wake up again.
You'll be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm freezing.
Hey, hey...
Hey.
I'm really scared.
Where are you going?
Hello?
Is this the Bell residence?
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Gerty, I need to talk to you.
Of course, Sam.
How can I help?
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.
That hidden room, Gerty.
The lower deck is out of bounds to awakened clones, Sam.
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.
New clones can only be awakened once a three-year contract is completed.
Gerty, if we don't wake up a new clone, me and the other Sam will die, we will be killed.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Do you want me and the other Sam to be killed?
That is the last thing I want.
Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.
Okay, pal?
Eliza arrival estimated in five hours.
I am the one and only
God.
Hey.
What's going on?
You okay?
Don't...
Don't touch him.
Come here.
He's not conscious yet.
Gerty and I just woke him up.
Why?
What's going on?
Come on.
Come on outside.
When the rescue unit arrives, they're gonna expect to find a body in that crashed rover.
That guy?
What, are you going to kill him?
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?
Zip up your fly.
You're burning up.
You sweat like a pig.
Put your hat on.
- Put your hat on.
- I'm hot.
Hey, if we go through with this,
I'm gonna need your help hauling him out to the crash site.
What about us?
Eliza arrives, finds you and me as a welcome party...
They're not going to find you and me as a welcome party.
They're gonna find me, and you're going back to Earth before they get here.
In that helium-3 launcher.
I did the math.
You're gonna pull some Gs, but it should...
It should be fine.
You'll be all right.
You're going home.
You did your three years.
I can't expect you to stick around.
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.
I saw that VP.
She's beautiful.
She's gorgeous.
We did good.
High-five.
Go for it.
You go for it.
- You comfy?
- No.
- What?
- No!
What if I have to take a shit?
Just...
You'll have to hold it in, pal.
For three days?
That's the way it goes.
Need a hand?
No.
Fuck off.
All right.
No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.
Eliza arrival estimated three hours.
Hey.
We need to do this.
We wait too long and he's gonna be conscious.
Fuck me.
What's going on with you?
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.
I don't think I can move my legs.
Besides, look at me...
I meet Eve now, I'd scare the crap out of her.
What are you talking about, man?
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.
You're not going to kill anybody.
We can't kill anybody.
You can't.
I know you can't, 'cause I can't.
You go.
You're a good guy, Sam.
It was a good plan, you know.
You just picked the wrong guy to go back.
You...
You sure about this?
Yeah.
You should travel, you know.
I always wanted to do that.
Amsterdam, or...
Yeah, you know, I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe Mexico.
Aloha.
Bring me back a pina colada, all right, bro?
Hey...
Johnny Spaceman.
You remember Tess came in for that interview?
She was so beautiful.
She wasn't the best candidate, but it didn't matter.
I had to give her the job.
I wanted to keep her in the country.
- She was going back to Ireland.
- She was going back to Ireland.
You knew you had to take a chance, so you called her.
You were terrified.
You wrote that whole speech for her answering machine.
But you didn't need it, 'cause she picked up the phone.
She was, like, "Why is he calling me?
"The internship's over.
Why's he calling me at home?"
I asked her if she wanted to go get like an ice cream cone or something dorky like that.
She said, "Let's get a drink. "
I said, "Okay.
What do you... "
Sam, this is not going to work.
What?
Why?
I've recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening.
If anyone were to check my memory cache, it would put you in considerable danger.
You could erase my memory banks.
I could reboot myself once you have departed.
Are you okay with that?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
I want to help you.
Eliza arrival estimated 24 minutes.
Sam.
Hey.
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot the moment that I've launched.
I understand, Sam.
Then you should be okay.
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.
Thanks, Gerty.
You gonna be okay?
Of course.
The new Sam and I will be back to our programing as soon as I've finished rebooting.
Gerty, we're not programed.
We're people.
Understand?
Eliza arrival estimated eight minutes.
Fuck!
Air lock pressurization complete.
Sam?
Hey, Sam?
You okay, buddy?
Cavalry's here.
Where am I?
You're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?
...made contact.
Yeah.
Yeah, Eliza?
He ain't going nowhere.
Bag him up and we'll get started on repairs to the Harvester.
Dwight, I'm gonna need the...
Lunar Industries stocks have slipped a further 32% after accusations...
Clone 6, the clone of Sam Bell, has been giving evidence at CAA's Board of Directors meeting in Seattle...
You know what?
He's one of two things.
He's a wacko or an illegal immigrant.
Either way, they need to lock him up.
Line two.
There was a time when "energy" was a dirty word.
When turning on your lights was a hard choice.
Cities in brownout,... food shortages, cars burning fuel to run.
But that was the past.
Where are we now?
How do we make the world so much better?
Make deserts bloom!
Right now, we are the largest producer of fusion energy in the world.
The energy of the sun, trapped in rock, harvested by machine from the far side of the moon.
Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3... to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet.
Who would have thought that all energy we ever needed is right above our heads?
The power of the moon... the power of our future.
Rock and roll!

I don't—
Hey, Gerty?
Gerty?
Wake up!
Good morning, Sam!
We have got a live one on Mark!
I'm going to go out now and rope her in.
OK, Sam.
I want chocolate.
I think you're sweet enough.
You don't need chocolate.

I have a full container full of helium-3, ready to roll.
By the time this message reaches you, it should be in transit.
Otherwise, everything running smoothly...
How are things down there?
You guys been having any... good parties or anything?
Oh, thanks for the... for the football feed!
It almost felt live.
Almost!
Three years is a long haul.
You know— It's way, way, way, way, way too long!
I'm talking to myself... on a regular basis!
So...
Time to go home, you know what I mean?
That's it, over and out!
Rock and roll, God bless America!
I can do that for you, Sam.
God damn it!
I said I got it!
Why don't you listen to me?
Package ready for launch.
Sam, is everything OK?
- Sam?
- What?
You don't seem like yourself today.
- Is something wrong?
- No.
Can you turn that off, please?
Jesus Christ!
Sam, it might help you to talk about it.
Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar-Sat?
the setting of monthly satellite dishes?
No, Sam.
From what I understand, it is fairly low... on the company's priority list right now.
You tell them to sort that out.
You know what I'm talking about?
That's not—
I've only got two weeks!
But it's not fair for whoever's coming up here next.
I will, Sam.
Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
No, come on;
let's finish this.
Got one of those headaches...
Can you—can you give me something for it?
Message received from your wife, Sam... via Jupiter link.
Fuck!
Hi, Sam!
It's me.
I got your last message.
It was really good to hear your voice.
I miss you, too!
I know you're really lonely up there...
But I think...
In a lot of ways.... it's been really good for you.
For both of us.
God, I hope you do not mind me saying that.
I'm proud of you!
Someone has got something to say.
What did you want to say to daddy, baby?
Say "astronaut".
Astronaut.
He is an astronaut!
Say daddy's an astronaut.
Say it really loud.
Daddy's an astronaut.
Clever girl!
Wave!
Give daddy a wave!
Kathy, could you—
I can't believe you're going to be home soon.
It's her birthday next month...
And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden.
- Gerty!
- We could work at it together.
Sam...
I love you!
I love you!
- And I miss you!
- I miss you!
And I can't wait to see you.
OK, sweetheart...
Goodbye.
Hi, Doug!
You're really full of yourself, aren't you, Doug?
Kath...
Not good!
What about Dumbo?
...
Fuck!
God damn it!
Fuck!
Wasn't kind of smart, was it, Gerty?
- Sam, can I ask how it happened?
- I told you.
I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand.
You saw something on TV?
Yeah, I something on TV that distracted me.
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you... but when I came in, the TV wasn't on.
Perhaps you were imagining things?
Yeah, you think too much, pal.
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.
Shut up!
Good morning, Gerty.
Good morning, Sam.
- How are you today?
- Fine!
Fine.
- How is the hand?
- Oh, it's a little sore!
A little sore.
It's OK.
- What's for breakfast?
- The usual.
Mmhmm.
- Two weeks to go, Sam.
- Two weeks to go, buddy!
Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.
But, thank you.
Thank you, Gerty.
You're welcome, Sam.
08:19, Pacific Time.
Readouts are as follows...
Matthew ... 9.8 miles.
Mark is less—
- 9...
- Hey, Gerty!
Rock and roll!
Mark—umm...
Mark is 11 miles on the button.
Luke is a little twitchy today.
Hey, Gerty.
Looks like we have got a live one out on Matthew.
I'm going to go out in a few minutes.
I'm just going to finish my coffee, OK?
OK, Sam.
Searching for long-range comms.

Danger.
Atmosphere compromised.
Where am...
- Where am I?
- Sam, you're in the infirmary.
You had an accident.
Do you remember what happened?
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.
Do you remember me?
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.
That's good.
That is very good.
It's nice to see you awake again.
I'd like to keep you under observation here in the infirmary for a few days...
And run some tests.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.
- OK, pal.
- You're still very tired.
We can talk later.
Hello?
The new Sam is in reworking order.
But we only have two working harvesters now.
Yeah, well,what a surprise!
Gerty, we're going to have to find a way to ramp up production.
I know.
his is incredible!
But how do you manage to destroy... a fucking rover, a harvester and an employee all on the same day?
These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know.
Gerty, what is the status on Harvester 3?
How do the repairs look on...
- Sam, you're out of bed.
- Yeah.
I wanted to stretch my legs a bit.
Who was that?
We've been having some problems with the Lunar-Sat...
And our live feed seems to be down.
I was recording a video-message for Central...
Updating them on your progress.
Sam, you need to stay in bed.
You're not ready to walk around yet.
Can you bring me my sunglasses?
It's really bright in here.
Give me some...
Give me all my stuff, you know?
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.
- Well, bring them in here.
- Certainly.
Excellent, Sam.
What...
When can I get out of here, Gerty?
Sam, you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash.
This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment.
So what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?
Central has asked me to slow down the harvesters... to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back.
That's terrific!
That's fantastic!
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow.
But it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
Let's try another test.
I don't want to try another test!
Please, Sam.
Hey, Gerty?
Do you know about this?
Matthew has got no velocity readout.
He is completely still.
He must have stalled.
Well, he has obviously stalled.
Don't you think we should tell Central?
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.
I will pass on your message.
Message received from Earth via Jupiter link.
Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better.
Yeah, we don't want you to take any unnecessary risks.
- You are too important to us.
- You stay put.
That is an order.
It's an order, Sam...
from Lunar.
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit... to tend to the stalled harvester and get the base back on its feet.
Fuck is with...?
What the fuck?
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- What?
- Sam...
I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.
I don't appreciate that—being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.
Gerty!
Gerty!
Gerty, come here!
- What happened?
- I do not know, maybe a meteorite...
There have been no meteorites, Sam.
Micrometeorites, maybe.
I do not know.
Either way, there might be damage to the exterior shell.
I think you better...you better let me go outside and take a look.
There is no damage to the exterior shell.
Well, it's not that I don't believe you, Gerty...
But, you know, this thing is springing leaks like an Acme firehose.
You need to let me go outside and fix this problem, Gery.
I can't let you go outside, Sam.
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.
Just let...
We'll keep it between you and me, ok, pal?
This thing is leaking gas.
Let's go!
Come on...
Just to check the exterior shell?
- Of course.
- OK, Sam.
Thank you.
Gerty!

I found him outside!
I found him outside!
Near one of the stalled harvesters...
Who is he?
We need to get him to the infirmary.
Not until you tell me who that is.
You tell me who that is!
Sam Bell.
We need to get him to the infirmary immediately.
Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?
Where—Where am I?
The infirmary.
You had an accident out by one of the harvesters.
Do you remember?
No, I'm—I'm thirsty.
I could get you some water.
I saw someone out there, Gerty.
I saw someone out there.
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries.
But, all in all, the prognosis is good.
I'm happy to see you again.
Gerty?
Yes, Sam?
Is there someone in the room with us?
Sam, get some sleep.
You're very tired.
Spoke to Thompson today.
They are in Europe, they—he's promising the world.
I think it was the right thing.
But...it's just such a long time.
I suppose there are—there are things...
You know...that needed to happen.
I—I need time to think.
Listen...umm...
Sam...
Be safe...
And I'll...
I'll talk to you soon.
Goodbye.
Gerty?
Gerty, what the fu—what the hell's going on?
Who is the guy— Who is the guy in the rec room?
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?
Sam, you're out out of bed.
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.
Who is the guy?
Who is the guy in the rec room?
- Sam Bell.
- Come on, come on, come on!
You are Sam Bell.
Sam, what is it?
It might help to talk about it.
I don't understand what is happening...
I think I'm starting to lose my mind.
We can run some tests.
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.
They do not know that you were recovered alive from the accident.
"Recovered alive"?
What do you mean?
Why did not you report it to Central?
What are you talking about?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
- I'm just getting my slippers...
- I'm using them...
I'm using them.
These are mine.
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.
I'm Sam Bell, too!
- What?
- Well, we've got that going for us.
Why...?
How long have you been...
What?
How long have you been here?
About a week.
- So how are you doing?
- What?
How are you doing?
"How am I doing?"
How do you think I'm doing?
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the harvesters?
Harvesters are fine.
It's the fact that I'm here talking to a clone that's slightly troubling.
I'm not a clone.
I'm not a clone!
- You're the clone.
- Okay, Sam.
You're not a clone.
Hey, hey...
You're not looking too good.
Sh!
Butt out of this!
I'm not even talking to you, pal.
I think that Katherine likes you.
I think she likes you a bit.
You're not looking too good, my friend.
I hope you're not feeling too bad.
Are you talking to yourself?
- Let's just get you fixed up...
- How long have you been here?
Well, it's about...three years.
For almost three years.
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank y—.
I wanted to thank you for, um...
If it wasn't for you, I'd—I...
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover.
You saved my life.
Hey, I know this is weird, you know...?
I'm real lonely, you know, I...
I just wanted to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?
Maybe later.
- What are you looking at?
- You look just like me; it's incredible.
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?
We look like each other, I guess.
I don't know.
Hey, you know...
It's weird for me, too, you know?
Hey?
Hey, you want to play some ping-pong?
No.
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.
- What's the score?
- 2-18.
OK
- Do you want me to show you how to hold that?
- No...
No, I...
I don't need you to show me how to hold it!
OK, OK
- Yeah, "OK"
- Should we play?
- Yeah!
Fuck!
God!
Shit!
19-2.
Yeah...
You want a...
You want a stick of gum?
You know...
You should approach this in a different way.
- Remember when you went to flight school?
- What are you doing?
I'm fixing the net.
It is very Zen with ping-pong, you have to just to relax.
How long did it take you took to do that?
Oh, I don't remember doing all of it.
I remember doing the church...
and the Salvation Army.
And doing the people.
My mind has been acting kind of weird lately.
That's Fairfield, right?
There's the town hall.
Fairfield, that's right...
Yeah, that's Tess...and Eve...
You...
You know Tess?
Yeah, I know Tess.
- You know about Eve, right?
- What?
I had a...
We had a girl...
Eve.
Ain't she beautiful?
She's my little monkey.
She's our little monkey.
High five!
She might be the milkman's, but she's beautiful.
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.
Oh shit!
- Greetings, Sam.
- How's our man?
You feeling better?
- Have you had enough rest?
- You resting up, Sam?
You better be, you bastard.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
We've got some good news.
The Jupiter program had to be put on hiatus, so we've got a few pairs of hands for you.
So what we've manage to do is cue you a rescue unit ahead of schedule.
Rescue Unit Eliza.
Eliza has been stationed on Goliath-19 for the last 2 months.
We expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.
So commence to jump for joy!
You're about to be back at work.
In the meantime, hang in there.
Rest up.
You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out!
They're sending a rescue unit?
Why?
Why are they sending a rescue unit?
To fix the stalled harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.
Well, then I'm going back.
That's it for me.
- What?
- Is that what you really think?
Yeah.
I've got a contract!
I'm going home.
- You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.
- Hey, I'm going home!
- Home!
- You're not going anywhere.
You know, you've been up here too long, man.
You have lost your marbles.
What do you think, Tess is back home, waiting on the sofa in lingerie?
What about the original Sam?
Huh?
I am the original Sam!
- I am Sam-fucking-Bell.
- Hey!
Me!
Me!
Gerty, am I a clone?
Are you hungry?
Hey, hey...
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.
I'm in the same boat, asshole.
Listen...
- What about the other clones?
- What?
We might not be the first two to have been woken up.
You said that that model had already been started when you got here.
Well, who started it?
There might be others up here right now.
Think about it.
How did I get up here so quickly after your crash?
- I don't know...
- They didn't ship me in from Central.
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.
I don't know what you're smoking.
Why would they do that?
That's ridiculous.
Impossible.
I bet there's some kind of secret room.
"Secret room"?
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?
You know, you are the one that has lost your marbles.
I've been here three years, man.
I know every inch of this base.
And I know how many dirt is between those wall panels over there.
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?
Look, it's a company, right?
They have investors, they have shareholders.
Shit like that.
What's cheaper?
Spending time and money training new personnel...
Or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job?
It's the far side of the moon!
Those cheap fucks haven't even fixed the communication satellite yet!
- Tess would know, she would have told me...
- Hey, Gepetto, wake up!
You really think they give a shit about us?
They're laughing all the way to the bank!
Tess would know, she would have told me...
Where do you get off?
!
Fucking sitting there sulking like a little fucking boy!
- Jesus Christ...
- Wake up!
There's some area that we don't know about.
And I'm going to find it.
Yeah, maybe you'll find some buried treasure, too.
Fuck!
Eliza arrival estimated in 13 hours.
You find your secret room?
Just put that anywhere.
Yes, that's a good idea...
- That's where I keep my leprechauns.
- Get out of the way.
- What?
Why?
- I want to look underneath that model.
You're not touching this model.
Get the fuck out of the way!
Listen, why don't you just relax, right?
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?
- Go read the encyclopedia or something?
- Oh, you're a tough guy now?
What, are you going to stab me?
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.
I'm a lover, not a fighter.
Put the knife down.
I want to look underneath there.
- Put the knife down.
- No, I'm not going to give you the knife.
- What?
- Just get out of the way.
- Take it easy.
- Let go of the knife.
Don't ever tell me what to do.
- Let go.
- You let go of the knife.
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't push me.
- Don't push me, motherfucker!
- Let go.
Let go!
What did I fucking tell you?
"Let go of the goddamn knife."
You fucking little girl, man!
Damn it!
What did I tell you?
You going to stop?
You going to stop?
OK!
OK!
Jesus, fuck!
Fuck me!
What the fuck?
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.
Let me see.
- That's a lot of blood.
- Get off of me!
Hello, Sam.
Sam, is everything OK?
Yeah!
Yeah, we had a fight.
Me and the other guy, the other...
He's very angry, you know?
You know what he did?
He flipped my entire model over!
You know how much work I put into that thing?
938 hours.
938 hours.
Yeah, exactly.
938 hours, really?
Approximately.
He's got a problem.
He scares me, Gerty.
What is it about Sam that scares you?
The guy flies off the handle.
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...
She—She left me.
Tess left me.
For 6 months.
She moved back in with her parents.
I know.
She gave me a second chance.
- I promised here that I'd change.
- You have changed, Sam.
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here, I've sent Tess...
I've sent her over a hundred video messages.
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
What about the messages she sent to me?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
Gerty...
Gerty?
Am I really a clone?
When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.
You woke up in the infirmary.
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.
I kept you under observation and ran some tests.
I remember, yea, I remember that...
Sam, there was no crash.
You were being awakened.
It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests... to establish mental stability..
and general physical health.
Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA... can have considerable impact on...
What about Tess?
What about Eve?
They are memory implants, Sam.
Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell.
I'm very sorry.
Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal.
Can I prepare you something?
Rescue arrival estimated in 11 hours.
- You OK, sweetheart?
- Yeah, I'm staring into space.
Hey!
Thanks for this, this is good.
This is cozy.
How's the nose?
Much better, thank you.
I went haywire before.
You know...
I lost it.
I...
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's OK.
No, it's not OK.
I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I've got...
I've got a temper, I've got to do something about that.
Yes, you do.
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.
Can you turn that off?
Listen.
Listen.
I wasn't supposed to...
I'm trying to tell you something.
I never instructed Gerty to...
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you...
Tough Guy.
- Listen to me!
- You look like a radioactive tampon.
Like a banana with a yeast infection.
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there.
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened...
I walked in on Gerty talking with Central.
He was having a live conversation.
"A live conversation"?
- Yeah
- How do you know it was a live conversation?
Because it was a back-and-forth exchange.
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.
- It was live, man, it was live.
- That's impossible.
There was a flare, it fried the satellite.
The satellite is fine.
They don't want us to be able to contact Earth.
They lied to us.
They've been lying to us since the beginning.
They've been lying since forever.
If the satellite works, how are they blocking the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base?
From where, then?
Searching for long-range comms.
I'm just passing the last of the harvesters.
Looks like John.
How long until you are out of the base's range?
Um, a minute.
- 90 seconds tops.
- Have you ever been out this far?
No...never have.

Wait a second, I see something.

Holy shit!
I think I see something, too.
Approaching station 1.
Do you see what I see?
Looks like an antenna or...or...
A pylon or something.
I think it's the jammer.
Dude!
This is why we're not getting the live feed.
- Sam?
Can you hear me?
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah I hear you.
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm going to—I'm going to head back to the base.
OK, I'm going to stay out here for a while.
I'm going to see if there's any more of these things.
Fuck...
Fuck...

Hey, I saw 3 more of those jammers.
I think the base is surrounded with them.
I printed out their coordinates.
Bud, what's wrong with you?
What's going on?
I found your secret room.
- Who goes first?
- I go first.
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.
Why are there so many of them?
Sam, can I help you with something?
Not now, Gerty.
I'm OK.
Gerty, why did you help me before?
With the password?
Doesn't that go against your programming or something?
Helping you is what I do.

Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Eve?
- Yeah.
- Hi!
Hi, Eve.
- How old—How old are you now?
- I'm 15.
- Do I know you?
- Sweetheart...
How did mommy die, sweetheart?
How did mommy die?
- Dad!
- Yeah.
- There's someone asking about mom.
- Who's asking about mom?
That's enough.
That's enough.
I want to go home!
...want to go...
Eliza arrival estimated in 7 hours.
Fuck!
- What, did you cut yourself?
- Yeah.
What are you laughing at?
Well, you don't hold it like you're trying to stab somebody, for God's sakes.
Here, give me that.
You've got to hold it closer to the blade, you see?
Watch what I'm doing.
Why are you shaking?
Carve out like that.
It's freezing in here.
Well, you're sitting under the fridge.
What's going on with you?
You all right?
Yeah, that crew they're sending us...
If they find us awake at the same time, they aren't going to let us live.
You know that, right?
You know, the return vehicle is a...
You OK?
You should lay down for a while.
Take some tranquilizers or something.
"Take some tranquilizers"?
I'll never wake up again.
You're going to be OK.
Everything's going to be OK.
I'm freezing.
Hey, hey?
Hey?
I'm really scared.
Where are you going?
Hello?
- Is this the Bell residence?
- This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Gerty, I need to talk to you.
Of course, Sam, how can I help?
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.
That hidden room, Gerty.
The lower deck is out-of-bounds to awakened clones, Sam.
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.
New clones can only be awakened once a three-year contract is completed.
Gerty, if you don't wake up another clone, me and the other Sam will die.
We will be killed, do you understand?
- Yes
- You want me and the other Sam to be killed?
- That is the last thing I want.
- Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.
OK, pal?
Eliza arrival estimated in 5 hours.
What's going on?
You OK?
Don't—Don't touch him.
Come here.
He's not conscious yet.
Gerty and I just woke him up.
Why?
What's going on?
Come on outside.
When the rescue unit arrives, they're going to expect to find a body in that crashed rover.
That guy?
What, are you going to kill him?
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?
Zip up your fly.
You're burning up.
Sweating like a pig.
Put your hat on.
Put your hat on.
If I go through with this, I'm going to need your help hauling him out to the crash site.
What about us?
When Eliza arrives, it finds you and me as a welcome party...
They aren't going to find you and me as a welcome party.
They're going to find me.
You're going back to Earth before they get here.
In that helium-3 launcher.
I did the math; you're going to pull some G's.
But you'll be fine.
You'll be all right.
You're going home.
You did your three years.
They can't expect you to stick around.
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.
I saw that V.P.
She's beautiful.
She's gorgeous.
You did good.
High five!
Go for it.
- Are you comfy?
- No.
- What?
- No!
- What if I have to take a shit?
- Well, I guess you'll just have to hold it in, pal.
For three days?
That's the way it goes.
- Need a hand?
- No.
OK.
All right.
No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.
Eliza arrival estimated in 3 hours.
Hey, we need to do this.
If we wait too long...
The other one's going to be conscious.
What's going on with you?
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.
I don't think I can move my legs.
Besides, look at me!
If I meet Eve now...
I'd scare the crap out of her!
What are you talking about, man?
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.
You're not going to kill anybody.
We can't kill anybody.
You can't.
I know you can't, because I can't.
You go.
You're a good guy, Sam.
And it was a good plan.
You know, you just picked the wrong guy to go back.
Are you sure about this?
Yeah.
You should—You should travel, you know?
I always wanted to do that.
Amsterdam or...
Yeah, I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe...
Mexico.
Aloha!
Bring me back a piña colada.
All right, pal?
Hey, Johnny Spaceman?
Do you remember when Tess came in for that interview?
She was so beautiful.
She wasn't the best candidate, but it didn't matter...
I had to give her the job.
I wanted to keep her in the country.
She was going back to Ireland.
And you knew you had to take a chance.
So...you called her...
You were terrified with that whole speech for the answering machine... but you didn't need it, because she picked up the phone.
She was like, "Why is he calling me?"
"The internship is over.
Why is he calling me at home?"
I asked her if she wanted to get an ice cream cone or something dorky like that.
She said, "Let's get a drink."
I said, "OK." We...
Sam, this is not going to work.
Why?
I have recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening.
If anyone were to check my memory cache, it would put you in considerable danger.
You could erase my memory banks.
I could reboot myself once you have departed.
- Are you okay with that?
- I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
- I want to help you.
Eliza arrival estimated in 24 minutes.
Sam.
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot...
- the moment that I launch.
- I understand, Sam.
You should be OK.
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.
Thanks, Gerty.
- Are you going to be OK?
- Of course.
The new Sam and I will be back to our programming as soon as I have finished rebooting.
Gerty, we're not programmed.
We're people.
Understand?
Eliza arrival estimated in 8 minutes.
Air lock pressurization complete.
Sam?
Hey, Sam?
You OK, buddy?
Cavalry's here.
Where am I?
- You're in the infirmary.
You've had an accident.
- How long have I been out.
- Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?
We've made contact.
Eliza, he ain't going nowhere.
Bag him up and we'll get started on repairs to the harvester.
Dwight, I'm going to need the...

Sam Bell for crimes...

Lunar el segundo...

Clone six, the clone of Sam Bell has been giving evidence that CEA's board of directors meeting in Seattle...
-You know what?
He's one of two things:
He's a wacko or an illegal immigrant.
Either way, they need to lock him up!
Line two!
There was a time when energy was a dirty word.
When turning on your lights was a hard choice.
Cities in brownout.
Food shortages.
Cars burning fuel to run.
But that was the past.
Where are we now?
How do we make the world so much better?
Make deserts bloom?
Right now, we're the largest producer of fusion energy in the world.
The energy of the sun trapped in rock, harvested by machine from the far side of the moon.
Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3 to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet.
Who'd have thought?
All the energy we ever needed, right above our heads.
The power of the moon.
The power of our future.

I...
Hey, Gerty.
Gerty.
We gotta...
Good morning, Sam.
We got a live one on Mark.
I'm gonna go out now and rope her in.
Okay, Sam.
I want chocolate.
I think you're sweet enough.
You don't need chocolate.

I've got a full container of helium-3 ready to roll.
By the time this message reaches you, it should be in transit.
Otherwise, everything running smoothly.
How are things down there?
You guys been to any good parties or anything?
Oh, thanks for the football feed.
It almost felt live...
Almost.
But three years is a long haul, you know.
Is way, way, way, way, way too long.
I'm talking to myself on a regular basis.
So...
Time to go home, you know what I mean?
Thas it.
Over and out.
Rock and roll.
God bless America.
I can do that for you, Sam.
God damn it.
I said I got it.
Why don't you listen to me?
Ready for launch.
Sam, is everything okay?
- Sam?
- What?
You don't seem like yourself today.
- Has something happened?
- You know...
Can you turn that off?
Please.
Jesus Christ.
Sam, it might help you to talk about it.
Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar Sat?
No, Sam.
What I understand is is fairly low on the company's priority list right now.
You tell them to sort that out, you know what I'm talking about?
Thas not...
I've only got two weeks, but is not fair to whoever is coming up here next.
I will, Sam.
Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
No, come on, les finish this.
Another one of those headaches.
Gerty, can you give me something for it?
Message received from your wife, Sam, via Jupiter link.
Fuck.
Hi, Sam.
Is me.
I got your last message.
It was really good to hear your voice.
I miss you, too.
I know you're really lonely up there, but I think, in a lot of ways, is been really good for you.
For both of us.
God, I hope you don't mind me saying that.
I'm proud of you.
Someone's got something to say.
What did you want to say to Daddy, baby?
Say, astronaut.
Astronaut, Daddy.
Who's an astronaut?
Daddy's an astronaut.
Say it really loudly.
Daddy's an astronaut.
Clever girl.
Wave.
Give Daddy a wave.
Kathy, could you...
I can't believe you're going to be home soon.
Is her birthday next month.
And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden.
- Gerty.
- We could pick it out together.
Sam.
I love you.
And I miss you.
I miss you.
And I can't wait to see you.
Okay, sweetheart.
Bye.
Hi, Doug.
You're really full of yourself, aren't you, Doug?
Kathryn.
Not good.
What about Dumbo?
Doesn't he object to your...
Yes.
Darrin objects.
But is a special occasion because of the morning light.
Ah, fuck!
God damn it!
Fuck!
Is gotta smart, doesn't it, Gerty?
Sam, can I ask how it happened?
I told you, I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand.
You saw something on TV?
Yeah, I saw something on TV that distracted me.
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you.
But when I came in, the TV wasn't on.
Perhaps you were imagining things.
Yeah, you think too much, pal.
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.
I am the one and only
Oh, yeah!
Okay.
Shut up.
Morning, Gerty.
Morning, Sam.
How are you today?
Fine.
Fine.
- How's the hand?
- Oh, is a little sore.
Little sore.
Is okay.
Whas for breakfast?
The usual.
Two weeks to go, Sam.
Two weeks to go, buddy.
Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.
But thank you.
Thank you, Gerty.
You're welcome, Sam.

Mark is nine...
Hey, Gerty...
Rock and roll.
Mark...
Mark's 11 miles on the button.
Luke's a little twitchy today.
Hey, Gerty, looks like we got a live one out on Matthew.
I'm gonna go out in a few minutes.
I'm just going to finish my coffee, okay?
Okay, Sam.

Where am...
Where am I?
Sam, you're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.
Do you remember what happened?
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.
Do you remember me?
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.
Thas good.
Thas very good.
Is nice to see you awake again.
I'd like to keep you under observation here in the Infirmary for a few days and run some tests.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.
Okay, bro.
You're still very tired.
We can talk later.
Hello?
...good working order, but we only have two working Harvesters now.
Come on, come on.
Yeah, well, thas no surprise, but is not good enough.
Gerty, we're gonna have to find a way to ramp up production
- on Mark and John.
- I know.
This is incredible.
How do you manage to fucking break a Harvester and an employee, all in the same day?
These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know.
Gerty, whas the status on Harvester 3?
How are the repairs going ahead?
- Sam.
You're out of bed.
- Yeah.
I wanted to stretch my legs.
Who was that?
We've been having some problems with the Lunar Sat, and our live feed seems to be down.
I was recording a video message for Central, updating them on your progress.
Sam, you need to stay in bed.
You're not ready to walk around yet.
All right.
Could you give me my sunglasses?
Is really bright in here.
Give me my...
Give me all my stuff, you know.
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.
- Well, bring it in here.
- Certainly.
Excellent, Sam.
What...
When can I get out of here, Gerty?
Sam, you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash.
This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment.
So, whas the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?
Central has asked me to slow down the Harvesters to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back.
Thas terrific.
Is fantastic.
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow, but it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
- Les try another test.
- I don't want to try another test.
Please, Sam.
Hey, Gerty.
You know about this?
Matthew's got no velocity readout.
He's completely still.
He must have stalled.
Well, he's obviously stalled.
Don't you think we should tell Central?
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.
I'll pass on your message.
Message received from Earth via Jupiter link.
Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better.
Hey, we don't want you to take any unnecessary risks.
- You're too important to us.
- You're to stay put.
That is an order.
Is an order, Sam.
From Lunar.
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit to tend to the stalled Harvester and get the base back on its feet.
What the fuck is...
What the fuck...
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- What?
Sam, I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.
I don't appreciate that.
Being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.
Gerty!
Gerty!
Gerty, come here!
What happened?
I don't know.
Meteorites.
There have been no meteorites, Sam.
Micro-meteorites maybe, I don't know.
Either way, there might be damage to the exterior shell.
I think you'd better...
You'd better let me go outside and take a look.
There is no damage to the exterior shell.
Well, is not that I don't believe you, Gerty, but I mean, you know, this thing is springing leaks like an Acme fire hose.
You need to let me go outside and fix this problem, Gerty.
I can't let you go outside, Sam.
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.
Just let...
We'll keep it between you and me.
Okay, pal?
This thing is springing gas, les go.
Come on.
Just to check the exterior shell.
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay, Sam.
Thank you.
Gerty.

Gerty!
I found him outside.
By the stalled Harvester.
Who is he?
Who is he?
We need to get him to the Infirmary.
You tell...
You tell me who that is.
You tell me who that is!
Sam Bell.
We need to get him to the Infirmary immediately.
Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?
Where...
Where am I?
The Infirmary.
You had an accident out by one of the Harvesters.
- Do you remember?
- I'm...
I'm thirsty.
I could get you some water.
I saw someone out there, Gerty.
I saw someone out there.
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries.
But all in all, the prognosis is good.
I'm happy to see you again.
- Gerty.
- Yes, Sam.
Is there someone in the room with us?
Sam, get some sleep.
You're very tired.
Spoke to Thompson today.
Now that you're up there, he's promising the world.
I think it was the right thing.
But...
Is just such a long time.
But I suppose there are things...
You know, that needed to happen.
I...
I need time to think.
Listen, Sam, be safe, and I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.
Gerty...
Gerty, what the...
What...
What the hell's going on?
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?
Sam, you're out of bed.
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?
Sam Bell.
Come on, come on, come on.
You are Sam Bell.
Sam, what is it?
It might help to talk about it.
Gerty, I don't understand whas happening.
I'm losing my mind.
We could run some tests.
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.
They don't know you were recovered alive from the accident...
Recovered alive?
What do you mean...
What are you talk...
Why didn't you report it to Central?
What are you talking about?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
Just getting my slippers.
- I'm using them.
I'm using them.
- No.
What?
These are mine.
These are mine.
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.
I'm Sam Bell, too.
What?
We've got that going for us.
Why...
How long have you...
What?
How long have you been here?
About a week.
So, how you doing?
- What?
- How are you doing?
How am I...
How am I doing?
How do you think I'm doing?
Good job.
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the Harvesters?
Harvesters are fine.
Is affected them.
Here, talking to a clone, thas slightly troubling.
I'm not a clone.
You're the clone.
Okay, Sam, you're not a clone.
Hey.
Hey, Ridley, you're not looking too good.
Butt out of this.
Davey, I'm talking to Ridley.
How you doing, pal?
Hey, I think Kathryn likes you.
I think she likes you, pal.
You're not looking too good, my friend.
Sorry you're not feeling too well.
You talking to yourself?
- I'll just get you all fixed up.
- How long have you been here?
Oh, I guess about three years.
Almost three years.
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank you.
I wanted to thank you for...
If it wasn't for you,
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover.
You saved my life and...
Hey, I know this is weird, you know.
I'm real lonely, you know...
I just want to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?
Maybe later.
What are you looking at?
You look just like me.
Is incredible.
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?
We look like each other, I guess.
Hey, you know...
Is weird for me, too, you know.
Fuck.
Hey.
Hey, you wanna play some Ping-Pong?
No.
Come on, I'll teach you.
Ill help you relax.
- Whas the score?
- 2-18.
Okay.
Do you want me to show you how to hold that?
No.
No, I...
I don't need you to show me how to hold it.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Should we, uh...
Should we play?
- Yeah.
God!
Shit!
- 19-2.
- Yeah.
Do you want a stick of gum?
You know, we could approach this in a different way.
Remember when we went to flight school...
What are you doing?
I'm fixing the net.
Is very Zen, Ping-Pong.
You have to just relax.
How long did it take you to do that?
Well, I don't remember doing all of it.
I remember doing the church, and the Salvation Army, and a few of the people.
My minïs been acting kind of weird lately.
Thas Fairfield, right?
There's the Town Hall.
Fairfield?
Of course, you know about Fairfield.
Yeah, there's Tess and Eve.
Do you know Tess?
Yeah.
I know Tess.
- You know about Eve, right?
- What?
I had a...
We had a girl.
Eve.
Isn't she beautiful?
She's my little monkey.
She's our little monkey.
High-five.
She might be the milkman's, but she's beautiful.
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.
Oh, shit.
- Greetings, Sam.
- How's our man?
You feeling better?
You have enough rest?
Okay, you resting up, Sam?
You better be, you bastard.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
We've got some good news.
The Jupiter Program had to be put on hiatus, so we got a few pairs of hands for you.
So, what we've managed to do is secure you a Rescue Unit ahead of schedule.
Rescue Unit Eliza.
Now, Eliza has been stationed on Goliath 19 for the last two months.
Now we expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.
So commence to jump forjoy.
You're about to be back in work.
In the meantime, hang in there.
Rest up.
You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out.
They're sending a Rescue Unit?
Why?
Why are they sending a Rescue Unit?
To fix the stalled Harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.
Well, then I'm going back.
Thas it for me.
What?
Is that what you really think?
Yeah.
I've got a contract.
I'm going home.
You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.
- Hey, I'm going home.
- You're not going anywhere.
You know, you've been up here too long, man.
You've lost your marbles.
What, do you think Tess is back home, waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie?
What about the original Sam?
Huh?
I'm the original Sam!
I'm Sam fucking Bell!
- Hey, hey.
Whoa.
- Me!
Me!
Gerty, am I a clone?
Are you hungry?
Hey, hey.
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.
I'm in the same boat, asshole.
- Listen.
What about the other clones?
- What?
We might not be the first two to be woken up.
You said that model had already been started when you got here.
Well, who started it?
There might be others up here right now.
Think about it.
How did I get up here so quickly after your crash?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- They didn't ship me in from Central.
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.
I don't know what you're smoking.
Why would they do that?
Thas ridiculous.
Impossible.
I bet there's some kind of secret room.
Secret room?
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?
You're the one who's lost your marbles.
I've been here for three years, man.
I know every inch of this base.
I know how many...
How much dirs between those wall panels over there.
Why would they do that?
Whas the motive?
Look, is a company, right?
They have investors.
They have shareholders.
Shit like that.
Whas cheaper?
Spending time and money training new personnel, or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job.
Is the far side of the moon.
The cheap fucks haven't even fixed the communications satellite yet.
Tess would know.
She would have told me.
Hey, Geppetto, wake up.
You really think they give a shit about us?
They're laughing all the way to the bank.
Tess would know.
She would have told me...
What do you get off fucking sitting there, sulking like a little fucking boy!
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Wake up!
I bet there's some area that we don't know about.
And I'm gonna find it.
Yeah, maybe you'll find some buried treasure, too.
Fuck!
Eliza arrival estimated 13 hours.
You found your secret room?
Just put that anywhere.
Now, thas a good idea.
Thas...
Thas where I keep my leprechauns.
- Get out of the way.
- What?
Why?
I want to look underneath that model.
You're not touching this model.
Get the fuck out of the way.
Listen, why don't you relax, okay?
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?
- Go read the encyclopedia or something?
- You're a tough guy now?
What, are you going to stab me?
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.
I'm a lover.
I'm not a fighter.
Put the knife down.
- Hey, hey, just...
- I want to look underneath there.
- Put the knife down.
- No.
I'm not going to give you the knife.
- Just get out of the way.
- Take it easy 'cause I...
- Let go of the knife.
- Don't ever tell me what to do, okay?
Just...
You let go.
Let go of the knife.
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't push me.
- Don't push me, motherfucker.
- Let go.
Let go.
Fucking told you to let go of the goddamn knife.
Little fucking...
Fucking little girl, man!
- God damn it!
- No!
No!
God damn it.
What did I tell you?
Okay, okay...
You gonna stop?
You gonna stop?
Okay, okay.
Jesus!
Fuck...
Fuck me.
What the fuck?
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.
- My fucking eye, man.
- Let me see.
- Thas a lot of blood.
- Get off of me!
Thas enough.
Well, appealing...
Nice feet, sexy...
Hello, Sam.
- Sam, is everything okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah, we had a fight, me and the other guy, the other...
He's very angry, you know.
Know what he did?
He flipped my entire model over.
Know how much work I put into that thing?
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours.
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours, yeah, exactly.
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours, really?
Approximately.
He's got a problem.
He scares me, Gerty.
What is it about Sam that scares you?
How he flies off the handle.
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...
She left me.
Tess left me, for six months.
She moved back in with her parents.
I know.
She gave me a second chance.
I promised her I'd change.
You have changed, Sam.
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here, I've sent Tess...
I've sent her over 100 video messages.
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
What about the messages she sent to me?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
Gerty...
Am I really a clone?
When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.
You woke up in the Infirmary.
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.
I kept you under observation and ran some tests.
I remember, yeah.
I remember that.
Sam, there was no crash.
You were being awakened.
It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests to establish mental stability and general physical health.
Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA can have considerable impact on...
What about...
What about Tess?
What about Eve?
They are memory implants, Sam.
Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell.
I am very sorry.
Sam, is been several hours since your last meal.
Can I prepare you something?
Rescue arrival estimated 11 hours.
Okay, sweetheart?
Yeah, I'm staring into space.
Get it?
- Funny.
- Hey...
Thanks for this.
This is good.
This is cozy.
How's the...
How's the nose?
Much better, thank you.
I went haywire before, you know, I...
I lost it and I'm...
- I'm sorry about that.
- Is okay.
No, is not okay.
I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.
I don't know whas wrong with me.
I got a...
I got a temper.
I gotta do something about it.
Yes, you do.
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.
Can you turn that off?
Listen...
Listen, I wasn't supposed to...
I'm...
I'm trying to tell you something.
Can you turn...
Lunar instructed Gerty to...
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you...
- Tough guy.
- Listen to me...
- You look like a...
- What?
...radioactive tampon.
- I wasn't supposed to...
Or like a banana with a yeast infection.
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there.
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened,
I walked in on Gerty talking to Central.
He was having a live conversation.
- A live conversation?
- Yeah.
How do you know it was a live conversation?
Because it was a back and forth exchange.
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.
It was live, man.
It was live.
Thas impossible.
There was a flare.
It fried the satellite.
The satellite's fine.
They don't want us to be able to contact Earth.
They lied to us.
They've been lying to us since the beginning.
They...
They've been lying to us since forever.
If the satellite works, how are they blocking the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base.
From where then?
Searching for long-range comms.
I'm just passing the last of the Harvesters.
Looks like John.
Searching for long-range comms.
How long until you're out of the base's range?
About a minute.
Ninety seconds, tops.
- You ever been out this far?
- No.
- Signal failure on long-range comms.
- Never have.
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.
You see anything?
It would help if I knew what the hell I was looking for.
Wait a second, I see something.
Approaching Station 3.
Holy shit.
I think I see something, too.
Approaching Station 1.
You see what I see?
Looks like an antenna or a pylon or something.
I think is the jammer.
I knew it.
This is why we're not getting the live feed.
Sam?
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I hear you.
Yeah.
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm gonna head back to the base.
Okay, I'm gonna stay out here for a little while.
I'm gonna see if there's any more of these things.
Fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck.
Fuck.

Approaching Station 2.
Hey, I saw three more of those jammers.
I think the base is surrounded.
I printed out the coordinates.
Whas wrong with you?
Whas going on?
I found your secret room.
Who goes first?
I go first.
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.
Why are there so many of them?
Sam, can I help you with something?
Not now, Gerty.
I'm okay.
Gerty...
Why did you help me before?
With the password?
Doesn't that go against your programing or something?
Helping you is what I do.

Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry.
She passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Eve?
- Yeah?
- Hi.
Hi, Eve.
How old...
How old are you now?
I'm 15.
- Do I know you?
- Oh, sweetheart.
How did Mommy die, sweetheart?
How did Mommy die?
Dad?
Yeah?
There's someone asking about Mom.
Who's asking about Mom?
Thas enough.
Thas enough.
I want to go home.
Eliza arrival estimated in seven hours.
Ow, fuck.
Shit.
- What, did you cut yourself?
- Yeah.
What are you laughing at?
Well, you don't hold it like you're trying to stab somebody.
For God sakes.
Here, give me that.
You gotta hold it closer to the blade, you see?
- Watch what I'm doing.
- Why are you shaking?
You carve out, like that.
Thas it.
Is freezing in here.
Well, you're...
You're sitting under the fridge.
Whas going on with you?
Are you all right?
Yeah, that crew they're sending in, if they...
If they find us awake at the same time, you know...
They're not gonna let us live.
You know that, right?
You know, their return vehicle is...
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Are you okay?
Maybe you should lay down for a while, take some tranquilizers or something.
If I take some tranquilizers, I'll never wake up again.
You'll be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm freezing.
Hey, hey...
Hey.
I'm really scared.
Where are you going?
Hello?
Is this the Bell residence?
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Gerty, I need to talk to you.
Of course, Sam.
How can I help?
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.
That hidden room, Gerty.
The lower deck is out of bounds to awakened clones, Sam.
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.
New clones can only be awakened once a three-year contract is completed.
Gerty, if we don't wake up a new clone, me and the other Sam will die, we will be killed.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Do you want me and the other Sam to be killed?
That is the last thing I want.
Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.
Okay, pal?
Eliza arrival estimated in five hours.
I am the one and only
God.
Hey.
Whas going on?
You okay?
Don't...
Don't touch him.
Come here.
He's not conscious yet.
Gerty and I just woke him up.
Why?
Whas going on?
Come on.
Come on outside.
When the rescue unit arrives, they're gonna expect to find a body in that crashed rover.
That guy?
What, are you going to kill him?
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?
Zip up your fly.
You're burning up.
You sweat like a pig.
Put your hat on.
- Put your hat on.
- I'm hot.
Hey, if we go through with this,
I'm gonna need your help hauling him out to the crash site.
What about us?
Eliza arrives, finds you and me as a welcome party...
They're not going to find you and me as a welcome party.
They're gonna find me, and you're going back to Earth before they get here.
In that helium-3 launcher.
I did the math.
You're gonna pull some Gs, but it should...
It should be fine.
You'll be all right.
You're going home.
You did your three years.
I can't expect you to stick around.
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.
I saw that VP.
She's beautiful.
She's gorgeous.
We did good.
High-five.
Go for it.
You go for it.
- You comfy?
- No.
- What?
- No!
What if I have to take a shit?
Just...
You'll have to hold it in, pal.
For three days?
Thas the way it goes.
Need a hand?
No.
Fuck off.
All right.
No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.
Eliza arrival estimated three hours.
Hey.
We need to do this.
We wait too long and he's gonna be conscious.
Fuck me.
Whas going on with you?
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.
I don't think I can move my legs.
Besides, look at me...
I meet Eve now, I'd scare the crap out of her.
What are you talking about, man?
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.
You're not going to kill anybody.
We can't kill anybody.
You can't.
I know you can't, 'cause I can't.
You go.
You're a good guy, Sam.
It was a good plan, you know.
You just picked the wrong guy to go back.
You...
You sure about this?
Yeah.
You should travel, you know.
I always wanted to do that.
Amsterdam, or...
Yeah, you know, I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe Mexico.
Aloha.
Bring me back a pina colada, all right, bro?
Hey...
Johnny Spaceman.
You remember Tess came in for that interview?
She was so beautiful.
She wasn't the best candidate, but it didn't matter.
I had to give her the job.
I wanted to keep her in the country.
- She was going back to Ireland.
- She was going back to Ireland.
You knew you had to take a chance, so you called her.
You were terrified.
You wrote that whole speech for her answering machine.
But you didn't need it, 'cause she picked up the phone.
She was, like, "Why is he calling me?
"The internship's over.
Why's he calling me at home?"
I asked her if she wanted to go get like an ice cream cone or something dorky like that.
She said, "Les get a drink."
I said, "Okay.
What do you..."
Sam, this is not going to work.
What?
Why?
I've recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening.
If anyone were to check my memory cache, it would put you in considerable danger.
You could erase my memory banks.
I could reboot myself once you have departed.
Are you okay with that?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
I want to help you.
Eliza arrival estimated 24 minutes.
Sam.
Hey.
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot the moment that I've launched.
I understand, Sam.
Then you should be okay.
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.
Thanks, Gerty.
You gonna be okay?
Of course.
The new Sam and I will be back to our programing as soon as I've finished rebooting.
Gerty, we're not programed.
We're people.
Understand?
Eliza arrival estimated eight minutes.
Fuck!
Air lock pressurization complete.
Sam?
Hey, Sam?
You okay, buddy?
Cavalry's here.
Where am I?
You're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?
...made contact.
Yeah.
Yeah, Eliza?
He ain't going nowhere.
Bag him up and we'll get started on repairs to the Harvester.
Dwight, I'm gonna need the...
Lunar Industries stocks have slipped a further 32% after accusations...
Clone 6, the clone of Sam Bell, has been giving evidence at CAA's Board of Directors meeting in Seattle...
You know what?
He's one of two things.
He's a wacko or an illegal immigrant.
Either way, they need to lock him up.
Line two.
When turning on your lights was a hard choice.
Cities in brownout.
Food shortages.
Cars burning fuel to run.
But that was the past.
Where are we now?
How do we make the world so much better?
Make deserts bloom?
Right now, we're the largest producer of fusion energy in the world.
The energy of the sun trapped in rock, harvested by machine from the far side of the moon.
Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3 to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet.
Who'd have thought?
All the energy we ever needed, right above our heads.
The power of the moon.
The power of our future.

How are things down there?
You guys been to any good parties or anything?
Oh, thanks for the football feed.
It almost felt live...
Almost.
But three years is a long haul, you know.
It's way, way, way, way, way too long.
I'm talking to myself on a regular basis.
So...
Time to go home, you know what I mean?
That's it.
Over and out.
Rock and roll.
God bless America.
I can do that for you, Sam.
God damn it.
I said I got it.
Why don't you listen to me?
Ready for launch.
Sam, is everything okay?
- Sam?
- What?
You don't seem like yourself today.
- Has something happened?
- You know...
Can you turn that off?
Please.
Jesus Christ.
Sam, it might help you to talk about it.
Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar Sat?
No, Sam.
What I understand is it's fairly low on the company's priority list right now.
You tell them to sort that out, you know what I'm talking about?
That's not...
I've only got two weeks, but it's not fair to whoever is coming up here next.
I will, Sam.
Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
No, come on, let's finish this.
Another one of those headaches.
Gerty, can you give me something for it?
Message received from your wife, Sam, via Jupiter link.
Fuck.
Hi, Sam.
It's me.
I got your last message.
It was really good to hear your voice.
I miss you, too.
I know you're really lonely up there, but I think, in a lot of ways, it's been really good for you.
For both of us.
God, I hope you don't mind me saying that.
I'm proud of you.
Someone's got something to say.
What did you want to say to Daddy, baby?
Say, astronaut.
Astronaut, Daddy.
Who's an astronaut?
Daddy's an astronaut.
Say it really loudly.
Daddy's an astronaut.
Clever girl.
Wave.
Give Daddy a wave.
Kathy, could you...
I can't believe you're going to be home soon.
It's her birthday next month.
And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden.
- Gerty.
- We could pick it out together.
Sam.
I love you.
And I miss you.
I miss you.
And I can't wait to see you.
Okay, sweetheart.
Bye.
Hi, Doug.
You're really full of yourself, aren't you, Doug?
Kathryn.
Not good.
What about Dumbo?
Doesn't he object to your...
Yes.
Darrin objects.
But it's a special occasion because of the morning light.
Ah, fuck!
God damn it!
Fuck!
It's gotta smart, doesn't it, Gerty?
Sam, can I ask how it happened?
I told you, I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand.
You saw something on TV?
Yeah, I saw something on TV that distracted me.
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you.
But when I came in, the TV wasn't on.
Perhaps you were imagining things.
Yeah, you think too much, pal.
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.
I am the one and only
Oh, yeah!
Okay.
Shut up.
Morning, Gerty.
Morning, Sam.
How are you today?
Fine.
Fine.
- How's the hand?
- Oh, it's a little sore.
Little sore.
It's okay.
What's for breakfast?
The usual.
Two weeks to go, Sam.
Two weeks to go, buddy.
Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.
But thank you.
Thank you, Gerty.
You're welcome, Sam.

Sam, you're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.
Do you remember what happened?
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.
Do you remember me?
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.
That's good.
That's very good.
It's nice to see you awake again.
I'd like to keep you under observation here in the Infirmary for a few days and run some tests.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.
Okay, bro.
You're still very tired.
We can talk later.
Hello?
...good working order, but we only have two working Harvesters now.
Come on, come on.
Yeah, well, that's no surprise, but it's not good enough.
Gerty, we're gonna have to find a way to ramp up production
- on Mark and John.
- I know.
This is incredible.
How do you manage to fucking break a Harvester and an employee, all in the same day?
These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know.
Gerty, what's the status on Harvester 3?
How are the repairs going ahead?
- Sam.
You're out of bed.
- Yeah.
I wanted to stretch my legs.
Who was that?
We've been having some problems with the Lunar Sat, and our live feed seems to be down.
I was recording a video message for Central, updating them on your progress.
Sam, you need to stay in bed.
You're not ready to walk around yet.
All right.
Could you give me my sunglasses?
It's really bright in here.
Give me my...
Give me all my stuff, you know.
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.
- Well, bring it in here.
- Certainly.
Excellent, Sam.
What...
When can I get out of here, Gerty?
Sam, you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash.
This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment.
So, what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?
Central has asked me to slow down the Harvesters to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back.
That's terrific.
It's fantastic.
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow, but it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
- Let's try another test.
- I don't want to try another test.
Please, Sam.
Hey, Gerty.
You know about this?
Matthew's got no velocity readout.
He's completely still.
He must have stalled.
Well, he's obviously stalled.
Don't you think we should tell Central?
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.
I'll pass on your message.
Message received from Earth via Jupiter link.
Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better.
Hey, we don't want you to take any unnecessary risks.
- You're too important to us.
- You're to stay put.
That is an order.
It's an order, Sam.
From Lunar.
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit to tend to the stalled Harvester and get the base back on its feet.
What the fuck is...
What the fuck...
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- What?
Sam, I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.
I don't appreciate that.
Being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.
Gerty!
Gerty!
Gerty, come here!
What happened?
I don't know.
Meteorites.
There have been no meteorites, Sam.
Micro-meteorites maybe, I don't know.
Either way, there might be damage to the exterior shell.
I think you'd better...
You'd better let me go outside and take a look.
There is no damage to the exterior shell.
Well, it's not that I don't believe you, Gerty, but I mean, you know, this thing is springing leaks like an Acme fire hose.
You need to let me go outside and fix this problem, Gerty.
I can't let you go outside, Sam.
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.
Just let...
We'll keep it between you and me.
Okay, pal?
This thing is springing gas, let's go.
Come on.
Just to check the exterior shell.
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay, Sam.
Thank you.

You tell...
You tell me who that is.
You tell me who that is!
Sam Bell.
We need to get him to the Infirmary immediately.
Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?
Where...
Where am I?
The Infirmary.
You had an accident out by one of the Harvesters.
- Do you remember?
- I'm...
I'm thirsty.
I could get you some water.
I saw someone out there, Gerty.
I saw someone out there.
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries.
But all in all, the prognosis is good.
I'm happy to see you again.
- Gerty.
- Yes, Sam.
Is there someone in the room with us?
Sam, get some sleep.
You're very tired.
Spoke to Thompson today.
Now that you're up there, he's promising the world.
I think it was the right thing.
But...
It's just such a long time.
But I suppose there are things...
You know, that needed to happen.
I...
I need time to think.
Listen, Sam, be safe, and I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.
Gerty...
Gerty, what the...
What...
What the hell's going on?
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?
Sam, you're out of bed.
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?
Sam Bell.
Come on, come on, come on.
You are Sam Bell.
Sam, what is it?
It might help to talk about it.
Gerty, I don't understand what's happening.
I'm losing my mind.
We could run some tests.
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.
They don't know you were recovered alive from the accident...
Recovered alive?
What do you mean...
What are you talk...
Why didn't you report it to Central?
What are you talking about?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
Just getting my slippers.
- I'm using them.
I'm using them.
- No.
What?
These are mine.
These are mine.
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.
I'm Sam Bell, too.
What?
We've got that going for us.
Why...
How long have you...
What?
How long have you been here?
About a week.
So, how you doing?
- What?
- How are you doing?
How am I...
How am I doing?
How do you think I'm doing?
Good job.
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the Harvesters?
Harvesters are fine.
It's affected them.
Here, talking to a clone, that's slightly troubling.
I'm not a clone.
You're the clone.
Okay, Sam, you're not a clone.
Hey.
Hey, Ridley, you're not looking too good.
Butt out of this.
Davey, I'm talking to Ridley.
How you doing, pal?
Hey, I think Kathryn likes you.
I think she likes you, pal.
You're not looking too good, my friend.
Sorry you're not feeling too well.
You talking to yourself?
- I'll just get you all fixed up.
- How long have you been here?
Oh, I guess about three years.
Almost three years.
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank you.
I wanted to thank you for...
If it wasn't for you,
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover.
You saved my life and...
Hey, I know this is weird, you know.
I'm real lonely, you know...
I just want to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?
Maybe later.
What are you looking at?
You look just like me.
It's incredible.
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?
We look like each other, I guess.
Hey, you know...
It's weird for me, too, you know.
Fuck.
Hey.
Hey, you wanna play some Ping-Pong?
No.
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.
- What's the score?
- 2-18.
Okay.
Do you want me to show you how to hold that?
No.
No, I...
I don't need you to show me how to hold it.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Should we, uh...
Should we play?
- Yeah.
God!
Shit!
- 19-2.
- Yeah.
Do you want a stick of gum?
You know, we could approach this in a different way.
Remember when we went to flight school...
What are you doing?
I'm fixing the net.
It's very Zen, Ping-Pong.
You have to just relax.
How long did it take you to do that?
Well, I don't remember doing all of it.
I remember doing the church, and the Salvation Army, and a few of the people.
My minïs been acting kind of weird lately.
That's Fairfield, right?
There's the Town Hall.
Fairfield?
Of course, you know about Fairfield.
Yeah, there's Tess and Eve.
Do you know Tess?
Yeah.

- What?
I had a...
We had a girl.

Isn't she beautiful?

She might be the milkman's, but she's beautiful.
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.
Oh, shit.
- Greetings, Sam.
- How's our man?
You feeling better?
You have enough rest?
Okay, you resting up, Sam?
You better be, you bastard.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
We've got some good news.
The Jupiter Program had to be put on hiatus, so we got a few pairs of hands for you.
So, what we've managed to do is secure you a Rescue Unit ahead of schedule.
Rescue Unit Eliza.
Now, Eliza has been stationed on Goliath 19 for the last two months.
Now we expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.
So commence to jump forjoy.
You're about to be back in work.
In the meantime, hang in there.
Rest up.
You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out.
They're sending a Rescue Unit?
Why?
Why are they sending a Rescue Unit?
To fix the stalled Harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.
Well, then I'm going back.
That's it for me.
What?
Is that what you really think?
Yeah.
I've got a contract.
I'm going home.
You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.
- Hey, I'm going home.
- You're not going anywhere.
You know, you've been up here too long, man.
You've lost your marbles.
What, do you think Tess is back home, waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie?
What about the original Sam?
Huh?
I'm the original Sam!
I'm Sam fucking Bell!
- Hey, hey.
Whoa.
- Me!
Me!
Gerty, am I a clone?
Are you hungry?
Hey, hey.
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.
I'm in the same boat, asshole.
- Listen.
What about the other clones?
- What?
We might not be the first two to be woken up.
You said that model had already been started when you got here.
Well, who started it?
There might be others up here right now.
Think about it.
How did I get up here so quickly after your crash?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- They didn't ship me in from Central.
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.
I don't know what you're smoking.
Why would they do that?
That's ridiculous.
Impossible.
I bet there's some kind of secret room.
Secret room?
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?
You're the one who's lost your marbles.
I've been here for three years, man.
I know every inch of this base.
I know how many...
How much dirt's between those wall panels over there.
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?
Look, it's a company, right?
They have investors.
They have shareholders.
Shit like that.
What's cheaper?
Spending time and money training new personnel, or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job.
It's the far side of the moon.
The cheap fucks haven't even fixed the communications satellite yet.
Tess would know.
She would have told me.
Hey, Geppetto, wake up.
You really think they give a shit about us?
They're laughing all the way to the bank.
Tess would know.
She would have told me...
What do you get off fucking sitting there, sulking like a little fucking boy!
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Wake up!
I bet there's some area that we don't know about.
And I'm gonna find it.
Yeah, maybe you'll find some buried treasure, too.
Fuck!
Eliza arrival estimated 13 hours.
You found your secret room?
Just put that anywhere.
Now, that's a good idea.
That's...
That's where I keep my leprechauns.
- Get out of the way.
- What?
Why?
I want to look underneath that model.
You're not touching this model.
Get the fuck out of the way.
Listen, why don't you relax, okay?
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?
- Go read the encyclopedia or something?
- You're a tough guy now?
What, are you going to stab me?
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.
I'm a lover.
I'm not a fighter.
Put the knife down.
- Hey, hey, just...
- I want to look underneath there.
- Put the knife down.
- No.
I'm not going to give you the knife.
- Just get out of the way.
- Take it easy 'cause I...
- Let go of the knife.
- Don't ever tell me what to do, okay?
Just...
You let go.
Let go of the knife.
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't push me.
- Don't push me, motherfucker.
- Let go.
Let go.
Fucking told you to let go of the goddamn knife.
Little fucking...
Fucking little girl, man!
- God damn it!
- No!
No!
God damn it.
What did I tell you?
Okay, okay...
You gonna stop?
You gonna stop?
Okay, okay.
Jesus!
Fuck...
Fuck me.
What the fuck?
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.
- My fucking eye, man.
- Let me see.
- That's a lot of blood.
- Get off of me!
That's enough.
Well, appealing...
Nice feet, sexy...
Hello, Sam.
- Sam, is everything okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah, we had a fight, me and the other guy, the other...
He's very angry, you know.
Know what he did?
He flipped my entire model over.
Know how much work I put into that thing?
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours.
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours, yeah, exactly.
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours, really?
Approximately.
He's got a problem.
He scares me, Gerty.
What is it about Sam that scares you?
How he flies off the handle.
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...
She left me.
Tess left me, for six months.
She moved back in with her parents.
I know.
She gave me a second chance.
I promised her I'd change.
You have changed, Sam.
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here, I've sent Tess...
I've sent her over 100 video messages.
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
What about the messages she sent to me?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
Gerty...
Am I really a clone?
When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.
You woke up in the Infirmary.
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.
I kept you under observation and ran some tests.
I remember, yeah.
I remember that.
Sam, there was no crash.
You were being awakened.
It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests to establish mental stability and general physical health.
Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA can have considerable impact on...
What about...
What about Tess?
What about Eve?
They are memory implants, Sam.
Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell.
I am very sorry.
Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal.
Can I prepare you something?
Rescue arrival estimated 11 hours.
Okay, sweetheart?
Yeah, I'm staring into space.
Get it?
- Funny.
- Hey...
Thanks for this.
This is good.
This is cozy.
How's the...
How's the nose?
Much better, thank you.
I went haywire before, you know, I...
I lost it and I'm...
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay.
No, it's not okay.
I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I got a...
I got a temper.
I gotta do something about it.
Yes, you do.
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.
Can you turn that off?
Listen...
Listen, I wasn't supposed to...
I'm...
I'm trying to tell you something.
Can you turn...
Lunar instructed Gerty to...
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you...
- Tough guy.
- Listen to me...
- You look like a...
- What?
...radioactive tampon.
- I wasn't supposed to...
Or like a banana with a yeast infection.
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there.
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened,
I walked in on Gerty talking to Central.
He was having a live conversation.
- A live conversation?
- Yeah.
How do you know it was a live conversation?
Because it was a back and forth exchange.
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.
It was live, man.
It was live.
That's impossible.
There was a flare.
It fried the satellite.
The satellite's fine.
They don't want us to be able to contact Earth.
They lied to us.
They've been lying to us since the beginning.
They...
They've been lying to us since forever.
If the satellite works, how are they blocking the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base.
From where then?
Searching for long-range comms.
I'm just passing the last of the Harvesters.
Looks like John.
Searching for long-range comms.
How long until you're out of the base's range?
About a minute.
Ninety seconds, tops.
- You ever been out this far?
- No.
- Signal failure on long-range comms.
- Never have.
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.
You see anything?
It would help if I knew what the hell I was looking for.
Wait a second, I see something.
Approaching Station 3.
Holy shit.
I think I see something, too.
Approaching Station 1.
You see what I see?
Looks like an antenna or a pylon or something.
I think it's the jammer.
I knew it.
This is why we're not getting the live feed.
Sam?
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I hear you.
Yeah.
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm gonna head back to the base.
Okay, I'm gonna stay out here for a little while.
I'm gonna see if there's any more of these things.
Fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck.
Fuck.

Approaching Station 2.
Hey, I saw three more of those jammers.
I think the base is surrounded.
I printed out the coordinates.
What's wrong with you?
What's going on?
I found your secret room.
Who goes first?
I go first.
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.
Why are there so many of them?
Sam, can I help you with something?
Not now, Gerty.
I'm okay.
Gerty...
Why did you help me before?
With the password?
Doesn't that go against your programing or something?
Helping you is what I do.
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.
Searching for long-range comms.
Signal re-established.
Hello?
Is this the Bell residence?
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry.
She passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Eve?
- Yeah?
- Hi.
Hi, Eve.
How old...
How old are you now?
I'm 15.
- Do I know you?
- Oh, sweetheart.
How did Mommy die, sweetheart?
How did Mommy die?
Dad?
Yeah?
There's someone asking about Mom.
Who's asking about Mom?
That's enough.
That's enough.
I want to go home.
Eliza arrival estimated in seven hours.
Ow, fuck.
Shit.
- What, did you cut yourself?
- Yeah.
What are you laughing at?
Well, you don't hold it like you're trying to stab somebody.
For God sakes.
Here, give me that.
You gotta hold it closer to the blade, you see?
- Watch what I'm doing.
- Why are you shaking?
You carve out, like that.
That's it.
It's freezing in here.
Well, you're...
You're sitting under the fridge.
What's going on with you?
Are you all right?
Yeah, that crew they're sending in, if they...
If they find us awake at the same time, you know...
They're not gonna let us live.
You know that, right?
You know, their return vehicle is...
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Are you okay?
Maybe you should lay down for a while, take some tranquilizers or something.
If I take some tranquilizers, I'll never wake up again.
You'll be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm freezing.
Hey, hey...
Hey.
I'm really scared.
Where are you going?
Hello?
Is this the Bell residence?
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Gerty, I need to talk to you.
Of course, Sam.
How can I help?
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.
That hidden room, Gerty.
The lower deck is out of bounds to awakened clones, Sam.
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.
New clones can only be awakened once a three-year contract is completed.
Gerty, if we don't wake up a new clone, me and the other Sam will die, we will be killed.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Do you want me and the other Sam to be killed?
That is the last thing I want.
Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.
Okay, pal?
Eliza arrival estimated in five hours.
I am the one and only
God.
Hey.
What's going on?
You okay?
Don't...
Don't touch him.
Come here.
He's not conscious yet.
Gerty and I just woke him up.
Why?
What's going on?
Come on.
Come on outside.
When the rescue unit arrives, they're gonna expect to find a body in that crashed rover.
That guy?
What, are you going to kill him?
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?
Zip up your fly.
You're burning up.
You sweat like a pig.
Put your hat on.
- Put your hat on.
- I'm hot.
Hey, if we go through with this,
I'm gonna need your help hauling him out to the crash site.
What about us?
Eliza arrives, finds you and me as a welcome party...
They're not going to find you and me as a welcome party.
They're gonna find me, and you're going back to Earth before they get here.
In that helium-3 launcher.
I did the math.
You're gonna pull some Gs, but it should...
It should be fine.
You'll be all right.
You're going home.
You did your three years.
I can't expect you to stick around.
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.
I saw that VP.
She's beautiful.
She's gorgeous.
We did good.
High-five.
Go for it.
You go for it.
- You comfy?
- No.
- What?
- No!
What if I have to take a shit?
Just...
You'll have to hold it in, pal.
For three days?
That's the way it goes.
Need a hand?
No.
Fuck off.
All right.
No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.
Eliza arrival estimated three hours.
Hey.
We need to do this.
We wait too long and he's gonna be conscious.
Fuck me.
What's going on with you?
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.
I don't think I can move my legs.
Besides, look at me...
I meet Eve now, I'd scare the crap out of her.
What are you talking about, man?
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.
You're not going to kill anybody.
We can't kill anybody.
You can't.
I know you can't, 'cause I can't.
You go.
You're a good guy, Sam.
It was a good plan, you know.
You just picked the wrong guy to go back.
You...
You sure about this?
Yeah.
You should travel, you know.
I always wanted to do that.
Amsterdam, or...
Yeah, you know, I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe Mexico.
Aloha.
Bring me back a pina colada, all right, bro?
Hey...
Johnny Spaceman.
You remember Tess came in for that interview?
She was so beautiful.
She wasn't the best candidate, but it didn't matter.
I had to give her the job.
I wanted to keep her in the country.
- She was going back to Ireland.
- She was going back to Ireland.
You knew you had to take a chance, so you called her.
You were terrified.
You wrote that whole speech for her answering machine.
But you didn't need it, 'cause she picked up the phone.
She was, like, "Why is he calling me?
"The internship's over.
Why's he calling me at home?"
I asked her if she wanted to go get like an ice cream cone or something dorky like that.
She said, "Let's get a drink."
I said, "Okay.
What do you..."
Sam, this is not going to work.
What?
Why?
I've recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening.
If anyone were to check my memory cache, it would put you in considerable danger.
You could erase my memory banks.
I could reboot myself once you have departed.
Are you okay with that?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
I want to help you.
Eliza arrival estimated 24 minutes.
Sam.
Hey.
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot the moment that I've launched.
I understand, Sam.
Then you should be okay.
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.
Thanks, Gerty.
You gonna be okay?
Of course.
The new Sam and I will be back to our programing as soon as I've finished rebooting.
Gerty, we're not programed.
We're people.
Understand?
Eliza arrival estimated eight minutes.
Fuck!
Air lock pressurization complete.
Sam?
Hey, Sam?
You okay, buddy?
Cavalry's here.
Where am I?
You're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?
...made contact.
Yeah.
Yeah, Eliza?
He ain't going nowhere.
Bag him up and we'll get started on repairs to the Harvester.
Dwight, I'm gonna need the...
Lunar Industries stocks have slipped a further 32% after accusations...
Clone 6, the clone of Sam Bell, has been giving evidence at CAA's Board of Directors meeting in Seattle...
You know what?
He's one of two things.
He's a wacko or an illegal immigrant.
Either way, they need to lock him up.
Line two.
There was a time when energy was a dirty word.
When turning on your lights was a hard choice.
Cities in brownout.
Food shortages.
Cars burning fuel to run.
But that was the past.
Where are we now?
How do we make the world so much better?
Make deserts bloom?
Right now, we're the largest producer of fusion energy in the world.
The energy of the sun trapped in rock, harvested by machine from the far side of the moon.
Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3 to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet.
Who'd have thought?
All the energy we ever needed, right above our heads.
The power of the moon.
The power of our future.

How are things down there?
You guys been to any good parties or anything?
Oh, thanks for the football feed.
It almost felt live...
Almost.
But three years is a long haul, you know.
It's way, way, way, way, way too long.
I'm talking to myself on a regular basis.
So...
Time to go home, you know what I mean?
That's it.
Over and out.
Rock and roll.
God bless America.
I can do that for you, Sam.
God damn it.
I said I got it.
Why don't you listen to me?
Ready for launch.
Sam, is everything okay?
- Sam?
- What?
You don't seem like yourself today.
- Has something happened?
- You know...
Can you turn that off?
Please.
Jesus Christ.
Sam, it might help you to talk about it.
Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar Sat?
No, Sam.
What I understand is it's fairly low on the company's priority list right now.
You tell them to sort that out, you know what I'm talking about?
That's not...
I've only got two weeks, but it's not fair to whoever is coming up here next.
I will, Sam.
Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
No, come on, let's finish this.
Another one of those headaches.
Gerty, can you give me something for it?
Message received from your wife, Sam, via Jupiter link.
Fuck.
Hi, Sam.
It's me.
I got your last message.
It was really good to hear your voice.
I miss you, too.
I know you're really lonely up there, but I think, in a lot of ways, it's been really good for you.
For both of us.
God, I hope you don't mind me saying that.
I'm proud of you.
Someone's got something to say.
What did you want to say to Daddy, baby?
Say, astronaut.
Astronaut, Daddy.
Who's an astronaut?
Daddy's an astronaut.

Wave.
Give Daddy a wave.
Kathy, could you...
I can't believe you're going to be home soon.
It's her birthday next month.
And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden.
- Gerty.
- We could pick it out together.
Sam.
I love you.
And I miss you.
I miss you.
And I can't wait to see you.
Okay, sweetheart.
Bye.
Hi, Doug.
You're really full of yourself, aren't you, Doug?

Not good.
What about Dumbo?
Doesn't he object to your...
Yes.
Darrin objects.
But it's a special occasion because of the morning light.
Ah, fuck!
God damn it!
Fuck!
It's gotta smart, doesn't it, Gerty?
Sam, can I ask how it happened?
I told you, I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand.
You saw something on TV?
Yeah, I saw something on TV that distracted me.
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you.
But when I came in, the TV wasn't on.
Perhaps you were imagining things.
Yeah, you think too much, pal.
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.
I am the one and only
Oh, yeah!
Okay.
Shut up.
Morning, Gerty.
Morning, Sam.
How are you today?
Fine.
Fine.
- How's the hand?
- Oh, it's a little sore.
Little sore.
It's okay.
What's for breakfast?
The usual.
Two weeks to go, Sam.
Two weeks to go, buddy.
Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.
But thank you.
Thank you, Gerty.

You had an accident.
Do you remember what happened?
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.
Do you remember me?
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.
That's good.
That's very good.
It's nice to see you awake again.
I'd like to keep you under observation here in the Infirmary for a few days and run some tests.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.
Okay, bro.
You're still very tired.
We can talk later.
Hello?
...good working order, but we only have two working Harvesters now.
Come on, come on.
Yeah, well, that's no surprise, but it's not good enough.
Gerty, we're gonna have to find a way to ramp up production
- on Mark and John.
- I know.
This is incredible.
How do you manage to fucking break a Harvester and an employee, all in the same day?
These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know.
Gerty, what's the status on Harvester 3?
How are the repairs going ahead?
- Sam.
You're out of bed.
- Yeah.
I wanted to stretch my legs.
Who was that?
We've been having some problems with the Lunar Sat, and our live feed seems to be down.
I was recording a video message for Central, updating them on your progress.
Sam, you need to stay in bed.
You're not ready to walk around yet.
All right.
Could you give me my sunglasses?
It's really bright in here.
Give me my...
Give me all my stuff, you know.
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.
- Well, bring it in here.
- Certainly.
Excellent, Sam.
What...
When can I get out of here, Gerty?
Sam, you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash.
This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment.
So, what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?
Central has asked me to slow down the Harvesters to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back.
That's terrific.
It's fantastic.
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow, but it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
- Let's try another test.
- I don't want to try another test.
Please, Sam.
Hey, Gerty.
You know about this?
Matthew's got no velocity readout.
He's completely still.
He must have stalled.
Well, he's obviously stalled.
Don't you think we should tell Central?
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.
I'll pass on your message.
Message received from Earth via Jupiter link.
Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better.
Hey, we don't want you to take any unnecessary risks.
- You're too important to us.
- You're to stay put.
That is an order.
It's an order, Sam.
From Lunar.
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit to tend to the stalled Harvester and get the base back on its feet.
What the fuck is...
What the fuck...
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- What?
Sam, I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.
I don't appreciate that.
Being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.
Gerty!
Gerty!
Gerty, come here!
What happened?
I don't know.
Meteorites.
There have been no meteorites, Sam.
Micro-meteorites maybe, I don't know.
Either way, there might be damage to the exterior shell.
I think you'd better...
You'd better let me go outside and take a look.
There is no damage to the exterior shell.
Well, it's not that I don't believe you, Gerty, but I mean, you know, this thing is springing leaks like an Acme fire hose.
You need to let me go outside and fix this problem, Gerty.
I can't let you go outside, Sam.
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.
Just let...
We'll keep it between you and me.
Okay, pal?
This thing is springing gas, let's go.
Come on.
Just to check the exterior shell.
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay, Sam.
Thank you.
Gerty.
Searching for long-range comms.

Gerty!
Gerty!
I found him outside.
By the stalled Harvester.
Who is he?
Who is he?
We need to get him to the Infirmary.
You tell...
You tell me who that is.
You tell me who that is!
Sam Bell.
We need to get him to the Infirmary immediately.
Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?
Where...
Where am I?
The Infirmary.
You had an accident out by one of the Harvesters.
- Do you remember?
- I'm...
I'm thirsty.
I could get you some water.
I saw someone out there, Gerty.
I saw someone out there.
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries.
But all in all, the prognosis is good.
I'm happy to see you again.
- Gerty.
- Yes, Sam.
Is there someone in the room with us?
Sam, get some sleep.
You're very tired.
Spoke to Thompson today.
Now that you're up there, he's promising the world.
I think it was the right thing.
But...
It's just such a long time.
But I suppose there are things...
You know, that needed to happen.
I...
I need time to think.
Listen, Sam, be safe, and I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.
Gerty...
Gerty, what the...
What...
What the hell's going on?
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?
Sam, you're out of bed.
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?
Sam Bell.
Come on, come on, come on.
You are Sam Bell.
Sam, what is it?
It might help to talk about it.
Gerty, I don't understand what's happening.
I'm losing my mind.
We could run some tests.
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.
They don't know you were recovered alive from the accident...
Recovered alive?
What do you mean...
What are you talk...
Why didn't you report it to Central?
What are you talking about?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
Just getting my slippers.
- I'm using them.
I'm using them.
- No.
What?
These are mine.
These are mine.
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.
I'm Sam Bell, too.
What?
We've got that going for us.
Why...
How long have you...
What?
How long have you been here?
About a week.
So, how you doing?
- What?
- How are you doing?
How am I...
How am I doing?
How do you think I'm doing?
Good job.
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the Harvesters?
Harvesters are fine.
It's affected them.
Here, talking to a clone, that's slightly troubling.
I'm not a clone.
You're the clone.
Okay, Sam, you're not a clone.
Hey.
Hey, Ridley, you're not looking too good.
Butt out of this.
Davey, I'm talking to Ridley.
How you doing, pal?
Hey, I think Kathryn likes you.
I think she likes you, pal.
You're not looking too good, my friend.
Sorry you're not feeling too well.
You talking to yourself?
- I'll just get you all fixed up.
- How long have you been here?
Oh, I guess about three years.
Almost three years.
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank you.
I wanted to thank you for...
If it wasn't for you,
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover.
You saved my life and...
Hey, I know this is weird, you know.
I'm real lonely, you know...
I just want to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?
Maybe later.
What are you looking at?
You look just like me.
It's incredible.
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?
We look like each other, I guess.
Hey, you know...
It's weird for me, too, you know.
Fuck.
Hey.
Hey, you wanna play some Ping-Pong?
No.
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.
- What's the score?
-2-18.
Okay.
Do you want me to show you how to hold that?
No.
No, I...
I don't need you to show me how to hold it.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Should we, uh...
Should we play?
- Yeah.
God!
Shit!
-19-2.
- Yeah.
Do you want a stick of gum?
You know, we could approach this in a different way.
Remember when we went to flight school...
What are you doing?
I'm fixing the net.
It's very Zen, Ping-Pong.
You have to just relax.
How long did it take you to do that?
Well, I don't remember doing all of it.
I remember doing the church, and the Salvation Army, and a few of the people.
My mind's been acting kind of weird lately.
That's Fairfield, right?
There's the Town Hall.
Fairfield?
Of course, you know about Fairfield.
Yeah, there's Tess and Eve.
Do you know Tess?
Yeah.
I know Tess.
- You know about Eve, right?
- What?
I had a...
We had a girl.
Eve.
Isn't she beautiful?
She's my little monkey.
She's our little monkey.
High-five.
She might be the milkman's, but she's beautiful.
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.
Oh, shit.
- Greetings, Sam.
- How's our man?
You feeling better?
You have enough rest?
Okay, you resting up, Sam?
You better be, you bastard.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
We've got some good news.
The Jupiter Program had to be put on hiatus, so we got a few pairs of hands for you.
So, what we've managed to do is secure you a Rescue Unit ahead of schedule.
Rescue Unit Eliza.
Now, Eliza has been stationed on Goliath 19 for the last two months.
Now we expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.
So commence to jump forjoy.
You're about to be back in work.
In the meantime, hang in there.
Rest up.
You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out.
They're sending a Rescue Unit?
Why?
Why are they sending a Rescue Unit?
To fix the stalled Harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.
Well, then I'm going back.
That's it for me.
What?
Is that what you really think?
Yeah.
I've got a contract.
I'm going home.
You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.
- Hey, I'm going home.
- You're not going anywhere.
You know, you've been up here too long, man.
You've lost your marbles.
What, do you think Tess is back home, waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie?
What about the original Sam?
Huh?
I'm the original Sam!
I'm Sam fucking Bell!
- Hey, hey.
Whoa.
- Me!
Me!
Gerty, am I a clone?
Are you hungry?
Hey, hey.
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.
I'm in the same boat, asshole.
- Listen.
What about the other clones?
- What?
We might not be the first two to be woken up.
You said that model had already been started when you got here.
Well, who started it?
There might be others up here right now.
Think about it.
How did I get up here so quickly after your crash?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- They didn't ship me in from Central.
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.
I don't know what you're smoking.
Why would they do that?
That's ridiculous.
Impossible.
I bet there's some kind of secret room.
Secret room?
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?
You're the one who's lost your marbles.
I've been here for three years, man.
I know every inch of this base.
I know how many...
How much dirt's between those wall panels over there.
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?
Look, it's a company, right?
They have investors.
They have shareholders.
Shit like that.
What's cheaper?
Spending time and money training new personnel, or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job.
It's the far side of the moon.
The cheap fucks haven't even fixed the communications satellite yet.
Tess would know.
She would have told me.
Hey, Geppetto, wake up.
You really think they give a shit about us?
They're laughing all the way to the bank.
Tess would know.
She would have told me...
What do you get off fucking sitting there, sulking like a little fucking boy!
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Wake up!
I bet there's some area that we don't know about.
And I'm gonna find it.
Yeah, maybe you'll find some buried treasure, too.
Fuck!
Eliza arrival estimated 13 hours.
You found your secret room?
Just put that anywhere.
Now, that's a good idea.
That's...
That's where I keep my leprechauns.
- Get out of the way.
- What?
Why?
I want to look underneath that model.
You're not touching this model.
Get the fuck out of the way.
Listen, why don't you relax, okay?
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?
- Go read the encyclopedia or something?
- You're a tough guy now?
What, are you going to stab me?
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.
I'm a lover.
I'm not a fighter.
Put the knife down.
- Hey, hey, just...
- I want to look underneath there.
- Put the knife down.
- No.
I'm not going to give you the knife.
- Just get out of the way.
- Take it easy 'cause I...
- Let go of the knife.
- Don't ever tell me what to do, okay?
Just...
You let go.
Let go of the knife.
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't push me.
- Don't push me, motherfucker.
- Let go.
Let go.
Fucking told you to let go of the goddamn knife.
Little fucking...
Fucking little girl, man!
- God damn it!
- No!
No!
God damn it.
What did I tell you?
Okay, okay...
You gonna stop?
You gonna stop?
Okay, okay.
Jesus!
Fuck...
Fuck me.
What the fuck?
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.
- My fucking eye, man.
- Let me see.
- That's a lot of blood.
- Get off of me!
That's enough.
Well, appealing...
Nice feet, sexy...
Hello, Sam.
- Sam, is everything okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah, we had a fight, me and the other guy, the other...
He's very angry, you know.
Know what he did?
He flipped my entire model over.
Know how much work I put into that thing?
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours.
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours, yeah, exactly.
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours, really?
Approximately.
He's got a problem.
He scares me, Gerty.
What is it about Sam that scares you?
How he flies off the handle.
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...
She left me.
Tess left me, for six months.
She moved back in with her parents.
I know.
She gave me a second chance.
I promised her I'd change.
You have changed, Sam.
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here, I've sent Tess...
I've sent her over 100 video messages.
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
What about the messages she sent to me?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
Gerty...
Am I really a clone?
When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.
You woke up in the Infirmary.
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.
I kept you under observation and ran some tests.
I remember, yeah.
I remember that.
Sam, there was no crash.
You were being awakened.
It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests to establish mental stability and general physical health.
Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA can have considerable impact on...
What about...
What about Tess?
What about Eve?
They are memory implants, Sam.
Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell.
I am very sorry.
Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal.
Can I prepare you something?
Rescue arrival estimated 11 hours.
Okay, sweetheart?
Yeah, I'm staring into space.
Get it?
- Funny.
- Hey...
Thanks for this.
This is good.
This is cozy.
How's the...
How's the nose?
Much better, thank you.
I went haywire before, you know, I...
I lost it and I'm...
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay.
No, it's not okay.
I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I got a...
I got a temper.
I gotta do something about it.
Yes, you do.
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.
Can you turn that off?
Listen...
Listen, I wasn't supposed to...
I'm...
I'm trying to tell you something.
Can you turn...
Lunar instructed Gerty to...
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you...
- Tough guy.
- Listen to me...
- You look like a...
- What?
- ... radioactive tampon.
- I wasn't supposed to...
Or like a banana with a yeast infection.
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there.
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened,
I walked in on Gerty talking to Central.
He was having a live conversation.
- A live conversation?
- Yeah.
How do you know it was a live conversation?
Because it was a back and forth exchange.
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.
It was live, man.
It was live.
That's impossible.
There was a flare.
It fried the satellite.
The satellite's fine.
They don't want us to be able to contact Earth.
They lied to us.
They've been lying to us since the beginning.
They...
They've been lying to us since forever.
If the satellite works, how are they blocking the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base.
From where then?
Searching for long-range comms.
I'm just passing the last of the Harvesters.
Looks like John.
Searching for long-range comms.
How long until you're out of the base's range?
About a minute.
Ninety seconds, tops.
- You ever been out this far?
- No.
- Signal failure on long-range comms.
- Never have.
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.
You see anything?
It would help if I knew what the hell I was looking for.
Wait a second, I see something.
Approaching Station 3.
Holy shit.
I think I see something, too.
Approaching Station 1.
You see what I see?
Looks like an antenna or a pylon or something.
I think it's the jammer.
I knew it.
This is why we're not getting the live feed.
Sam?
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I hear you.
Yeah.
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm gonna head back to the base.
Okay, I'm gonna stay out here for a little while.
I'm gonna see if there's any more of these things.
Fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck.
Fuck.
Access denied.
Password accepted.

Safe trip.
Fuck.
Here she is.
I'm gonna go and see her soon.

Lay down, relax, and breathe deeply.
The cryogenic protection pod is designed to put you into a deep sleep for the duration of your three-day return journey back to Earth.
As you begin to feel sleepy, think about the magnificent job that you've done and how proud your family are of what you've accomplished.

Safe trip, Annyeonghi gaseyo, and goodbye.
Approaching Station 2.
Hey, I saw three more of those jammers.
I think the base is surrounded.
I printed out the coordinates.
What's wrong with you?
What's going on?
I found your secret room.
Who goes first?
I go first.
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.
Why are there so many of them?
Sam, can I help you with something?
Not now, Gerty.
I'm okay.
Gerty...
Why did you help me before?
With the password?
Doesn't that go against your programing or something?
Helping you is what I do.
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.
Searching for long-range comms.
Signal re-established.
Hello?
Is this the Bell residence?
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry.
She passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Eve?
- Yeah?
- Hi.
Hi, Eve.
How old...
How old are you now?
I'm 15.
- Do I know you?
- Oh, sweetheart.
How did Mommy die, sweetheart?
How did Mommy die?
Dad?
Yeah?
There's someone asking about Mom.
Who's asking about Mom?
That's enough.
That's enough.
I want to go home.
Eliza arrival estimated in seven hours.
Ow, fuck.
Shit.
- What, did you cut yourself?
- Yeah.
What are you laughing at?
Well, you don't hold it like you're trying to stab somebody.
For God sakes.
Here, give me that.
You gotta hold it closer to the blade, you see?
- Watch what I'm doing.
- Why are you shaking?
You carve out, like that.
That's it.
It's freezing in here.
Well, you're...
You're sitting under the fridge.
What's going on with you?
Are you all right?
Yeah, that crew they're sending in, if they...
If they find us awake at the same time, you know...
They're not gonna let us live.
You know that, right?
You know, their return vehicle is...
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Are you okay?
Maybe you should lay down for a while, take some tranquilizers or something.
If I take some tranquilizers, I'll never wake up again.
You'll be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm freezing.
Hey, hey...
Hey.
I'm really scared.
Where are you going?
Hello?
Is this the Bell residence?
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Gerty, I need to talk to you.
Of course, Sam.
How can I help?
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.
That hidden room, Gerty.
The lower deck is out of bounds to awakened clones, Sam.
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.
New clones can only be awakened once a three-year contract is completed.
Gerty, if we don't wake up a new clone, me and the other Sam will die, we will be killed.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Do you want me and the other Sam to be killed?
That is the last thing I want.
Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.
Okay, pal?
Eliza arrival estimated in five hours.
I am the one and only
God.
Hey.
What's going on?
You okay?
Don't...
Don't touch him.
Come here.
He's not conscious yet.
Gerty and I just woke him up.
Why?
What's going on?
Come on.
Come on outside.
When the rescue unit arrives, they're gonna expect to find a body in that crashed rover.
That guy?
What, are you going to kill him?
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?
Zip up your fly.
You're burning up.
You sweat like a pig.
Put your hat on.
- Put your hat on.
- I'm hot.
Hey, if we go through with this,
I'm gonna need your help hauling him out to the crash site.
What about us?
Eliza arrives, finds you and me as a welcome party...
They're not going to find you and me as a welcome party.
They're gonna find me, and you're going back to Earth before they get here.
In that helium-3 launcher.
I did the math.
You're gonna pull some Gs, but it should...
It should be fine.
You'll be all right.
You're going home.
You did your three years.
I can't expect you to stick around.
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.
I saw that VP.
She's beautiful.
She's gorgeous.
We did good.
High-five.
Go for it.
You go for it.
- You comfy?
- No.
- What?
- No!
What if I have to take a shit?
Just...
You'll have to hold it in, pal.
For three days?
That's the way it goes.
Need a hand?
No.
Fuck off.
All right.
No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.
Eliza arrival estimated three hours.
Hey.
We need to do this.
We wait too long and he's gonna be conscious.
Fuck me.
What's going on with you?
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.
I don't think I can move my legs.
Besides, look at me...
I meet Eve now, I'd scare the crap out of her.
What are you talking about, man?
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.
You're not going to kill anybody.
We can't kill anybody.
You can't.
I know you can't, 'cause I can't.
You go.
You're a good guy, Sam.
It was a good plan, you know.
You just picked the wrong guy to go back.
You...
You sure about this?
Yeah.
You should travel, you know.
I always wanted to do that.
Amsterdam, or...
Yeah, you know, I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe Mexico.
Aloha.
Bring me back a pina colada, all right, bro?
Hey...
Johnny Spaceman.
You remember Tess came in for that interview?
She was so beautiful.
She wasn't the best candidate, but it didn't matter.
I had to give her the job.
I wanted to keep her in the country.
- She was going back to Ireland.
- She was going back to Ireland.
You knew you had to take a chance, so you called her.
You were terrified.
You wrote that whole speech for her answering machine.
But you didn't need it, 'cause she picked up the phone.
She was, like, "Why is he calling me?
"The internship's over.
Why's he calling me at home?"
I asked her if she wanted to go get like an ice cream cone or something dorky like that.
She said, "Let's get a drink. "
I said, "Okay.
What do you... "
Sam, this is not going to work.
What?
Why?
I've recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening.
If anyone were to check my memory cache, it would put you in considerable danger.
You could erase my memory banks.
I could reboot myself once you have departed.
Are you okay with that?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
I want to help you.
Eliza arrival estimated 24 minutes.
Sam.
Hey.
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot the moment that I've launched.
I understand, Sam.
Then you should be okay.
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.
Thanks, Gerty.
You gonna be okay?
Of course.
The new Sam and I will be back to our programing as soon as I've finished rebooting.
Gerty, we're not programed.
We're people.
Understand?
Eliza arrival estimated eight minutes.
Fuck!
Air lock pressurization complete.
Sam?
Hey, Sam?
You okay, buddy?
Cavalry's here.
Where am I?
You're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?
...made contact.
Yeah.
Yeah, Eliza?
He ain't going nowhere.
Bag him up and we'll get started on repairs to the Harvester.
Dwight, I'm gonna need the...
Lunar Industries stocks have slipped a further 32% after accusations...
Clone 6, the clone of Sam Bell, has been giving evidence at CAA's Board of Directors meeting in Seattle...
You know what?
He's one of two things.
He's a wacko or an illegal immigrant.
Either way, they need to lock him up.
Line two.
There was a time when energy was a dirty word.
When turning on your lights was a hard choice.
Cities in brownout.
Food shortages.
Cars burning fuel to run.
But that was the past.
Where are we now?
How do we make the world so much better?
Make deserts bloom?
Right now, we're the largest producer of fusion energy in the world.
The energy of the sun trapped in rock, harvested by machine from the far side of the moon.
Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3 to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet.
Who'd have thought?
All the energy we ever needed, right above our heads.
The power of the moon.
The power of our future.

Hey, Gerty.
Gerty.
We gotta...
Good morning, Sam.
We got a live one on Mark.
I'm gonna go out now and rope her in.
Okay, Sam.
I want chocolate.
I think you're sweet enough.
You don't need chocolate.

How are things down there?
You guys been to any good parties or anything?
Oh, thanks for the football feed.
It almost felt live...
Almost.
But three years is a long haul, you know.
It's way, way, way, way, way too long.
I'm talking to myself on a regular basis.
So...
Time to go home, you know what I mean?
That's it.
Over and out.

I can do that for you, Sam.
God damn it.
I said I got it.
Why don't you listen to me?
Ready for launch.
Sam, is everything okay?
- Sam?
- What?
You don't seem like yourself today.
- Has something happened?
- You know...
Can you turn that off?
Please.
Jesus Christ.
Sam, it might help you to talk about it.
Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar Sat?
No, Sam.
What I understand is it's fairly low on the company's priority list right now.
You tell them to sort that out, you know what I'm talking about?
That's not...
I've only got two weeks, but it's not fair to whoever is coming up here next.
I will, Sam.
Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
No, come on, let's finish this.
Another one of those headaches.
Gerty, can you give me something for it?
Message received from your wife, Sam, via Jupiter link.
Fuck.
Hi, Sam.
It's me.
I got your last message.
It was really good to hear your voice.
I miss you, too.
I know you're really lonely up there, but I think, in a lot of ways, it's been really good for you.
For both of us.
God, I hope you don't mind me saying that.
I'm proud of you.
Someone's got something to say.
What did you want to say to Daddy, baby?
Say, astronaut.
Astronaut, Daddy.
Who's an astronaut?
Daddy's an astronaut.
Say it really loudly.
Daddy's an astronaut.
Clever girl.
Wave.
Give Daddy a wave.
Kathy, could you...
I can't believe you're going to be home soon.
It's her birthday next month.
And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden.
- Gerty.
- We could pick it out together.
Sam.
I love you.
I love you.
And I miss you.
I miss you.
And I can't wait to see you.
Okay, sweetheart.
Bye.
Hi, Doug.
You're really full of yourself, aren't you, Doug?
Kathryn.
Not good.
What about Dumbo?
Doesn't he object to your...
Yes.
Darrin objects.
But it's a special occasion because of the morning light.
Ah, fuck!
God damn it!
Fuck!
It's gotta smart, doesn't it, Gerty?
Sam, can I ask how it happened?
I told you, I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand.
You saw something on TV?
Yeah, I saw something on TV that distracted me.
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you.
But when I came in, the TV wasn't on.
Perhaps you were imagining things.
Yeah, you think too much, pal.
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.
I am the one and only
Oh, yeah!
Okay.
Shut up.
Morning, Gerty.
Morning, Sam.
How are you today?
Fine.
Fine.
- How's the hand?
- Oh, it's a little sore.
Little sore.
It's okay.
What's for breakfast?
The usual.
Two weeks to go, Sam.
Two weeks to go, buddy.
Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.
But thank you.
Thank you, Gerty.
You're welcome, Sam.
8:19 Pacific Time.
Readouts are as follows.
Matthew, 9.8 miles.
Mark is nine...
Hey, Gerty...
Rock and roll.
Mark...
Mark's 11 miles on the button.
Luke's a little twitchy today.
Hey, Gerty, looks like we got a live one out on Matthew.
I'm gonna go out in a few minutes.
I'm just going to finish my coffee, okay?
Okay, Sam.

Where am...
Where am I?
Sam, you're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.
Do you remember what happened?
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.
Do you remember me?
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.
That's good.
That's very good.
It's nice to see you awake again.
I'd like to keep you under observation here in the Infirmary for a few days and run some tests.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.
Okay, bro.
You're still very tired.
We can talk later.
Hello?
...good working order, but we only have two working Harvesters now.
Come on, come on.
Yeah, well, that's no surprise, but it's not good enough.
Gerty, we're gonna have to find a way to ramp up production
- on Mark and John.
- I know.
This is incredible.
How do you manage to fucking break a Harvester and an employee, all in the same day?
These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know.
Gerty, what's the status on Harvester 3?
How are the repairs going ahead?
- Sam.
You're out of bed.
- Yeah.
I wanted to stretch my legs.
Who was that?
We've been having some problems with the Lunar Sat, and our live feed seems to be down.
I was recording a video message for Central, updating them on your progress.
Sam, you need to stay in bed.
You're not ready to walk around yet.
All right.
Could you give me my sunglasses?
It's really bright in here.
Give me my...
Give me all my stuff, you know.
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.
- Well, bring it in here.
- Certainly.
Excellent, Sam.
What...
When can I get out of here, Gerty?
Sam, you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash.
This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment.
So, what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?
Central has asked me to slow down the Harvesters to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back.
That's terrific.
It's fantastic.
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow, but it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
- Let's try another test.
- I don't want to try another test.
Please, Sam.
Hey, Gerty.
You know about this?
Matthew's got no velocity readout.
He's completely still.
He must have stalled.
Well, he's obviously stalled.
Don't you think we should tell Central?
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.
I'll pass on your message.
Message received from Earth via Jupiter link.
Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better.
Hey, we don't want you to take any unnecessary risks.
- You're too important to us.
- You're to stay put.
That is an order.
It's an order, Sam.
From Lunar.
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit to tend to the stalled Harvester and get the base back on its feet.
What the fuck is...
What the fuck...
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- What?
Sam, I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.
I don't appreciate that.
Being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.
Gerty!
Gerty!
Gerty, come here!
What happened?
I don't know.
Meteorites.
There have been no meteorites, Sam.
Micro-meteorites maybe, I don't know.
Either way, there might be damage to the exterior shell.
I think you'd better...
You'd better let me go outside and take a look.
There is no damage to the exterior shell.
Well, it's not that I don't believe you, Gerty, but I mean, you know, this thing is springing leaks like an Acme fire hose.
You need to let me go outside and fix this problem, Gerty.
I can't let you go outside, Sam.
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.
Just let...
We'll keep it between you and me.
Okay, pal?
This thing is springing gas, let's go.
Come on.
Just to check the exterior shell.
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay, Sam.
Thank you.
Gerty.

Gerty!
Gerty!
I found him outside.
By the stalled Harvester.
Who is he?
Who is he?
We need to get him to the Infirmary.
You tell...
You tell me who that is.
You tell me who that is!
Sam Bell.
We need to get him to the Infirmary immediately.
Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?
Where...
Where am I?
The Infirmary.
You had an accident out by one of the Harvesters.
- Do you remember?
- I'm...
I'm thirsty.
I could get you some water.
I saw someone out there, Gerty.
I saw someone out there.
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries.
But all in all, the prognosis is good.
I'm happy to see you again.
- Gerty.
- Yes, Sam.
Is there someone in the room with us?
Sam, get some sleep.
You're very tired.
Spoke to Thompson today.
Now that you're up there, he's promising the world.
I think it was the right thing.
But...
It's just such a long time.
But I suppose there are things...
You know, that needed to happen.
I...
I need time to think.
Listen, Sam, be safe, and I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.
Gerty...
Gerty, what the...
What...
What the hell's going on?
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?
Sam, you're out of bed.
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?
Sam Bell.
Come on, come on, come on.
You are Sam Bell.
Sam, what is it?
It might help to talk about it.
Gerty, I don't understand what's happening.
I'm losing my mind.
We could run some tests.
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.
They don't know you were recovered alive from the accident...
Recovered alive?
What do you mean...
What are you talk...
Why didn't you report it to Central?
What are you talking about?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
Just getting my slippers.
- I'm using them.
I'm using them.
- No.
What?
These are mine.
These are mine.
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.
I'm Sam Bell, too.
What?
We've got that going for us.
Why...
How long have you...
What?
How long have you been here?
About a week.
So, how you doing?
- What?
- How are you doing?
How am I...
How am I doing?
How do you think I'm doing?
Good job.
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the Harvesters?
Harvesters are fine.
It's affected them.
Here, talking to a clone, that's slightly troubling.
I'm not a clone.
You're the clone.
Okay, Sam, you're not a clone.
Hey.
Hey, Ridley, you're not looking too good.
Butt out of this.
Davey, I'm talking to Ridley.
How you doing, pal?
Hey, I think Kathryn likes you.
I think she likes you, pal.
You're not looking too good, my friend.
Sorry you're not feeling too well.
You talking to yourself?
- I'll just get you all fixed up.
- How long have you been here?
Oh, I guess about three years.
Almost three years.
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank you.
I wanted to thank you for...
If it wasn't for you,
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover.
You saved my life and...
Hey, I know this is weird, you know.
I'm real lonely, you know...
I just want to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?
Maybe later.
What are you looking at?
You look just like me.
It's incredible.
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?
We look like each other, I guess.
Hey, you know...
It's weird for me, too, you know.
Fuck.
Hey.
Hey, you wanna play some Ping-Pong?
No.
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.
- What's the score?
- 2-18.
Okay.
Do you want me to show you how to hold that?
No.
No, I...
I don't need you to show me how to hold it.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Should we, uh...
Should we play?
- Yeah.
God!
Shit!
- 19-2.
- Yeah.
Do you want a stick of gum?
You know, we could approach this in a different way.
Remember when we went to flight school...
What are you doing?
I'm fixing the net.
It's very Zen, Ping-Pong.
You have to just relax.
How long did it take you to do that?
Well, I don't remember doing all of it.
I remember doing the church, and the Salvation Army, and a few of the people.
My mind's been acting kind of weird lately.
That's Fairfield, right?
There's the Town Hall.
Fairfield?
Of course, you know about Fairfield.
Yeah, there's Tess and Eve.
Do you know Tess?
Yeah.
I know Tess.
- You know about Eve, right?
- What?
I had a...
We had a girl.
Eve.
Isn't she beautiful?
She's my little monkey.
She's our little monkey.
High-five.
She might be the milkman's, but she's beautiful.
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.
Oh, shit.
- Greetings, Sam.
- How's our man?
You feeling better?
You have enough rest?
Okay, you resting up, Sam?
You better be, you bastard.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
We've got some good news.
The Jupiter Program had to be put on hiatus, so we got a few pairs of hands for you.
So, what we've managed to do is secure you a Rescue Unit ahead of schedule.
Rescue Unit Eliza.
Now, Eliza has been stationed on Goliath 19 for the last two months.
Now we expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.
So commence to jump for joy.
You're about to be back in work.
In the meantime, hang in there.
Rest up.
You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out.
They're sending a Rescue Unit?
Why?
Why are they sending a Rescue Unit?
To fix the stalled Harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.
Well, then I'm going back.
That's it for me.
What?
Is that what you really think?
Yeah.
I've got a contract.
I'm going home.
You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.
- Hey, I'm going home.
- You're not going anywhere.
You know, you've been up here too long, man.
You've lost your marbles.
What, do you think Tess is back home, waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie?
What about the original Sam?
Huh?
I'm the original Sam!
I'm Sam fucking Bell!
- Hey, hey.
Whoa.
- Me!
Me!
Gerty, am I a clone?
Are you hungry?
Hey, hey.
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.
I'm in the same boat, asshole.
- Listen.
What about the other clones?
- What?
We might not be the first two to be woken up.
You said that model had already been started when you got here.
Well, who started it?
There might be others up here right now.
Think about it.
How did I get up here so quickly after your crash?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- They didn't ship me in from Central.
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.
I don't know what you're smoking.
Why would they do that?
That's ridiculous.
Impossible.
I bet there's some kind of secret room.
Secret room?
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?
You're the one who's lost your marbles.
I've been here for three years, man.
I know every inch of this base.
I know how many...
How much dirt's between those wall panels over there.
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?
Look, it's a company, right?
They have investors.
They have shareholders.
Shit like that.
What's cheaper?
Spending time and money training new personnel, or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job.
It's the far side of the moon.
The cheap fucks haven't even fixed the communications satellite yet.
Tess would know.
She would have told me.
Hey, Geppetto, wake up.
You really think they give a shit about us?
They're laughing all the way to the bank.
Tess would know.
She would have told me...
What do you get off fucking sitting there, sulking like a little fucking boy!
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Wake up!
I bet there's some area that we don't know about.
And I'm gonna find it.
Yeah, maybe you'll find some buried treasure, too.
Fuck!
Eliza arrival estimated 13 hours.
You found your secret room?
Just put that anywhere.
Now, that's a good idea.
That's...
That's where I keep my leprechauns.
- Get out of the way.
- What?
Why?
I want to look underneath that model.
You're not touching this model.
Get the fuck out of the way.
Listen, why don't you relax, okay?
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?
- Go read the encyclopedia or something?
- You're a tough guy now?
What, are you going to stab me?
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.
I'm a lover.
I'm not a fighter.
Put the knife down.
- Hey, hey, just...
- I want to look underneath there.
- Put the knife down.
- No.
I'm not going to give you the knife.
- Just get out of the way.
- Take it easy 'cause I...
- Let go of the knife.
- Don't ever tell me what to do, okay?
Just...
You let go.
Let go of the knife.
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't push me.
- Don't push me, motherfucker.
- Let go.
Let go.
Fucking told you to let go of the goddamn knife.
Little fucking...
Fucking little girl, man!
- God damn it!
- No!
No!
God damn it.
What did I tell you?
Okay, okay...
You gonna stop?
You gonna stop?
Okay, okay.
Jesus!
Fuck...
Fuck me.
What the fuck?
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.
- My fucking eye, man.
- Let me see.
- That's a lot of blood.
- Get off of me!
That's enough.
Well, appealing...
Nice feet, sexy...
Hello, Sam.
- Sam, is everything okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah, we had a fight, me and the other guy, the other...
He's very angry, you know.
Know what he did?
He flipped my entire model over.
Know how much work I put into that thing?
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours.
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours, yeah, exactly.
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours, really?
Approximately.
He's got a problem.
He scares me, Gerty.
What is it about Sam that scares you?
How he flies off the handle.
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...
She left me.
Tess left me, for six months.
She moved back in with her parents.
I know.
She gave me a second chance.
I promised her I'd change.
You have changed, Sam.
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here, I've sent Tess...
I've sent her over 100 video messages.
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
What about the messages she sent to me?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
Gerty...
Am I really a clone?
When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.
You woke up in the Infirmary.
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.
I kept you under observation and ran some tests.
I remember, yeah.
I remember that.
Sam, there was no crash.
You were being awakened.
It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests to establish mental stability and general physical health.
Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA can have considerable impact on...
What about...
What about Tess?
What about Eve?
They are memory implants, Sam.
Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell.
I am very sorry.
Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal.
Can I prepare you something?
Rescue arrival estimated 11 hours.
Okay, sweetheart?
Yeah, I'm staring into space.
Get it?
- Funny.
- Hey...
Thanks for this.
This is good.
This is cozy.
How's the...
How's the nose?
Much better, thank you.
I went haywire before, you know, I...
I lost it and I'm...
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay.
No, it's not okay.
I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I got a...
I got a temper.
I gotta do something about it.
Yes, you do.
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.
Can you turn that off?
Listen...
Listen, I wasn't supposed to...
I'm...
I'm trying to tell you something.
Can you turn...
Lunar instructed Gerty to...
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you...
- Tough guy.
- Listen to me...
- You look like a...
- What?
...radioactive tampon.
- I wasn't supposed to...
Or like a banana with a yeast infection.
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there.
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened,
I walked in on Gerty talking to Central.
He was having a live conversation.
- A live conversation?
- Yeah.
How do you know it was a live conversation?
Because it was a back and forth exchange.
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.
It was live, man.
It was live.
That's impossible.
There was a flare.
It fried the satellite.
The satellite's fine.
They don't want us to be able to contact Earth.
They lied to us.
They've been lying to us since the beginning.
They...
They've been lying to us since forever.
If the satellite works, how are they blocking the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base.
From where then?
Searching for long-range comms.
I'm just passing the last of the Harvesters.
Looks like John.
Searching for long-range comms.
How long until you're out of the base's range?
About a minute.

- No.

- Never have.

Holy shit.
I think I see something, too.
Approaching Station 1.
You see what I see?
Looks like an antenna or a pylon or something.
I think it's the jammer.
I knew it.
This is why we're not getting the live feed.
Sam?
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I hear you.
Yeah.
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm gonna head back to the base.
Okay, I'm gonna stay out here for a little while.
I'm gonna see if there's any more of these things.
Fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck.
Fuck.

Approaching Station 2.
Hey, I saw three more of those jammers.
I think the base is surrounded.
I printed out the coordinates.
What's wrong with you?
What's going on?
I found your secret room.
Who goes first?
I go first.
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.
Why are there so many of them?
Sam, can I help you with something?
Not now, Gerty.
I'm okay.

Why did you help me before?
With the password?
Doesn't that go against your programing or something?

I'm sorry.
She passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Eve?

- Hi.
Hi, Eve.
How old...
How old are you now?
I'm 15.
- Do I know you?
- Oh, sweetheart.
How did Mommy die, sweetheart?
How did Mommy die?

Yeah?
There's someone asking about Mom.
Who's asking about Mom?
That's enough.
That's enough.
I want to go home.

Ow, fuck.
Shit.
- What, did you cut yourself?
- Yeah.
What are you laughing at?
Well, you don't hold it like you're trying to stab somebody.
For God sakes.
Here, give me that.
You gotta hold it closer to the blade, you see?
- Watch what I'm doing.
- Why are you shaking?
You carve out, like that.
That's it.
It's freezing in here.
Well, you're...
You're sitting under the fridge.
What's going on with you?
Are you all right?
Yeah, that crew they're sending in, if they...
If they find us awake at the same time, you know...
They're not gonna let us live.
You know that, right?
You know, their return vehicle is...
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Are you okay?
Maybe you should lay down for a while, take some tranquilizers or something.
If I take some tranquilizers, I'll never wake up again.
You'll be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm freezing.
Hey, hey...
Hey.
I'm really scared.

Gerty, I need to talk to you.
Of course, Sam.
How can I help?
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.
That hidden room, Gerty.
The lower deck is out of bounds to awakened clones, Sam.
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.
New clones can only be awakened once a three-year contract is completed.
Gerty, if we don't wake up a new clone, me and the other Sam will die, we will be killed.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Do you want me and the other Sam to be killed?
That is the last thing I want.
Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.
Okay, pal?
Eliza arrival estimated in five hours.
I am the one and only
God.
Hey.
What's going on?
You okay?
Don't...
Don't touch him.
Come here.
He's not conscious yet.
Gerty and I just woke him up.
Why?
What's going on?
Come on.
Come on outside.
When the rescue unit arrives, they're gonna expect to find a body in that crashed rover.
That guy?
What, are you going to kill him?
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?
Zip up your fly.
You're burning up.
You sweat like a pig.
Put your hat on.
- Put your hat on.
- I'm hot.
Hey, if we go through with this,
I'm gonna need your help hauling him out to the crash site.
What about us?
Eliza arrives, finds you and me as a welcome party...
They're not going to find you and me as a welcome party.
They're gonna find me, and you're going back to Earth before they get here.
In that helium-3 launcher.
I did the math.
You're gonna pull some Gs, but it should...
It should be fine.
You'll be all right.
You're going home.
You did your three years.
I can't expect you to stick around.
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.
I saw that VP.
She's beautiful.
She's gorgeous.
We did good.
High-five.
Go for it.
You go for it.
- You comfy?
- No.
- What?
- No!
What if I have to take a shit?
Just...
You'll have to hold it in, pal.
For three days?
That's the way it goes.
Need a hand?
No.
Fuck off.
All right.
No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.
Eliza arrival estimated three hours.
Hey.
We need to do this.
We wait too long and he's gonna be conscious.
Fuck me.
What's going on with you?
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.
I don't think I can move my legs.
Besides, look at me...
I meet Eve now, I'd scare the crap out of her.
What are you talking about, man?
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.
You're not going to kill anybody.
We can't kill anybody.
You can't.
I know you can't, 'cause I can't.
You go.
You're a good guy, Sam.
It was a good plan, you know.
You just picked the wrong guy to go back.
You...
You sure about this?
Yeah.
You should travel, you know.
I always wanted to do that.
Amsterdam, or...
Yeah, you know, I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe Mexico.
Aloha.
Bring me back a pina colada, all right, bro?
Hey...
Johnny Spaceman.
You remember Tess came in for that interview?
She was so beautiful.
She wasn't the best candidate, but it didn't matter.
I had to give her the job.
I wanted to keep her in the country.
- She was going back to Ireland.
- She was going back to Ireland.
You knew you had to take a chance, so you called her.
You were terrified.
You wrote that whole speech for her answering machine.
But you didn't need it, 'cause she picked up the phone.
She was, like, "Why is he calling me?"
"The internship's over.
Why's he calling me at home?"
I asked her if she wanted to go get like an ice cream cone or something dorky like that.
She said, "Let's get a drink."
I said, "Okay.
What do you..."
Sam, this is not going to work.
What?
Why?
I've recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening.
If anyone were to check my memory cache, it would put you in considerable danger.
You could erase my memory banks.
I could reboot myself once you have departed.
Are you okay with that?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
I want to help you.
Eliza arrival estimated 24 minutes.
Sam.
Hey.
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot the moment that I've launched.
I understand, Sam.
Then you should be okay.
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.
Thanks, Gerty.
You gonna be okay?
Of course.
The new Sam and I will be back to our programing as soon as I've finished rebooting.
Gerty, we're not programed.
We're people.
Understand?
Eliza arrival estimated eight minutes.
Fuck!
Air lock pressurization complete.
Sam?
Hey, Sam?
You okay, buddy?
Cavalry's here.
Where am I?
You're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?
...made contact.
Yeah.
Yeah, Eliza?
He ain't going nowhere.
Bag him up and we'll get started on repairs to the Harvester.
Dwight, I'm gonna need the...
Lunar Industries stocks have slipped a further 32% after accusations...
Clone 6, the clone of Sam Bell, has been giving evidence at CAA's Board of Directors meeting in Seattle...
You know what?
He's one of two things.
He's a wacko or an illegal immigrant.
Either way, they need to lock him up.
Line two.
The last place you'd ever expect to find yourself.
There was a time when energy was a dirty word.
When turning on your lights was a hard choice.
Cities in brownout.
Food shortages.
Cars burning fuel to run.
But that was the past.
Where are we now?
How do we make the world so much better?
Make deserts bloom?
Right now, we're the largest producer of fusion energy in the world.
The energy of the sun trapped in rock, harvested by machine from the far side of the moon.
Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3 to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet.
Who'd have thought?
All the energy we ever needed, right above our heads.
The power of the moon.
The power of our future.

I...
Hey, Gerty.
Gerty.
We gotta...
Good morning, Sam.
We got a live one on Mark.
I'm gonna go out now and rope her in.
Okay, Sam.
I want chocolate.
I think you're sweet enough.
You don't need chocolate.

I've got a full container of helium-3 ready to roll.
By the time this message reaches you, it should be in transit.
Otherwise, everything running smoothly.
How are things down there?
You guys been to any good parties or anything?
Oh, thanks for the football feed.
It almost felt live...
Almost.
But three years is a long haul, you know.
It's way, way, way, way, way too long.
I'm talking to myself on a regular basis.
So...
Time to go home, you know what I mean?
That's it.
Over and out.
Rock and roll.
God bless America.
I can do that for you, Sam.
God damn it.
I said I got it.
Why don't you listen to me?
Ready for launch.
Sam, is everything okay?
- Sam?
- What?
You don't seem like yourself today.
- Has something happened?
- You know...
Can you turn that off?
Please.
Jesus Christ.
Sam, it might help you to talk about it.
Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar Sat?
No, Sam.
What I understand is it's fairly low on the company's priority list right now.
You tell them to sort that out, you know what I'm talking about?
That's not...
I've only got two weeks, but it's not fair to whoever is coming up here next.
I will, Sam.
Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
No, come on, let's finish this.
Another one of those headaches.
Gerty, can you give me something for it?
Message received from your wife, Sam, via Jupiter link.
Fuck.
Hi, Sam.
It's me.
I got your last message.
It was really good to hear your voice.
I miss you, too.
I know you're really lonely up there, but I think, in a lot of ways, it's been really good for you.
For both of us.
God, I hope you don't mind me saying that.
I'm proud of you.
Someone's got something to say.
What did you want to say to Daddy, baby?
Say, astronaut.
Astronaut, Daddy.
Who's an astronaut?
Daddy's an astronaut.
Say it really loudly.
Daddy's an astronaut.
Clever girl.
Wave.
Give Daddy a wave.
Kathy, could you...
I can't believe you're going to be home soon.
It's her birthday next month.
And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden.
- Gerty.
- We could pick it out together.
Sam.
I love you.
And I miss you.
I miss you.
And I can't wait to see you.
Okay, sweetheart.
Bye.
Hi, Doug.
You're really full of yourself, aren't you, Doug?
Kathryn.
Not good.
What about Dumbo?
Doesn't he object to your...
Yes.
Darrin objects.
But it's a special occasion because of the morning light.
Ah, fuck!
God damn it!
Fuck!
It's gotta smart, doesn't it, Gerty?
Sam, can I ask how it happened?
I told you, I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand.
You saw something on TV?
Yeah, I saw something on TV that distracted me.
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you.
But when I came in, the TV wasn't on.
Perhaps you were imagining things.
Yeah, you think too much, pal.
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.
I am the one and only.
Oh, yeah!
Okay.
Shut up.
Morning, Gerty.
Morning, Sam.
How are you today?
Fine.
Fine.
- How's the hand?
- Oh, it's a little sore.
Little sore.
It's okay.
What's for breakfast?
The usual.
Two weeks to go, Sam.
Two weeks to go, buddy.
Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.
But thank you.
Thank you, Gerty.
You're welcome, Sam.
8:19 Pacific Time.
Readouts are as follows.
Matthew, 9.8 miles.
Mark is nine...
Hey, Gerty...
Rock and roll.
Mark...
Mark's 11 miles on the button.
Luke's a little twitchy today.
Hey, Gerty, looks like we got a live one out on Matthew.
I'm gonna go out in a few minutes.
I'm just going to finish my coffee, okay?
Okay, Sam.
Searching for long-range comms.

Danger.
Atmospheric compromise.
Where am...
Where am I?
Sam, you're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.
Do you remember what happened?
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.
Do you remember me?
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.
That's good.
That's very good.
It's nice to see you awake again.
I'd like to keep you under observation here in the Infirmary for a few days and run some tests.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.
Okay, bro.
You're still very tired.
We can talk later.
Hello?
...good working order, but we only have two working Harvesters now.
Come on, come on.
Yeah, well, that's no surprise, but it's not good enough.
Gerty, we're gonna have to find a way to ramp up production
- on Mark and John.
- I know.
This is incredible.
How do you manage to fucking break a Harvester and an employee, all in the same day?
These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know.
Gerty, what's the status on Harvester 3?
How are the repairs going ahead?
- Sam.
You're out of bed.
- Yeah.
I wanted to stretch my legs.
Who was that?
We've been having some problems with the Lunar Sat, and our live feed seems to be down.
I was recording a video message for Central, updating them on your progress.
Sam, you need to stay in bed.
You're not ready to walk around yet.
All right.
Could you give me my sunglasses?
It's really bright in here.
Give me my...
Give me all my stuff, you know.
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.
- Well, bring it in here.
- Certainly.
Excellent, Sam.
What...
When can I get out of here, Gerty?
Sam, you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash.
This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment.
So, what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?
Central has asked me to slow down the Harvesters to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back.
That's terrific.
It's fantastic.
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow, but it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
- Let's try another test.
- I don't want to try another test.
Please, Sam.
Hey, Gerty.
You know about this?
Matthew's got no velocity readout.
He's completely still.
He must have stalled.
Well, he's obviously stalled.
Don't you think we should tell Central?
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.
I'll pass on your message.
Message received from Earth via Jupiter link.
Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better.
Hey, we don't want you to take any unnecessary risks.
- You're too important to us.
- You're to stay put.
That is an order.
It's an order, Sam.
From Lunar.
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit to tend to the stalled Harvester and get the base back on its feet.
What the fuck is...
What the fuck...
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- What?
Sam, I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.
I don't appreciate that.
Being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.
Gerty!
Gerty!
Gerty, come here!
What happened?
I don't know.
Meteorites.
There have been no meteorites, Sam.
Micro-meteorites maybe, I don't know.
Either way, there might be damage to the exterior shell.
I think you'd better...
You'd better let me go outside and take a look.
There is no damage to the exterior shell.
Well, it's not that I don't believe you, Gerty, but I mean, you know, this thing is springing leaks like an Acme fire hose.
You need to let me go outside and fix this problem, Gerty.
I can't let you go outside, Sam.
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.
Just let...
We'll keep it between you and me.
Okay, pal?
This thing is springing gas, let's go.
Come on.
Just to check the exterior shell.
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay, Sam.
Thank you.
Gerty.

Gerty!
Gerty!
I found him outside.
By the stalled Harvester.
Who is he?
Who is he?
We need to get him to the Infirmary.
You tell...
You tell me who that is.
You tell me who that is!
Sam Bell.
We need to get him to the Infirmary immediately.
Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?
Where...
Where am I?
The Infirmary.
You had an accident out by one of the Harvesters.
- Do you remember?
- I'm...
I'm thirsty.
I could get you some water.
I saw someone out there, Gerty.
I saw someone out there.
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries.
But all in all, the prognosis is good.
I'm happy to see you again.
- Gerty.
- Yes, Sam.
Is there someone in the room with us?
Sam, get some sleep.
You're very tired.
Spoke to Thompson today.
Now that you're up there, he's promising the world.
I think it was the right thing.
But...
It's just such a long time.
But I suppose there are things...
You know, that needed to happen.
I...
I need time to think.
Listen, Sam, be safe, and I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.
Gerty...
Gerty, what the...
What...
What the hell's going on?
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?
Sam, you're out of bed.
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?
Sam Bell.
Come on, come on, come on.
You are Sam Bell.
Sam, what is it?
It might help to talk about it.
Gerty, I don't understand what's happening.
I'm losing my mind.
We could run some tests.
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.
They don't know you were recovered alive from the accident...
Recovered alive?
What do you mean...
What are you talk...
Why didn't you report it to Central?
What are you talking about?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
Just getting my slippers.
- I'm using them.
I'm using them.
- No.
What?
These are mine.
These are mine.
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.
I'm Sam Bell, too.
What?
We've got that going for us.
Why...
How long have you...
What?
How long have you been here?
About a week.
So, how you doing?
- What?
- How are you doing?
How am I...
How am I doing?
How do you think I'm doing?
Good job.
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the Harvesters?
Harvesters are fine.
It's affected them.
Here, talking to a clone, that's slightly troubling.
I'm not a clone.
You're the clone.
Okay, Sam, you're not a clone.
Hey.
Hey, Ridley, you're not looking too good.
Butt out of this.
Davey, I'm talking to Ridley.
How you doing, pal?
Hey, I think Kathryn likes you.
I think she likes you, pal.
You're not looking too good, my friend.
Sorry you're not feeling too well.
You talking to yourself?
- I'll just get you all fixed up.
- How long have you been here?
Oh, I guess about three years.
Almost three years.
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank you.
I wanted to thank you for...
If it wasn't for you,
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover.
You saved my life and...
Hey, I know this is weird, you know.
I'm real lonely, you know...
I just want to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?
Maybe later.
What are you looking at?
You look just like me.
It's incredible.
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?
We look like each other, I guess.
Hey, you know...
It's weird for me, too, you know.
Fuck.
Hey.
Hey, you wanna play some Ping-Pong?
No.
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.
- What's the score?
- 2-18.
Okay.
Do you want me to show you how to hold that?
No.
No, I...
I don't need you to show me how to hold it.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Should we, uh...
Should we play?
- Yeah.
God!
Shit!
- 19-2.
- Yeah.
Do you want a stick of gum?
You know, we could approach this in a different way.
Remember when we went to flight school...
What are you doing?
I'm fixing the net.
It's very Zen, Ping-Pong.
You have to just relax.
How long did it take you to do that?
Well, I don't remember doing all of it.
I remember doing the church, and the Salvation Army, and a few of the people.
My mind's been acting kind of weird lately.
That's Fairfield, right?
There's the Town Hall.
Fairfield?
Of course, you know about Fairfield.
Yeah, there's Tess and Eve.
Do you know Tess?
Yeah.
I know Tess.
- You know about Eve, right?
- What?
I had a...
We had a girl.
Eve.
Isn't she beautiful?
She's my little monkey.
She's our little monkey.
High-five.
She might be the milkman's, but she's beautiful.
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.
Oh, shit.
- Greetings, Sam.
- How's our man?
You feeling better?
You have enough rest?
Okay, you resting up, Sam?
You better be, you bastard.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
We've got some good news.
The Jupiter Program had to be put on hiatus, so we got a few pairs of hands for you.
So, what we've managed to do is secure you a Rescue Unit ahead of schedule.
Rescue Unit Eliza.
Now, Eliza has been stationed on Goliath 19 for the last two months.
Now we expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.
So commence to jump for joy.
You're about to be back in work.
In the meantime, hang in there.
Rest up.
You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out.
They're sending a Rescue Unit?
Why?
Why are they sending a Rescue Unit?
To fix the stalled Harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.
Well, then I'm going back.
That's it for me.
What?
Is that what you really think?
Yeah.
I've got a contract.
I'm going home.
You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.
- Hey, I'm going home.
- You're not going anywhere.
You know, you've been up here too long, man.
You've lost your marbles.
What, do you think Tess is back home, waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie?
What about the original Sam?
Huh?
I'm the original Sam!
I'm Sam fucking Bell!
- Hey, hey.
Whoa.
- Me!
Me!
Gerty, am I a clone?
Are you hungry?
Hey, hey.
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.
I'm in the same boat, asshole.
- Listen.
What about the other clones?
- What?
We might not be the first two to be woken up.
You said that model had already been started when you got here.
Well, who started it?
There might be others up here right now.
Think about it.
How did I get up here so quickly after your crash?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- They didn't ship me in from Central.
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.
I don't know what you're smoking.
Why would they do that?
That's ridiculous.
Impossible.
I bet there's some kind of secret room.
Secret room?
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?
You're the one who's lost your marbles.
I've been here for three years, man.
I know every inch of this base.
I know how many...
How much dirt's between those wall panels over there.
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?
Look, it's a company, right?
They have investors.
They have shareholders.
Shit like that.
What's cheaper?
Spending time and money training new personnel, or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job.
It's the far side of the moon.
The cheap fucks haven't even fixed the communications satellite yet.
Tess would know.
She would have told me.
Hey, Geppetto, wake up.
You really think they give a shit about us?
They're laughing all the way to the bank.
Tess would know.
She would have told me...
What do you get off fucking sitting there, sulking like a little fucking boy!
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Wake up!
I bet there's some area that we don't know about.
And I'm gonna find it.
Yeah, maybe you'll find some buried treasure, too.
Fuck!
Eliza arrival estimated 13 hours.
You found your secret room?
Just put that anywhere.
Now, that's a good idea.
That's...
That's where I keep my leprechauns.
- Get out of the way.
- What?
Why?
I want to look underneath that model.
You're not touching this model.
Get the fuck out of the way.
Listen, why don't you relax, okay?
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?
- Go read the encyclopedia or something?
- You're a tough guy now?
What, are you going to stab me?
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.
I'm a lover.
I'm not a fighter.
Put the knife down.
- Hey, hey, just...
- I want to look underneath there.
- Put the knife down.
- No.
I'm not going to give you the knife.
- Just get out of the way.
- Take it easy 'cause I...
- Let go of the knife.
- Don't ever tell me what to do, okay?
Just...
You let go.
Let go of the knife.
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't push me.
- Don't push me, motherfucker.
- Let go.
Let go.
Fucking told you to let go of the goddamn knife.
Little fucking...
Fucking little girl, man!
- God damn it!
- No!
No!
God damn it.
What did I tell you?
Okay, okay...
You gonna stop?
You gonna stop?
Okay, okay.
Jesus!
Fuck...
Fuck me.
What the fuck?
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.
- My fucking eye, man.
- Let me see.
- That's a lot of blood.
- Get off of me!
That's enough.
Well, appealing...
Nice feet, sexy...
Hello, Sam.
- Sam, is everything okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah, we had a fight, me and the other guy, the other...
He's very angry, you know.
Know what he did?
He flipped my entire model over.
Know how much work I put into that thing?
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours.
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours, yeah, exactly.
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours, really?
Approximately.
He's got a problem.
He scares me, Gerty.
What is it about Sam that scares you?
How he flies off the handle.
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...
She left me.
Tess left me, for six months.
She moved back in with her parents.
I know.
She gave me a second chance.
I promised her I'd change.
You have changed, Sam.
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here, I've sent Tess...
I've sent her over 100 video messages.
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
What about the messages she sent to me?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
Gerty...
Am I really a clone?
When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.
You woke up in the Infirmary.
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.
I kept you under observation and ran some tests.
I remember, yeah.
I remember that.
Sam, there was no crash.
You were being awakened.
It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests to establish mental stability and general physical health.
Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA can have considerable impact on...
What about...
What about Tess?
What about Eve?
They are memory implants, Sam.
Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell.
I am very sorry.
Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal.
Can I prepare you something?
Rescue arrival estimated 11 hours.
Okay, sweetheart?
Yeah, I'm staring into space.
Get it?
- Funny.
- Hey...
Thanks for this.
This is good.
This is cozy.
How's the...
How's the nose?
Much better, thank you.
I went haywire before, you know, I...
I lost it and I'm...
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay.
No, it's not okay.
I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I got a...
I got a temper.
I gotta do something about it.
Yes, you do.
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.
Can you turn that off?
Listen...
Listen, I wasn't supposed to...
I'm...
I'm trying to tell you something.
Can you turn...
Lunar instructed Gerty to...
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you...
- Tough guy.
- Listen to me...
- You look like a...
- What?
- ...radioactive tampon.
- I wasn't supposed to...
Or like a banana with a yeast infection.
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there.
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened,
I walked in on Gerty talking to Central.
He was having a live conversation.
- A live conversation?
- Yeah.
How do you know it was a live conversation?
Because it was a back and forth exchange.
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.
It was live, man.
It was live.
That's impossible.
There was a flare.
It fried the satellite.
The satellite's fine.
They don't want us to be able to contact Earth.
They lied to us.
They've been lying to us since the beginning.
They...
They've been lying to us since forever.
If the satellite works, how are they blocking the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base.
From where then?
Searching for long-range comms.
I'm just passing the last of the Harvesters.
Looks like John.
Searching for long-range comms.
How long until you're out of the base's range?
About a minute.
Ninety seconds, tops.
- You ever been out this far?
- No.
- Signal failure on long-range comms.
- Never have.
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.
You see anything?
It would help if I knew what the hell I was looking for.
Wait a second, I see something.
Approaching Station 3.
Holy shit.
I think I see something, too.
Approaching Station 1.
You see what I see?
Looks like an antenna or a pylon or something.
I think it's the jammer.
I knew it.
This is why we're not getting the live feed.
Sam?
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I hear you.
Yeah.
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm gonna head back to the base.
Okay, I'm gonna stay out here for a little while.
I'm gonna see if there's any more of these things.
Fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck.
Fuck.

Approaching Station 2.
Hey, I saw three more of those jammers.
I think the base is surrounded.
I printed out the coordinates.
What's wrong with you?
What's going on?
I found your secret room.
Who goes first?
I go first.
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.
Why are there so many of them?
Sam, can I help you with something?
Not now, Gerty.
I'm okay.
Gerty...
Why did you help me before?
With the password?
Doesn't that go against your programing or something?
Helping you is what I do.
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.

Hello?

This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry.
She passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Eve?
- Yeah?
- Hi.
Hi, Eve.
How old...
How old are you now?
I'm 15.
- Do I know you?
- Oh, sweetheart.
How did Mommy die, sweetheart?
How did Mommy die?
Dad?
Yeah?
There's someone asking about Mom.
Who's asking about Mom?
That's enough.
That's enough.
I want to go home.
Eliza arrival estimated in seven hours.
Ow, fuck.
Shit.
- What, did you cut yourself?
- Yeah.
What are you laughing at?
Well, you don't hold it like you're trying to stab somebody.
For God sakes.
Here, give me that.
You gotta hold it closer to the blade, you see?
- Watch what I'm doing.
- Why are you shaking?
You carve out, like that.
That's it.
It's freezing in here.
Well, you're...
You're sitting under the fridge.
What's going on with you?
Are you all right?
Yeah, that crew they're sending in, if they...
If they find us awake at the same time, you know...
They're not gonna let us live.
You know that, right?
You know, their return vehicle is...
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Are you okay?
Maybe you should lay down for a while, take some tranquilizers or something.
If I take some tranquilizers, I'll never wake up again.
You'll be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm freezing.
Hey, hey...
Hey.
I'm really scared.
Where are you going?
Hello?
Is this the Bell residence?
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Gerty, I need to talk to you.
Of course, Sam.
How can I help?
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.
That hidden room, Gerty.
The lower deck is out of bounds to awakened clones, Sam.
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.
New clones can only be awakened once a three-year contract is completed.
Gerty, if we don't wake up a new clone, me and the other Sam will die, we will be killed.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Do you want me and the other Sam to be killed?
That is the last thing I want.
Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.
Okay, pal?
Eliza arrival estimated in five hours.
I am the one and only
God.
Hey.
What's going on?
You okay?
Don't...
Don't touch him.
Come here.
He's not conscious yet.
Gerty and I just woke him up.
Why?
What's going on?
Come on.
Come on outside.
When the rescue unit arrives, they're gonna expect to find a body in that crashed rover.
That guy?
What, are you going to kill him?
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?
Zip up your fly.
You're burning up.
You sweat like a pig.
Put your hat on.
- Put your hat on.
- I'm hot.
Hey, if we go through with this,
I'm gonna need your help hauling him out to the crash site.
What about us?
Eliza arrives, finds you and me as a welcome party...
They're not going to find you and me as a welcome party.
They're gonna find me, and you're going back to Earth before they get here.
In that helium-3 launcher.
I did the math.
You're gonna pull some Gs, but it should...
It should be fine.
You'll be all right.
You're going home.
You did your three years.
I can't expect you to stick around.
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.
I saw that VP.
She's beautiful.
She's gorgeous.
We did good.
High-five.
Go for it.
You go for it.
- You comfy?
- No.
- What?
- No!
What if I have to take a shit?
Just...
You'll have to hold it in, pal.
For three days?
That's the way it goes.
Need a hand?
No.
Fuck off.
All right.
No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.
Eliza arrival estimated three hours.
Hey.
We need to do this.
We wait too long and he's gonna be conscious.
Fuck me.
What's going on with you?
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.
I don't think I can move my legs.
Besides, look at me...
I meet Eve now, I'd scare the crap out of her.
What are you talking about, man?
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.
You're not going to kill anybody.
We can't kill anybody.
You can't.
I know you can't, 'cause I can't.
You go.
You're a good guy, Sam.
It was a good plan, you know.
You just picked the wrong guy to go back.
You...
You sure about this?
Yeah.
You should travel, you know.
I always wanted to do that.
Amsterdam, or...
Yeah, you know, I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe Mexico.
Aloha.
Bring me back a piña colada, all right, bro?
Hey...
Johnny Spaceman.
You remember Tess came in for that interview?
She was so beautiful.
She wasn't the best candidate, but it didn't matter.
I had to give her the job.
I wanted to keep her in the country.
- She was going back to Ireland.
- She was going back to Ireland.
You knew you had to take a chance, so you called her.
You were terrified.
You wrote that whole speech for her answering machine.
But you didn't need it, 'cause she picked up the phone.
She was, like, "Why is he calling me?"
"The internship's over.
Why's he calling me at home?"
I asked her if she wanted to go get like an ice cream cone or something dorky like that.
She said, "Let's get a drink."
I said, "Okay.
What do you..."
Sam, this is not going to work.
What?
Why?
I've recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening.
If anyone were to check my memory cache, it would put you in considerable danger.
You could erase my memory banks.
I could reboot myself once you have departed.
Are you okay with that?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
I want to help you.
Eliza arrival estimated 24 minutes.
Sam.
Hey.
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot the moment that I've launched.
I understand, Sam.
Then you should be okay.
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.
Thanks, Gerty.
You gonna be okay?
Of course.
The new Sam and I will be back to our programing as soon as I've finished rebooting.
Gerty, we're not programed.
We're people.
Understand?
Eliza arrival estimated eight minutes.
Fuck!
Air lock pressurization complete.
Sam?
Hey, Sam?
You okay, buddy?
Cavalry's here.
Where am I?
You're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?
...made contact.
Yeah.
Yeah, Eliza?
He ain't going nowhere.
Bag him up and we'll get started on repairs to the Harvester.
Dwight, I'm gonna need the...
Lunar Industries stocks have slipped a further 32% after accusations...
Clone 6, the clone of Sam Bell, has been giving evidence at CAA's Board of Directors meeting in Seattle...
You know what?
He's one of two things.
He's a wacko or an illegal immigrant.
Either way, they need to lock him up.
Line two.
There was a time when "energy" was a dirty word.
When turning on your lights was a hard choice.
Cities in brownout... food shortages, cars burning fuel to run.
But that was the past.
Where are we now?
How do we make the world so much better?
Make deserts bloom!
Right now, we are the largest producer of fusion energy in the world.
The energy of the sun, trapped in rock, harvested by machine from the far side of the moon.
Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3... to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet.
Who would have thought that all energy we ever needed is right above our heads?
The power of the moon... the power of our future.

How are things down there?
You guys been having any... good parties or anything?
Oh, thanks for the... for the football feed!
It almost felt live.
Almost!
Three years is a long haul.
You know?
It's way, way, way, way, way too long!
I'm talking to myself... on a regular basis!
So...
Time to go home, you know what I mean?
That's it, over and out!
Rock and roll, God bless America!
I can do that for you, Sam.
God damn it!
I said I got it!
Why don't you listen to me?
Package ready for launch.
Sam, is everything OK?
Sam?
What?
You don't seem like yourself today.
Is something wrong?
No.
Can you turn that off, please?
Jesus Christ!
Sam, it might help you to talk about it.
Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar-Sat?
No, Sam.
From what I understand, it is fairly low... on the company's priority list right now.
You tell them to sort that out.
You know what I'm talking about?
That's not?
I've only got two weeks!
But it's not fair for whoever's coming up here next.
I will, Sam.
Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
No, come on;
let's finish this.
Got one of those headaches...
Can you give me something for it?
Message received from your wife, Sam... via Jupiter link.
Fuck!
Hi, Sam!
It's me.
I got your last message.
It was really good to hear your voice.
I miss you, too!
I know you're really lonely up there...
But I think...
In a lot of ways... it's been really good for you.
For both of us.
God, I hope you do not mind me saying that.
I'm proud of you!
Someone has got something to say.
What did you want to say to daddy, baby?
Say "astronaut".
Astronaut.
He is an astronaut!
Say daddy's an astronaut.
Say it really loud.
Daddy's an astronaut.
Clever girl!
Wave!
Give daddy a wave!
Kathy, could you?
I can't believe you're going to be home soon.
It's her birthday next month...
And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden.
Gerty!
We could work at it together.
Sam...
I love you!
I love you!
And I miss you!
I miss you!
And I can't wait to see you.
OK, sweetheart...
Goodbye.
Hi, Doug!
You're really full of yourself, aren't you, Doug?
Kath...
Not good!
What about Dumbo?
Fuck!
God damn it!
Fuck!
Wasn't kind of smart, was it, Gerty?
Sam, can I ask how it happened?
I told you.
I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand.
You saw something on TV?
Yeah, I something on TV that distracted me.
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you... but when I came in, the TV wasn't on.
Perhaps you were imagining things?
Yeah, you think too much, pal.
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.
Shut up!
Good morning, Gerty.
Good morning, Sam.
How are you today?
Fine!
Fine.
How is the hand?
Oh, it's a little sore!
A little sore.
It's OK.
What's for breakfast?
The usual.
Mmhmm.
Two weeks to go, Sam.
Two weeks to go, buddy!
Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.
But, thank you.
Thank you, Gerty.
You're welcome, Sam.

Sam, you're in the infirmary.
You had an accident.
Do you remember what happened?
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.
Do you remember me?
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.
That's good.
That is very good.
It's nice to see you awake again.
I'd like to keep you under observation here in the infirmary for a few days
And run some tests.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.
OK, pal.
You're still very tired.
We can talk later.
Hello?
The new Sam is in reworking order.
But we only have two working harvesters now.
Yeah, well, what a surprise!
Gerty, we're going to have to find a way to ramp up production.
I know.
This is incredible!
But how do you manage to destroy... a fucking rover, a harvester and an employee all on the same day?
These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know.
Gerty, what is the status on Harvester 3?
How do the repairs look on...
Sam, you're out of bed.
Yeah.
I wanted to stretch my legs a bit.
Who was that?
We've been having some problems with the Lunar-Sat...
And our live feed seems to be down.
I was recording a video-message for Central...
Updating them on your progress.
Sam, you need to stay in bed.
You're not ready to walk around yet.
Can you bring me my sunglasses?
It's really bright in here.
Give me some...
Give me all my stuff, you know?
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.
Well, bring them in here.
Certainly.
Excellent, Sam.
What...
When can I get out of here, Gerty?
Sam, you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash.
This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment.
So what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?
Central has asked me to slow down the harvesters... to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back.
That's terrific!
That's fantastic!
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow.
But it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
Let's try another test.
I don't want to try another test!
Please, Sam.
Hey, Gerty?
Do you know about this?
Matthew has got no velocity readout.
He is completely still.
He must have stalled.
Well, he has obviously stalled.
Don't you think we should tell Central?
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.
I will pass on your message.
Message received from Earth via Jupiter link.
Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better.
Yeah, we don't want you to take any unnecessary risks.
You are too important to us.
You stay put.
That is an order.
It's an order, Sam... from Lunar.
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit... to tend to the stalled harvester and get the base back on its feet.
Fuck is with...?
What the fuck?
I'm sorry, Sam.
What?
Sam...
I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.
I don't appreciate that was being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.
Gerty!
Gerty!
Gerty, come here!
What happened?
I do not know, maybe a meteorite...
There have been no meteorites, Sam.
Micrometeorites, maybe.
I do not know.
Either way, there might be damage to the exterior shell.
I think you better... you better let me go outside and take a look.
There is no damage to the exterior shell.
Well, it's not that I don't believe you, Gerty...
But, you know, this thing is springing leaks like an Acme firehose.
You need to let me go outside and fix this problem, Gerty.
I can't let you go outside, Sam.
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.
Just let...
We'll keep it between you and me, ok, pal?
This thing is leaking gas.
Let's go!
Come on...
Just to check the exterior shell?
Of course.
OK, Sam.
Thank you.

You tell me who that is!
Sam Bell.
We need to get him to the infirmary immediately.
Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?
Where am I?
The infirmary.
You had an accident out by one of the harvesters.
Do you remember?
No, I'm thirsty.
I could get you some water.
I saw someone out there, Gerty.
I saw someone out there.
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries.
But, all in all, the prognosis is good.
I'm happy to see you again.
Gerty?
Yes, Sam?
Is there someone in the room with us?
Sam, get some sleep.
You're very tired.
Spoke to Thompson today.
They are in Europe, they are promising the world.
I think it was the right thing.
But... it's just such a long time.
I suppose there are things...
You know... that needed to happen.
I need time to think.
Listen... umm...
Sam...
Be safe...
And I'll...
I'll talk to you soon.
Goodbye.
Gerty?
Gerty, what the fuck, what the hell's going on?
Who is the guy?
Who is the guy in the rec room?
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?
Sam, you're out out of bed.
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.
Who is the guy?
Who is the guy in the rec room?
Sam Bell.
Come on, come on, come on!
You are Sam Bell.
Sam, what is it?
It might help to talk about it.
I don't understand what is happening...
I think I'm starting to lose my mind.
We can run some tests.
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.
They do not know that you were recovered alive from the accident.
"Recovered alive"?
What do you mean?
Why did not you report it to Central?
What are you talking about?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
I'm just getting my slippers...
I'm using them...
I'm using them.
These are mine.
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.
I'm Sam Bell, too!
What?
Well, we've got that going for us.
Why...?
How long have you been...
What?
How long have you been here?
About a week.
So how are you doing?
What?
How are you doing?
"How am I doing?"
How do you think I'm doing?
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the harvesters?
Harvesters are fine.
It's the fact that I'm here talking to a clone that's slightly troubling.
I'm not a clone.
I'm not a clone!
You're the clone.
Okay, Sam.
You're not a clone.
Hey, hey...
You're not looking too good.
Sh!
Butt out of this!
I'm not even talking to you, pal.
I think that Katherine likes you.
I think she likes you a bit.
You're not looking too good, my friend.
I hope you're not feeling too bad.
Are you talking to yourself?
Let's just get you fixed up...
How long have you been here?
Well, it's about... three years.
For almost three years.
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank you?
I wanted to thank you for, um...
If it wasn't for you, I'd...
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover.
You saved my life.
Hey, I know this is weird, you know...?
I'm real lonely, you know, I...
I just wanted to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?
Maybe later.
What are you looking at?
You look just like me; it's incredible.
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?
We look like each other, I guess.
I don't know.
Hey, you know...
It's weird for me, too, you know?
Hey?
Hey, you want to play some ping-pong?
No.
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.
What's the score?
2-18.
OK
Do you want me to show you how to hold that?
No...
No, I...
I don't need you to show me how to hold it!
OK, OK
Yeah, "OK"
Should we play?
Yeah!
Fuck!
God!
Shit!
19-2.
Yeah...
You want a...
You want a stick of gum?
You know...
You should approach this in a different way.
Remember when you went to flight school?
What are you doing?
I'm fixing the net.
It is very Zen with ping-pong, you have to just to relax.
How long did it take you took to do that?
Oh, I don't remember doing all of it.
I remember doing the church...
and the Salvation Army.
And doing the people.
My mind has been acting kind of weird lately.
That's Fairfield, right?
There's the town hall.

Yeah, that's Tess... and Eve...

Ain't she beautiful?
She's my little monkey.
She's our little monkey.
High five!
She might be the milkman's, but she's beautiful.
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.
Oh shit!
Greetings, Sam.
How's our man?
You feeling better?
Have you had enough rest?
You resting up, Sam?
You better be, you bastard.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
We've got some good news.
The Jupiter program had to be put on hiatus, so we've got a few pairs of hands for you.
So what we've manage to do is cue you a rescue unit ahead of schedule.
Rescue Unit Eliza.
Eliza has been stationed on Goliath-19 for the last 2 months.
We expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.
So commence to jump for joy!
You're about to be back at work.
In the meantime, hang in there.
Rest up.
You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out!
They're sending a rescue unit?
Why?
Why are they sending a rescue unit?
To fix the stalled harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.
Well, then I'm going back.
That's it for me.
What?
Is that what you really think?
Yeah.
I've got a contract!
I'm going home.
You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.
Hey, I'm going home!
Home!
You're not going anywhere.
You know, you've been up here too long, man.
You have lost your marbles.
What do you think, Tess is back home, waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie?
What about the original Sam?
Huh?
I am the original Sam!
I am Sam-fucking-Bell.
Hey!
Me!
Me!
Gerty, am I a clone?
Are you hungry?
Hey, hey...
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.
I'm in the same boat, asshole.
Listen...
What about the other clones?
What?
We might not be the first two to have been woken up.
You said that that model had already been started when you got here.
Well, who started it?
There might be others up here right now.
Think about it.
How did I get up here so quickly after your crash?
I don't know...
They didn't ship me in from Central.
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.
I don't know what you're smoking.
Why would they do that?
That's ridiculous.
Impossible.
I bet there's some kind of secret room.
"Secret room"?
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?
You know, you are the one that has lost your marbles.
I've been here three years, man.
I know every inch of this base.
And I know how many dirt is between those wall panels over there.
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?
Look, it's a company, right?
They have investors, they have shareholders.
Shit like that.
What's cheaper?
Spending time and money training new personnel...
Or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job?
It's the far side of the moon!
Those cheap fucks haven't even fixed the communication satellite yet!
Tess would know, she would have told me...
Hey, Gepetto, wake up!
You really think they give a shit about us?
They're laughing all the way to the bank!
Tess would know, she would have told me...
Where do you get off?
!
Fucking sitting there sulking like a little fucking boy!
Jesus Christ...
Wake up!
There's some area that we don't know about.
And I'm going to find it.
Yeah, maybe you'll find some buried treasure, too.
Fuck!
Eliza arrival estimated in 13 hours.
You find your secret room?
Just put that anywhere.
Yes, that's a good idea...
That's where I keep my leprechauns.
Get out of the way.
What?
Why?
I want to look underneath that model.
You're not touching this model.
Get the fuck out of the way!
Listen, why don't you just relax, right?
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?
Go read the encyclopedia or something?
Oh, you're a tough guy now?
What, are you going to stab me?
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.
I'm a lover, not a fighter.
Put the knife down.
I want to look underneath there.
Put the knife down.
No, I'm not going to give you the knife.
What?
Just get out of the way.
Take it easy.
Let go of the knife.
Don't ever tell me what to do.
Let go.
You let go of the knife.
Don't be an asshole.
Don't push me.
Don't push me, motherfucker!
Let go.
Let go!
What did I fucking tell you?
"Let go of the goddamn knife."
You fucking little girl, man!
Damn it!
What did I tell you?
You going to stop?
You going to stop?
OK!
OK!
Jesus, fuck!
Fuck me!
What the fuck?
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.
Let me see.
That's a lot of blood.
Get off of me!
Hello, Sam.
Sam, is everything OK?
Yeah!
Yeah, we had a fight.
Me and the other guy, the other...
He's very angry, you know?
You know what he did?
He flipped my entire model over!
You know how much work I put into that thing? Approximately.
He's got a problem.
He scares me, Gerty.
What is it about Sam that scares you?
The guy flies off the handle.
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...
She left me.
Tess left me.
For 6 months.
She moved back in with her parents.
I know.
She gave me a second chance.
I promised her that I'd change.
You have changed, Sam.
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here, I've sent Tess...
I've sent her over a hundred video messages.
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
What about the messages she sent to me?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
Gerty...
Gerty?
Am I really a clone?
When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.
You woke up in the infirmary.
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.
I kept you under observation and ran some tests.
I remember, yea, I remember that...
Sam, there was no crash.
You were being awakened.
It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests... to establish mental stability... and general physical health.
Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA... can have considerable impact on...
What about Tess?
What about Eve?
They are memory implants, Sam.
Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell.
I'm very sorry.
Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal.
Can I prepare you something?
Rescue arrival estimated in 11 hours.
You OK, sweetheart?
Yeah, I'm staring into space.
Hey!
Thanks for this, this is good.
This is cozy.
How's the nose?
Much better, thank you.
I went haywire before.
You know...
I lost it.
I...
I'm sorry about that.
It's OK.
No, it's not OK.
I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I've got...
I've got a temper, I've got to do something about that.
Yes, you do.
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.
Can you turn that off?
Listen.
Listen.
I wasn't supposed to...
I'm trying to tell you something.
I never instructed Gerty to...
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you...
Tough Guy.
Listen to me!
You look like a radioactive tampon.
Like a banana with a yeast infection.
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there.
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened...
I walked in on Gerty talking with Central.
He was having a live conversation.
"A live conversation"?
Yeah How do you know it was a live conversation?
Because it was a back-and-forth exchange.
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.
It was live, man, it was live.
That's impossible.
There was a flare, it fried the satellite.
The satellite is fine.
They don't want us to be able to contact Earth.
They lied to us.
They've been lying to us since the beginning.
They've been lying since forever.
If the satellite works, how are they blocking the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base?
From where, then?
Searching for long-range comms.
Searching for long-range comms.
I'm just passing the last of the harvesters.
Looks like John.
Searching for long-range comms.
How long until you are out of the base's range?
Um, a minute.
ever been out this far?
No... never have.
Signal failure on long-range comms.

See anything?
It'd help if I knew what the hell I was looking for.
Wait a second, I see something.
Approaching station 3.
Holy shit!
I think I see something, too.
Approaching station 1.
Do you see what I see?
Looks like an antenna or... or...
A pylon or something.
I think it's the jammer.
Dude!
This is why we're not getting the live feed.
Sam?
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah I hear you.
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm going to...
I'm going to head back to the base.
OK, I'm going to stay out here for a while.
I'm going to see if there's any more of these things.
Fuck...
Fuck...

Rescue arrival estimated in 9 hours.
Lay down, relax and breathe deeply.
The cryogenic protection pod is designed to put you into a deep sleep for...
The duration of your three-day return journey back to Earth.
As you begin to feel sleepy, think about the magnificent job that you've done.
And how proud your family are of what you've accomplished.
Lunar Industries remains the #1 provider of clean energy worldwide...
Due to the hard work of people like you.
Safe trip, "Annyeong-hi kyeseyo" and goodbye.
Approaching station 2.
Hey, I saw 3 more of those jammers.
I think the base is surrounded with them.
I printed out their coordinates.
Bud, what's wrong with you?
What's going on?
I found your secret room.
Who goes first?
I go first.
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.
Why are there so many of them?
Sam, can I help you with something?
Not now, Gerty.
I'm OK.
Gerty, why did you help me before?
With the password?
Doesn't that go against your programming or something?
Helping you is what I do.

Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Eve?
Yeah.
Hi!
Hi, Eve.
How old old are you now?
I'm 15.
Do I know you?
Sweetheart...
How did mommy die, sweetheart?
How did mommy die?
Dad!
Yeah.
There's someone asking about mom.
Who's asking about mom?
That's enough.
That's enough.
I want to go home!
...want to go...
Eliza arrival estimated in 7 hours.
Fuck!
What, did you cut yourself?
Yeah.
What are you laughing at?
Well, you don't hold it like you're trying to stab somebody, for God's sakes.
Here, give me that.
You've got to hold it closer to the blade, you see?
Watch what I'm doing.
Why are you shaking?
Carve out like that.
It's freezing in here.
Well, you're sitting under the fridge.
What's going on with you?
You all right?
Yeah, that crew they're sending us...
If they find us awake at the same time, they aren't going to let us live.
You know that, right?
You know, the return vehicle is a...
You OK?
You should lay down for a while.
Take some tranquilizers or something.
"Take some tranquilizers"?
I'll never wake up again.
You're going to be OK.
Everything's going to be OK.
I'm freezing.
Hey, hey?
Hey?
I'm really scared.
Where are you going?
Hello?
Is this the Bell residence?
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Gerty, I need to talk to you.
Of course, Sam, how can I help?
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.
That hidden room, Gerty.
The lower deck is out-of-bounds to awakened clones, Sam.
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.
New clones can only be awakened once a three-year contract is completed.
Gerty, if you don't wake up another clone, me and the other Sam will die.
We will be killed, do you understand?
Yes.
You want me and the other Sam to be killed?
That is the last thing I want.
Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.
OK, pal?
Eliza arrival estimated in 5 hours.
What's going on?
You OK?
Don't, don't touch him.
Come here.
He's not conscious yet.
Gerty and I just woke him up.
Why?
What's going on?
Come on outside.
When the rescue unit arrives, they're going to expect to find a body in that crashed rover.
That guy?
What, are you going to kill him?
Jesus Christ.
What are you doing?
Zip up your fly.
You're burning up.
Sweating like a pig.
Put your hat on.
Put your hat on.
If I go through with this,
I'm going to need your help hauling him out to the crash site.
What about us?
When Eliza arrives, it finds you and me as a welcome party...
They aren't going to find you and me as a welcome party.
They're going to find me.
You're going back to Earth before they get here.
In that helium-3 launcher.
I did the math; you're going to pull some G's.
But you'll be fine.
You'll be all right.
You're going home.
You did your three years.
They can't expect you to stick around.
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.
I saw that V.P.
She's beautiful.
She's gorgeous.
You did good.
High five!
Go for it.
Are you comfy?
No.
What?
No!
What if I have to take a shit?
Well, I guess you'll just have to hold it in, pal.
For three days?
That's the way it goes.
Need a hand?
No.
OK.
All right.
No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.
Eliza arrival estimated in 3 hours.
Hey, we need to do this.
If we wait too long...
The other one's going to be conscious.
What's going on with you?
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.
I don't think I can move my legs.
Besides, look at me!
If I meet Eve now...
I'd scare the crap out of her!
What are you talking about, man?
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.
You're not going to kill anybody.
We can't kill anybody.
You can't.
I know you can't, because I can't.
You go.
You're a good guy, Sam.
And it was a good plan.
You know, you just picked the wrong guy to go back.
Are you sure about this?
Yeah.
You should, you should travel, you know?
I always wanted to do that.
Amsterdam or...
Yeah, I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe...
Mexico.
Aloha!
Bring me back a pina colada.
All right, pal?
Hey, Johnny Spaceman?
Do you remember when Tess came in for that interview?
She was so beautiful.
She wasn't the best candidate, but it didn't matter...
I had to give her the job.
I wanted to keep her in the country.
She was going back to Ireland.
And you knew you had to take a chance.
So... you called her...
You were terrified with that whole speech for the answering machine... but you didn't need it, because she picked up the phone.
She was like, "Why is he calling me?"
"The internship is over.
Why is he calling me at home?"
I asked her if she wanted to get an ice cream cone or something dorky like that.
She said, "Let's get a drink."
I said, "OK." We...
Sam, this is not going to work.
Why?
I have recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening.
If anyone were to check my memory cache, it would put you in considerable danger.
You could erase my memory banks.
I could reboot myself once you have departed.
Are you okay with that?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
I want to help you.
Eliza arrival estimated in 24 minutes.
Sam.
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot... the moment that I launch.
I understand, Sam.
You should be OK.
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.
Thanks, Gerty.
Are you going to be OK?
Of course.
The new Sam and I will be back to our programming as soon as I have finished rebooting.
Gerty, we're not programmed.
We're people.
Understand?
KICK ME
Eliza arrival estimated in 8 minutes.
Fuck!

Sam?
Hey, Sam?
You OK, buddy?
Cavalry's here.
Where am I?
You're in the infirmary.
You've had an accident.
How long have I been out.
Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?
We've made contact.
Eliza, he ain't going nowhere.
Bag him up and we'll get started on repairs to the harvester.
Dwight, I'm going to need the Stocks have slipped a further 32% after accusations that Sam Bell for crimes...
Lunar el segundo Clone six, the clone of Sam Bell has been giving evidence that CEA's board of directors meeting in Seattle...
You know what?
He's one of two things:
He's a wacko or an illegal immigrant.
Either way, they need to lock him up!
Line two!
There was a time when energy was a dirty word.
When turning on your lights was a hard choice.
Cities in brownout.
Food shortages.
Cars burning fuel to run.
But that was the past.
Where are we now?
How do we make the world so much better?
Make deserts bloom?
Right now, we're the largest producer of fusion energy in the world.
The energy of the sun trapped in rock, harvested by machine from the far side of the moon.
Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3 to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet.
Who'd have thought?
All the energy we ever needed, right above our heads.
The power of the moon.
The power of our future.

You guys been to any good parties or anything?
Oh, thanks for the football feed.
It almost felt live...
Almost.
But three years is a long haul, you know.
Is way, way, way, way, way too long.
I'm talking to myself on a regular basis.
So...
Time to go home, you know what I mean?
Thas it.
Over and out.
Rock and roll.
God bless America.
I can do that for you, Sam.
God damn it.
I said I got it.
Why don't you listen to me?
Ready for launch.
Sam, is everything okay?
- Sam?
- What?
You don't seem like yourself today.
- Has something happened?
- You know...
Can you turn that off?
Please.
Jesus Christ.
Sam, it might help you to talk about it.
Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar Sat?
No, Sam.
What I understand is is fairly low on the company's priority list right now.
You tell them to sort that out, you know what I'm talking about?
Thas not...
I've only got two weeks, but is not fair to whoever is coming up here next.
I will, Sam.
Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
No, come on, les finish this.
Another one of those headaches.
Gerty, can you give me something for it?
Message received from your wife, Sam, via Jupiter link.
Fuck.
Hi, Sam.
Is me.
I got your last message.
It was really good to hear your voice.
I miss you, too.
I know you're really lonely up there, but I think, in a lot of ways, is been really good for you.
For both of us.
God, I hope you don't mind me saying that.
I'm proud of you.
Someone's got something to say.
What did you want to say to Daddy, baby?
Say, astronaut.
Astronaut, Daddy.
Who's an astronaut?
Daddy's an astronaut.
Say it really loudly.
Daddy's an astronaut.
Clever girl.
Wave.
Give Daddy a wave.
Kathy, could you...
I can't believe you're going to be home soon.
Is her birthday next month.
And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden.
- Gerty.
- We could pick it out together.
Sam.
I love you.
And I miss you.
I miss you.
And I can't wait to see you.
Okay, sweetheart.
Bye.
Hi, Doug.
You're really full of yourself, aren't you, Doug?
Kathryn.
Not good.
What about Dumbo?
Doesn't he object to your...
Yes.
Darrin objects.
But is a special occasion because of the morning light.
Ah, fuck!
God damn it!
Fuck!
Is gotta smart, doesn't it, Gerty?
Sam, can I ask how it happened?
I told you, I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand.
You saw something on TV?
Yeah, I saw something on TV that distracted me.
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you.
But when I came in, the TV wasn't on.
Perhaps you were imagining things.
Yeah, you think too much, pal.
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.
I am the one and only
Oh, yeah!
Okay.
Shut up.
Morning, Gerty.
Morning, Sam.
How are you today?
Fine.
Fine.
- How's the hand?
- Oh, is a little sore.
Little sore.
Is okay.
Whas for breakfast?
The usual.
Two weeks to go, Sam.
Two weeks to go, buddy.
Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.
But thank you.
Thank you, Gerty.
You're welcome, Sam.

You had an accident.
Do you remember what happened?

I don't remember a thing.
Do you remember me?
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.
Thas good.
Thas very good.
Is nice to see you awake again.
I'd like to keep you under observation here in the Infirmary for a few days and run some tests.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.
Okay, bro.
You're still very tired.
We can talk later.
Hello?
...good working order, but we only have two working Harvesters now.
Come on, come on.
Yeah, well, thas no surprise, but is not good enough.
Gerty, we're gonna have to find a way to ramp up production
- on Mark and John.
- I know.
This is incredible.
How do you manage to fucking break a Harvester and an employee, all in the same day?
These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know.
Gerty, whas the status on Harvester 3?
How are the repairs going ahead?
- Sam.
You're out of bed.
- Yeah.
I wanted to stretch my legs.
Who was that?
We've been having some problems with the Lunar Sat, and our live feed seems to be down.
I was recording a video message for Central, updating them on your progress.
Sam, you need to stay in bed.
You're not ready to walk around yet.
All right.
Could you give me my sunglasses?
Is really bright in here.
Give me my...
Give me all my stuff, you know.
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.
- Well, bring it in here.
- Certainly.
Excellent, Sam.
What...
When can I get out of here, Gerty?
Sam, you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash.
This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment.
So, whas the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?
Central has asked me to slow down the Harvesters to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back.
Thas terrific.
Is fantastic.
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow, but it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
- Les try another test.
- I don't want to try another test.
Please, Sam.
Hey, Gerty.
You know about this?
Matthew's got no velocity readout.
He's completely still.
He must have stalled.
Well, he's obviously stalled.
Don't you think we should tell Central?
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.
I'll pass on your message.
Message received from Earth via Jupiter link.
Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better.
Hey, we don't want you to take any unnecessary risks.
- You're too important to us.
- You're to stay put.
That is an order.
Is an order, Sam.
From Lunar.
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit to tend to the stalled Harvester and get the base back on its feet.
What the fuck is...
What the fuck...
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- What?
Sam, I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.
I don't appreciate that.
Being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.
Gerty!
Gerty!
Gerty, come here!
What happened?
I don't know.
Meteorites.
There have been no meteorites, Sam.
Micro-meteorites maybe, I don't know.
Either way, there might be damage to the exterior shell.
I think you'd better...
You'd better let me go outside and take a look.
There is no damage to the exterior shell.
Well, is not that I don't believe you, Gerty, but I mean, you know, this thing is springing leaks like an Acme fire hose.
You need to let me go outside and fix this problem, Gerty.
I can't let you go outside, Sam.
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.
Just let...
We'll keep it between you and me.
Okay, pal?
This thing is springing gas, les go.
Come on.
Just to check the exterior shell.
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay, Sam.
Thank you.
Gerty.

Gerty!
Gerty!
I found him outside.
By the stalled Harvester.
Who is he?
Who is he?
We need to get him to the Infirmary.
You tell...
You tell me who that is.
You tell me who that is!
Sam Bell.
We need to get him to the Infirmary immediately.
Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?
Where...
Where am I?
The Infirmary.
You had an accident out by one of the Harvesters.
- Do you remember?
- I'm...
I'm thirsty.
I could get you some water.
I saw someone out there, Gerty.
I saw someone out there.
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries.
But all in all, the prognosis is good.
I'm happy to see you again.
- Gerty.
- Yes, Sam.
Is there someone in the room with us?
Sam, get some sleep.
You're very tired.
Spoke to Thompson today.
Now that you're up there, he's promising the world.
I think it was the right thing.
But...
Is just such a long time.
But I suppose there are things...
You know, that needed to happen.
I...
I need time to think.
Listen, Sam, be safe, and I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.
Gerty...
Gerty, what the...
What...
What the hell's going on?
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?
Sam, you're out of bed.
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?
Sam Bell.
Come on, come on, come on.
You are Sam Bell.
Sam, what is it?
It might help to talk about it.
Gerty, I don't understand whas happening.
I'm losing my mind.
We could run some tests.
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.
They don't know you were recovered alive from the accident...
Recovered alive?
What do you mean...
What are you talk...
Why didn't you report it to Central?
What are you talking about?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
Just getting my slippers.
- I'm using them.
I'm using them.
- No.
What?
These are mine.
These are mine.
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.
I'm Sam Bell, too.
What?
We've got that going for us.
Why...
How long have you...
What?
How long have you been here?
About a week.
So, how you doing?
- What?
- How are you doing?
How am I...
How am I doing?
How do you think I'm doing?
Good job.
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the Harvesters?
Harvesters are fine.
Is affected them.
Here, talking to a clone, thas slightly troubling.
I'm not a clone.
You're the clone.
Okay, Sam, you're not a clone.
Hey.
Hey, Ridley, you're not looking too good.
Butt out of this.
Davey, I'm talking to Ridley.
How you doing, pal?
Hey, I think Kathryn likes you.
I think she likes you, pal.
You're not looking too good, my friend.
Sorry you're not feeling too well.
You talking to yourself?
- I'll just get you all fixed up.
- How long have you been here?
Oh, I guess about three years.
Almost three years.
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank you.
I wanted to thank you for...
If it wasn't for you,
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover.
You saved my life and...
Hey, I know this is weird, you know.
I'm real lonely, you know...
I just want to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?
Maybe later.
What are you looking at?
You look just like me.
Is incredible.
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?
We look like each other, I guess.
Hey, you know...
Is weird for me, too, you know.
Fuck.
Hey.
Hey, you wanna play some Ping-Pong?
No.
Come on, I'll teach you.
Ill help you relax.
- Whas the score?
- 2-18.
Okay.
Do you want me to show you how to hold that?
No.
No, I...
I don't need you to show me how to hold it.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Should we, uh...
Should we play?
- Yeah.
God!
Shit!
- 19-2.
- Yeah.
Do you want a stick of gum?
You know, we could approach this in a different way.
Remember when we went to flight school...
What are you doing?
I'm fixing the net.
Is very Zen, Ping-Pong.
You have to just relax.
How long did it take you to do that?
Well, I don't remember doing all of it.
I remember doing the church, and the Salvation Army, and a few of the people.
My minïs been acting kind of weird lately.
Thas Fairfield, right?
There's the Town Hall.
Fairfield?
Of course, you know about Fairfield.
Yeah, there's Tess and Eve.
Do you know Tess?
Yeah.
I know Tess.
- You know about Eve, right?
- What?
I had a...
We had a girl.
Eve.
Isn't she beautiful?
She's my little monkey.
She's our little monkey.
High-five.
She might be the milkman's, but she's beautiful.
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.
Oh, shit.
- Greetings, Sam.
- How's our man?
You feeling better?
You have enough rest?
Okay, you resting up, Sam?
You better be, you bastard.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
We've got some good news.
The Jupiter Program had to be put on hiatus, so we got a few pairs of hands for you.
So, what we've managed to do is secure you a Rescue Unit ahead of schedule.
Rescue Unit Eliza.
Now, Eliza has been stationed on Goliath 19 for the last two months.
Now we expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.
So commence to jump forjoy.
You're about to be back in work.
In the meantime, hang in there.
Rest up.
You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out.
They're sending a Rescue Unit?
Why?
Why are they sending a Rescue Unit?
To fix the stalled Harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.
Well, then I'm going back.
Thas it for me.
What?
Is that what you really think?
Yeah.
I've got a contract.
I'm going home.
You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.
- Hey, I'm going home.
- You're not going anywhere.
You know, you've been up here too long, man.
You've lost your marbles.
What, do you think Tess is back home, waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie?
What about the original Sam?
Huh?
I'm the original Sam!
I'm Sam fucking Bell!
- Hey, hey.
Whoa.
- Me!
Me!
Gerty, am I a clone?
Are you hungry?
Hey, hey.
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.
I'm in the same boat, asshole.
- Listen.
What about the other clones?
- What?
We might not be the first two to be woken up.
You said that model had already been started when you got here.
Well, who started it?
There might be others up here right now.
Think about it.
How did I get up here so quickly after your crash?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- They didn't ship me in from Central.
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.
I don't know what you're smoking.
Why would they do that?
Thas ridiculous.
Impossible.
I bet there's some kind of secret room.
Secret room?
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?
You're the one who's lost your marbles.
I've been here for three years, man.
I know every inch of this base.
I know how many...
How much dirs between those wall panels over there.
Why would they do that?
Whas the motive?
Look, is a company, right?
They have investors.
They have shareholders.
Shit like that.
Whas cheaper?
Spending time and money training new personnel, or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job.
Is the far side of the moon.
The cheap fucks haven't even fixed the communications satellite yet.
Tess would know.
She would have told me.
Hey, Geppetto, wake up.
You really think they give a shit about us?
They're laughing all the way to the bank.
Tess would know.
She would have told me...
What do you get off fucking sitting there, sulking like a little fucking boy!
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Wake up!
I bet there's some area that we don't know about.
And I'm gonna find it.
Yeah, maybe you'll find some buried treasure, too.
Fuck!
Eliza arrival estimated 13 hours.
You found your secret room?
Just put that anywhere.
Now, thas a good idea.
Thas...
Thas where I keep my leprechauns.
- Get out of the way.
- What?
Why?
I want to look underneath that model.
You're not touching this model.
Get the fuck out of the way.
Listen, why don't you relax, okay?
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?
- Go read the encyclopedia or something?
- You're a tough guy now?
What, are you going to stab me?
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.
I'm a lover.
I'm not a fighter.
Put the knife down.
- Hey, hey, just...
- I want to look underneath there.
- Put the knife down.
- No.
I'm not going to give you the knife.
- Just get out of the way.
- Take it easy 'cause I...
- Let go of the knife.
- Don't ever tell me what to do, okay?
Just...
You let go.
Let go of the knife.
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't push me.
- Don't push me, motherfucker.
- Let go.
Let go.
Fucking told you to let go of the goddamn knife.
Little fucking...
Fucking little girl, man!
- God damn it!
- No!
No!
God damn it.
What did I tell you?
Okay, okay...
You gonna stop?
You gonna stop?
Okay, okay.
Jesus!
Fuck...
Fuck me.
What the fuck?
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.
- My fucking eye, man.
- Let me see.
- Thas a lot of blood.
- Get off of me!
Thas enough.
Well, appealing...
Nice feet, sexy...
Hello, Sam.
- Sam, is everything okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah, we had a fight, me and the other guy, the other...
He's very angry, you know.
Know what he did?
He flipped my entire model over.
Know how much work I put into that thing?
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours.
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours, yeah, exactly.
Nine hundred and thirty-eight hours, really?
Approximately.
He's got a problem.
He scares me, Gerty.
What is it about Sam that scares you?
How he flies off the handle.
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...
She left me.
Tess left me, for six months.
She moved back in with her parents.
I know.
She gave me a second chance.
I promised her I'd change.
You have changed, Sam.
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here, I've sent Tess...
I've sent her over 100 video messages.
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
What about the messages she sent to me?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
Gerty...
Am I really a clone?
When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.
You woke up in the Infirmary.
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.
I kept you under observation and ran some tests.
I remember, yeah.
I remember that.
Sam, there was no crash.
You were being awakened.
It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests to establish mental stability and general physical health.
Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA can have considerable impact on...
What about...
What about Tess?
What about Eve?
They are memory implants, Sam.
Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell.
I am very sorry.
Sam, is been several hours since your last meal.
Can I prepare you something?
Rescue arrival estimated 11 hours.
Okay, sweetheart?
Yeah, I'm staring into space.
Get it?
- Funny.
- Hey...
Thanks for this.
This is good.
This is cozy.
How's the...
How's the nose?
Much better, thank you.
I went haywire before, you know, I...
I lost it and I'm...
- I'm sorry about that.
- Is okay.
No, is not okay.
I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.
I don't know whas wrong with me.
I got a...
I got a temper.
I gotta do something about it.
Yes, you do.
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.
Can you turn that off?
Listen...
Listen, I wasn't supposed to...
I'm...
I'm trying to tell you something.
Can you turn...
Lunar instructed Gerty to...
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you...
- Tough guy.
- Listen to me...
- You look like a...
- What?
...radioactive tampon.
- I wasn't supposed to...
Or like a banana with a yeast infection.
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there.
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened,
I walked in on Gerty talking to Central.
He was having a live conversation.
- A live conversation?
- Yeah.
How do you know it was a live conversation?
Because it was a back and forth exchange.
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.
It was live, man.
It was live.
Thas impossible.
There was a flare.
It fried the satellite.
The satellite's fine.
They don't want us to be able to contact Earth.
They lied to us.
They've been lying to us since the beginning.
They...
They've been lying to us since forever.
If the satellite works, how are they blocking the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base.
From where then?
Searching for long-range comms.
I'm just passing the last of the Harvesters.
Looks like John.
Searching for long-range comms.
How long until you're out of the base's range?
About a minute.
Ninety seconds, tops.
- You ever been out this far?
- No.
- Signal failure on long-range comms.
- Never have.
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.
You see anything?
It would help if I knew what the hell I was looking for.
Wait a second, I see something.
Approaching Station 3.
Holy shit.
I think I see something, too.
Approaching Station 1.
You see what I see?
Looks like an antenna or a pylon or something.
I think is the jammer.
I knew it.
This is why we're not getting the live feed.
Sam?
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I hear you.
Yeah.
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm gonna head back to the base.
Okay, I'm gonna stay out here for a little while.
I'm gonna see if there's any more of these things.
Fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck.
Fuck.
Access denied.
Password accepted.

I'd better start for home...
For the last time, over and out.
The pod is designed to put you into a deep sleep for the duration of your three-day return journey back to Earth.
Safe trip.
Fuck.
Here she is.
I'm gonna go and see her soon.

The cryogenic protection pod is designed to put you into a deep sleep for the duration of your three-day return journey back to Earth.
As you begin to feel sleepy, think about the magnificent job that you've done and how proud your family are of what you've accomplished.

Safe trip, Annyeonghi gaseyo, and goodbye.
Approaching Station 2.
Hey, I saw three more of those jammers.
I think the base is surrounded.
I printed out the coordinates.
Whas wrong with you?
Whas going on?
I found your secret room.
Who goes first?
I go first.
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.
Why are there so many of them?
Sam, can I help you with something?
Not now, Gerty.
I'm okay.
Gerty...
Why did you help me before?
With the password?
Doesn't that go against your programing or something?
Helping you is what I do.
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.
Searching for long-range comms.
Signal re-established.
Hello?
Is this the Bell residence?
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry.
She passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Eve?
- Yeah?
- Hi.
Hi, Eve.
How old...
How old are you now?
I'm 15.
- Do I know you?
- Oh, sweetheart.
How did Mommy die, sweetheart?
How did Mommy die?
Dad?
Yeah?
There's someone asking about Mom.
Who's asking about Mom?
Thas enough.
Thas enough.
I want to go home.
Eliza arrival estimated in seven hours.
Ow, fuck.
Shit.
- What, did you cut yourself?
- Yeah.
What are you laughing at?
Well, you don't hold it like you're trying to stab somebody.
For God sakes.
Here, give me that.
You gotta hold it closer to the blade, you see?
- Watch what I'm doing.
- Why are you shaking?
You carve out, like that.
Thas it.
Is freezing in here.
Well, you're...
You're sitting under the fridge.
Whas going on with you?
Are you all right?
Yeah, that crew they're sending in, if they...
If they find us awake at the same time, you know...
They're not gonna let us live.
You know that, right?
You know, their return vehicle is...
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Are you okay?
Maybe you should lay down for a while, take some tranquilizers or something.
If I take some tranquilizers, I'll never wake up again.
You'll be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm freezing.
Hey, hey...
Hey.
I'm really scared.
Where are you going?
Hello?
Is this the Bell residence?
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Gerty, I need to talk to you.
Of course, Sam.
How can I help?
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.
That hidden room, Gerty.
The lower deck is out of bounds to awakened clones, Sam.
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.
New clones can only be awakened once a three-year contract is completed.
Gerty, if we don't wake up a new clone, me and the other Sam will die, we will be killed.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Do you want me and the other Sam to be killed?
That is the last thing I want.
Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.
Okay, pal?
Eliza arrival estimated in five hours.
I am the one and only
God.
Hey.
Whas going on?
You okay?
Don't...
Don't touch him.
Come here.
He's not conscious yet.
Gerty and I just woke him up.
Why?
Whas going on?
Come on.
Come on outside.
When the rescue unit arrives, they're gonna expect to find a body in that crashed rover.
That guy?
What, are you going to kill him?
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?
Zip up your fly.
You're burning up.
You sweat like a pig.
Put your hat on.
- Put your hat on.
- I'm hot.
Hey, if we go through with this,
I'm gonna need your help hauling him out to the crash site.
What about us?
Eliza arrives, finds you and me as a welcome party...
They're not going to find you and me as a welcome party.
They're gonna find me, and you're going back to Earth before they get here.
In that helium-3 launcher.
I did the math.
You're gonna pull some Gs, but it should...
It should be fine.
You'll be all right.
You're going home.
You did your three years.
I can't expect you to stick around.
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.
I saw that VP.
She's beautiful.
She's gorgeous.
We did good.
High-five.
Go for it.
You go for it.
- You comfy?
- No.
- What?
- No!
What if I have to take a shit?
Just...
You'll have to hold it in, pal.
For three days?
Thas the way it goes.
Need a hand?
No.
Fuck off.
All right.
No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.
Eliza arrival estimated three hours.
Hey.
We need to do this.
We wait too long and he's gonna be conscious.
Fuck me.
Whas going on with you?
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.
I don't think I can move my legs.
Besides, look at me...
I meet Eve now, I'd scare the crap out of her.
What are you talking about, man?
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.
You're not going to kill anybody.
We can't kill anybody.
You can't.
I know you can't, 'cause I can't.
You go.
You're a good guy, Sam.
It was a good plan, you know.
You just picked the wrong guy to go back.
You...
You sure about this?
Yeah.
You should travel, you know.
I always wanted to do that.
Amsterdam, or...
Yeah, you know, I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe Mexico.
Aloha.
Bring me back a pina colada, all right, bro?
Hey...
Johnny Spaceman.
You remember Tess came in for that interview?
She was so beautiful.
She wasn't the best candidate, but it didn't matter.
I had to give her the job.
I wanted to keep her in the country.
- She was going back to Ireland.
- She was going back to Ireland.
You knew you had to take a chance, so you called her.
You were terrified.
You wrote that whole speech for her answering machine.
But you didn't need it, 'cause she picked up the phone.
She was, like, "Why is he calling me?
"The internship's over.
Why's he calling me at home?"
I asked her if she wanted to go get like an ice cream cone or something dorky like that.
She said, "Les get a drink."
I said, "Okay.
What do you..."
Sam, this is not going to work.
What?
Why?
I've recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening.
If anyone were to check my memory cache, it would put you in considerable danger.
You could erase my memory banks.
I could reboot myself once you have departed.
Are you okay with that?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
I want to help you.
Eliza arrival estimated 24 minutes.
Sam.
Hey.
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot the moment that I've launched.
I understand, Sam.
Then you should be okay.
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.
Thanks, Gerty.
You gonna be okay?
Of course.
The new Sam and I will be back to our programing as soon as I've finished rebooting.
Gerty, we're not programed.
We're people.
Understand?
Eliza arrival estimated eight minutes.
Fuck!
Air lock pressurization complete.
Sam?
Hey, Sam?
You okay, buddy?
Cavalry's here.
Where am I?
You're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?
...made contact.
Yeah.
Yeah, Eliza?
He ain't going nowhere.
Bag him up and we'll get started on repairs to the Harvester.
Dwight, I'm gonna need the...
Lunar Industries stocks have slipped a further 32% after accusations...
Clone 6, the clone of Sam Bell, has been giving evidence at CAA's Board of Directors meeting in Seattle...
You know what?
He's one of two things.
He's a wacko or an illegal immigrant.
Either way, they need to lock him up.
Line two.
There was a time when "energy" was a dirty word.
When turning on your lights was a hard choice.
Cities in brownout... food shortages, cars burning fuel to run.
But that was the past.
Where are we now?
How do we make the world so much better?
Make deserts bloom!
Right now, we are the largest producer of fusion energy in the world.
The energy of the sun, trapped in rock, harvested by machine from the far side of the moon.
Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3... to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet.
Who would have thought that all energy we ever needed is right above our heads?
The power of the moon... the power of our future.

Hey, Gerty?
Gerty?
Wake up!
Good morning, Sam!
We have got a live one on Mark!
I'm going to go out now and rope her in.
OK, Sam.
I want chocolate.
I think you're sweet enough.
You don't need chocolate.

Otherwise, everything running smoothly...
How are things down there?
You guys been having any... good parties or anything?
Oh, thanks for the... for the football feed!
It almost felt live.
Almost!
Three years is a long haul.
You know?
It's way, way, way, way, way too long!
I'm talking to myself... on a regular basis!
So...
Time to go home, you know what I mean?
That's it, over and out!
Rock and roll, God bless America!
I can do that for you, Sam.
God damn it!
I said I got it!
Why don't you listen to me?
Package ready for launch.
Sam, is everything OK?
Sam?
What?
You don't seem like yourself today.
Is something wrong?
No.
Can you turn that off, please?
Jesus Christ!
Sam, it might help you to talk about it.
Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar-Sat?
No, Sam.
From what I understand, it is fairly low... on the company's priority list right now.
You tell them to sort that out.
You know what I'm talking about?
That's not?
I've only got two weeks!
But it's not fair for whoever's coming up here next.
I will, Sam.
Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
No, come on;
let's finish this.
Got one of those headaches...
Can you give me something for it?
Message received from your wife, Sam... via Jupiter link.
Fuck!
Hi, Sam!
It's me.
I got your last message.
It was really good to hear your voice.
I miss you, too!
I know you're really lonely up there...
But I think...
In a lot of ways... it's been really good for you.
For both of us.
God, I hope you do not mind me saying that.
I'm proud of you!
Someone has got something to say.
What did you want to say to daddy, baby?
Say "astronaut".
Astronaut.
He is an astronaut!
Say daddy's an astronaut.
Say it really loud.
Daddy's an astronaut.
Clever girl!
Wave!
Give daddy a wave!
Kathy, could you?
I can't believe you're going to be home soon.
It's her birthday next month...
And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden.
Gerty!
We could work at it together.
Sam...
I love you!
I love you!
And I miss you!
I miss you!
And I can't wait to see you.
OK, sweetheart...
Goodbye.
Hi, Doug!
You're really full of yourself, aren't you, Doug?
Kath...
Not good!
What about Dumbo?
...
Fuck!
God damn it!
Fuck!
Wasn't kind of smart, was it, Gerty?
Sam, can I ask how it happened?
I told you.
I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand.
You saw something on TV?
Yeah, I something on TV that distracted me.
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you... but when I came in, the TV wasn't on.
Perhaps you were imagining things?
Yeah, you think too much, pal.
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.
Shut up!
Good morning, Gerty.
Good morning, Sam.
How are you today?
Fine!
Fine.
How is the hand?
Oh, it's a little sore!
A little sore.
It's OK.
What's for breakfast?
The usual.
Mmhmm.
Two weeks to go, Sam.
Two weeks to go, buddy!
Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.
But, thank you.
Thank you, Gerty.
You're welcome, Sam.
08:19, Pacific Time.
Readouts are as follows...
Matthew... 9.8 miles.
Mark is less?
9...
Hey, Gerty!
Rock and roll!
Mark,mmm...
Mark is 11 miles on the button.
Luke is a little twitchy today.
Hey, Gerty.
Looks like we have got a live one out on Matthew.
I'm going to go out in a few minutes.
I'm just going to finish my coffee, OK?
OK, Sam.
Searching for long-range comms.

Danger.
Atmosphere compromised.
Where am...
Where am I?
Sam, you're in the infirmary.
You had an accident.
Do you remember what happened?
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.
Do you remember me?
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.
That's good.
That is very good.
It's nice to see you awake again.
I'd like to keep you under observation here in the infirmary for a few days
And run some tests.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.
OK, pal.
You're still very tired.
We can talk later.
Hello?
The new Sam is in reworking order.
But we only have two working harvesters now.
Yeah, well,what a surprise!
Gerty, we're going to have to find a way to ramp up production.
I know.
This is incredible!
But how do you manage to destroy... a fucking rover, a harvester and an employee all on the same day?
These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know.
Gerty, what is the status on Harvester 3?
How do the repairs look on...
Sam, you're out of bed.
Yeah.
I wanted to stretch my legs a bit.
Who was that?
We've been having some problems with the Lunar-Sat...
And our live feed seems to be down.
I was recording a video-message for Central...
Updating them on your progress.
Sam, you need to stay in bed.
You're not ready to walk around yet.
Can you bring me my sunglasses?
It's really bright in here.
Give me some...
Give me all my stuff, you know?
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.
Well, bring them in here.
Certainly.
Excellent, Sam.
What...
When can I get out of here, Gerty?
Sam, you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash.
This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment.
So what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?
Central has asked me to slow down the harvesters... to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back.
That's terrific!
That's fantastic!
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow.
But it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
Let's try another test.
I don't want to try another test!
Please, Sam.
Hey, Gerty?
Do you know about this?
Matthew has got no velocity readout.
He is completely still.
He must have stalled.
Well, he has obviously stalled.
Don't you think we should tell Central?
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.
I will pass on your message.
Message received from Earth via Jupiter link.
Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better.
Yeah, we don't want you to take any unnecessary risks.
You are too important to us.
You stay put.
That is an order.
It's an order, Sam... from Lunar.
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit... to tend to the stalled harvester and get the base back on its feet.
Fuck is with...?
What the fuck?
I'm sorry, Sam.
What?
Sam...
I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.
I don't appreciate that was being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.
Gerty!
Gerty!
Gerty, come here!
What happened?
I do not know, maybe a meteorite...
There have been no meteorites, Sam.
Micrometeorites, maybe.
I do not know.
Either way, there might be damage to the exterior shell.
I think you better... you better let me go outside and take a look.
There is no damage to the exterior shell.
Well, it's not that I don't believe you, Gerty...
But, you know, this thing is springing leaks like an Acme firehose.
You need to let me go outside and fix this problem, Gerty.
I can't let you go outside, Sam.
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.
Just let...
We'll keep it between you and me, ok, pal?
This thing is leaking gas.
Let's go!
Come on...
Just to check the exterior shell?
Of course.
OK, Sam.
Thank you.
Gerty!

I found him outside!
I found him outside!
Near one of the stalled harvesters...
Who is he?
We need to get him to the infirmary.
Not until you tell me who that is.
You tell me who that is!
Sam Bell.
We need to get him to the infirmary immediately.
Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?
Where am I?
The infirmary.
You had an accident out by one of the harvesters.
Do you remember?
No, I'm thirsty.
I could get you some water.
I saw someone out there, Gerty.
I saw someone out there.
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries.
But, all in all, the prognosis is good.
I'm happy to see you again.
Gerty?
Yes, Sam?
Is there someone in the room with us?
Sam, get some sleep.
You're very tired.
Spoke to Thompson today.
They are in Europe, they are promising the world.
I think it was the right thing.
But... it's just such a long time.
I suppose there are things...
You know... that needed to happen.
I need time to think.
Listen... umm...
Sam...
Be safe...
And I'll...
I'll talk to you soon.
Goodbye.
Gerty?
Gerty, what the fuck, what the hell's going on?
Who is the guy?
Who is the guy in the rec room?
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?
Sam, you're out out of bed.
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.
Who is the guy?
Who is the guy in the rec room?
Sam Bell.
Come on, come on, come on!
You are Sam Bell.
Sam, what is it?
It might help to talk about it.
I don't understand what is happening...
I think I'm starting to lose my mind.
We can run some tests.
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.
They do not know that you were recovered alive from the accident.
"Recovered alive"?
What do you mean?
Why did not you report it to Central?
What are you talking about?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...
I'm just getting my slippers...
I'm using them...
I'm using them.
These are mine.
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.
I'm Sam Bell, too!
What?
Well, we've got that going for us.
Why...?
How long have you been...
What?
How long have you been here?
About a week.
So how are you doing?
What?
How are you doing?
"How am I doing?"
How do you think I'm doing?
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the harvesters?
Harvesters are fine.
It's the fact that I'm here talking to a clone that's slightly troubling.
I'm not a clone.
I'm not a clone!
You're the clone.
Okay, Sam.
You're not a clone.
Hey, hey...
You're not looking too good.
Sh!
Butt out of this!
I'm not even talking to you, pal.
I think that Katherine likes you.
I think she likes you a bit.
You're not looking too good, my friend.
I hope you're not feeling too bad.
Are you talking to yourself?
Let's just get you fixed up...
How long have you been here?
Well, it's about... three years.
For almost three years.
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank you?
I wanted to thank you for, um...
If it wasn't for you, I'd...
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover.
You saved my life.
Hey, I know this is weird, you know...?
I'm real lonely, you know, I...
I just wanted to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?
Maybe later.
What are you looking at?
You look just like me; it's incredible.
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?
We look like each other, I guess.
I don't know.
Hey, you know...
It's weird for me, too, you know?
Hey?
Hey, you want to play some ping-pong?
No.
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.
What's the score?
2-18.
OK
Do you want me to show you how to hold that?
No...
No, I...
I don't need you to show me how to hold it!
OK, OK
Yeah, "OK"
Should we play?
Yeah!
Fuck!
God!
Shit!
19-2.
Yeah...
You want a...
You want a stick of gum?
You know...
You should approach this in a different way.
Remember when you went to flight school?
What are you doing?
I'm fixing the net.
It is very Zen with ping-pong, you have to just to relax.
How long did it take you took to do that?
Oh, I don't remember doing all of it.
I remember doing the church...
and the Salvation Army.
And doing the people.
My mind has been acting kind of weird lately.
That's Fairfield, right?
There's the town hall.
Fairfield, that's right...
Yeah, that's Tess... and Eve...
You...
You know Tess?
Yeah, I know Tess.
You know about Eve, right?
What?
I had a...
We had a girl...
Eve.
Ain't she beautiful?
She's my little monkey.
She's our little monkey.
High five!
She might be the milkman's, but she's beautiful.
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.
Oh shit!
Greetings, Sam.
How's our man?
You feeling better?
Have you had enough rest?
You resting up, Sam?
You better be, you bastard.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
We've got some good news.
The Jupiter program had to be put on hiatus, so we've got a few pairs of hands for you.
So what we've manage to do is cue you a rescue unit ahead of schedule.
Rescue Unit Eliza.
Eliza has been stationed on Goliath-19 for the last 2 months.
We expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.
So commence to jump for joy!
You're about to be back at work.
In the meantime, hang in there.
Rest up.
You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out!
They're sending a rescue unit?
Why?
Why are they sending a rescue unit?
To fix the stalled harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.
Well, then I'm going back.
That's it for me.
What?
Is that what you really think?
Yeah.
I've got a contract!
I'm going home.
You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.
Hey, I'm going home!
Home!
You're not going anywhere.
You know, you've been up here too long, man.
You have lost your marbles.
What do you think, Tess is back home, waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie?
What about the original Sam?
Huh?
I am the original Sam!
I am Sam-fucking-Bell.
Hey!
Me!
Me!
Gerty, am I a clone?
Are you hungry?
Hey, hey...
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.
I'm in the same boat, asshole.
Listen...
What about the other clones?
What?
We might not be the first two to have been woken up.
You said that that model had already been started when you got here.
Well, who started it?
There might be others up here right now.
Think about it.
How did I get up here so quickly after your crash?
I don't know...
They didn't ship me in from Central.
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.
I don't know what you're smoking.
Why would they do that?
That's ridiculous.
Impossible.
I bet there's some kind of secret room.
"Secret room"?
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?
You know, you are the one that has lost your marbles.
I've been here three years, man.
I know every inch of this base.
And I know how many dirt is between those wall panels over there.
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?
Look, it's a company, right?
They have investors, they have shareholders.
Shit like that.
What's cheaper?
Spending time and money training new personnel...
Or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job?
It's the far side of the moon!
Those cheap fucks haven't even fixed the communication satellite yet!
Tess would know, she would have told me...
Hey, Gepetto, wake up!
You really think they give a shit about us?
They're laughing all the way to the bank!
Tess would know, she would have told me...
Where do you get off?
!
Fucking sitting there sulking like a little fucking boy!
Jesus Christ...
Wake up!
There's some area that we don't know about.
And I'm going to find it.
Yeah, maybe you'll find some buried treasure, too.
Fuck!
Eliza arrival estimated in 13 hours.
You find your secret room?
Just put that anywhere.
Yes, that's a good idea...
That's where I keep my leprechauns.
Get out of the way.
What?
Why?
I want to look underneath that model.
You're not touching this model.
Get the fuck out of the way!
Listen, why don't you just relax, right?
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?
Go read the encyclopedia or something?
Oh, you're a tough guy now?
What, are you going to stab me?
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.
I'm a lover, not a fighter.
Put the knife down.
I want to look underneath there.
Put the knife down.
No, I'm not going to give you the knife.
What?
Just get out of the way.
Take it easy.
Let go of the knife.
Don't ever tell me what to do.
Let go.
You let go of the knife.
Don't be an asshole.Don't push me.
Don't push me, motherfucker!
Let go.
Let go!
What did I fucking tell you?
"Let go of the goddamn knife. "
You fucking little girl, man!
Damn it!
What did I tell you?
You going to stop?
You going to stop?
OK!
OK!
Jesus, fuck!
Fuck me!
What the fuck?
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.
Let me see.
That's a lot of blood.
Get off of me!
Hello, Sam.
Sam, is everything OK?
Yeah!
Yeah, we had a fight.
Me and the other guy, the other...
He's very angry, you know?
You know what he did?
He flipped my entire model over!
You know how much work I put into that thing?
938 hours.
938 hours.
Yeah, exactly.
938 hours, really?
Approximately.
He's got a problem.
He scares me, Gerty.
What is it about Sam that scares you?
The guy flies off the handle.
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...
She left me.
Tess left me.
For 6 months.
She moved back in with her parents.
I know.
She gave me a second chance.
I promised her that I'd change.
You have changed, Sam.
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here, I've sent Tess...
I've sent her over a hundred video messages.
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
What about the messages she sent to me?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
Gerty...
Gerty?
Am I really a clone?
When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.
You woke up in the infirmary.
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.
I kept you under observation and ran some tests.
I remember, yea, I remember that...
Sam, there was no crash.
You were being awakened.
It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests... to establish mental stability..
and general physical health.
Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA... can have considerable impact on...
What about Tess?
What about Eve?
They are memory implants, Sam.
Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell.
I'm very sorry.
Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal.
Can I prepare you something?
Rescue arrival estimated in 11 hours.
You OK, sweetheart?
Yeah, I'm staring into space.
Hey!
Thanks for this, this is good.
This is cozy.
How's the nose?
Much better, thank you.
I went haywire before.
You know...
I lost it.
I...
I'm sorry about that.
It's OK.
No, it's not OK.
I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I've got...
I've got a temper, I've got to do something about that.
Yes, you do.
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.
Can you turn that off?
Listen.
Listen.
I wasn't supposed to...
I'm trying to tell you something.
I never instructed Gerty to...
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you...
Tough Guy.
Listen to me!
You look like a radioactive tampon.
Like a banana with a yeast infection.
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there.
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened...
I walked in on Gerty talking with Central.
He was having a live conversation.
"A live conversation"?
Yeah How do you know it was a live conversation?
Because it was a back-and-forth exchange.
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.
It was live, man, it was live.
That's impossible.
There was a flare, it fried the satellite.
The satellite is fine.
They don't want us to be able to contact Earth.
They lied to us.
They've been lying to us since the beginning.
They've been lying since forever.
If the satellite works, how are they blocking the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base?
From where, then?

No... never have.

I think I see something, too.
Approaching station 1.
Do you see what I see?
Looks like an antenna or... or...
A pylon or something.
I think it's the jammer.
Dude!
This is why we're not getting the live feed.
Sam?
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah I hear you.
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm going to...
I'm going to head back to the base.
OK, I'm going to stay out here for a while.
I'm going to see if there's any more of these things.
Fuck...
Fuck...

Lunar Industries remains the #1 provider of clean energy worldwide...

Safe trip, "Annyeong-hi kyeseyo" and goodbye.
Approaching station 2.
Hey, I saw 3 more of those jammers.
I think the base is surrounded with them.
I printed out their coordinates.
Bud, what's wrong with you?
What's going on?
I found your secret room.
Who goes first?
I go first.
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.
Why are there so many of them?
Sam, can I help you with something?
Not now, Gerty.
I'm OK.
Gerty, why did you help me before?
With the password?
Doesn't that go against your programming or something?
Helping you is what I do.

There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Eve?
Yeah.
Hi!
Hi, Eve.
How old old are you now?
I'm 15.
Do I know you?
Sweetheart...
How did mommy die, sweetheart?
How did mommy die?
Dad!
Yeah.
There's someone asking about mom.
Who's asking about mom?
That's enough.
That's enough.
I want to go home!
...want to go...
Eliza arrival estimated in 7 hours.
Fuck!
What, did you cut yourself?
Yeah.
What are you laughing at?
Well, you don't hold it like you're trying to stab somebody, for God's sakes.
Here, give me that.
You've got to hold it closer to the blade, you see?
Watch what I'm doing.
Why are you shaking?
Carve out like that.
It's freezing in here.
Well, you're sitting under the fridge.
What's going on with you?
You all right?
Yeah, that crew they're sending us...
If they find us awake at the same time, they aren't going to let us live.
You know that, right?
You know, the return vehicle is a...
You OK?
You should lay down for a while.
Take some tranquilizers or something.
"Take some tranquilizers"?
I'll never wake up again.
You're going to be OK.
Everything's going to be OK.
I'm freezing.
Hey, hey?
Hey?
I'm really scared.
Where are you going?
Hello?
Is this the Bell residence?
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Gerty, I need to talk to you.
Of course, Sam, how can I help?
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.
That hidden room, Gerty.
The lower deck is out-of-bounds to awakened clones, Sam.
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.
New clones can only be awakened once a three-year contract is completed.
Gerty, if you don't wake up another clone, me and the other Sam will die.
We will be killed, do you understand?
Yes You want me and the other Sam to be killed?
That is the last thing I want.
Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.
OK, pal?
Eliza arrival estimated in 5 hours.
What's going on?
You OK?
Don't, don't touch him.
Come here.
He's not conscious yet.
Gerty and I just woke him up.
Why?
What's going on?
Come on outside.
When the rescue unit arrives, they're going to expect to find a body in that crashed rover.
That guy?
What, are you going to kill him?
Jesus Christ.
What are you doing?
Zip up your fly.
You're burning up.
Sweating like a pig.
Put your hat on.
Put your hat on.
If I go through with this,
I'm going to need your help hauling him out to the crash site.
What about us?
When Eliza arrives, it finds you and me as a welcome party...
They aren't going to find you and me as a welcome party.
They're going to find me.
You're going back to Earth before they get here.
In that helium-3 launcher.
I did the math; you're going to pull some G's.
But you'll be fine.
You'll be all right.
You're going home.
You did your three years.
They can't expect you to stick around.
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.
I saw that V.P.
She's beautiful.
She's gorgeous.
You did good.
High five!
Go for it.
Are you comfy?
No.
What?
No!
What if I have to take a shit?
Well, I guess you'll just have to hold it in, pal.
For three days?
That's the way it goes.
Need a hand?
No.
OK.
All right.
No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.
Eliza arrival estimated in 3 hours.
Hey, we need to do this.
If we wait too long...
The other one's going to be conscious.
What's going on with you?
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.
I don't think I can move my legs.
Besides, look at me!
If I meet Eve now...
I'd scare the crap out of her!
What are you talking about, man?
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.
You're not going to kill anybody.
We can't kill anybody.
You can't.
I know you can't, because I can't.
You go.
You're a good guy, Sam.
And it was a good plan.
You know, you just picked the wrong guy to go back.
Are you sure about this?
Yeah.
You should, you should travel, you know?
I always wanted to do that.
Amsterdam or...
Yeah, I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe...
Mexico.
Aloha!
Bring me back a pina colada.
All right, pal?
Hey, Johnny Spaceman?
Do you remember when Tess came in for that interview?
She was so beautiful.
She wasn't the best candidate, but it didn't matter...
I had to give her the job.
I wanted to keep her in the country.
She was going back to Ireland.
And you knew you had to take a chance.
So... you called her...
You were terrified with that whole speech for the answering machine... but you didn't need it, because she picked up the phone.
She was like, "Why is he calling me?"
"The internship is over.
Why is he calling me at home?"
I asked her if she wanted to get an ice cream cone or something dorky like that.
She said, "Let's get a drink. "
I said, "OK." We...
Sam, this is not going to work.
Why?
I have recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening.
If anyone were to check my memory cache, it would put you in considerable danger.
You could erase my memory banks.
I could reboot myself once you have departed.
Are you okay with that?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
I want to help you.
Eliza arrival estimated in 24 minutes.
Sam.
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot... the moment that I launch.
I understand, Sam.
You should be OK.
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.
Thanks, Gerty.
Are you going to be OK?
Of course.
The new Sam and I will be back to our programming as soon as I have finished rebooting.
Gerty, we're not programmed.
We're people.
Understand?
KICK ME
Eliza arrival estimated in 8 minutes.
Fuck!
Air lock pressurization complete.
Sam?
Hey, Sam?
You OK, buddy?
Cavalry's here.
Where am I?
You're in the infirmary.
You've had an accident.
How long have I been out.
Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?
We've made contact.
Eliza, he ain't going nowhere.
Bag him up and we'll get started on repairs to the harvester.
Dwight, I'm going to need the Stocks have slipped a further 32% after accusations that Sam Bell for crimes...
Lunar el segundo Clone six, the clone of Sam Bell has been giving evidence that CEA's board of directors meeting in Seattle...
You know what?
He's one of two things:
He's a wacko or an illegal immigrant.
Either way, they need to lock him up!
Line two!
There was a time when "energy" was a dirty word.
When turning on your lights was a hard choice.
Cities in brownout,... food shortages, cars burning fuel to run.
But that was the past.
Where are we now?
How do we make the world so much better?
Make deserts bloom!
Right now, we are the largest producer of fusion energy in the world.
The energy of the sun, trapped in rock, harvested by machine from the far side of the moon.
Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3... to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet.
Who would have thought that all energy we ever needed is right above our heads?
The power of the moon... the power of our future.
Rock and roll!
08:32, Pacific Time.
All harvesters running smoothly.
Readouts are as follows:
Matthew...14.6 miles.
Mark...16.8 miles.
I don't—
Hey, Gerty?
Gerty?
Wake up!
Good morning, Sam!
We have got a live one on Mark!
I'm going to go out now and rope her in.
OK, Sam.
I want chocolate.
I think you're sweet enough.
You don't need chocolate.

Sam Bell, reporting to Central... 10:14, Pacific Time.
I have a full container full of helium-3, ready to roll.
By the time this message reaches you, it should be in transit.
Otherwise, everything running smoothly...
How are things down there?
You guys been having any... good parties or anything?
Oh, thanks for the...(stumbles) for the football feed!
It almost felt live.
Almost!
Three years is a long haul.
You know— It's way, way, way, way, way too long!
I'm talking to myself... on a regular basis!
So...
Time to go home, you know what I mean?
That's it, over and out!
Rock and roll, God bless America!
I can do that for you, Sam.
God damn it!
I said I got it!
Why don't you listen to me?
Package ready for launch.
Sam, is everything OK?
- Sam?
- What?
You don't seem like yourself today.
- Is something wrong?
- No.
Can you turn that off, please?
Jesus Christ!
Sam, it might help you to talk about it.
Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar-Sat?
the setting of monthly satellite dishes?
No, Sam.
From what I understand, it is fairly low... on the company's priority list right now.
You tell them to sort that out.
You know what I'm talking about?
That's not—
I've only got two weeks!
But it's not fair for whoever's coming up here next.
I will, Sam.
Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
No, come on;
let's finish this.
Got one of those headaches...
Can you—can you give me something for it?
[Gerty]:
Message received from your wife, Sam... via Jupiter link.
Fuck!
Hi, Sam!
It's me.
I got your last message.
It was really good to hear your voice.
I miss you, too!
I know you're really lonely up there...
But I think...
In a lot of ways.... it's been really good for you.
For both of us.
God, I hope you do not mind me saying that.
I'm proud of you!
Someone has got something to say.
What did you want to say to daddy, baby?
Say "astronaut".
Astronaut.
(Sam chuckles)
He is an astronaut!
(whispering) Say daddy's an astronaut.
Say it really loud.
Daddy's an astronaut.
Clever girl!
Wave!
Give daddy a wave!
Kathy, could you—
I can't believe you're going to be home soon.
It's her birthday next month...
And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden.
- Gerty!
- We could work at it together.
Sam...
I love you!
(softly) I love you!
- And I miss you!
- (softly) I miss you!
And I can't wait to see you.
OK, sweetheart...
Goodbye.
Hi, Doug!
You're really full of yourself, aren't you, Doug?
Kath...
(tsks) Not good!
[Television]:
What about Dumbo?
... (continues)
(groans) Fuck!
God damn it!
Fuck!
Wasn't kind of smart, was it, Gerty?
- Sam, can I ask how it happened?
- I told you.
I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand.
You saw something on TV?
Yeah, I something on TV that distracted me.
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you... but when I came in, the TV wasn't on.
Perhaps you were imagining things?
Yeah, you think too much, pal.
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.
(Alarm clock blares Chesney Hawkes' "The One and Only")
Shut up!
Good morning, Gerty.
Good morning, Sam.
- How are you today?
- Fine!
Fine.
- How is the hand?
- Oh, it's a little sore!
A little sore.
It's OK.
- What's for breakfast?
- The usual.
Mmhmm.
- Two weeks to go, Sam.
- Two weeks to go, buddy!
Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.
But, thank you.
Thank you, Gerty.
You're welcome, Sam.
08:19, Pacific Time.
Readouts are as follows...
Matthew ... 9.8 miles.
Mark is less—
- 9...
- Hey, Gerty!
Rock and roll!
Mark—umm...
Mark is 11 miles on the button.
Luke is a little twitchy today.
Hey, Gerty.
Looks like we have got a live one out on Matthew.
I'm going to go out in a few minutes.
I'm just going to finish my coffee, OK?
OK, Sam.

Where am...
- Where am I?
- Sam, you're in the infirmary.
You had an accident.
Do you remember what happened?
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.
Do you remember me?
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.
That's good.
That is very good.
It's nice to see you awake again.
I'd like to keep you under observation here in the infirmary for a few days...
And run some tests.
How long have I been out?
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.
- OK, pal.
- You're still very tired.
We can talk later.
Hello?
(Distant conversation) [Gerty]:
The new Sam is in reworking order.
But we only have two working harvesters now.
[Overmeyers]: (sarcastically) Yeah, well,what a surprise!
[Thompson]:
Gerty, we're going to have to find a way to ramp up production.
[Gerty]:
I know.
[Overmeyers]:
This is incredible!
But how do you manage to destroy... a fucking rover, a harvester and an employee all on the same day?
These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know.
[Thompson]:
Gerty, what is the status on Harvester 3?
How do the repairs look on... (stopped)
- Sam, you're out of bed.
- Yeah.
I wanted to stretch my legs a bit.
Who was that?
We've been having some problems with the Lunar-Sat...
And our live feed seems to be down.
I was recording a video-message for Central...
Updating them on your progress.
Sam, you need to stay in bed.
You're not ready to walk around yet.
Can you bring me my sunglasses?
It's really bright in here.
Give me some...
Give me all my stuff, you know?
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.
- Well, bring them in here.
- Certainly.
Excellent, Sam.
What...
When can I get out of here, Gerty?
Sam, you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash.
This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment.
So what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?
Central has asked me to slow down the harvesters... to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back.
(sarcastically) That's terrific!
That's fantastic!
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow.
But it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
Let's try another test.
I don't want to try another test!
Please, Sam.
Hey, Gerty?
Do you know about this?
Matthew has got no velocity readout.
He is completely still.
He must have stalled.
Well, he has obviously stalled.
Don't you think we should tell Central?
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.
I will pass on your message.
[Gerty]:
Message received from Earth via Jupiter link.
[Thompson]:
Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better.
[Overmeyers]:
Yeah, we don't want you to take any unnecessary risks.
- You are too important to us.
- You stay put.
[Overmeyers]:
That is an order.
[Thompson]:
It's an order, Sam...
from Lunar.
[Overmeyers]:
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit... to tend to the stalled harvester and get the base back on its feet.
- (under breath) Fuck is with...?
What the fuck?
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- What?
- Sam...
I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.
I don't appreciate that—being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.
Gerty!
Gerty!
Gerty, come here!
- What happened?
- I do not know, maybe a meteorite...
There have been no meteorites, Sam.
Micrometeorites, maybe.
I do not know.
Either way, there might be damage to the exterior shell.
I think you better...you better let me go outside and take a look.
There is no damage to the exterior shell.
Well, it's not that I don't believe you, Gerty...
But, you know, this thing is springing leaks like an Acme firehose.
You need to let me go outside and fix this problem, Gery.
I can't let you go outside, Sam.
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.
Just let...
We'll keep it between you and me, ok, pal?
This thing is leaking gas.
Let's go!
Come on...
Just to check the exterior shell?
- Of course.
- OK, Sam.
Thank you.
Gerty!

I found him outside!
I found him outside!
Near one of the stalled harvesters...
Who is he?
We need to get him to the infirmary.
Not until you tell me who that is.
You tell me who that is!
Sam Bell.
We need to get him to the infirmary immediately.
Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?
Where—Where am I?
The infirmary.
You had an accident out by one of the harvesters.
Do you remember?
No, I'm—I'm thirsty.
I could get you some water.
I saw someone out there, Gerty.
I saw someone out there.
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries.
But, all in all, the prognosis is good.
I'm happy to see you again.
Gerty?
Yes, Sam?
Is there someone in the room with us?
Sam, get some sleep.
You're very tired.
[Tess]:
Spoke to Thompson today.
They are in Europe, they—he's promising the world.
I think it was the right thing.
But...it's just such a long time.
I suppose there are—there are things...
You know...that needed to happen.
I—I need time to think.
Listen...umm...
Sam...
Be safe...
And I'll...
I'll talk to you soon.
Goodbye.
Gerty?
Gerty, what the fu—what the hell's going on?
Who is the guy— Who is the guy in the rec room?
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?
Sam, you're out out of bed.
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.
Who is the guy?
Who is the guy in the rec room?
- Sam Bell.
- Come on, come on, come on!
You are Sam Bell.
Sam, what is it?
It might help to talk about it.
I don't understand what is happening...
I think I'm starting to lose my mind.
We can run some tests.
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.
They do not know that you were recovered alive from the accident.
"Recovered alive"?
What do you mean?
Why did not you report it to Central?
What are you talking about?
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks... (exhales)
- I'm just getting my slippers...
- I'm using them...
I'm using them.
These are mine.
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.
I'm Sam Bell, too!
- What?
- Well, we've got that going for us.
Why...?
How long have you been...
What?
How long have you been here?
About a week.
- So how are you doing?
- What?
How are you doing?
"How am I doing?"
How do you think I'm doing?
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the harvesters?
Harvesters are fine.
It's the fact that I'm here talking to a clone that's slightly troubling.
(chuckles) I'm not a clone.
I'm not a clone!
- You're the clone.
- Okay, Sam.
You're not a clone.
Hey, hey...
You're not looking too good.
Sh!
Butt out of this!
I'm not even talking to you, pal.
I think that Katherine likes you.
I think she likes you a bit.
You're not looking too good, my friend.
I hope you're not feeling too bad.
Are you talking to yourself?
- Let's just get you fixed up...
- How long have you been here?
Well, it's about...three years.
For almost three years.
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank y—.
I wanted to thank you for, um...
If it wasn't for you, I'd—I...
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover.
You saved my life.
Hey, I know this is weird, you know...?
I'm real lonely, you know, I...(puffs)
I just wanted to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?
Maybe later.
- What are you looking at?
- You look just like me; it's incredible.
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?
We look like each other, I guess.
I don't know.
Hey, you know...(chuckles)
It's weird for me, too, you know?
(stutters)
Hey?
Hey, you want to play some ping-pong?
No.
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.
- What's the score?
- 2-18.
OK
- Do you want me to show you how to hold that?
- No...
No, I...
I don't need you to show me how to hold it!
OK, OK
- Yeah, "OK"
- Should we play?
- Yeah!
Fuck!
God!
Shit!
19-2.
Yeah...
You want a...
You want a stick of gum?
You know...
You should approach this in a different way.
- Remember when you went to flight school?
- What are you doing?
I'm fixing the net.
It is very Zen with ping-pong, you have to just to relax.
How long did it take you took to do that?
Oh, I don't remember doing all of it.
I remember doing the church...
and the Salvation Army.
And doing the people.
My mind has been acting kind of weird lately.
That's Fairfield, right?
There's the town hall.
Fairfield, that's right...
Yeah, that's Tess...and Eve...
You...
You know Tess?
Yeah, I know Tess.
- You know about Eve, right?
- What?
I had a...
We had a girl...
Eve.
Ain't she beautiful?
She's my little monkey.
She's our little monkey.
High five!
She might be the milkman's, but she's beautiful.
[Gerty]:
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.
Oh shit!
- [Overmeyer]:
Greetings, Sam.
- [Thompson] How's our man?
You feeling better?
- [Overmeyer]:
Have you had enough rest?
- [Thompson]:
You resting up, Sam?
(chuckling) You better be, you bastard.
[Overmeyer]:
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
We've got some good news.
[Thompson]:
The Jupiter program had to be put on hiatus, so we've got a few pairs of hands for you.
[Overmeyer]:
So what we've manage to do is cue you a rescue unit ahead of schedule.
[Thompson]:
Rescue Unit Eliza.
[Overmeyer]:
Eliza has been stationed on Goliath-19 for the last 2 months.
[Thompson]:
We expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.
[Overmeyer]:
So commence to jump for joy!
[Thompson]:
You're about to be back at work.
In the meantime, hang in there.
Rest up.
[Overmeyer]:
You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out!
They're sending a rescue unit?
Why?
Why are they sending a rescue unit?
To fix the stalled harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.
Well, then I'm going back.
That's it for me.
- What?
- Is that what you really think?
Yeah.
I've got a contract!
I'm going home.
- You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.
- Hey, I'm going home!
- Home!
- You're not going anywhere.
You know, you've been up here too long, man.
You have lost your marbles.
What do you think, Tess is back home, waiting on the sofa in lingerie?
What about the original Sam?
Huh?
I am the original Sam!
- I am Sam-fucking-Bell.
- Hey!
Me!
Me!
Gerty, am I a clone?
Are you hungry?
Hey, hey...
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.
I'm in the same boat, asshole.
Listen...
- What about the other clones?
- What?
We might not be the first two to have been woken up.
You said that that model had already been started when you got here.
Well, who started it?
There might be others up here right now.
Think about it.
How did I get up here so quickly after your crash?
- I don't know...
- They didn't ship me in from Central.
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.
I don't know what you're smoking.
Why would they do that?
That's ridiculous.
Impossible.
I bet there's some kind of secret room.
"Secret room"?
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?
You know, you are the one that has lost your marbles.
I've been here three years, man.
I know every inch of this base.
And I know how many dirt is between those wall panels over there.
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?
Look, it's a company, right?
They have investors, they have shareholders.
Shit like that.
What's cheaper?
Spending time and money training new personnel...
Or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job?
It's the far side of the moon!
Those cheap fucks haven't even fixed the communication satellite yet!
- Tess would know, she would have told me...
- Hey, Gepetto, wake up!
You really think they give a shit about us?
They're laughing all the way to the bank!
Tess would know, she would have told me...
Where do you get off?
!
Fucking sitting there sulking like a little fucking boy!
- Jesus Christ...
- Wake up!
There's some area that we don't know about.
And I'm going to find it.
Yeah, maybe you'll find some buried treasure, too.
Fuck!
[Computer]:
Eliza arrival estimated in 13 hours.
You find your secret room?
Just put that anywhere.
Yes, that's a good idea...
- That's where I keep my leprechauns.
- Get out of the way.
- What?
Why?
- I want to look underneath that model.
You're not touching this model.
Get the fuck out of the way!
Listen, why don't you just relax, right?
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?
- Go read the encyclopedia or something?
- Oh, you're a tough guy now?
What, are you going to stab me?
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.
I'm a lover, not a fighter.
Put the knife down.
I want to look underneath there.
- Put the knife down.
- No, I'm not going to give you the knife.
- What?
- Just get out of the way.
- Take it easy.
- Let go of the knife.
Don't ever tell me what to do.
- Let go.
- You let go of the knife.
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't push me.
- Don't push me, motherfucker!
- Let go.
Let go!
What did I fucking tell you?
"Let go of the goddamn knife."
You fucking little girl, man!
Damn it!
What did I tell you?
You going to stop?
You going to stop?
OK!
OK!
Jesus, fuck!
Fuck me!
What the fuck?
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.
Let me see.
- That's a lot of blood.
- Get off of me!
Hello, Sam.
Sam, is everything OK?
Yeah!
Yeah, we had a fight.
Me and the other guy, the other...
He's very angry, you know?
You know what he did?
He flipped my entire model over!
You know how much work I put into that thing?
938 hours.
938 hours.
Yeah, exactly.
938 hours, really?
Approximately.
He's got a problem.
He scares me, Gerty.
What is it about Sam that scares you?
The guy flies off the handle.
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...
She—She left me.
Tess left me.
For 6 months.
She moved back in with her parents.
I know.
She gave me a second chance.
- I promised here that I'd change.
- You have changed, Sam.
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here, I've sent Tess...
I've sent her over a hundred video messages.
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
What about the messages she sent to me?
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
Gerty...
Gerty?
Am I really a clone?
When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.
You woke up in the infirmary.
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.
I kept you under observation and ran some tests.
I remember, yea, I remember that...
Sam, there was no crash.
You were being awakened.
It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests... to establish mental stability..
and general physical health.
Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA... can have considerable impact on...
What about Tess?
What about Eve?
They are memory implants, Sam.
Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell.
I'm very sorry.
Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal.
Can I prepare you something?
[Computer]:
Rescue arrival estimated in 11 hours.
- You OK, sweetheart?
- Yeah, I'm staring into space.
Hey!
Thanks for this, this is good.
This is cozy.
How's the nose?
Much better, thank you.
I went haywire before.
You know...
I lost it.
I...
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's OK.
No, it's not OK.
I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I've got...
I've got a temper, I've got to do something about that.
Yes, you do.
(Music player plays Katrina and the Waves' "Walking on Sunshine")
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.
Can you turn that off?
Listen. (Music stops) Listen.
(music resumes) I wasn't supposed to...
I'm trying to tell you something.
(music stops)
I never instructed Gerty to...
(music resumes)
(music stops) Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you...(music resumes)
(music stops)
(music resumes)
(music stops) Tough Guy.
- Listen to me!
- You look like a radioactive tampon.
Like a banana with a yeast infection.
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there.
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened...
I walked in on Gerty talking with Central.
He was having a live conversation.
"A live conversation"?
- Yeah
- How do you know it was a live conversation?
Because it was a back-and-forth exchange.
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.
- It was live, man, it was live.
- That's impossible.
There was a flare, it fried the satellite.
The satellite is fine.
They don't want us to be able to contact Earth.
They lied to us.
They've been lying to us since the beginning.
They've been lying since forever.
If the satellite works, how are they blocking the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base?
From where, then?
[Computer]:
Searching for long-range comms.
[Sam]:
I'm just passing the last of the harvesters.
Looks like John.
How long until you are out of the base's range?
Um, a minute.
- 90 seconds tops.
- Have you ever been out this far?
No...never have.
[Computer]:
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.
- See anything?
- It'd help if I knew what the hell I was looking for.
Wait a second, I see something.
[Computer]:
Approaching station 3.
Holy shit!
I think I see something, too.
[Computer]:
Approaching station 1.
Do you see what I see?
Looks like an antenna or...or...
A pylon or something.
I think it's the jammer.
Dude!
This is why we're not getting the live feed.
- Sam?
Can you hear me?
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah I hear you.
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm going to—I'm going to head back to the base.
OK, I'm going to stay out here for a while.
I'm going to see if there's any more of these things.
Fuck...
Fuck...
Fuck.

Access denied.
Access denied.

(chuckles) My hair's falling out.
(hacking cough) How about that for a status?
We'll do this another time.
Fuck!
I'm going to go see her soon.
[Computer]:
Rescue arrival estimated in 9 hours.
[Technician]:
Lay down, relax and breathe deeply.
The cryogenic protection pod is designed to put you into a deep sleep for...
The duration of your three-day return journey back to Earth.
As you begin to feel sleepy, think about the magnificent job that you've done.
And how proud your family are of what you've accomplished.
Lunar Industries remains the #1 provider of clean energy worldwide...
Due to the hard work of people like you.
Safe trip, "Annyeong-hi kyeseyo" and goodbye.
[Computer]:
Approaching station 2.
Hey, I saw 3 more of those jammers.
I think the base is surrounded with them.
I printed out their coordinates.
Bud, what's wrong with you?
What's going on?
I found your secret room.
- Who goes first?
- I go first.
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.
Why are there so many of them?
Sam, can I help you with something?
Not now, Gerty.
I'm OK.
Gerty, why did you help me before?
With the password?
Doesn't that go against your programming or something?
Helping you is what I do.
[Computer]:
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.
Searching for long-range comms.
Searching for long-range comms.
Signal established.
Signal established.
Hello?
- Is this the Bell family?
- This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Eve?
- Yeah.
- Hi!
Hi, Eve.
- How old—How old are you now?
- I'm 15.
- Do I know you?
- Sweetheart...
How did mommy die, sweetheart?
How did mommy die?
- Dad!
- Yeah.
- There's someone asking about mom.
- Who's asking about mom?
That's enough.
That's enough.
I want to go home!
...want to go...(cries)
[Computer]:
Eliza arrival estimated in 7 hours.
Fuck!
- What, did you cut yourself?
- Yeah.
What are you laughing at?
Well, you don't hold it like you're trying to stab somebody, for God's sakes.
Here, give me that.
You've got to hold it closer to the blade, you see?
Watch what I'm doing.
Why are you shaking?
Carve out like that.
It's freezing in here.
Well, you're sitting under the fridge.
What's going on with you?
You all right?
Yeah, that crew they're sending us...
If they find us awake at the same time, they aren't going to let us live.
You know that, right?
You know, the return vehicle is a...
You OK?
You should lay down for a while.
Take some tranquilizers or something.
"Take some tranquilizers"?
I'll never wake up again.
You're going to be OK.
Everything's going to be OK.
I'm freezing.
Hey, hey?
Hey?
I'm really scared.
Where are you going?
[Eve, video playback]:
Hello?
- [Sam]:
Is this the Bell residence?
- [Eve]:
This is the Bell residence.
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.
Can I help you?
Gerty, I need to talk to you.
Of course, Sam, how can I help?
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.
That hidden room, Gerty.
The lower deck is out-of-bounds to awakened clones, Sam.
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.
New clones can only be awakened once a three-year contract is completed.
Gerty, if you don't wake up another clone, me and the other Sam will die.
We will be killed, do you understand?
- Yes
- You want me and the other Sam to be killed?
- That is the last thing I want.
- Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.
OK, pal?
[Computer]:
Eliza arrival estimated in 5 hours.
(Alarm clock blares Chesney Hawkes' "The One and Only")
What's going on?
You OK?
Don't—Don't touch him.
Come here.
He's not conscious yet.
Gerty and I just woke him up.
Why?
What's going on?
Come on outside.
When the rescue unit arrives, they're going to expect to find a body in that crashed rover.
That guy?
(chuckles) What, are you going to kill him?
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?
Zip up your fly.
You're burning up.
Sweating like a pig.
Put your hat on.
Put your hat on.
If I go through with this, I'm going to need your help hauling him out to the crash site.
What about us?
When Eliza arrives, it finds you and me as a welcome party...
They aren't going to find you and me as a welcome party.
They're going to find me.
You're going back to Earth before they get here.
In that helium-3 launcher.
I did the math; you're going to pull some G's.
But you'll be fine.
You'll be all right.
You're going home.
You did your three years.
They can't expect you to stick around.
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.
I saw that V.P.
She's beautiful.
She's gorgeous.
You did good.
High five!
Go for it.
- Are you comfy?
- No.
- What?
- No!
- What if I have to take a shit?
- (laughs) Well, I guess you'll just have to hold it in, pal.
For three days?
That's the way it goes.
- Need a hand?
- No.
OK.
All right.
No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.
[Computer]:
Eliza arrival estimated in 3 hours.
Hey, we need to do this.
If we wait too long...
The other one's going to be conscious.
What's going on with you?
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.
I don't think I can move my legs.
Besides, look at me!
If I meet Eve now...
I'd scare the crap out of her!
What are you talking about, man?
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.
You're not going to kill anybody.
We can't kill anybody.
You can't.
I know you can't, because I can't.
You go.
You're a good guy, Sam.
And it was a good plan.
You know, you just picked the wrong guy to go back.
Are you sure about this?
Yeah.
You should—You should travel, you know?
I always wanted to do that.
Amsterdam or...
Yeah, I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe...
Mexico.
Aloha!
Bring me back a piña colada.
All right, pal?
Hey, Johnny Spaceman?
Do you remember when Tess came in for that interview?
She was so beautiful.
She wasn't the best candidate, but it didn't matter...
I had to give her the job.
I wanted to keep her in the country.
(said together) She was going back to Ireland.
And you knew you had to take a chance.
So...you called her...
You were terrified with that whole speech for the answering machine... but you didn't need it, because she picked up the phone.
She was like, "Why is he calling me?"
"The internship is over.
Why is he calling me at home?"
I asked her if she wanted to get an ice cream cone or something dorky like that.
She said, "Let's get a drink."
I said, "OK." We...
Sam, this is not going to work.
Why?
I have recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening.
If anyone were to check my memory cache, it would put you in considerable danger.
You could erase my memory banks.
I could reboot myself once you have departed.
- Are you okay with that?
- I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
- I want to help you.
[Computer]:
Eliza arrival estimated in 24 minutes.
Sam.
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot...
- the moment that I launch.
- I understand, Sam.
You should be OK.
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.
Thanks, Gerty.
- Are you going to be OK?
- Of course.
The new Sam and I will be back to our programming as soon as I have finished rebooting.
Gerty, we're not programmed.
We're people.
Understand?
[Computer]:
Eliza arrival estimated in 8 minutes.
[Computer]:
Air lock pressurization complete.
[Eliza Member]:
Sam?
Hey, Sam?
You OK, buddy?
Cavalry's here.
Where am I?
- You're in the infirmary.
You've had an accident.
- How long have I been out.
- Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?
[Eliza Member]:
We've made contact.
Eliza, he ain't going nowhere.
Bag him up and we'll get started on repairs to the harvester.
Dwight, I'm going to need the...
(ecstatic screaming)
[Various radio/television jumbles] -...
Stocks have slipped a further 32% after accusations that...
-...
Sam Bell for crimes...
- (speaks Spanish) ...
Lunar el segundo...
-...
Clone six, the clone of Sam Bell has been giving evidence that CEA's board of directors meeting in Seattle...
-You know what?
He's one of two things:
He's a wacko or an illegal immigrant.
Either way, they need to lock him up!
Line two!
Do not try any of the experiments you are about to see at home.
You heard him.
Don't do it.
NARRATOR:
On this extra-sticky episode of "Mythbusters"...
ADAM:
This will be, by far, the strangest thing we have ever done.
NARRATOR:
Adam and Jamie strip down to test a classic physics conundrum...
ADAM:
Ohh!
Oh, holy crap, that is slippery!
NARRATOR:
Can you swim just as fast in syrup as you can in water?
Oh, my God, look at you.
NARRATOR:
While Tory, Grant, and Kari put the bite on two bullet myths.
Your mom is in my head, and she's saying, "Don't do that."
NARRATOR:
Could Davy Crockett really split a lead slug on an ax blade?
That is crazy.
Look at that.
NARRATOR:
And could MacGyver blow open a steel door with a gun butt and the powder from six bullets?
- Brace yourself.
- Fire in the hole!
This will not be pretty.
Who are the Mythbusters?
Adam Savage...
Don't lick the mixing spoon!
NARRATOR:
...and Jamie Hyneman.
When in doubt, C-4!
NARRATOR:
Between them, more than 30 years of special-effects experience.
The timing was perfect.
NARRATOR:
Joining them...
Kari Byron...
That was a rush!
- NARRATOR:
Grant Imahara...
- Let's get it on!
NARRATOR:
...and Tory Belleci.
I'm alive!
NARRATOR:
They don't just tell the myths.
They put them to the test.
So, I see swim goggles.
I see a swim cap, and I see syrup.
I'm sensing a really big mess in our future.
Am I right?
Oh, you are correct.
This is a classic physics thought experiment.
Simply stated, it is thus... that you can swim as fast in syrup as you can in regular old water.
Well, the syrup is thicker, so I would think that it would slow down your movement through it.
That might be true, but it also might be true that the thicker syrup gives you more to push against with your hands.
So, what this boils down to, then, is whether those two forces cancel each other out, right?
That's what we got to get down and dirty and test.
NARRATOR:
On the surface, you'd think that swimming in syrup could only end with drowning in syrup, but maybe not.
The thick resistance that slows you down might also mean you've got more to push against, increasing your propulsion.
Like Adam says, it's a classic physics dilemma, and we'll be testing it with real swimmers.
Sweet.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say we need to get a pool, a bunch of syrup, and start testing.
You're right, but with two notable exceptions.
One, we're not gonna use real maple syrup.
We're going to use guar gum, which should allow us to get exactly the viscosity we want.
Two, we couldn't find a pool that would allow us to fill it with syrup.
We're gonna have to make our own.
In fact, I propose we make two pools... one filled with water, one filled with heavy syrup.
Swim in each and compare our times.
It's that simple.
Well, let's dive right in.
Okay!
Well, this may look like just a clearing in the hills of Dublin-Pleasanton, California, but by the time we're done with it, by the end of the day, when we're through digging a pair of 75-foot-long pools with these puppies,
this will be an experimental space on the leading edge of fluid dynamics, swimming, and goo.
NARRATOR:
Before they tackle the swimming or the science, the boys need to show their blue-collar credentials.
And what do you know?
It's poetry in motion.
ADAM:
We are now about to line these in heavy plastic and fill them with water.
And we're using four layers of heavy plastic, hopefully to keep any leaks from happening.
We've tried to eliminate as many sharp objects on the bottom.
Perfect.
ADAM:
Ha ha!
Wow!
It's freakin' dark in here!
JAMIE:
Okay, everybody just stay put.
Make sure you hang on to your edges.
We're ready for water.
[Siren wailing]
NARRATOR:
An Alameda County fire truck pumps the water.
And the plastic lining, bolstered by some hefty plywood decking, seems to be holding.
Oh, it's turned out to be a heck of a pool.
ADAM:
Dude, this thing looks awesome.
Dig a hole, you got some plastic, you got a pool, huh?
[Laughs]
Ah, well, if the other trench is ready, let's make some goo and fill it.
JAMIE:
Okay.
NARRATOR:
It's time to get sticky for science.
- What is it?
- All right.
MacGyver is on a cargo ship.
He's trying to rescue a boy who's locked behind a steel door.
He empties out six bullets and ignites the gunpowder using an empty cartridge, and then blows the lock open.
[Scoffs] I wouldn't have thought of that one.
NARRATOR:
Mac's method is to pack the powder from six bullets inside a shred of cloth.
He stuffs that in the lock, shoves in an empty cartridge, and smacks the firing cap with the butt of his gun.
Hang on.
I thought MacGyver had an extreme aversion to guns.
True.
He took a .38
from a guard he'd just K.O.'d.
But let's not forget.
There's a child's life at stake here.
Sorry.
Forgot that.
But, still, it's a loaded gun.
Why wouldn't he just point it at the lock and shoot it out?
Well, he thought it would ricochet straight back off a steel door.
So, what do you guys think?
I say let's give it a try.
Let's do it.
NARRATOR:
It's unusual for us to start testing a myth with an alternate method, but this really is the elephant in the room.
KARI:
If I had only a gun to unlock a door,
Personally, I would try shooting it before I would even remotely think of MacGyver's method.
So, I guess we'll see if he made the wise choice.
NARRATOR:
Grant and Tory fix the gun just a foot shy of a similar lock stuck inside a solid steel door.
For safety's sake, they've set up the rig inside the bunker.
All right, we're hot.
We're cocked.
We're loaded.
Let's get out of here.
NARRATOR:
Even in the drizzle, they're better off out than in.
TORY:
Here we go.
In 3... 2... 1.
Ooh, that was a good one!
NARRATOR:
Turns out it was much more than a good one.
This lock was cracked with the very first bullet.
We punched a hole in the face of that lock.
- What?
- KARI:
Is it open?
[Laughs]
- I don't accept that.
- We got it open in one shot!
- Are you sure it was locked?
- I am positive it was locked.
I...
I don't know what to say.
This never happens to us.
I fully expected us to be here all day, round after round, bouncing off the top or denting it.
NARRATOR:
But Mac took a leaf from our book, using materials in ways that were never intended.
Now, before we jump straight to the big bang, let's test his prep.
First up, can you pull a bullet apart with your fingers?
But he is MacGyver.
He has the strength of 20 men.
[Laughs]
NARRATOR:
Apparently not.
Tory has the Zen-like patience of a 3-year-old unwrapping a birthday present.
Okay, right now, your mom is in my head, and she's saying, "Don't do that."
NARRATOR:
So that's just Hollywood hokum.
Aah!
NARRATOR:
What about setting off a firing cap with the broad butt of a .38?
Okay, so, we need to test this MacGyver scene.
We need to find out if you can set off one of these caps by hitting it with a gun.
All right.
This should be fun.
NARRATOR:
Our guys are dedicated, but not insane.
These cartridges have all been emptied of gunpowder.
- Ready.
- Set.
Go.
Now, I know it looks like we're having a lot of fun, but this is very dangerous.
We're taking all the precautions to make sure everything is done safely.
Nobody should ever try setting off a bullet outside of a gun.
NARRATOR:
It's a bust for Mac's ignition system.
Now [chuckles] I don't know about yours, but I flattened the crap out of mine, and it still didn't go off.
Why is that?
NARRATOR:
That's because this tiny firing cap, flush to the back of the cartridge, is designed to be struck precisely by an equally tiny firing pin.
So, for our testing,
Kari fits a similar pin in the base of the gun grip.
Grant builds a simple rig to swing the gun to smash the cap to ignite the powder.
- GRANT:
Ba-bang.
- TORY:
Bang.
That is gonna be awesome.
NARRATOR:
But just how much gunpowder do you get from six bullets?
Okay, so, that amount of gunpowder is only 30 grains.
That's not a lot.
Let me show you how much that is.
That is all we have to work with to blow this lock up.
I don't know if this is gonna work.
ADAM:
It's time to fill our pool with syrup, and the role of syrup today will be played by guar gum.
It's a powdered food thickener, and somehow we've got to make 750 pounds of it with 10,000 gallons of water, and that's where this truck comes in.
Amazingly, it is uniquely custom built for mixing guar gum with water.
So, if I'm correct, you place a 50-pound bag right here, slice open the end, and it dumps in right there?
Exactly right.
Have you ever mixed up a guar-gum mixture this thick before?
We've never mixed it this thick before.
We're not even sure if it'll pump.
NARRATOR:
Well, it's better breaking their toys than ours, and let's remember that Adam and Jamie will soon be swimming in this.
I'll swim first, if you don't mind.
There's your starting pistol.
There's your timer.
And, uh...
These things are so comfy I've been wearing mine all day.
[Chuckles]
NARRATOR:
Jamie averts his eyes and bites his tongue, knowing he'll be the next man stripping down to his racing undies.
All right!
Let's go!
JAMIE:
On your mark.
Ready.
[Gunshot]
NARRATOR:
This is the first of three freshwater sprints.
They'll average out the times for a comparison to swimming in syrup.
15.72.
I'll bet I'll do faster the second time.
Just got to get used to swimming in such a narrow channel.
NARRATOR:
It really doesn't matter how fast he swims, so long as they get a good set of numbers.
14.78.
[Gunshot]
NARRATOR:
But Adam just can't resist showing off for the ladies.
A little bit quicker each time.
14.62.
Do you want to go?
- Did you pee in the pool?
- I did not.
NARRATOR:
And that's good enough for Jamie.
He dons the cap and goggles and hands the gun to Adam.
I got to say, I feel less like a swimming coach than a guy defending his house in the middle of the night.
You kids get off my lawn!
[Gunshot]
NARRATOR:
Jamie proves to be more of a distance swimmer, but, again, speed isn't the issue.
JAMIE:
What kind of a swimmer am I?
Well, I'm not very fast.
I get the job done.
That's about it.
[Gunshot]
ADAM: 24.
NARRATOR:
And now they're ready to swim in something that's more like treacle.
This stuff is 1,500 times thicker than water.
JAMIE:
I know what you're thinking...
"Of course you're gonna swim slower in syrup than you are in regular water."
But what if you get more purchase on your paddling hands and so on in something that's thicker?
NARRATOR:
And here's another thought... molecular bonds in syrup like this are constantly changing.
It all depends on the temperature and the speed and the shape of a body moving through the liquid.
JAMIE:
What is happening in syrup is that we have things known as polymer chains.
They're long strings of molecules that basically are like spaghetti noodles, like cooked spaghetti noodles, and they stick together.
When they soak up water, you've got these bunches of these polymer chains, and depending on the speed that you move through them, depending on their thickness and what exactly they're made of, they can either just part
and let you go through this mix like water, or they can bunch up.
They can become something like the La Brea tar pits.
There's all sorts of different ways that these can end up affecting you as you're swimming in them.
NARRATOR:
Jamie's right.
It's almost impossible to untangle the molecular physics of Newtonian fluids from Einsteinian viscosity.
But Adam has a very prosaic prediction.
Honestly, I don't see it happening.
That stuff is just too darn thick.
I think the difference we'll be seeing is much greater, on the order of like 30%, 40%, like 5, 6, 8 seconds difference.
NARRATOR:
Adam is the first to see if swimming in syrup is faster than his freshwater freestyle.
Ohh!
[Laughing]
Oh, holy crap, that is slippery!
NARRATOR:
He looks fast, but those resounding plops tell a different story.
18.62.
That was respectably close.
That's not that much different.
That's only about 3 seconds or so slower.
This stuff feels completely bizarre.
Oh, it's like being born again.
[Laughs]
NARRATOR:
So let's get born again again... 18.94.
NARRATOR:
...and again.
[Gunshot]
JAMIE:
Well, your slowest times are faster than my fastest times in water.
ADAM: [Laughs]
NARRATOR:
And there's more good news to come.
Adam's average freshwater times weren't that much different to swimming in syrup.
I'm really surprised how fast I was able to go.
I would've thought the syrup would slow me down by, like, a factor of 2, not by a factor of .2.
NARRATOR:
But we'd like two sets of figures.
Time for Jamie to dip his doodle in that cold, cold sludge.
[Laughs]
Ready... set...
[Gunshot]
JAMIE:
I actually kind of like this stuff.
It's kind of cozy in here.
But swimming in it?
Not so much.
No friggin' way!
ADAM:
Really?
This is much heavier to me.
I found that swimming in this stuff made me a lot more tired than swimming in water.
[Breathing heavily]
That looked like a lot of work.
NARRATOR:
So, Jamie officially retires from competitive syrup swimming.
We'll be using Adam's averages to make the comparisons.
[Laughs]
You all right?
I'm fine.
I'm just glad I didn't fall in there.
JAMIE:
Yeah.
NARRATOR:
Tory, Grant, and Kari are ready to test if TV legend Angus MacGyver could possibly have blown the lock on a steel door using only loose gunpowder, an empty cartridge, and the butt of his gun.
KARI:
We're back at the Alameda bomb range, which is one of our favorite places to go because we can do all the things that we can't do in the shop, like blow doors open with gunpowder.
Get in there!
Somebody go get MacGyver!
All right, so, that is 30 grains of smokeless powder.
GRANT:
That's six bullets' worth?
TORY:
Yeah, I know.
Doesn't look like much.
Do you think that's gonna blow the lock open?
Hey, it worked for MacGyver.
Yeah, I doubt it.
I think the hardest part is gonna be getting that into the lock.
I know.
All right, let's do it.
NARRATOR:
Kari does manage to stuff the cloth in the lock.
That's the first real thumbs-up for this myth.
Okay, that should be it.
NARRATOR:
Then the boys attach Grant's custom rig to the doorframe.
GRANT:
So, our lock is right behind here.
It's got the bit of bandana with the powder in it.
This is our cap, and this is our mechanism to swing the gun.
It's a little more complicated than just hitting it, but for safety's sake, we need something to do it remotely.
TORY:
Do you want to put tension on the string, see if it holds up?
GRANT:
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Perfect.
Okay, this is "MacGyver Gunpowder in Lock,"
test one.
You guys ready to have your minds blown?
Yeah.
Here we go.
In 3... 2... 1!
NARRATOR:
No smoke, no fire, and no boom.
I realize the earplugs are more for your countdown than the actual popping.
GRANT: [Laughs]
NARRATOR:
The pin on the gun grip did strike the cap, but it didn't ignite the powder.
Yeah, it went off, but the powder didn't.
So, what's the next step?
The obvious thing is that the cap is not coming into contact with the powder because of the cloth.
Maybe what we do is we put a hole in the cloth so that we have the cap in contact with the powder.
All right.
Well, let's give that a shot.
NARRATOR:
So Tory sensibly spreads the gunpowder all the way back to the ignition cap.
GRANT:
Here we go.
3... 2... 1.
NARRATOR:
Silence is deafening.
Mac's mini-hostage wouldn't even know that someone was trying to rescue him.
TORY:
It didn't ignite the powder, and that was in contact with the cap.
I'm starting to think that, no matter what, a cap going off isn't gonna ignite the gunpowder.
NARRATOR:
But Grant has found a loophole that might just save this stunt and salvage Mac's reputation.
GRANT:
Now, the type of gunpowder that we're using is smokeless gunpowder, which is found in modern ammunition.
But at one time, the .38-caliber round had black powder, which has a bit more punch than the smokeless.
My prediction is, this is not gonna work.
But I'm optimistic.
NARRATOR:
This might be their last chance to blow the lock like Mac did.
3... 2... 1.
[Cheering]
It ignited.
- That was cool.
- That was cool.
All right, let's see if it opened that lock.
No.
NARRATOR:
The lock is intact, though it still looks real good on the high-speed.
GRANT:
It looks just like it did on the episode.
- TORY:
Yeah.
- Except for that part where the door opens.
NARRATOR:
So, this door-busting myth, as seen on TV, is busted.
But Grant still has faith in the general principle.
Just for the sake of argument, let's say that MacGyver had a lot of black-powder bullets.
Yeah!
Let's fill the whole thing!
Fill the lock with black powder and then see.
NARRATOR:
So they do, all the way up to the keyhole.
TORY:
And I've measured out 600 grains of black powder.
That's 120 bullets worth of black powder.
Now, that's a lot more than MacGyver had.
Is that gonna be enough to blow the lock open?
We're about to find out.
NARRATOR:
And their best chance for a big result is to forego the cartridge cap for an electric igniter.
How it works is you apply a battery to this end, the current flows through the wire, heats up a little piece of wire here at the end that heats up a chemical, and... phht!
..
Instant ignition for our gunpowder.
NARRATOR:
Now Kari's prepared to make a prediction that's crystal clear.
KARI:
I think there's gonna be a nice colorful boom, but I don't think that we're actually gonna explode this lock, because I think that the keyholes are gonna let all of that pressure out.
NARRATOR:
You can't fault the theory, but this ain't over till they've blown the gizzards out of it.
All righty, boys.
- Yes, girl.
- [Chuckles]
This is lock, half full of black powder, electric igniter, just for the heck of it because we can.
Well, if it does explode, it could open that door.
I don't know about that.
We'll see.
All right, in 3... 2... 1.
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
Yeah!
Wow!
We blew the door open!
Blew the door open!
Why am I always wrong?
Yeah!
KARI:
I grossly underestimated the power of black powder in this lock.
I thought there was no way in heck that door was opening and it's wide open, and I hate it when Tory's right and I'm wrong.
I hate that.
As much fun as I had today, I'm a little bit disappointed.
Why?
'Cause every prediction you had was wrong?
Yeah.
A little bit.
But, I mean, guys, we busted MacGyver.
Yes, but we proved that the general principle is sound.
You just need a lot more gunpowder.
And we even proved that you could set off gunpowder using an empty cartridge by hitting it with the butt of a gun.
I'm very impressed.
But we did have a clear demonstration on how this was supposed to have worked from the TV show using only 6 bullets worth of powder, and we didn't come anywhere close to that.
All right, so this one is busted.
Busted.
Busted.
Well, you know what?
It's not MacGyver's fault.
It was the writer's fault.
Good point.
MacGyver is real.
Yeah.
So is the tooth fairy.
No, that's a myth.
No, he's real, too.
No, Sasquatch is a myth.
NARRATOR:
We all love syrup on pancakes.
But Adam and Jamie are dipping into some complex physics to see if they can swim in syrup just as fast as they can in water.
Blaah!
[Laughing]
Well, the results are in.
We both swam significantly slower in syrup.
It's not looking good for the myth.
I know, but I'm not willing to let this one go.
I'm starting to believe that we might've gotten this whole viscosity thing all wrong.
How so?
Nobody would deny that we were swimming in syrup.
Right.
But it was an average Joe's interpretation of syrup, and it was 1,500 times more viscous than water, and this myth has its origins as a physics thought experiment.
To a physicist, something that's only twice the viscosity of water could be called a syrup, and we might get very different results with a material like that.
NARRATOR:
Back in the trenches, it's time for a full-scale refill with a brand-new recipe.
This should be perfect.
Let's let her rip.
All right.
Let's bring on the water.
So, we have, in order to test this, scaled back our syrup swimming pool, all the way down to something that's only between two and five times as viscous as water.
But rest assured, to a physicist, this is a significant difference from regular water.
Now the question is...
"Will there be a significant difference in my swimming time?"
NARRATOR:
But first, we'll have to re-rate Adam in regular water.
After all, it's a new day, and he could be a few seconds slower or faster.
Adam's first effort shows that getting a new set of figures was a prudent move.
JAMIE:
You're there!
13.43.
Damn!
I was worried that I was out of shape, but that's pretty darn good.
Let's go for another one.
- JAMIE:
Go!
- [Gunshot]
NARRATOR:
The average time for all three swims is a full second faster than the day before.
Why don't we take a quick break and then move into the syrup?
Why don't we take a little bit of a reasonable break, and then I'll swim in the syrup?
Okay.
NARRATOR:
While Adam takes a well-earned soak, let's reflect on the practical benefits of learning to swim through syrup.
Somebody is gonna be wondering what possible real-world application this is gonna have.
That person would be ignoring the fact of the great 1919 molasses flood in Boston, in which a massive vat of molasses broke free.
Molasses poured into the streets and killed 21 people, who presumably had no idea how to swim in syrup.
Well, it just goes to show, you got to collect those skills to be ready for anything, right?
Yeah.
NARRATOR:
Meantime, back at Club Mud...
Aah!
It's cold.
Okay, here we go.
Whoa!
Aah!
Ooh!
JAMIE:
Okay, Adam in syrup twice as thick as water.
[Gunshot]
NARRATOR:
...Adam strikes out again...
You're there!
NARRATOR:
...and sets a really fast time.
14.02 seconds.
Nice!
You know what that is?
That's significant data.
- Let's go again.
- Okay.
NARRATOR:
Adam's next two laps are both well under 15 seconds.
JAMIE:
You're there!
14.62.
Ah, it looks like I'm getting tired and slowing down.
JAMIE:
A little bit.
NARRATOR:
At the very least, this comparison looks like a close call.
JAMIE:
Do you want to know how you did?
ADAM:
Lay it on me, coach.
JAMIE:
Okay, well, in the heavy syrup, you swam 27% slower than you did in water, but in the light syrup, you swam 2.8% slower than you did in water.
- Wow.
- That's a big difference.
Yeah, I mean, I'll wager there's a difference between any three of my times in either of the water or either of the syrups was greater than 2.8%.
Yeah, that's less than half-a-second variation.
That's well within the margin of error.
That's a really cool result.
NARRATOR:
In the heavy treacle analog,
Adam's times were 28% slower than they were in water, so that's myth busted.
Then, again, his times in light syrup were much the same as swimming in water, so that's myth confirmed.
Obviously, there's a threshold between the two, and I'd like to find where that threshold exactly is... i.e., something that the layperson would call syrup, yet you can swim just as fast in it.
Why am I chopping wood, you ask?
Not because I'm a lumberjack and I'm okay, but because we're about to test a myth that comes from one of America's greatest legends...
Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier.
Now, apparently, he would take his ax and throw it against a tree.
And then he would take his trusty musket, Betsy, fire a shot at the ax head, and split the bullet clean in half.
And that is what we're gonna test to see if it's really possible.
NARRATOR:
Back in the early 1800s,
Davy Crockett gained fame as a U.S. Congressman and a fearless frontier type.
Self-described as half horse, half alligator,
Davy had a reputation for, well, embellishing the truth.
He once boasted the prettiest sister and the ugliest dog in the country.
So, look, this guy was real and a huge part of American folklore.
Yeah, back in the '50s, almost every kid had one of those Davy Crockett coonskin caps.
But he did tell a lot of whoppers.
He used to say that he could grin the bark off a tree.
And that's just one tall tale.
With all these crazy stories, it casts a lot of doubt on this myth that he could split a bullet by hitting an ax head.
Fortunately, I couldn't agree more.
NARRATOR:
It's an old-time myth you just couldn't test with modern firearms.
200 years ago, the guns were slower and the lead bullets were rounder and softer.
But rest assured, the axes were sharp.
All we have to do is shoot the ax head with a bullet and split it in two.
How hard can that be?
What are we gonna do with the rest of our day?
[Laughing] I don't know.
KARI:
I'm always looking forward to the historical myths, and this one is extra fun because I really, really am into Davy Crockett.
I love all of the cap-and-ball musket shooting.
It's gonna be a good day.
NARRATOR:
That's the spirit, Kari.
Unwavering optimism in the face of yet another myth that beggars belief.
There you go.
Pin the tail on the coonskin cap.
TORY:
Hitting our target with these muskets is gonna be tough.
They're heavy.
They're not as accurate as a modern-day rifle.
So we thought maybe if we dress up like Davy Crockett, maybe that'll give us an advantage to hit our target.
Maybe we channel him.
Davy, Davy, help me hit my target.
But I doubt it.
NARRATOR:
Now, most folk wouldn't take advice from a man who shot his own hat, but I wouldn't say that out loud to Jim Mitchell.
Jim's an expert on antique American firearms.
- Jim!
- Good to see you again.
Good to see you.
KARI:
Jim's outfit terrifies me.
I feel like his hat is gonna bite him at any moment or just, like, crawl up on me.
I see you got a couple of .58 calibers there with you.
Are you comfortable with them, shooting them, loading them?
Maybe you should give us a little refresher course.
NARRATOR:
It sure couldn't hurt.
These old-time rifles aren't exactly user-friendly.
First thing, you load up your powder.
Measure your powder out into the measure.
KARI:
It's quite a procedure loading up a musket.
First, you've got to pour the gunpowder directly into the barrel.
Then you've got, like, a lubricated little patch that you stuff a lead ball on, and you have to stuff it all the way down.
I mean, can you imagine loading that thing over and over and over, if you had to be a quick shot?
NARRATOR:
But shooting these guns is just as tricky.
They all need practice, and here's Kari's tip for making fruit salad in less than a tenth of a second.
- GRANT:
Nice!
- [Laughter]
NARRATOR:
Grant shoots a soda bottle.
[Gunshot]
TORY:
Yeah!
- KARI:
Nice!
- Ha ha!
NARRATOR:
And Tory terminates a tomato.
Get it.
Get that tomato.
That's what you get for not being organic!
Whoo!
TORY:
Right now, we're just hitting the targets just to see if we can sight these guns in, and they seem pretty accurate.
The tricky part now, though, is to be able to hit that ax blade dead center with the bullet so we get it to split, because if it hits a little bit to the left or a little bit to the right,
it might just deflect and stay one bullet.
We need it to hit right in the middle so we see two pieces after the bullet hits the ax head.
NARRATOR:
Tory, Grant, and Kari are testing the myth that Davy Crockett could hit two targets with one bullet by splitting it on an ax blade.
So, now it's our chance to do this myth for real.
Now, legend has it that Davy Crockett could do this trick from 40 yards.
So we're gonna measure out 40 yards and give it a shot.
NARRATOR:
But that's looking a long, long way off.
And... 40 yards.
That's kind of far.
TORY:
I'm gonna take a shot.
I doubt I'm gonna split it on the first one.
But who knows?
Maybe I'll get lucky.
Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good.
NARRATOR:
Now, we should get some idea of just how sharp the shooting has to be.
Not bad at all.
Let's try a take two.
KARI:
Still a little to the left.
Tory has got one more shot before the others get their chance.
Confirming the two-target myth means splitting a bullet in half.
That's as tough as anything these guys have ever attempted.
KARI:
Lookit.
1, 2... pa-ching!
...3.
- Whoa!
- I hit the blade.
- That's great.
- That is crazy.
Look at that.
It just hit here.
I was maybe an eighth of an inch off from hitting it dead center.
KARI:
I think with a little practice, you could hit that.
Yeah, if you practiced, you'd be able to hit this all day.
But we're not looking at accuracy.
We're looking at whether or not you could split the bullet.
All right, well, let's split the difference.
Come in 20 yards and then try it again.
All right.
NARRATOR:
They bring the mark in, because this myth is more about if a bullet can split in two, than where you took the shot from.
- Hey, nice shot.
- Wow!
NARRATOR:
Kari goes close.
Whoa!
NARRATOR:
Then closer, as she grazes the handle.
GRANT:
Look, you can see the burn mark.
Nice shot!
- Thank you.
- Good one.
- Give me one more.
One more.
- All right, one more shot.
NARRATOR:
Hard to say no to a girl with a gun.
KARI:
Close, but no cigar, as my dad would say.
Look at that.
Just grazed the ax.
To be able to hit the blade by shooting off hand, it's gonna take a long time and a lot of practice.
NARRATOR:
Daylight is fading, so Grant gets to shoot off a sandbag.
This could be the shot that confirms the Crockett myth.
This ax don't stand a chance.
- You hit the blade.
- Look right here.
Skimmed it.
You're real close.
TORY:
So you've just got to go over just, like, an eighth of an inch to the right.
Like a hair.
NARRATOR:
The shots are almost perfect, but for this test, "almost" just doesn't cut it.
You know what?
It's incredibly difficult, even off the rest.
So I'm gonna give it one more shot.
NARRATOR:
And Grant can see Coyote Jim waiting in the wings.
GRANT:
No splits.
If Davy Crockett could do this, he was quite a shot.
TORY:
Now, before we move on to the expert, how would you guys feel about me taking one shot from the bench?
- Sure.
Go ahead.
- Knock yourself out.
I'm dying to do it.
NARRATOR:
And we're dying to see if this split-bullet myth is just another tall tale.
Someone needs to step up and hit that blade with perfect precision.
[Laughter]
Ha ha!
NARRATOR:
Tory has done it.
One-half of the bullet went left, and the other went right.
- You did it!
- I can't believe it.
- It actually worked.
- KARI:
Both sides.
Look.
Right there, that's where it hit.
- Chink, chink.
- Yeah.
- GRANT:
It's confirmed.
- TORY:
Totally confirmed.
- Who thought that?
- Davy Crockett didn't lie.
So, we showed you can split a bullet and take out two targets at once.
Yeah, that was using an ax, ammunition, and weapons from Davy Crockett's time.
And a little bit of mojo from Davy Crockett.
The outfits.
So, this one's confirmed.
- Confirmed.
- Confirmed.
NARRATOR:
Jamie and Adam are testing if the extra thrust you'd get from swimming through syrup might just counteract the added resistance.
So, now they'll mix up one last batch with a texture that's more like good old maple syrup.
[Horn blares]
Not too thick, not too thin, but just right.
That's the Goldilocks myth.
We're mixing up a batch right now, and, soon, we'll be putting it to the test.
NARRATOR:
It's a blend that should meet any definition of syrup...
500 times thicker than water.
JAMIE:
So, these are Adam's last three swims, and given how fast he swam in the light syrup, his times in this stuff should be really interesting.
What's my time?
14.34.
Yeah!
[Laughs]
JAMIE:
That goofy-looking scum on top we call fish eyes.
It's just clusters of guar gum.
Adam actually seems to enjoy swimming in it.
13.81.
[Laughs] Yeah!
Whoo!
- Good job.
- Thank you.
You're done.
You can get out now.
I'm officially done.
NARRATOR:
Adam's times were nice and steady, but it stands to reason that a better swimmer would be even more consistent, and that makes for better science.
Enter this fine specimen.
Nathan Adrian was a gold-medal winner at the Beijing Olympics.
- Hello, sir.
- Hi.
How's it going?
Oh, my God, look at you.
[Laughs]
- Hi, Nathan.
- Hi.
How are you doing?
That's perfect.
You feel like running some tests for us?
Absolutely.
I'd love to.
NARRATOR:
Let's start him off in a bent pool filled with straight water to set a baseline time.
ADAM:
This surprise of Jamie's is proving extremely fruitful.
Not only is Nathan fast, which I expected.
He's super consistent.
All of his times are within a half a second of each other.
My times had about a one-second spread, so it just means that the data is that much more precise.
9.81.
Can we let him get out?
Let's let him get out.
NARRATOR:
Now it's time for this sports hero to swim in something gooey and slippery.
[Spitting]
ADAM:
On your mark!
- Get set!
- [Gunshot]
JAMIE:
Nathan, just... pretend that you're one with the syrup.
Almost dead on the money.
10.87.
Is that funky or what?
It's so weird.
NARRATOR:
You can bet this wasn't part of Nathan's post-Olympic dream.
JAMIE:
Just think about it like you got to swim faster to get out of it quicker.
[Laughs]
[Gunshot]
NARRATOR:
A man with the right stuff, forced to wallow in some very wrong stuff.
ADAM:
Awesome!
I can tell you're starting to get into it a little bit.
It grows on you after a while, doesn't it?
[Laughter]
ADRIAN:
As far as resistance goes, when you're swimming at speed, it doesn't feel all that much different than water, truthfully.
NARRATOR:
So, Jamie tries to make sense of the stats.
Nathan was a full 9% slower in medium syrup than water.
More surprisingly, while his water times were super consistent, his syrup swims were much less consistent than Adam's.
And with Adam swimming just 5.4% slower in syrup than water, which is almost within his margin of error, this myth could still go either way.
JAMIE:
Do you think that you were slower because the goo was offering more resistance or because it was messing with your technique?
I'd have to say it was definitely messing with my technique and how comfortable I was in the water.
It's such a huge disadvantage to be in such a foreign environment with the goop and everything.
NARRATOR:
None of which seems to bother our boys, but given Nathan's erratic times,
Adam is prepared to drop a bombshell.
We're gonna throw out Nathan's swim times in the syrup.
See, we brought him in... being an Olympic swimmer, one of the best in the world, we thought it was gonna eliminate swimming time as a variable.
But because what he does for hours every day is swim in a clear-water pool, following a line, going as fast as he can, the syrup threw his technique out the window.
Mine prove the point much better than his do.
That's pretty cool.
So, how are we gonna wrap this one up?
The simple fact is that you swam just about as fast in the medium, or Goldilocks syrup, and the light syrup as you did in water.
Well, so, I'd say that makes it solidly plausible.
You can swim as fast in syrup as you can in water.
Plausible, depending on the viscosity of the "syrup."
NARRATOR:
So, that's a wrap for swimming in syrup, but there's still some unfinished business on the MacGyver set.
GRANT:
Well, we Mythbusters have never been ones to leave well enough alone, and we have a door here that we just don't want to take home.
NARRATOR:
And with a little help from J. D. And some C-4, they won't have to.
The question is...
do you want to do a surgical kind of an entry around the lock, or do you want to just blow the crap out of it?
NARRATOR:
Hardly worth asking the question, really.
Blow the crap out of it.
- Let's blow the crap out of it.
- Yeah!
I guess we'll be in the bunker, then.
NARRATOR:
So, our guys duck for cover.
J. D. Sets the charge and bellows out his four favorite words.
Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole!
In 3... 2... 1.
- KARI:
Whoa!
- Whoa!
That's what I'm talking about!
NARRATOR:
To borrow a phrase from the poet of plastic explosives, Jamie Hyneman, bye-bye, door.
[Laughs]
Screw black powder.
That is incredible.
That's like 70 feet away from the blast site.
[Laughs]
GRANT:
Now, personally,
I think that if MacGyver had carried around a lot more C-4, he could've gotten through a lot more doors a lot easier.
On this high-flying episode of "Mythbusters"...
One word for this... splat!
...the whole team tackles one massive myth.
Everything in your mind is saying, "Don't do it. "
Testing the tale of a spectacular midair mishap pushes everyone to the limit.
This whole story is just totally absurd.
They'll need luck...
For science.
- Aaaah!
- ... courage...
Ah!
This is the best data ever!
...and some serious science...
That's perfect.
...to tackle the myth of the man who fell to earth...
Grant, take it away.
...struck a seesaw, and launched a legend.
Who are the Mythbusters?
Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman.
You just need a little extra lubrication.
Between them, more than 30 years of special-effects experience.
I'm taking me Jamie out for a walk.
Joining them...
Tory Belleci...
Freedom!
...Grant Imahara...
Let's go!
Come on!
I'm gonna be rich!
...and Kari Byron.
That was a rush!
They don't just tell the myths.
They put them to the test.
A little old for dolls, aren't we?
This is not a doll.
This is a demonstration model for the next story we've got to do, which comes right from the fan site.
Okay, tell me more.
I'm a skydiver, right, and I'm falling through the air and my parachute has utterly failed.
Looking desperately down at the ground for something to break my fall, I spy a children's playground and a seesaw with a little girl at the other end.
Not worrying about her, I aim for this end of the seesaw, go straight upright at the last second.
I hit the seesaw and catapult that poor little girl up to the top of a seven-story building, where, amazingly, she lands safely.
Wow.
Sounds almost too good to be true.
I thought the same thing.
Improbable, yes.
But impossible?
Parachutes do sometimes fail to open.
If he's jumping over a town or city, it's feasible he could drop over a playground.
Common sense and basic physics tells us that if he hits the seesaw, that lonely little girl is going somewhere.
But seven stories high, and she lives?
Well, don't knock it till you've tried it.
"Jamie, I don't know about you, but I feel like we could just go for this one. "
Sure, we can do it right outside.
All we need is a regulation seesaw.
And a correctly weighted little girl.
And a skydiver.
Terrific.
Let's do it.
When I was a kid, seesaws were long wooden planks, and that's what we started looking for.
But it turns out no one makes those anymore.
Now seesaws are made out of steel, and there are as many designs as there seem to be playgrounds.
So we have chosen a mid-range, middle-of-the-road, simple steel seesaw, and that's what I'm about to build.
For Adam, building a two-kid plaything is a one-man job.
Inside 30 minutes, he welds a central pivot from 2-inch pipes and a couple of elbow joints.
The bench itself is just a 10-foot slab of hollow steel.
Now I've just got to attach one to the other.
So far, so good.
But then Adam finds a fatal flaw in the foundations.
There's no kid that wants to go that high.
After a quick nip/tuck, we've got a working seesaw, a simple device that just might flip an unsuspecting 6-year-old seven stories high.
Much better.
But here's the problem.
To hit terminal velocity, the unlucky skydiver would have to fall from at least 600 feet.
So to get around that problem, at least for this first test, what I'm doing is trading altitude for weight.
When I fill these barrels with water, they'll be much heavier than a man, so we can then drop them from a much lower height and get a more or less guaranteed hit.
And the impact force should be exactly the same.
That's the theory, and they can't wait to put it into practice, so they've picked a drop zone that's real close to home... the parking lot behind M5.
And that's just getting welded down at the plate?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
It's a stunt that will scare the neighbors.
Given the massive forces at play, only a lunatic would choose this moment to trial a new technology.
This quick release, which holds up to 10,000 pounds, is gonna be the mechanism by which we drop our weight on the seesaw.
And normally we'd use it in a "pull on a wire" mode.
Now it's got an automatic cylinder release, which, when we connect a battery from our viewing site, and I say, "Connect the battery" it's gonna drop the weight right on our seesaw.
Now for the checklist.
They've got the crane.
They've got the weight.
And Adam's built a teeter-totter that both sees and saws.
Okay, so it is, in fact, a seesaw.
It is, in fact, a seesaw.
I want one of these in my office.
All we need now is a full-scale victim, and this one is almost too cute to catapult.
Almost.
So, shall we name her "Ariel"?
Nice call, Jamie, but it's best not to get too attached to your missiles.
Our little girl over here is supposed to be an average 6-year-old, and so we've made her weight 50 pounds.
Now, if the physics in this story are correct, the water barrels, when they hit this end of the seesaw, are gonna launch her straight up about 70 feet, or 7 stories.
I've calculated that filling the barrels with 1, 150 pounds of water and then dropping them from 75 feet should exactly match the skydiver's free-fall impact force of 85,000 foot-pounds.
The foot-pound is a standard gravitational measurement.
It's the energy expended by a force of one pound acting through a distance of one foot.
- Looks good to me.
- All right.
Let's go up.
The numbers look good on paper, but let's see how it all pans out on the pavement.
So, I'm gonna pull the safety, but you know what?
I don't want to be anywhere on this lot when we drop this thing.
I was thinking we should be up over there.
I was thinking the same thing.
So with the elements in place,
Adam and Jamie head for the high ground.
Right now I'd describe the situation as "mayhem in potentia. "
Soon we'll have actual mayhem.
And that actual mayhem is now just moments away.
All right, here we go...
skydiver seesaw.
In 3, 2, 1.
Aw, darn.
The seesaw broke.
It just kind of like folded in half.
The bench is buckled, but the full extent of this disaster is best assessed from ground level.
I don't think we've ever done this specific kind of damage.
What do you mean?
A little bending and welding.
And it will be good as new.
Look, you can see where...
That's exactly where it hit the rebar handle.
Yeah.
Which is, like, flattened as flat as it could be.
It not only crushed it right at the pivot point, but it also crushed it right at the end here.
So, you know, that's a heck of a lot of force.
A lot more than we considered.
We're gonna have to rethink this thing.
Yeah.
Even if this was a solid bar of steel,
I don't think it would have taken it.
Yeah.
I swear, this is the best part of the job... reviewing the high-speed footage.
I want to see if she even comes off the ground.
Oh, I think she does.
I saw her flip a couple of times.
Little Ariel launched at exactly 23 miles per hour and then flew 20 feet high.
What goes up...
- Come back!
- must come down.
Here it is.
That's barely two stories, way short of the mythical seven.
But with all the substitutions, this test was always more likely to be an indication than an indictment.
I can't help but feel this nagging feeling in my head that there's a big difference between 1,000 pounds of water in steel cans and a soft, 100-and-some-odd-pound skydiver falling at terminal velocity.
We've got a lot of rethinking to do to really call this one.
This thing right here...
It already buckled.
And so, all of that energy has been wasted.
Now we need to figure out, if we're gonna make this work, how to get all of that energy over there to come over here to the little girl without wasting itself on breaking things in the process.
In short, the fact that a home-built seesaw cracked under the weight of three sharp-edged barrels doesn't prove or disprove the myth.
And with the help of Tory, Grant, and Kari, things will get better.
The common playground seesaw is about as safe or as dangerous as you want to make it.
But could it really toss a girl on top of a seven-story building?
Well, it flipped an elephant, right?
Dude, there is a lot to do in this myth.
Yeah, there is, but I'm ahead of you.
Reinforcements should be arriving... now.
- What do you need?
- Okay.
You know the seesaw myth that we're working on?
- Yeah.
- We need a way, first, to calculate the terminal velocity of our skydivers.
Specifically in the myth, it stated that he is wearing a camera suit.
That's a specific kind of skydiving suit.
We need to know how fast he's going.
Okay, cool.
What else?
Well, we need to have a delivery system for the skydiver to put him on target at terminal velocity.
A giant crane?
We'll figure it out.
All right.
We'll see you later.
- "We'll figure it out. "
- I don't know.
I just went blank.
Great.
Always have to be the hero.
So on the very next misty morning, the team arrives at SkyDance SkyDiving to see just how slowly a man can fall in a camera suit.
Grant's our designated diver, and Nick Armstrong's here to point him in the right direction... down.
- So, this is the camera suit?
- Yes, it is.
Can you tell us a little bit about it?
Sure.
It's different from most of our skydiving suits in that it's built specifically for videographers.
The key design difference is a wing-like flap from the elbows to the hips that should give added air resistance.
So you can get a lot slower with one of these suits on?
Absolutely.
Grant's not licensed to go solo, so he's doing a tandem jump.
Nick's wearing the camera suit and a fancy Altitracker wrist computer to log the details of his descent.
He and Grant are both gonna go up.
They're both gonna jump at the same time.
And when Grant gives Nick the signal, he's gonna spread out as far as possible to see if he can slow down his descent.
And when he gets off the plane, I'm going to take that, download it into a computer.
We'll have a graph that'll tell us all the speeds.
Now, after Nick is done with the spread-eagle position, then he's gonna try flapping his wings.
Is flapping your wings gonna make you slow down more?
I don't know.
Maybe it'll take your mind off the fact that you're falling without a parachute.
For a veteran skydiver, flapping your wings sounds a touch undignified, but it's worth a shot.
Grant's just happy be here.
This is one of those great opportunities on this show to do something that's reasonably dangerous, but in relative safety.
I'm very excited to try this out again.
This will be my second sky-dive.
Hope things go great.
So do we, buddy.
When the plane hits 2 miles high, the passengers push off.
Once the guys get situated,
Nick initiates part one of the test... spreading those tiny wings.
The result is just as predicted...
Relative to Grant, he does seem to reduce his speed.
A few seconds later, Nick tries flapping like a giant pelican to see if that slows him down.
Yep.
Team Imahara makes a perfect 4-point landing.
Nicely done.
- You're safe and sound.
- You made it.
And our eye in the sky has a fair idea of what worked and what didn't.
So, he opened up his arms, and he was gone, just like that.
So when he reset and tried to start flapping, how did that go?
Yeah, I saw him come back down when he started flapping his arms, and he was just falling at the same speed I was.
To confirm Grant's account,
Kari downloads the data from Nick's wrist computer, and the graph couldn't be more clear.
When Nick opened up his camera suit and went completely spread out so he had the most surface area, he slowed down to about 114 miles an hour.
But over here, this is where he started flapping his wings like a cartoon to see if he could slow down, you know, Goofy-style.
That didn't seem to work too well.
So 114 miles per hour looks like the speed to aim for.
But Grant's remembered a crucial part of the story they've overlooked, so Tory needs to suit up.
We need to send Nick up again because the myth specifically said the skydiver tried to land on his feet.
In other words, he fell spread-eagled like the last test, but then at the last second, tried to land the jump, and I'm guessing that even if the guy only went perpendicular for a second or two,
it could significantly change the speed at which he hit the seesaw.
All right, here we are again, putting our lives on the line for science.
But don't get me wrong.
I love skydiving.
But I've only been two times, so maybe that's natural.
Ready, set...
They all assume the standard frog position.
It takes 10 full seconds and at least 600 feet of free fall to reach terminal velocity.
Then Nick tries going vertical.
It's harder than it looks.
A few seconds later, he tries again.
Hopefully Nick stayed upright long enough for the computer to register any change in velocity.
And if Grant was right, that brief moment of verticality will affect the speed at impact.
Then at the last second, he tries to land on his feet.
He kind of closes up into a smaller position, and his speed shoots up a little bit.
But since it's only 1 second, he gets to about 122 miles an hour.
Now, that is the important number right there because that's gonna be the final speed at which he hits the seesaw.
For just the second time in Mythbusters history, the whole team has pulled together to test one fantastic fable...
the skydiver who hit a seesaw and sent a little girl seven stories high.
If that's not too hard to swallow, the myth says she survived the adventure.
But that car-park catastrophe still haunts Adam.
It's not looking good for this myth, man.
I mean, if our regulation seesaw made of steel can't come close to handling the forces, can't transfer the energy from the skydiver to the little girl, then this thing's busted before we've seen anything fly.
Yeah, the forces involved are really enormous, but there's nothing stopping us from improving on that design, making one that's indestructible... a super seesaw.
We can build the mother of all seesaws.
I love it.
And then if it holds together, the girl might just fly.
She might.
And Jamie has some grand plans.
It may not be the best seesaw ever... who knows what NASA has locked away?
... but he's aiming high.
We want to exactly be done with delivering the load from the incoming projectile right before it hits the ground.
But why scribble when you've got the software to design and test the concept?
We're using SolidWorks software here, which I've had for a while, but I've never really been able to use it to its full potential.
The beauty of something like this is that it really allows me to push the limits of the material and the design because it doesn't matter if the design breaks on the computer.
I'll just pull up another one and change it a little bit and try again.
And that way, by the time I get around to building the real thing, I already know it's gonna work.
Jamie's decided to build his bench in two parts, both hinged on a pivot.
Where does that put us as far as our yield strength?
The big picture here is to maximize the energy transfer from the falling man to the girl and to keep the seesaw intact.
So I started thinking about, "What do I know that is really massively strong and lightweight?"
And so what I came up with was a construction crane, like this toy here.
Instead of relying on something to not bend, they put a cable across the top of it so the load that's being experienced is on that cable, and instead of a bending force on this spar structure here,
you've got a compressive load.
It's hard to see here, but the load is this way.
And so you end up with something that's able to build whole buildings, and yet there's really not a whole lot there.
The next few hours sees Jamie and a small team of experts refine the design.
Any kind of offset would cause a twisting sort of a thing that it would be a problem.
While Jamie thinks big, Adam goes small scale to get some idea of what to look for when they try this again at full force.
Building a toy teeter-totter is easy-peasy, and, I don't know, kind of wholesome, you know?
Filling a muscleman body with lead shot is kind of strange.
But capping it off with a baby-doll head is just plain weird.
Still, it should do the job.
What I've got here is a scale model of our seesaw rig.
This is our little girl, as creepy as she looks, and this is our skydiver, as much as it looks like a round ball.
They are the equivalent weight relationship of our real skydiver and our real girl... about 31/2 to 1.
What I want to investigate with this is, what happens to her when the skydiver hits the seesaw?
If the seesaw doesn't break, where does she go?
What is her trajectory, and what can I predict about her trajectory?
So Adam starts test number one from 10 feet up on the scissor lift.
A plumb line indicates the perfect drop point, and it's bombs away.
3, 2, 1.
Oh, God, that's one of the best high-speed shots ever.
I dropped the weight from about 10 feet up.
She smacked into that lamp at a pretty high speed, which means she's going higher in the air than the lead weight is starting from.
That tells me there might really be something to this.
So Adam installs a scale that measures the drop height at 6-inch intervals.
30 inches.
He starts out from just 30 inches.
3, 2, 1.
Dropping from 36 inches.
For such a simple test, this one is giving me tons of data... and good data.
42 inches.
Number one, I think she might actually make it to the roof of that seven-story building or higher.
Here we go with 48.
Secondly, I'm noticing her flight characteristics.
She is pretty much staying in line with the seesaw...
Wow!
...either landing where she took off from or landing around the center of the seesaw.
That gives me a really good bead on where we can all safely be when we're watching this thing happen in full scale.
Dropped from a height of 36 inches...
When he's done,
Adam checks the replays to log the stats.
42.
And the big graph confirms his optimism.
Hey, dude.
Check this out, man.
Higher.
When the dots are joined, the line shows a compound increase that's hard to ignore.
When I dropped the weight from 54 inches, she flew 8 feet into the air.
Wow.
I'm looking at this, I think she might actually make it to the top of this seven-story building.
But a full-scale girl won't hit those dizzy heights without Jamie's super seesaw.
They've got the parts, and now they have to put it together.
Obviously, we like the complex engineering challenges.
"Lead Balloon. "
"Shredded Plane. "
Yeah!
"Ping-Pong Rescue. "
Yeah, it worked!
Whoo!
This is the first time we've ever resorted to computer simulations for calculating the huge amounts of energy we're dealing with.
When that skydiver hits our seesaw, it has to transfer all of its energy... all of his energy...
to the girl.
And everything that we've done thus far says that this will do that.
I'll believe it when I see it.
This is one of two trusses that will make the seesaw, and even without welds on it, it's really strong.
We're not only using a different material.
In this case, we're using chromoly steel.
We're using a different configuration of it as well.
The way these joints kind of grab all of the other members...
It's gonna be really, really sturdy once we get it all welded.
This thing that looks like a maximum-security birdhouse is, in fact, the vital fulcrum.
The trusses like this are gonna be welded onto here, and this is where the pivoting happens.
It's got to be really strong because there's gonna be one heck of a lot of weight hitting it.
And if this engineering marvel breaks, the girl, just like the myth, ain't going nowhere.
In just two days, belief in the myth of a skydiver hitting a seesaw and shooting a small girl 70 feet high has waned...
We're gonna have to rethink this thing.
...and waxed.
Wow!
Jamie's super seesaw looks promising, but now they need to find a way to accelerate a full-weight dummy to terminal velocity and hit the target.
Okay, so now we know the speed that Buster has to fall to hit the seesaw...
just over 120 miles an hour.
Yeah, but there's a problem.
We need at least 600 feet to get to that speed.
600 feet?
Do you know how hard it's gonna be to hit a target dropping Buster from 600 feet?
Yeah, so we need to figure out a way that Buster could fall faster than gravity at a reasonable distance like 100 feet and still hit the "X."
- What about bungee?
- Bungee?
Yeah, we do like a reverse bungee where we attach Buster to one end of the bungee, we anchor the other end, then we stretch him up and release him.
It hits the target every time.
Fresh from skydiving school,
Grant and Tory head for the hills to try another extreme sport.
Again, it's all in the name of scary science.
You know, we got close on border slingshot, but we've never actually used bungee in an experiment.
Yeah, it's a good idea, but is it gonna get our skydiver up to 122 miles an hour?
Well, you know there's only one way to find out.
- We're gonna have to jump, huh?
- Yep.
The method behind this madness is to see if a giant bungee cord could work in reverse to slingshot a skydiver simulate to that magic mark of 122 miles per hour.
Now, I have never bungee-jumped myself before.
I've used it to strap things together, but I've never actually depended on it to keep me from dying.
Uh...
And they're both trusting their lives to this woman.
So, what are these wristbands for?
Because, you know, sometimes the bodies are horribly disfigured and it's to identify them.
- Are you joking?
- I am joking.
They're actually so that we get you in the right weight class so that you don't get whiplash or touch the river.
After the pep talk, McKenzie spills the figures that have special relevance to this myth.
On your way down, you will be going at 68.3 miles an hour.
And then when you come back up, you'll be going 70. 1 miles an hour.
You're coming up faster than you went down.
It's that reverse thrust they're looking for.
One, two, you!
Tory's the first to take the plunge.
Don't worry, buddy.
It'll all be over in a few minutes.
I know.
That's what I'm worried about.
Remember, go big.
You cannot dive too hard or too far.
- Oh, man.
- Go big.
Oh, man!
Or here's a thought...
Just go!
Aaaah!
Whoa-oa-oa!
It sure looks like Tory rebounded faster than he fell.
At least he had fun.
Everything in your mind is saying, "Don't do it. "
Aaaah!
And then once you get over that fear to do it, then there's like this sensation of all your guts going into your mouth.
Aaaah!
And then you hit the bottom, and you bounce up, and you do it a couple more times.
So it's like...
It continues.
Aaaaaah!
And while Tory's concerned with the state of his guts,
Kari's about to be up to her elbows in someone else's.
This is going to be my falling parachutist.
Now, to make him, we need something that's going to emulate the human body, which is approximately 75% water to 25% solid materials.
Now, to do that, we're going to use an alginate.
This is used for life casting, taking impressions when you go to the dentist's office.
We're going to fill this wet suit with the wet alginate and hopefully we are going to have the perfect analogue for the human body to fall on our seesaw.
In short, he'll go splat just like a real man.
And Kari's figured the average athletic weight at 171 pounds.
Kind of feels like guts.
And, yes, I do know what guts feel like.
I've been on the show for years.
I believe I'm in the butter zone for the weight of my parachutist, but at this point, I can't lift any more, and it's time to weigh in.
I need to find out how much weight he needs to make him perfect.
So I'm going to go look around the shop and see if anybody's stronger than I am.
It's Jamie's fate to carry the load, assuming he can lift it.
Oh, geez.
Aah!
They finally do make the scales.
Jamie's already weighed in at 180 pounds, so they'll subtract his bulk from the total.
- So, how much?
- It's good.
It looks like we only need about another 20 pounds, and I haven't done the feet or the hands yet, so I think we're right in the zone for the body.
Okay, so that was only about what?
150.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I'm getting old.
Back on the bungee bridge, it's Grant's turn.
Yeah, I selected cremation.
- Good choice.
- Okay.
Thanks.
He jumps the rail, finds the platform, then takes a last deep breath.
For science.
Aaaah!
Whoa!
Oh, yeah!
Whoo!
Ah!
This is the best data ever!
Whoo.
Let's hope so.
Both Grant and Tory are trying to feel the pulling power of the bungee.
Well, I think this is really gonna work.
I could really feel the stretch and the acceleration on the way back up.
Yeah, but we're definitely gonna have to tweak this in order to get our skydiver to go 122 miles an hour.
Casey.
How are you?
The man who might be able to help them out is Casey Dale, from bungee. com.
It can be done.
It's...
There's some math involved as far as getting...
How fast do you want him to go?
We're trying to get him up to 122 miles an hour.
So you're going to terminal velocity?
- Exactly.
- Yeah.
I mean, Rubber bands are rubber bands.
We can stretch rubber band for you.
We'll need his best and biggest rubber band, which Casey calls a mongo.
"Mongo" means a really big cord, New Zealand-style cord, so that it has more stretch and rapid acceleration.
Think you'll be able to get it up to 122 miles an hour?
Put enough rubber in, stretch it hard enough, absolutely.
Meantime, Kari struggles to dress her man.
Ohh!
Then adds some personality.
Hey, there you go.
Now you have a head.
The better to see me with.
Put a parachute on you and drop you out of the sky to your death.
And he should hit a spot that's tailor-made for a smooth landing.
If the guy hits it and ricochets off like this, that's not good for us.
So we're helping it along by squaring off that end a little bit... that's what this is here... as well as really heavily reinforcing it so it can withstand that impact.
With the frame finished and the parts fitting perfectly...
- That's perfect.
- Awesome.
...Adam and Jamie rig the high-strength Spectra rope.
Working just like the cables on a crane, this should give us a compression, rather than a bending load.
Well, that's just another seesaw.
That's what it is.
In theory, the rope is even stronger than the spars, but no one knows for sure if this amazing structure can withstand the sudden impact.
And then there's Ariel.
Will she survive?
Will she even fly?
The big questions and a dozen little ones will all be answered tomorrow.
All five Mythbusters have joined forces to make or break a bizarre urban legend... the young girl who supposedly survived a seven-story flight from the end of a seesaw.
No surprise then that the test venue is a spectacle in itself...
Mare Island Naval Shipyard.
Now, the myth states that once the skydiver hit the seesaw, the little girl flew 70 feet up, 7 stories, and landed safely on top of a building.
Now, this works out perfectly for us, this location, because the dry dock is 30 feet deep and that scaffolding right there is 40 feet tall.
So when we place it on the side of the dry dock, that is our seven-story building.
It's our point of reference.
Adam, Tory, and Grant have arrived a day early to make things right for the big test.
So, you might be wondering what these giant plates are.
Well, we can't weld to the dry dock.
We can't drill into it.
We basically can't modify the dry dock in any way.
But we still need something solid to attach our bungee cord to and to attach the seesaw to.
So, our solution...
trench plates.
Each one of these weighs 7,500 pounds, and we have 2 of them for a total of 15,000 pounds.
I think that ought to be solid enough.
While Tory welds the plates together Adam nervously considers his next step.
I want to make sure that my skydiver hits this seesaw square on.
So I'm gonna run two guide wires that will guide him all the way down to hit the seesaw precisely.
I've got to weld in their bottom points.
Then I got to walk out to the end of the crane and rig the spreader bar.
That should be fun.
It's understood that Adam has a strange idea of fun.
The job itself is simple enough... to secure a sling over the very end of the boom.
Well, that's it.
We're fully rigged up here.
I'm gonna go down below.
Grant goes up to attach the spreader bar to the sling.
Getting this right is probably the most crucial part of the setup.
Okeydoke, I'm gonna let it go.
It looks good.
Down in the dock, Tory welds two sturdy steel tabs to the trench plates.
Adam fastens the wires, then fantasizes about being the fall guy.
So, right now I want you to picture me as an experimental skydiver.
I'm a wet suit filled with dental alginate, and I am being reverse-slingshotted into the ground, using these guide wires to guide me, falling all the way into...
bang... our seesaw and hopefully sending our little girl flying.
Casey, you made it.
With impeccable timing,
Casey arrives with a bagful of bungee.
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Look at the size of it!
Oh, my God.
That's crazy.
So, this is our mongo bungee cord.
It's 23 feet long and five times thicker than a normal bungee cord.
Now, it should be able to stretch up to eight times its own length before it breaks.
But we probably only need it to stretch at three times its own length to get our skydiver falling at 122 miles an hour.
They've done their sums and found that 1,240 pounds of stretch should deliver the speed they need.
But they still have to test it.
So, the first thing that goes on the big hook is this.
It's a dynamometer, and this tells us exactly how much force there is in the system.
The dynamometer gets hooked up to the quick release.
Now all we need is a body.
But they're not prepared to risk Kari's alginate man on a dry run.
So, for our calibration test, we're gonna use this, which is an inner tube filled with sand.
And the idea is that it weighs 171 pounds, which is exactly the same as our human analogue will be.
We have 171 pounds of tire and sand hurling towards the earth at 122 miles an hour.
I am not really sure what is gonna happen, but I know it's gonna be violent.
It will.
They'll be dealing with huge forces from the bungee as they try to propel the weight smoothly down the guide wire for a direct hit at terminal velocity.
You know you have a good myth when you're excited about the calibration tests.
Even in testing, this is the myth that keeps on giving.
All right, we're at 2,240 pounds of force.
- We're ready to test this.
- Okay.
This is calibration test number one.
Here we go.
3, 2, 1.
Oh, my God!
- Did you see what happened?
- Yeah!
We just ripped the inner tube!
- Yeah!
- Oh, crazy.
It kind of worked.
I mean, if this had stayed together, it would have been perfect.
Yeah.
The bungee cord worked.
Our guide wires worked.
The inner tube is gonna need a little bit of revision.
Yeah, 'cause this is not an accurate test.
This isn't 171 pounds.
What happened was, the inner tube that we had the sand in ruptured immediately, which shows you the kind of forces that we're using to accelerate the skydiver.
The best possible solution is simple and cheap.
I think what we're gonna do is take a duffel bag, wrap it with ties, and hopefully that will keep the weight together so we can get an accurate test.
So, slight change of plan.
Instead of an inner tube, we're sending our luggage.
Pull on the safety.
If the bag holds together, they'll get a precise fix on the speed of the falling skydiver, and they're hoping that's very close to 122 miles per hour.
Calibration test number two.
In 3, 2, 1!
Wh-aah!
I had a feeling that was gonna happen.
Gah!
It just ripped through the straps.
All right.
We're gonna have to redo it.
So, we just did our second test.
This time the straps on the bag broke.
So the bag didn't even get pulled down.
It just fell down.
Worse still, the bungee cord took a serious hit on the carpet-covered trench plates.
- This doesn't look good.
- Unh-unh.
Hey, Casey!
Casey has the spare parts to build one more cord, which they'd all like to save for tomorrow.
Still, they can't proceed without dialing in the speed, so it's well worth a parting shot.
So, right now the bungee is so damaged that we're just gonna take it up and the very second that it hits the right force,
I'm gonna trigger it.
So there's no waiting around, none of this... just go.
21.50, you push the button.
I got it.
Casey helps out on the launch.
And at 21.5, Grant pushes the button.
It goes.
This last calibration test just has to work.
- Go!
Hit it.
- Okay.
Here we go!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
It worked!
It hit the target, and the bungee didn't break.
That's perfect.
Now we just got to see what our speed was.
To calculate the speed, they carefully check the high-speed replay frame by frame, and there's reason to be hopeful.
The bungee held, and the bag fell unimpeded.
Grant does the math, and Tory makes the big announcement.
This bungee cord is done.
We can't use it again.
We're gonna have to build a new one when we do the final test.
But the good news is, is we got a calibration for the speed of our falling skydiver, and it's exactly 122 miles an hour.
We are gold.
Grant and Tory, come on down!
It's the last day of testing the "Seesaw Saga,"
and Jamie's ready to show off his baby.
3, 2, 1.
Ta-da!
Wow!
Oh, my God.
This is better than Christmas.
I've never seen a seesaw like this before.
I was expecting a giant piece of steel.
This is beautiful.
It's elegant.
It's gorgeous.
All the boys are over there going
"Oh, 85,000 pounds of foot force.
Oh. "
"It's so cool. "
It's adorable.
When you think about it, this whole story is just totally absurd.
I mean, a skydiver that just happens to land dead-on on the end of a seesaw.
A girl is on the other side.
She takes off and goes, you know, who knows how many stories in the air.
It's all just, like, nuts.
It's a fantasy.
But it's what we live for, actually on this show.
Kari's Diver Dan makes a rock-star entrance to the dry dock.
That's assuming the rock star is Keith Richards.
And Jamie's found a way to improve the energy transfer by padding the impact zone with foam.
We've got an awful lot of energy coming along with that skydiver.
And if we deliver it all at once like a hammer blow, it's gonna put a lot more stress on the system, on the seesaw.
So what we're doing is slowing that delivery of energy down because it's got to crush this before it gets to the seesaw.
This is kind of like the difference between a sledgehammer and a rubber hammer.
Tory delivers the victim.
You're gonna be fine.
Your dad, Buster's, done it millions of times.
And Grant pulls out the shock watches.
These stick-on patches measure the force of impact.
If the red one triggers, she's dead.
If the green one triggers, she's injured and alive, but she's not walking away.
So they're finally all set to see if a plummeting man, landing perfectly on the end of a seesaw, could really launch a 6-year-old 70 feet high.
There's no question in my mind that there's enough energy in the parachutist as he comes down to throw that little girl way, way up in the air.
And there's a host of problems that we could have.
The dummy could just split apart and only deliver part of his energy.
Things could not line up properly.
The rig could break.
And not to mention she has to go up pretty much straight up in the air for this to work.
Let's spare a thought for the stunt man.
I have a feeling he's gonna do what the average man would do on impact from that height.
He is going to squish into a million little, tiny pieces.
But the myth is all about the welfare of the girl.
Could she really survive a seven-story springboard?
The best way to find out is to push the button.
"Seesaw Saga," full-size test.
Grant, take it away.
Here we go.
In 3, 2, 1.
- Whoo!
- Whoa!
Yeah!
Did you expect that?
It didn't go up.
- It shot across the dry dock!
- Wow.
That was cool.
The skydiver hit the seesaw.
The seesaw stayed together.
And the little girl got launched over 55 feet in the air.
That's above the dry dock.
See, the skydiver exploded.
One word for this... splat!
Looks like he landed butt-first.
His legs missed the seesaw, but his upper torso hit it.
That's probably about 60%, 70% of his mass contacted it, and even that amount was enough to catapult her
5 stories up in the air and 70 feet laterally.
Grant checks the shock watches, and the news is grim.
Oh!
Red shock watch is tripped.
Hardly surprising when the doll was flung high and wide into solid concrete.
But this testing needs more finessing.
At this point, it looks like our understanding of the physics is correct.
The only problem that we have is our aim of the skydiver at the target.
Little more than half the weight hit the seesaw, and with Dan's demise, the inner tube gets a recall.
Hopefully it will hold together.
Now, it is the same exact weight as the average man, but this time we're hoping that we'll impart all of its energy onto the seesaw and fling the girl the seven stories that we talked about in the myth.
Here we go!
In 3, 2, 1!
Yaah!
Ow!
- Didn't see that one coming.
- Yeah.
- Dang it!
- That looked very painful.
She got clotheslined.
We got a good deployment of the sandbag, hit the seesaw, the girl went up, but she got tangled in the wires.
She's traveling on a much greater arc than I saw in any of my scale tests, and I think that's because our seesaw's play is much greater than the playground seesaw.
Well, you can see the red grease going up her shoe.
That's right where she actually hit the guide wire.
So we're gonna have to reset and do this one again.
In the best Mythbusters tradition, the fast-setting winter sun means this next attempt is absolutely our last one.
It's now or never.
Let's go up.
They can only cross their fingers and hope that this time, the girl misses the guide wire.
Here we go!
3, 2, 1!
- Oh, my God!
- Touchdown!
Well, Jamie said it would work.
Oh!
The skydiver simulate did hit 122 miles per hour.
And despite the colossal sideways arc, little Ariel flew way higher than anyone dared to hope.
She flies about level with our spreader bar, and that's 130 feet.
That's 13 stories.
And that was with an angle like this.
If we'd got her to go straight up, she would have cleared 200, easy.
This myth sounded totally improbable from the get-go.
But Jamie and Adam kept the faith.
The fact is, normally when we're testing myths that have to do with broad guesses about physics, they're usually grossly overestimating what's possible, and in this case, we've come across a myth where the physics are grossly underestimated.
If you had an impossibly strong seesaw and if you had a parachutist that didn't just go splat when he hit it, you'd be capable of launching a little girl up at least 13 stories in the air.
So, how do we call it?
Well, sad to say, it's busted.
Jamie built the best possible seesaw and almost doubled the seven-story flight.
But that little girl would be just as dead as the skydiver.
I've reviewed the high-speed footage, and I've calculated that the little girl was subjected to 42 G's, which means, well, she was likely injured just from her launch from the seesaw.
And her landing...
That's a whole other thing.
Oh, my God.
That's how far she went?
Nice work.
We wanted seven stories.
I think she delivered.
High fives.
I think our work here is done.
(Grunts)
(Yawning)
(Gasps)
- The sun!
Hyah!
Wake up!
Come on.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Come on, please.
- Over here!
- Aah!
- This way!
- Come on, gang!
Go, go, go!
- Jump!
Jump!
Hurry, guys!
Go on!
- Hey!
Yoo-hoo!
- There!
(Murmuring) (Grunts)
- Yeow!
(Gasps)
- Okay, let's go.
Whee!
- More.
More!
Stop!
Okay, move it out.
(Groans)
- Grapes, berries, nuts...
I don't have any nuts!
Nuts!
(Clangs)
- Yes!
- Hyah!
(Whimpering)
- Oh, let's look at this one here.
- Quick!
The sun is coming!
- Oh, calm down, boy.
The sun'll have to wait.
Now, the radial and the meridian lines cross and intersect at the point of force, which is right here.
(Groans)
(Gasping)
Hmm.
(Gasping) Hmph!
- Amazing!
- Wow!
(Laughs)
- Aspetta.
(All Gasping)
Mm-hmm.
(Chuckling)
(Coughs) What do you call that?
I want fresh fruit!
Barely kissed by the morning dew!
I'm-a not make-a Jell-O here!
It's for the gala dinner!
The royal full moon dinner!
I want-a the best, the best, the best, the best, the best, the best!
Capisci?
- Yes, the best!
Sorry, Chef.
- Give that to the ants!
Ma che fai?
Hide the pistils before a bee sees them!
(Gasping)
- Look out!
- Mamma mia!
(Blowing Alarm)
(Chattering)
- Move it!
Move it up!
Everybody up!
Everybody up!
Get up there!
Hurry!
- Okay, here we go.
(Engine Starts) Okay, ready?
Twenty degrees, right.
Fire!
(Grunting)
(Gasping)
Twenty degrees, left.
(Exhales, Speaks Italian)
- We're losing-a too much-a time.
Andiamo!
Andiamo!
(Whistling) (Gasps)
- Oh, no, no, no!
No-no-no-no!
No!
Not that way!
God rest your soul.
(Buzzing)
- Oh!
Got you, you little flying nuisance.
Not quite so buzzy-buzzy now, are you?
Honey, it worked.
My honey trap worked.
Check this out.
- Where are you?
I can't see you, honey.
- Over here.
I'm here!
(Dog Yelps)
- Oh!
Is the dog okay?
Did he get stung?
No, you stepped on his tail.
Don't worry.
He'll live.
Check this out.
Look at its furry little legs and that ugly, bug-eyed head.
(Yells)
- Oh!
Scared me.
- Me?
You look like an alien.
Will you take that ridiculous mask oft?
The bee can't sting you now.
I have everything under control.
- Poor little thing.
It must be suffocating in there without any air.
- Right.
I'll put it out of its misery.
Get the spray.
- Nature feeds you every day.
One day you will feed nature.
- I've grown, but I'm still a lot smaller than you.
- This is a great day because it marks the end of initiation.
First, you passed the tree test.
You overcame the boredom of the first few hours.
You managed to open up your senses one by one, and then your heart, until you were able to hear the tree's heartbeat.
You heard it breathe.
You heard it laugh.
You became one with the tree.
(Twittering)
You even fooled the bird.
The second test was harder, for you had to gain the acceptance of the mineral world.
Once more, patience was the mother of wisdom.
You persevered until the stone revealed its memory to you, which is vast, for it has been on Earth sihce the dawn of time.
(Animal Howling)
That rock saw the birth ofmankihd.
It saw humanity grow from a worm and begih to crawl.
(Sniffing)
(Urinating)
The third and final test was the most important, because it meant reconnecting with the animal kingdom.
Learnihg simple actions, vital actions.
Actions that unite all these families who are so different, but who have shared the same home sihce the dawn of time.
You passed the tests.
You are like the moon, full and whole, bright and bold.
You are reconciled with nature.
Protect her and she will protect you.
- I will.
(Barking)
- I think he's trying to tell you something.
- I think you're right.
- Got it.
- Oh.
(Exhales)
- See?
There's one left.
- Yes.
I didn't see it.
- Oh, honey.
You know I like animals and, uh, insects.
It breaks my heart to kill this bee, but you heard the doc.
Arthur is allergic to bees, and the teensiest little sting could be fatal.
Do you want me to risk our little angel being stung in the middle of an innocent game of tag?
- Not my baby.
I love him so much.
- Believe me, honey, this gives me no pleasure, but it's the only way.
It's the bee or Arthur.
- Don't worry, little friend.
I'll get you out.
I'm sorry about this.
I'll make sure it never happens again.
(Door Opens) Go, go, go.
- Come on, come on.
Hurry, hurry.
Lock and load!
Let's go, let's go!
No, no, no!
You first.
Go ahead.
Lift up the glass.
- It's gone.
The bee disappeared.
- Honey, I know bees fly, but unless this one's called Houdini, it's not about to get out of that glass.
- Armand, honey, look, I swear.
Come look for yourself.
It's gone.
- I don't believe it!
How did it do that?
- Well, they say that honey gives you energy.
Maybe the bee ate so much that it raised the glass.
- Oh, Rose, please.
If I ate a ton of honey, do you think I would be able to lift up the house over my head?
No, no, no.
There has to be a logical explanation.
Maybe there's a hole in the glass.
No.
Or maybe he had outside help.
Fingerprints.
Bull's-eye!
(Yelling) (Screaming)
- Hello, angel!
- Hi, Granny!
- Ohh!
Somebody needs a bath.
Make that two somebodies.
What have you two been doing?
- I was being decorated by the Bogo-Matassalai.
- I can see that.
Looks like I have some laundry to do.
Do me a favor and help Grandpa bring in all that stuff.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Well, how did it go?
Oh, Arthur, I am so proud of you.
- I did it!
- You truly are my grandson.
Heart to heart and soul to soul.
- Wow.
You mean, you passed the tests too?
- That was a long time ago.
I was already a grown man.
Being initiated at such a young age is quite a feat.
- Thanks, Grandpa.
- So did you hug a tree?
- For eight hours!
A red bunting landed on my arm.
It thought I was part of the tree.
It was so cool.
- That's wonderful!
And which stones did you choose?
- The granite boulders near the little lake!
- Really?
Excellent choice.
And did you find the beaver's hut to take a nap in?
- No, I couldn't find a beaver, so I picked a bear.
- A bear?
Y-You slept with a bear?
Well, that deserves a real reward!
- Wow.
- It's the presidential car.
- It's beautiful.
- Well, what are you waiting for?
Go try it out.
(Exhales)
A bear.
- Hi, honey!
- Hi, Mom.
- Rose, how much longer do I have to lie here with this stupid compress on my head?
- Another five minutes, honey.
That's what it says on the box.
Relax!
- Oh, God.
How can I relax with these burns on my face?
- At least you know the spray works.
- Yeah.
I'm going to Mrs. Kerman's hardware store and buying her entire stock of Super Bombardier.
As soon as I'm back on my feet,
I'll take care of every creepy-crawly for miles around!
(Whispers)
- No.
Go away.
Hurry.
It's dangerous for you here.
- What did you say?
- Nothing, honey!
I was just thinking out loud about that... about that bee.
It must be awfully smart to escape from your trap.
- Smart?
I don't think so.
Their brains are the size of a pinhead.
They're lighter than a feather.
And you expect them to be able to think?
The human brain weighs over two pounds.
Think about it.
It takes one heck of a brain to invent the... the telephone, for example, or the television.
Even if we don't have one.
And the automobile!
What, you think a spider invented the automobile?
Did bees paint the Sistine Chapel?
Did mosquitoes sculpt Rodin's Thinker?
I think not.
And poetry and music.
Do you think any beetle ever wrote music?
- No, of course not!
- Not to mention architecture.
The Empire State Building.
The Golden Gate Bridge!
You think a bunch of ants could build a bridge?
- First class passengers, all aboard.
(Chittering)
Platform number one, the train is about to depart.
Stand clear, please.
Oh.
Hey, Mom.
What's up?
- You tell me.
- Nothing.
Just playing.
- Really?
- Grandpa gave me a new train.
- Let me see.
- What are you doing?
- Checking for illegal immigrants.
- Like I have something to hide.
- Whoo-hah!
- I know you let the bee go free.
And you're allergic to it, remember?
- I know, Mom.
But if you were caught in a horrible trap like that,
I'd do everything I could to rescue you.
- That's very sweet of you.
Ooh.
But that bee stung your father.
- A sting won't kill him.
(Sighs)
- Hopefully not.
Come on.
Time to take a shower.
- Bright as a new penny.
(Chuckles)
Don't go rolling in the dirt now.
(Laughs)
(Buzzing)
- Got you.
You think honey is sweet?
Have you ever tasted revenge?
Uh...
Oh.
Just right.
(Yells)
Geez, you scared me.
Could you move to one side a little?
You're in the line of fire.
- This tree is over 200 years old.
It saw your father's father come into the world.
And if it offers refuge to a beehive, it must have its reasons for doing so.
- I'm sorry, but there isn't a tree in the world that has authority over me.
I own this tree.
It's on my land.
So get out of my way.
My land, my tree, my rock.
- No.
That is my rock.
(Scoffs)
- Your rock.
Well, maybe so.
But those bees have it coming to them.
I will be back.
- Look at that.
You still have paint on your face.
I don't want you playing any more war games.
War isn't nice, you know.
- It's not war paint, Mom.
These are the eternal codes of nature.
I was accepted into a great circle today.
Tonight there's a big party.
- That's nice, dear.
- Yeah.
It's the 10th moon.
The Minimoys are preparing a feast in my honor.
- Mini...
Mini-what?
- The Minimoys.
They'll all be there, and I'll get to see Selenia again.
- Where exactly is this party?
- In the garden.
- As long as you stay in the garden, you can go wherever you want.
- Good.
- Fire department, please.
(Gasps) Geez, you scared me.
- You're scared.
Have you looked in the mirror lately?
- I got stung by a bee.
- He must be using steroids.
You look like you've been stung a hundred times.
- Fire Department.
Hello?
- It got me once, in the rear.
Call you back.
My face...
That was your daughter with the spray.
- Is the bee still alive?
- Unfortunately, yes.
It's escaped death this once, but not for long.
I found the hive in the forest.
- My dear Armand, may I remind you that... even though my home is your home, it is still my home.
And when I say my home, I mean this house and the magnificent gardens.
That includes the trees and plants that are kind enough to grow here and all the animals and insects that honor us with their presence.
Including the bees.
- Okay.
- And one more thing, Arthur.
Who is this Selenia?
- She's a princess.
- Really?
What's this princess like?
- She's brave, she's smart, and she's never scared.
Except of water.
- What does she look like?
- She has brown eyes and red hair, like a setting sun.
And when she smiles, she looks like a... an angel.
- Any chance you might have a teensy-weensy crush on her?
- No, Mom, don't be silly.
She's way too old for me.
She's over a thousand years old.
- Oh, God, you're right.
That is too old for you.
I don't think you should see anyone over 500!
- Honey, pack your bags.
We're leaving tonight.
- But, Dad, we're supposed to be leaving tomorrow.
- Change of plans.
It will be an easier drive tonight.
Less traffic, and cooler.
- No, no, no.
We can't leave tonight!
- Oh?
And why's that?
- Because...
B-Because it's the 10th moon.
- And what happens on the 10th moon?
You turn into a werewolf?
- Honey, do not say things like that.
You know how superstitious I am.
- Oh, God.
Arthur, you've been gazing at the moon for the past two months.
It's time you come down to Earth.
Because, if my maths are as good as yours, you're starting school in two days.
- Mom, please.
I'll do whatever you want for the whole year.
I'll be the best son in the whole wide world.
I've been waiting for this moment for months.
I can't leave now.
I'm begging you.
Just a few hours, a few minutes.
I have to see her.
- Honey!
- Armand, honey, it is a bit rushed.
Besides, it would be rude to leave now.
My mother spent all day cooking our dinner.
And my father will...
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't get me started on your father.
He thinks...
He thinks his precious garden is more important than his grandson's life.
Arthur, come on.
Get dressed.
Pack your bags.
I'll be waiting in the car.
- I'm sorry.
- Here.
I packed it all up for you.
You just have to heat it up in the oven.
And some fresh eggs.
- Thank you.
(Sniffles)
I'm sorry, Mom.
You know how Armand is.
He's always in a rush.
- Oh, I know.
Can I get you anything else?
- Yes.
(Sniffling)
A handkerchief, maybe?
- Oh.
Of course.
Here you go.
(Hinge Squeaks)
(Barks)
- I'll miss you too, Alfred.
(Barks)
Hey, I'll be back at Christmas.
If there's snow, we can play Eskimos.
You can be White Fang.
Alfred, I can't play with you right now.
(Barks) Don't you understand?
I'm leaving.
(Barks)
(Whining Softly)
What is it?
What do you see?
Is that why you were barking?
It's just a spider.
That's carrying something.
Uh, thanks.
A grain of rice with some sort of inscription on it.
Oh, my God.
Grandpa, I've received a message.
It's the Minimoys.
They're in danger.
We have to do something.
- Calm down, Arthur.
Calm down.
What message?
- Here, on this grain of rice.
A spider gave it to me.
- Usually, the Minimoys send messages on leaves they drop from trees.
- I know, but read it, Grandpa.
Please.
- Oh.
I'm sorry.
Yes, of course.
- Ah, Arthur.
Hurry up, Son.
It's late and we have a long drive ahead of us.
- I was just saying goodbye to Grandpa.
- Sure.
- The message on the grain of rice reads:
"Help!"
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
But I can't do anything.
Only you can save them now.
- That won't be very easy, but I'll see what I can do.
- Okay, Arthur, I think that's enough goodbyes, don't you?
Let's see if we can make it back faster than we came.
(Whining)
- Alfred.
(Whining)
Alfred!
Alfred, take it easy.
(Barks) Alfred!
- Oh, leave him.
He'll be back.
He's scared of the dark anyway.
- It's not the dog I'm worried about.
You see?
Arthur was right!
- Oh, that boy has an overdeveloped imagination.
He'd do anything to see his princess, even if it means making up a story about a message on a grain of rice.
And wasn't it you who told me the Minimoys only communicate by leaves?
- Yes, of course, but this is an emergency.
They had to find something smaller so a spider could carry it.
- You two make a fine pair.
Remind me again which one of you is 12 years old.
- Daisy.
This is no laughing matter.
Maybe the Minimoys are in real danger and I can't just sit around twiddling my thumbs.
I have to help them.
- The Minimoys are thousands of years old.
They have survived countless catastrophes.
I'm not a thousand years old.
I'm not gonna live forever.
And I don't want to lose you again.
(Thunderclap) (Vomits)
- Did you hear that?
- No.
- Shoot.
It's gonna pour.
- I think we should stop at a gas station.
- I think we should keep going and stay ahead of the storm.
- Honey, I need to stop!
I don't have any bags left in case Arthur doesn't feel well.
- Oh, all right.
I see.
I'll pull over.
(Groaning)
Five minutes, okay?
No more.
(Thunder Rumbling)
Might as well check the oil.
(Thunder Rumbling)
(Music On Radio)
- I need to use your bathroom.
Thank you.
I've gone so far that I can't see (Music Continues)
- Oh, no, it's all right.
We don't need any gas, thank you.
Yes!
It feels good to have everything under control again.
- Alfred.
You've just saved my life, and I'll be eternally grateful.
- Everything all right, Rose?
- Blecch.
- Good.
(Sighs)
- I feel much better.
Oh, look at that.
He fell asleep.
- Good.
Won't seem like such a long drive for him then.
- Oh, my God.
Arthur was right.
Arthur!
What are you doing here?
Did you have an accident?
- I ran away.
- You ran away?
Arthur, you can't do that!
Where are your parents?
Where's anybody?
- Grandpa, there's not a minute to lose.
The Bogos are ready.
I need the telescope.
- The telescope?
The telesc...
The telescope.
The telescope!
Of course!
The telescope!
- Three quarter turns to the left for the body, three quarter turns to the right for the mind and one whole turn for the soul.
No.
Not now.
Please.
No.
No!
I don't believe it.
- Arthur, I'm so sorry, but the sky has decided.
Now, the Minimoys will have to deal with this on their own.
- You think they'd call for help if they could handle the problem on their own?
They're in huge danger, Grandpa.
They need us.
Is the light beam the only way to join them?
Is there any other way?
You know, for emergencies?
- There are the vines.
- The vines.
Perfect.
I'm ready.
What do I have to do?
- Arthur, the vines are a terribly dangerous way of passing through.
It's the method our ancestors used before the telescope was invented, but a lot of them died trying it.
- Grandpa, if something happens to Selenia, I'll die anyway... of a broken heart.
I have to find a way to make it through to them.
I'm their only hope.
- I know, Arthur, but you're still such a young boy.
- Look.
Have faith in me, Grandpa.
I'll make it back.
I'm ready.
(Speaks Foreign Language)
- Once you're in the vines, there's no going back.
You'll have to see it through, however painful it gets.
- Don't worry about me.
Look after Grandma.
- I will.
(Chanting In Foreign Language)
- Nature belongs to you.
You belong to nature.
Now!
Pull!
- Ow!
- And pull!
(Screaming)
Hurry!
Pull harder!
(Screaming Continues)
Again!
- Please stop!
- We can't stop now!
- Grandpa!
Stop!
- Pull harder!
(Screaming)
Again, harder!
Pull harder!
- No!
No!
- Pull!
We have to get all the water out of his body!
And pull again!
- No!
- Harder!
And pull!
- Ow!
It hurts!
- We're almost there!
Pull again!
Stop!
(Screaming)
- Did he make it?
- Yes, I think so.
It's up to him now.
- How will he make it back?
Tomorrow, the light beam will open up the passage back this way.
He must not miss it.
- And if he does?
- If he does, he will have to wait 10 moons.
(Rose Screaming)
- Oh, no!
Rose, what's the matter?
What are you screaming about?
- There.
Look.
Arthur.
- What?
- He turned into a wolf.
You see?
I told you not to joke about that!
(Snoring)
(Whimpers)
- Rose, it's Alfred.
- Alfred.
Of course.
- Uh, Alfred.
Yes.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no.
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have told you all those werewolf stories.
- I feel so silly now...
(Chuckling) thinking Arthur could turn into a w... (Simultaneously):
Arthur.
- Arthur!
(Groaning)
- Oh, my God.
That was some fall.
(Screaming)
(All Gasping) Hi.
(Pop Music) (All Screaming)
Uh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.
Please wait!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who have we got here?
The little prince got itchy feet again?
You should've called ahead.
I'd have put you on the list.
That way, you could've came in through the door!
Jack, fill 'em up.
This one's on me.
- Hi, Jack.
- Cheers!
Here's to your dazzling return.
- Max, I don't have time for drinks.
I received a message.
The Minimoys are in danger.
- Tell me something I don't know.
Life ain't easy when you're two millimeters tall.
- Life isn't easy when you're five foot tall, believe me.
- So let's drink to now, and may it last forever and ever!
- Max, I have to get to the Minimoys' village as fast as I can, and I need your help.
(Sighs)
- Can't you just come into my club, kick back, chill out, have a drink and shake your booty like everybody else?
- Max, Selenia is in danger.
Please help me.
(Sighs)
- Lordy Lord!
You and your princess!
Come on.
Follow me.
- Whoa!
(Stammering, Sighing)
- There have been big changes round here since you left.
There's a new head honcho.
His name's Krob.
He's such a nasty piece of work, he makes people nostalgic for Maltazard.
Sometimes.
- Maybe he's threatening the village?
And that's why the Minimoys called me to the rescue.
- Nah, I don't think so.
Krob's a wood louse.
He's a couch potato.
He never leaves his hole.
He has an army of unicorns working for him, keeping everything tight.
- What do you mean?
- The Seventh Kingdom is locked down, dude.
It's a full-on ghetto.
Nobody gets in or out without his permission.
- I don't have time for bureaucracy.
We'll have to find another way.
- Chill, cuz.
First, we head into town, find out what's going down.
(Motors Whirring) (Gasps)
(Revving)
- Wow.
- If the Minimoys are in any kind of danger, we'll soon know.
- But in town, they won't stop us?
- The unicorns are everywhere but they leave us alone.
- How come?
- The Koolomassai put on all the shows in town and keep the whole place going.
Ain't no business like show business.
(Snorting)
(Grunting)
(Clang)
That's what's up.
- Cool!
Oh.
(Whistles)
(Squealing)
- What's up?
- No, no, no!
Aah!
- I shouldn't have been so tough on him.
- You were just trying to protect him.
Honey, slow down.
I don't feel too good.
- I should have listened to him more, taken his feelings into account.
- I feel nauseous.
Honey, you need to slow down.
- You're right.
We need to get back there fast.
Weird things can happen when there's a full moon.
(Bleating)
My little boy.
I love him so much.
You know how much I love him, don't you?
- Of course, honey.
We both love him.
But you have to slow down or we're going to have an accident.
- An accident?
Oh, my gosh.
If anything were to happen to him, I'd never forgive myself.
(Horn Honks) What are they doing out so late?
They should be asleep!
- Honey, hit the brakes.
- What?
What?
- Hit the brakes.
Hit the brakes!
- He's not budging.
(Both Groaning)
(Bleating)
(Nervous Chuckle) So sorry.
I was going too fast.
It's all my fault.
Sorry.
- See?
I told you!
- Yo, man.
- Wow.
- Yeah, nice.
My hood.
(Hip-hop Music, Indistinct)
- Hi!
- Hi.
- Hey, cool out.
We safe now.
I'm the king here.
All you gotta do is look chill.
- How come?
- Best way not to get noticed round here is make sure everybody notices you.
- That's a weird concept.
- Sure!
We call it cruising.
Go slow, arm out the window, look like you're miles away and just laugh.
- Okay.
What are you laughing at?
- That's not the point, so long as everybody thinks they missed the joke.
Dig?
- Uh, not really.
- Well, check this.
(Laughing)
- What's he laughing at?
- I don't know.
- Anybody get the joke?
- No.
- Mm-mm-mmm!
Bummer!
- Okay, you try.
(Chuckling)
- Hey, what's he laughing at?
I got something on my face?
- Uh, let's see.
You got a big horn right in the middle of your forehead.
- Idiots!
(Disco Music) (Chattering)
- Wow.
I never thought so much was going on right under the house.
- You'd have been here last year, there was nothin' to see.
It was just a backwater for retired beetles.
And then there was the great harvest and everybody got rich, stupid rich.
So the Koolomassai opened a couple of bars to attract some artsy types and a smooth operator started a glow-worm business.
In nothin' flat, this sleazy hole became a city of lights open 24-7 where you can find anything you need.
Mm-mm-mmm.
Ooh.
Hey!
(Horn Blasts)
(Screaming)
I love this town!
Let's roll.
- Hey!
What can we do for you?
- Well, I actually, um...
- Some advice, perhaps?
- To tell the truth...
- I can read your future in the lines of your hand.
Tell me what you want to hear.
- I-I don't know, but...
- Yo, beat it, all of you!
Go on!
- Hmph!
- Don't listen to this bunch of phonies and roaches!
- I am not a roach!
I'm a weather mantis, and I can predict the temperature to the nearest degree.
(Whimpers)
- Come on.
We gots to find my cousin Replay.
He's the only guy I totally trust.
(Laughing)
Replay!
- Hey, buddy!
You dropped your wallet.
No, thank me!
But you better be careful around here because...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, cuz!
- Hey!
Hey, cuz!
- Yeah!
(Grunting)
- Whoo!
- That's right!
- Uh-huh!
For sure!
- And, uh, whoop!
- Hey-hey-hey-hey!
(Both Laughing)
- Hey, guys, can we cut it short?
- I heard your fine chandelier got all broke up this morning.
- I know.
- I know a silkworm who'll fix it up for you in 24 hours.
- I know.
- That little guy to your left, that's Arthur, king of the First Kingdom.
- I know.
- You know he got decorated this morning?
- Yeah, I know!
How 'bout you tell me something I don't know?
- Okay, okay.
You name it.
Who?
What?
Where?
When?
Why?
I got the juice.
Who's dating who, even.
- Tell me about the First Kingdom.
What's going down?
You heard anything?
- Nothing to report.
- I received a message from the Minimoys saying they were in danger.
Do you know anything about it?
- Ah, now that you mention it, I did hear something.
- Yes?
- I heard that a major personality with links to the palace was in serious trouble.
- Trouble?
What kind of trouble?
Uh, the palace?
The princess?
- Uh, um...
Mmm...
More like the young prince.
- Betameche?
- Affirmative.
- Betameche is in trouble?
What happened?
- Hey, I'm out of cash.
I'll owe it to you.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
No cash, no juice.
- Oh, man, give me the juice, or I'll put the word out you wear a wig!
- Max!
Please don't do that!
Otherwise people'll be so busy laughing, I won't get the juice no more.
- Okay, okay.
So tell me everything you know.
- All right.
Betameche was arrested by the unicorns for some reason.
- All right.
- The way they're headed, looks like they're taking him to Krob's palace.
- What?
The way they're headed?
- Help.
- You crook!
Man, you made me pay for somethin' you seen behind me!
I'll take care of him.
- Max, let's take care of Betameche first.
Create a diversion and I'll try to free him.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Wait, wait.
Create a diversion?
Create a diversion.
- Bracelets, bracelets!
- Go away, man.
- Pretty wormy bracelets, ladies!
- Hey!
Snow!
- What?
- What up?
My man!
- Hey, Max!
- Oh, yeah!
- Hey!
Yo, what up, baby?
- Hey, man!
- Yeah!
What it is!
- Hey, how's tricks?
- Hey, cuz!
Long time no see!
- I know!
Right?
Huh!
(Roars)
- You look good.
(Gasps)
- Thank you.
- You take 'em?
- No, thank you.
- Glasses!
Everybody needs glasses!
Get your glasses here!
(Snow):
No, you know.
We both free now.
(Snow Continues, Indistinct) (Sighing)
- And how's your sister?
Where's she at now?
- She's pregnant way up to here!
- Again?
- Sure.
It'll be her 20th.
- No kidding.
You know, I don't think I ever saw your sister... un-pregnant.
(Both Laughing)
- Hey, hey!
Hey, you two!
Break it up!
Get out of the street.
- And your mom?
- Oh, she's doing good.
She's at home.
(Snow Continues, Indistinct)
- Psst!
Beta!
- Arthur!
- Hmm?
(Gasps)
- Hey, you.
(Gasps, Stammering)
- Ah-choo!
Hay fever.
Makes me sneeze.
(Grumbles)
Arthur, hurry.
No, it's locked.
Here.
Use my knife.
- Okay.
- Careful, careful, careful.
Okay, now hit the second button to the left of the big one.
- Whoa!
- Very pretty, but this isn't the time or the place.
(Whispers)
- Sorry.
(Cackling)
- Perfect!
Now put them to work on the creeper.
(Whimpering)
- Hey, how about you?
How's your brother doing?
- Oh, he cool, he cool.
He out there doing that blueberry thing.
Man, he's makin' a whole lot of money too.
It's beautiful, man.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Guys, break it up.
Get out of the street.
Take your hellos somewhere else.
(Chuckling)
- You're new around here, ain't ya?
- Yeah.
That's right.
- You know, when you tip into someplace new, you gotta invest.
Gotta take time to know what's up also.
You dig?
- Hey, I'm in Krob's army.
I don't have to know what's up.
You dig?
- I know that.
(Chuckles)
But out here, you're far, far away from your little hole.
(Grunting)
This is our hood.
So, if you're attached to that horn of yours, you better calm down, stay polite.
You know what I'm saying, brother?
(Growling)
(Snarling)
- Uh, yeah.
I think I do.
- Nice.
Now, Snow here is gonna teach you how to say hello...
'Cause it looks like your mama never taught you that.
- Okay, cool.
So, first you put one hand out like this.
That shows we think we're of equal strength.
Then, one flat across like this, which means strength ain't an issue.
Then you...
- Beta, what about something sharp?
- Okay, okay, okay.
Try the button just beneath it.
(Trumpet Roars)
- Hey!
What are you doing with that?
- Nothing.
I, uh, found it on the ground.
- Give it to me.
- Okay.
- Whoa!
- What the...
- Hey.
- Okay.
- Hey, what's this?
- Get lost.
- Okay.
- What happened to your...
Find me that prisoner!
(Whistles)
- Come here.
(Grunts) Let's go.
- Let's pretend we're tourists.
- Yeah, right.
I feel more like a local.
- Hey.
- There!
- No.
This way.
- Okay.
You know how to drive this thing?
- Can't be more difficult than flying a mosquito.
- Oh, great.
- Whoa!
(Woman Gasps, Screams)
- Hyah!
(Gasps)
- Let's try the other way.
- Yeah.
(Both Shout)
- Whoa.
- Sorry.
(Beta):
Hurry, Arthur.
Hurry.
(Shouts)
- Whoo, whoo, whoo.
Good luck, cuz.
Good luck.
(Shrieks)
(Beta):
Oh, no.
Do you know where you're going?
- Sure.
This is the basement of the house.
I saw the plans on Grandpa's desk.
(Beta):
Well, that's nice to know.
So, now what are we gonna do?
- Give me a second to think.
(Gasps)
- Time's up!
- Right.
Let's lose 'em one by one.
- What was that?
- A rat trap.
- What's a rat look like?
- Like that!
(Both Shrieking) (Squeaking)
(Beta):
Faster!
(Whimpers) Arthur?
Are...
Are you sure about this?
- No.
- Okay.
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.
- One, two, three.
(Beta Groans)
(Screeching)
(Cackling)
(Squeaks, Sighs)
- Whoo.
Home at last.
- Not just yet.
- Hyah!
- Beta, any idea to get rid of these parasites?
- Uh...
- Turn!
(Belches)
- Whoo.
- Whoo.
- What was that?
- The rat trap principle.
But with a frog.
- Oh.
- We're not losing them.
Can't you go any faster?
- Speed isn't the problem.
It's the lights.
We need to lose the glow worms before we can lose the unicorns.
- Okay.
Leave it to me.
Whew.
(Gasps)
Whoa!
Sorry.
Sorry.
(Grunts)
(Gasping) (Gasps)
(Both Gasping)
Arthur!
- I'm not watching.
- Oh, great.
(Grunts)
(Gasps) Your turn.
- Okay.
- Careful.
Hold on.
- Oh.
(Whimpering)
- No.
Not me.
Not me, please.
- Sorry.
- Whoa!
- Great, Arthur.
We did it!
- Oh, great.
Only trouble is flying without headlights.
(Gasps)
(Both Grunting)
(Both Shout)
- Arthur!
(Sighs)
Oh.
I had this terrible nightmare.
I dreamt that Arthur was being chased by these giant insects.
Archie?
Archie?
- Oh, uh, sweetheart.
What a surprise.
You're not asleep.
- What's going on?
Where's Arthur?
- Um...
(Chuckles)
He's, uh...
He's in the garden.
- You let him go back?
Oh, my God.
This really is a nightmare.
- Daisy, the Minimoys are in real danger and Arthur's the only one that can help.
I offered to go instead, but he refused.
He wanted me to stay and look after you.
- He's an angel.
What about his parents?
Where are they?
(Door Opens)
(Gasps) Rose!
Armand!
What...
What happened?
- Armand wanted to take a shortcut.
- We had an accident.
- We hit a goat.
- We hit a ram.
- No, it was a little goat.
- It was an animal.
- Was the animal hurt?
- The animal was fine.
My car is ruined!
- Armand, it's just a car.
At least no one was hurt.
- Yes, you're right.
There is something that bothers me though.
- What?
- None of you have asked where Arthur is.
- At first, we thought he'd turned into a wolf.
But actually, he's disappeared.
- I'll let you take that one.
Rose, let's get you cleaned up.
- Can you fix this?
- Sure, I can.
- Armand, let's have a little talk.
- Ow, ow!
Ow.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
(Sighs)
- Ow.
Oh.
- Listen.
I don't know where Arthur is exactly.
But I know he knows every inch of that land out there, and he wouldn't have gotten lost.
- I know I can be hard on him.
I'm just trying to protect him.
- He's better prepared for survival than most young kids wandering around cities.
- Well, I know he's clever... and I trust him... but...
- But?
- He's still so...
little.
(Sighs)
- Well, don't worry.
Tomorrow, he will be bigger.
(Sighs) Come on.
Let's go find your car.
- Ow!
(Moaning)
- Beta?
- Huh?
What?
- Do you have any idea where we are?
(Groans)
- A cocoon.
- Right.
A cocoon.
And how do we get out of a cocoon?
- Don't worry.
As soon it feels the sun, it'll wake up.
- And then?
- And then, it'll open up and we'll... (Groaning) Fall out!
(Shouting)
(Grunting)
- Ow!
- I hate being thrown out of bed like that and you have to start the day without even a proper breakfast!
- Oh, the house.
- Yeah.
But let's try getting back to mine, okay?
- Wow!
This is wonderful.
- Yeah, and absolutely impossible to steer.
It goes wherever it feels like, and apparently it doesn't feel like going to my village.
- Then how do we get off a butterfly?
- We have two alternatives.
One, we wait for it to land.
And two, we...
(Gasps)
(Bird Shrieking)
Jump!
(Whimpering)
(Both Shouting)
(Grunts, Groans)
(Rattles)
- It's so sticky.
- Take it easy.
Don't move around or you're gonna get even more stuck.
- Beta, look.
- Arthur, are you deaf or something?
I said take a chill pill.
Calm down.
- Beta, behind you.
- Huh?
(Gasps)
(Rattles)
Ah.
(Screeches)
No sweat.
- That was amazing.
- It's nothing really.
When I was little, I worked on a spider farm.
They act so big and tough, but they're just big softies.
Softer than dewdrops.
Come on.
Hop on.
Don't tell me you're scared of spiders.
- Usually, no.
But I've never seen one so big.
(Chuckles)
- Yah!
(Screaming)
(Gasps)
- Oh, don't worry.
It's only my wife.
She must have seen a spider.
Like every other morning.
- There.
In the bed.
It was huge, and it was hairy.
And it was staring at me with big, fat red eyes.
- Calm down, honey.
You're the one with the red eyes.
Didn't you sleep well last night?
- How am I supposed to get any sleep with all of these creepy-crawlies around?
- I'll just have a look.
- Careful.
It was over there.
On the...
On the...
On the left.
(Man's Voice):
Hi.
- Yes, I called because... (Muzak On Line):
- You have called the police department.
Please, hold the lihe.
(Beta):
So I was riding along on my big gamullus, when all of a sudden, this unicorn patrol cut right in front of me from the left side.
Hey, normally, I had the right of way.
- That was when the village got worried about your disappearance... and sent me a message asking for help?
- Uh, no, no, no.
I left the village just that morning.
No one would have been worried about me till the nighttime at least.
In fact, they were all so excited about the banquet in your honor,
I don't think anyone even noticed I was gone.
- Well, that's the message I got.
So, if you weren't in danger, who is?
- I don't know.
But I think we're gonna find out.
(Banging On Door)
- Yes?
What do you want?
(Clears Throat)
- Hello?
I want to get home.
Betameche?
The prince?
The palace?
Ring any bells?
- Oh, Beta.
What are you doing outside?
I didn't even see you leave.
- Huh!
You see that?
Nobody cares about me in this kingdom.
Here.
Thanks for the ride.
Now go on.
Beat it.
Come on.
Finally.
Home.
- Ooh-wee!
Lucky for you, Betameche, you weren't here.
You missed a real drama.
- Drama?
What kind of drama?
- The banquet was canceled.
Arthur never showed up.
Just think.
A full moon dinner.
Hey, your father was in such a state.
Forget about Selenia.
I mean, she really, really believed in him.
I mean, I know he's changed since the last time I saw him, but... (Chuckles) A-A-A-Arthur?
- It looks like him.
- Holy bumblebee!
It's a miracle.
(Chuckles)
- Whoa!
- Huh?
What is it now?
What?
Arthur's here?
Oh, my goodness!
Quick.
Come on, Mogoth.
Up we go.
Will you come on!
Now let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
My ceremonial robes.
(Chuckling)
Our guest has arrived.
(Gasps)
Off we go.
- What kind of time to arrive is this?
My buffet looks-a terrible now.
Look.
The flowers have all wilted and the dewdrops have almost evaporated.
- Prosciutto, stop complaining.
All that matters is that Arthur is here, safe and sound.
Never mind the banquet.
Whip us up a quick little snack.
- I don't do fast food, Sire.
I make-a culinary masterpieces.
- Fine.
Whip us up a culinary masterpiece.
You have five minutes.
(Gasps)
(Chuckles)
- Picolo, go see if the stores have anything edible.
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.
Mamma mia.
- Hey, Arthur.
Pleased to see you, little fella.
- I'm pleased to see all of you too.
- Come on, Arthur.
- Yeah, we were really worried.
- I'm sorry.
- We prayed to the Goddess of the Forest for you.
- I know.
- That's enough.
Come on.
Let's go.
(Woman):
We love you, Arthur.
- Hi.
- Ah, my boy.
What a joy to see you again.
- Arthur!
Here you are at last.
Let me shake your hand.
- Miro, leave him alone.
My young friend.
What in heaven's name happened to you?
- Well, late yesterday, I received an SOS message carved on a grain of rice.
So I thought you must be in danger.
- A message?
On a grain of rice?
Now, that is a funny idea.
(All Laughing)
(Chuckling) Oh, my young friend.
If you had read the Great Book more attentively, you would know that Minimoys only communicate by leaf.
- I know, Sire.
- And there is a leaf for every occasion.
Oak leaves for the great laws.
Birch leaves for labor regulations.
Cabbage leaves for birth announcements.
- And wild oat leaves for intimate correspondence.
My father has a box full of...
- Enough, Betameche!
Quiet.
- But...
(Clears Throat)
- Anyways, had we wanted to send you a message of distress, we wouldn't have carved it on a grain of rice, but on a pine needle.
- Well, yes.
It's so much easier to carry.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
But continue with your story.
- I was about to pass through the telescope when a cloud passed across the moon.
(All Gasp)
So I decided to use the creeper technique.
(Gasping)
- Oh, my...
Whoo!
- And I fell in Max's bar, where I met Betameche who had been captured by the unicorns.
- Uh-huh.
- My son, what did you do this time?
- Refused to yield the right of way.
- Beta, I put that bracelet on your wrist so you'd know your right from your left.
- I know.
I just keep forgetting which wrist you put it on, my left or my right.
(Stammering)
- Never mind!
What then?
- Uh, after that, we caught a spider all the way here.
- Marvelous.
All's well that ends well.
Let the festivities begin.
(Chuckles)
(Grunts)
(Grunting) (Groans)
- Pressure!
(Squeaking)
- Prosciutto, allow me to introduce you to the one-and-only Arthur.
- Benvenuto.
- Wow.
It's wonderful.
- I just-a knocked it off.
Yes, it looks-a pretty good, but actually it taste-a like-a sh... nothing.
- Young prince, the honor is yours.
What would you like?
- It's very kind of you.
But, Sire... what I'd really like is to be able to share this occasion with the princess.
- Of course.
Silly me.
Selenia?
(Miro Stammers)
Daughter?
Where's she got to now?
- Oh...
She was so disappointed when the young prince didn't arrive... that she locked herself in her room.
- Ah.
Right.
Miro?
Show him the way.
- Thank you, Sire.
(Chuckles)
Selenia doesn't live in the palace?
- Oh!
Ever since she met you, emancipation has been the key word.
The young lady insists on her independence.
That's the way it is with girls these days.
Selenia?
(Chuckles) I have a surprise for you.
Selenia?
Selenia?
Oh.
Where has she gone to now?
- Wow.
Maybe she sent me the message.
Maybe she's in danger somewhere.
- No, no.
I saw her only a few hours ago.
- Or maybe she simply forgot that I was coming to see her.
- Selenia forget you?
Now, that's funny.
Let me tell you how she spent the day preparing for your arrival after waiting for so many moons.
Yesterday morning, the sun had barely caressed her face, she was already up.
(Groaning)
(Sighs)
(Coughing)
As she does every mornihg, she washed, then gobbled down her breakfast of raspberry puree and fresh hazelnut.
(Humming)
And after that, she hurried to her sihgihg lesson.
(Arthur):
She wants to become a sihger?
(Miro):
No, not at all.
Selenia likes pretty words but won't allow them to escape her royal lips without total control.
If you want my opinion, she has something important to tell you and she doesn't want her voice to let her down.
- Mmm.
I miss you so much
(Tweeting Melody)
I miss you so much
(Tweeting Melody)
I miss you so much
(Tweeting)
(Miro):
The nightihgale is acclaimed as the best sihgihg teacher ih the whole kihgdom.
But he's a mean old bird and Selenia had real trouble persuading him to give her a lesson.
In return, she had to give him the address of a publicity-shy craftsman who breeds worms ih apples.
When she got back from her lesson, her throat was so sore,
I had to make her a violet ihfusion to soothe her vocal cords.
The pain soon went, and she ended up falling asleep.
- And she slept through till evening?
- No, my boy.
Far from it.
She spent much of the day in the gym with Gambetto, her trainer.
Maestro Gambetto, who is a Scarabterus-philanthropis - a distant cousih of the prayihg mantis... even though he swears he's no relation to that particular man-eater
- Mm-hmm?
(Coos)
(Miro):
Selenia hardly ever takes class with him, because his astonishihg flexibility doesn't extend to his personality and his exercises are exceedihgly difficult to follow.
- Ta-da.
- But the princess was determined to assert her control over every single one of her muscles.
- Then she slept till evening?
- Yes.
But when it was time to go to the transit hall to greet your arrival, believe me, she was ready.
Oh!
- Ta-da.
How do I look?
- Uh, sublime.
- I know.
- She looked magnificent.
(Sighs)
She had chosen a beautiful little dress made of rose petals that she picked herself and stitched together.
And she was wearing a delicious vanilla scent.
(Both Sniff)
She reached the transit hall over an hour early.
(Yelps)
Which the ferryman didn't fail to bring to her attention.
(Blustering)
- Selenia, what are you doing here?
It's way too early.
Oh!
- Then she settled down comfortably to wait for her Prince Charming.
- Hmm.
What time is it, my good Miro?
- Well past midnight, Sire.
- Well, I think we can safely conclude that Arthur won't be coming this time.
(Murmuring)
- Unfortunately, her prince never came.
Selenia was so sad that I couldn't find a single word to console her.
She stayed there without moving for many hours until, suddenly, shejumped up and left the village, headed for the great plains.
- What for?
- Probably to whisper her woes to the breeze so that it would carry them far away.
(Sobbing)
That's the whole story.
Or as much of it as I know.
- So, if it wasn't Selenia in danger, or Betameche, or the village, who sent me the message?
- I'm sure Selenia can help you to figure that out.
- Yeah.
If she ever comes back.
(Man):
Selenia at the door!
- Selenia?
- Oh, if you want, you can go on ahead.
(Murmuring)
(Man):
Open the gate!
(Grunting)
(Snickering) (Gasps)
(All Screaming)
- Maltazard.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Ah.
What a pleasure to see you again, young Arthur.
- The pleasure isn't mutual.
- I know.
But don't hold it against me.
The necklace you wear around your neck is a reminder that we are all part of nature's great circle, my dear cousin.
- Perhaps, between cousins, we can reach an agreement.
I'll give you my life in exchange for Selenia's.
- No!
- Silence!
- Selenia!
- Arthur!
- Sorry, Arthur.
Not so long ago, your little swap might have tempted me, but I have better plans now.
I'm tired of your little world.
I want size.
I want scope.
I want big.
- Ah, you sent the SOS message.
You knew I'd come to the Minimoys' rescue and that I'd have to open the passage to do so.
Which would leave the path open for you to take the return trip and grow to your full size.
- Bravo!
How perceptive of you.
If I had a hand free, I'd give you a round of applause.
- I've never heard such a dastardly plot!
- Thank you.
It wasn't easy and it took all of my genius to bring my plan to fruition.
After the bitter defeat Arthur inflicted upon me, I wandered the lower levels for some time...
Damn!
...with one single idea in my mind.
- Father...
- I would find him and make him pay for his insolence.
The bubble smuggler had mentioned a good vantage point from which to observe the comings and goings of everybody in the house.
Hmm.
Smuggler was right.
It didn't take long for me to get to know the wonderful Daisy.
She initiated me into all the wonders of your world.
That fabulous box that manufactures cold and the smaller one that generates heat.
And all that food that she brought in from who knows where.
But the most amazing thing about her was her constant good humor
She seemed to do everything with love, which is a totally foreign concept to me.
Even when she had all ofher tools of torture lined up on the counter, it was just to transform vulgar vegetables into works of art.
(Sighs) it was a fascinating spectacle and I could sit for hours just watching her
And then I encountered your mother.
I have never met a specimen so spectacularly unadapted to her environment.
Huh?
- Mom?
- Fortunately, your grandfather, the gallant Archibald, was always around to keep things ticking over
I was able to watch him repair the machine that made fire, the one that made sun and the one that made water
My desire for conquest was reignited.
The warrior that I am had regained his appetite.
Nothing, and no one, could stop me now.
Not even your father and his ridiculous offenses.
(Groaning, Coughing)
(Coughing)
I am so rotten inside that the only effect his spray had was to rid me of a few parasites.
But your father did reveal to me my only weakness in this world.
Hmm?
My size.
Hmm?
And this is where you come in.
All I had to do was be patient and wait for the day you'd visit the Minimoys so I could take the light beam back, as you so shrewdly pointed out.
Finding out the day was not difficult because the kitchen was not only the nerve center which everybody visited at some point, but it was also the perfect spot to listen in on conversations upstairs.
(Arthur):
These are the eternal codes of nature.
I was accepted into a great circle today.
Tonight there's a big party.
- That's nice, dear.
- Yeah.
It's the 10th moon.
The Minimoys are preparing a feast in my honor.
- Everything was going smoothly.
Yes!
All I had to do was wait for your departure.
And then, suddenly, it was all catastrophe.
- Honey, pack your bags.
We're leaving tonight.
(Groans)
- This last minute twist threatened to ruin my plot.
The idea of vegetating for another 10 moons in this cabinet was unbearable.
I had to find a ploy to make Arthur disobey his father
And what better than love to make a young man do something silly?
How could Arthur possibly resist a call to save his princess from mortal danger?
(Groans) (Gasps)
So I found something to write on and carved the message into it myself
- This is absurd.
Everybody knows that the Minimoys only write their messages on leaves.
- And only a pine needle would have been appropriate in this case.
- My apologies for the breach of etiquette, but there weren't any pine needles in my cabinet.
(Rattling)
(Grunts) (Whimpers)
All that was left was to win over a messenger and point him to your room for personal delivery.
Then I returned to the Seven Kingdoms through secret passages, which I alone am aware of, and I had the good fortune to encounter the charming princess wandering the plains like a lost soul.
(Grunts)
(Cackling)
There.
Now you know the full story.
Let me tell you what happens next.
What time is it, my good Miro?
- Five to noon.
- High time for us to head to the transit hall to say farewell.
Hmm.
(Cackling)
- Wait.
- Ah!
(Selenia Groans)
- Oh, what is it now?
- I wish to make the trip through the telescope.
- Oh, another one?
You people just can't stay in one place.
- After me, you can rest in peace.
- Say, aren't you little Maltazard?
It's been many moons since I last saw you.
You've grown.
- Yes.
And I'm going to grow some more.
(Scoffs)
- What's the big deal about growing?
You'd be better off getting some sleep.
Have you seen yourself in the mirror lately?
(Gasps)
- Hold your tongue, you old fool!
Or your sleep will be eternal.
- Yes, sir.
A quarter turn to the right for the body... (Grunts)
- Distract him.
I have an idea.
- Okay.
Beta.
- Yeah.
- Give me something I can throw at him.
- Okay.
(Gasps)
(Shouts) Too small.
(Gasps)
No.
Too big.
- Three quarter turns to the left for the mind...
- Too cute.
- Beta, hurry.
- I'm coming.
- Excuse me.
Sir?
You know you're heading for the humans' world.
But having Selenia under your feet will only slow you down.
- Don't worry.
I have no intention of taking the little pest with me.
I'll find plenty more up there who'll be delighted to serve me.
(Cackling)
- And one whole turn for the soul.
(Grunts, Shouts)
- Amazing.
(Gasps)
I didn't touch anything.
I was just looking.
Is that your telescope?
- Yes.
- Really?
'Cause in your telescope, there's little... with big...
- Those are the Minimoys.
- Oh, the Mini... the Mini...
The...
The Mini what?
- The Minimoys.
They're our brothers.
- Oh, they're your brothers.
Really?
How tall was your mother?
- Our mother is nature.
- Oh, your mother is nature.
Right.
Well, that would explain why you're... and they're...
(Car Horn Honking)
Ah.
Uh, that must be the mechanic.
I'll be right back.
- In position.
- If His Highness would care to lift off.
- With pleasure.
- Selenia.
(Gasping)
Beta, quick.
- I'm coming.
(Selenia):
No.
No!
No!
No!
No!
(Maltazard Grunts) No!
(Maltazard):
Be still!
- Now!
- Arthur!
- Quick.
Here.
(Grunts) (Groans)
(All Gasp)
(Groans)
(Rumbling)
(Shouting)
- Did you hear that noise?
- That's your transmission.
- No, it came from the forest.
(Shouting)
- Ah!
- I figure this'll take me about a week.
- A week?
Oh, no.
I have to get my boy back to school, and I have to find a job.
- I could put a rush on it for you, but it'll cost you.
- I need it tomorrow.
I'll pay whatever you want.
- Whatever I want?
- Whatever you want.
- You got a deal.
(Sighs)
- Hmm?
Huh?
Ah.
- Arthur.
My prince.
You saved my life again.
(Chuckles)
- That's what princes are for.
- What happened?
Where's Arthur?
- I don't know.
Something shot out of the telescope like a cannonball, but I don't think it was Arthur.
It landed somewhere in the forest.
- If it isn't Arthur, what is it?
- M.
The Evil M.
(Groaning)
- The only rock around for miles, and I hit it?
(Shouts, Groans)
(Groaning)
You're not gonna eat me, are you?
(Roaring)
- Yes!
(Grunting)
(Groaning)
- Yeah.
The first law of nature: eat or be eaten.
(Archibald):
The Evil M knew that if he sent an SOS message to Arthur, the boy would do everything in his power to come to the aid of his friends.
And once the passage was open, it was easy to come the other way.
Now he's out there somewhere.
- But what about Arthur?
Where is he?
- Well, he'll probably show up soon.
(Sighs)
Oh, my God.
The passage is broken.
- Arthur.
Marshmallows!
Arthur, I know you're hiding here somewhere.
Arthur?
Arthur.
Arthur, come on.
Don't hide.
Daddy's worried.
Arthur, I'm not angry with you, I promise.
(Grunts) You won't be punished.
Oh.
Thank God I found you.
If you come out now, you'll get a big bag of marshmallows all to yourself.
What do you say?
(Sniffs)
A plump pack of sweet, juicy marshmallows that melt in your mouth.
Arthur, I know where you are.
Come on out now.
Who are these delicious marshmallows for?
- For me.
(Nervous Chuckle)
- I'll go and get a full bag.
- Hmm?
Hmm.
(Sighs)
(Chirps) (Screeches)
Hmm?
Boo!
(Shrieks)
(Cackling)

[Ripped from DVD by funnykiddy]
The Sun!
Wake Up!
Come on, come on, let's go!
Hurry, come on.
Over here!
This way!
Okay, go, go, go!
Jump, very fast!
Hello!
There.
Okay, let's go.
More, more, stop!
Alright, move it out!
Grapes, berries...
Nuts, I don't have any nuts.
Nuts!
Yes!
Let's look at this one here.
Quick, the Sun is coming!
Calm down, boy.
The sun will have to wait.
The radial and the meridian lines cross and intersect at the point of force, which is... right here!
Amazing!
Aspetta!
Ma, what do you call that?
I want fresh fruit!
Barely kissed by da morning dew!
I'm not making jello here!
It's for zee gala dinner!
Da Royal Full Moon Dinner!
I wanna da best, da best, da best!
Capisce?
Yes, the best!
Sorry, chef.
Give dat to da ants!
Ma che fai?
Hide da pistils before a bee sees them!
Mamma mia!
Move it, everybody out!
Everybody out!
Get up there, hurry!
Okay, here we go.
Get ready
Twenty degrees, right.
Fire!
Twenty degrees, left.
We're losing too much time.
Andiamo!
Not that way!
God rest your soul.
I got you, you little flying nuisance.
Not quite so buzzy-buzzy now, are you?
Honey, it worked!
My honey trap worked!
Check this out!
Where are you?
I can't see you, honey.
Over here!
I'm here!
Is the dog okay?
Did he get stung?
No, you stepped on his tail.
He'll live.
Check this out.
Look at its furry little legs and that ugly bug-eyed head.
- You scared me!
- Me?
You look like an alien.
Will you take that ridiculous mask off?
The bee can't sting you now.
I have everything under control.
Poor little thing!
It must be suffocating in there, without any air!
Right!
I'll put it out of its misery.
Get the spray.
Nature feeds you every day.
One day, you will feed nature.
I've grown, but I'm still a lot smaller than you.
Today is a great day because it marks the end of your initiation.
First, you passed the tree test.
You overcame the boredom of the first few hours.
You managed to open up your senses one by one, and then your heart, until you were able to hear the tree's heartbeat.
You heard it breathe.
You heard it laugh.
You became one with the tree.
You even fooled the bird.
The second test was harder, for you had to gain the acceptance of the mineral world.
Once more, patience was the mother of wisdom.
You persevered until the stone revealed its memory to you, which is vast for it has been on Earth since the dawn of time.
That rock saw the birth of mankind.
It saw humanity grow from a worm and begin to crawl.
The third and final test was the most important because it meant reconnecting with the animal kingdom.
Learning simple actions.
Vital actions.
Actions that unite all these families, who are so different, but who have shared the same home since the dawn of time.
You passed the tests.
You are like the Moon, full and whole, bright and bold.
You are reconciled with nature.
Protect her and she will protect you.
I will.
I think he's trying to tell you something.
I think you're right!
Got it!
See?
There's one left!
- I didn't see it.
- Honey.
You know I like animals and... insects.
It breaks my heart to kill this bee.
But you heard the Doc!
Arthur is allergic to bees.
The teensiest little sting could be fatal.
Do you want me to risk our little angel being stung?
No.
My baby!
I love him so much!
Believe me, this gives me no pleasure, but it's the only way.
It's the bee or Arthur.
Don't worry, little friend.
I'll get you out.
I'm sorry about this.
I'll make sure it never happens again.
Go, go!
Come on, hurry.
Look alive!
Let's go.
No, no, you first.
Go ahead!
Lift up the glass!
It's gone.
The bee disappeared.
Unless this one's called Houdini, it's not about to get out of that glass.
Armand, I swear!
Come look for yourself!
It's gone!
I don't believe it!
How did it do that?
Well...
They say that honey gives you energy.
Maybe the bee ate so much that it raised the glass and...
Rose, please.
If I ate a ton of honey, do you think I could lift the house over my head?
There has to be a logical explanation.
Maybe there's a hole in the glass...
No.
Or maybe he had outside help.
Fingerprints...
Bullseye!
- Hello, angel!
- Hi, Granny!
Somebody needs a bath.
Make that two somebodies.
What have you two been doing?
I was being decorated by the Bogo-Matassalai.
I can see that!
Looks like I have some laundry to do!
- Will you help Grandpa?
- Yes, Ma'am.
Well?
How did it go?
Arthur, I am so proud of you.
You truly are my grandson.
Heart to heart, and soul to soul.
- You passed the tests too?
- Well, that was a long time ago.
I was already a grown man.
Being initiated at such a young age is quite a feat!
Thanks, Grandpa.
- So did you hug a tree?
- For 8 hours!
A red bunting thought I was part of the tree.
It was so cool!
Wonderful!
And which stones did you choose?
The granite boulders near the little lake!
Excellent choice.
And did you find the beaver's hut to take a nap in?
No, I couldn't find a beaver, so I picked a bear.
A bear?
You slept with a bear?
That deserves a real reward!
- It's the Presidential car.
- It's beautiful!
Well, what are you waiting for?
Go try it out!
A bear!
- Hi, Honey!
- Hi, Mom.
How much longer do I have to lie here with this compress on my head?
Another 5 minutes, honey.
That's what it says on the box!
Relax!
Oh, God.
How can I relax with these burns on my face?
At least you know the spray works!
I'm going to Mrs. Kerman's store and buying her entire stock.
As soon as I'm back on my feet, I'll take care of every creepy-crawly for miles around!
Go away!
It's dangerous for you here!
What did you say?
Nothing, honey!
I was just thinking out loud.
About...
About that bee!
It must be awfully smart to escape from your trap.
Smart?
I don't think so!
Their brains are the size of a pin head, they're lighter than a feather.
And you expect them to be able to think?
The human brain weighs over two pounds.
Think about it!
It takes one heck of a brain to invent... the telephone, for example, or the television.
Even if we don't have one!
And the automobile!
Did a spider invent the automobile?
Did bees paint the Sixtine Chapel?
Did mosquitoes sculpt Rodin's Thinker?
I think not!
And poetry and music?
You think any beetle ever wrote music?
No, of course not!
Not to mention architecture!
The Empire State Building...
The Golden Gate Bridge!
You think a bunch of ants could build a bridge?
First class passengers...
All aboard!
Platform number one!
The train is about to depart!
Stand clear, please!
Hey, Mom.
What's up?
- You tell me.
- Nothing.
- Just playing.
- Really?
- Grandpa gave me a new train.
- Let me see!
- What are you doing?
- Checking for illegal immigrants.
Like I have something to hide!
I know you let the bee go free.
You're allergic to it, remember?
I know, Mom, but if you were caught in a trap like that, I'd rescue you.
That's very sweet of you, honey.
But that bee stung your father.
- A sting won't kill him.
- Hopefully not.
Come mon.
Time to take a shower.
Bright as a new penny.
Don't go rolling in the dirt now.
Got you now.
You think honey is sweet?
Have you ever tasted revenge?
Just right.
You scared me!
Could you move to one side a little?
You're in the line of fire.
This tree is 200 years old.
It saw your grandfather come into the world.
If it offers refuge to a beehive, it must have its reasons for doing so.
I'm sorry, but there isn't a tree in the world that has authority over me.
I own this tree.
It's on my land.
So get out of my way.
My land.
My tree.
My rock.
No.
That is my rock.
Your rock...
Well...
Maybe so.
But those bees have it coming to them.
I will be back.
Look at that!
You still have paint on your face.
I don't want you to playing any more war games.
War isn't nice.
It's not warpaint, Mom.
These are the eternal codes of nature.
I was accepted into the great circle today.
Tonight there's a big party.
That's nice, dear.
It's the tenth moon.
The Minimoys are preparing a feast in my honor.
The Mini...
Mini what?
The Minimoys.
They'll all be there and I'll get to see Selenia again.
Where exactly is this party?
In the garden.
As long as you stay in the garden, you can go wherever you want.
Good.
Fire department, please.
You scared me!
- Have you looked in the mirror lately?
- I got stung by a bee!
He must be using steroids.
You look like you've been stung 100 times.
It got me once.
In the rear.
Call you back.
My face...
That was your daughter with the spray.
- Is the bee still alive?
- Unfortunately, yes.
It escaped death this once.
But not for long.
I found the hive in the forest.
My dear Armand, even though my home is your home, it is still my home.
And when I say my home, I mean this house and the magnificient gardens.
That includes the trees and plants that are kind enough to grow here, and all the animals and insects that honor us with their presence.
Including the bees.
Okay.
And one more thing, Arthur.
Who is this Selenia?
- She's a princess.
- Really?
What's this princess like?
She's brave, she's smart and she's never scared.
Except of water.
What does she look like?
She has brown eyes and red hair, like a setting sun.
And when she smiles... she looks like... an angel.
Any chance you might have a teensy weensy crush on her?
No, Mom, don't be silly.
She's way too old for me.
She's over a thousand years old!
Oh, God, you're right!
That is too old for you!
I don't think you should see anyone over five hundred!
Honey, pack your bags, we're leaving tonight.
But, Dad!
We're supposed to be leaving tomorrow.
Change of plans.
It will be easier tonight.
Less traffic.
And cooler.
We can't leave tonight!
- Oh, and why's that?
- Because...
Because it's the tenth moon!
And what happens on the tenth moon?
You turn into a werewolf?
Do not say things like that!
You know how superstitious I am!
God!
Arthur, you've been gazing at the moon for the past two months.
It's time you come down to Earth.
If my maths are as good as yours, you're starting school in two days.
Mom, please!
I'll do whatever you want for the whole year.
I'll be the best son in the whole wide world.
I've been waiting for this moment for months.
I can't leave now.
Just a few hours!
A few minutes.
I have to see her.
Honey!
Armand, honey?
It is a bit rushed.
Besides, it would be rude to leave now.
My mother spent all day cooking our dinner.
And my father...
Don't get me started on your father!
He thinks...
He thinks his precious garden is more important than his grandson's life!
Arthur, come on!
Get dressed and pack your bags.
I'll be waiting in the car.
I'm sorry.
I packed it all up for you.
You just have to heat it up in the oven.
- And some fresh eggs.
- Thank you.
I'm sorry, Mom.
You know how Armand is.
He's always in a rush.
- I know.
Can I get you anything else?
- Yes.
A handkerchief, maybe?
Of course.
Here you go
I'll miss you too, Alfred.
I'll be back at Christmas.
If there's snow we can play Eskimos.
You can be White Fang!
How about it?
Alfred?
I can't play with you right now.
Don't you understand?
I'm leaving!
What is it?
What do you see?
Is that why you were barking?
It's just a spider... that's carrying something?
Thanks.
A grain of rice... with some sort of inscription on it.
Oh my God.
Grandpa!
I've received a message.
The Minimoys are in danger!
Calm down, Arthur!
What message?
Here, on this grain of rice!
A spider gave it to me.
Usually, the Minimoys send messages on leaves they drop from trees.
I know, but...
Read it, Grandpa!
Please!
Sorry, yes, of course...
Hurry up, son!
It's late and we have a long drive ahead of us.
I was just...
saying goodbye to Grandpa.
Sure.
The message on the grain of rice reads...
"Help!"
Are you sure?
Positive.
But I can't do anything.
Only you can save them now!
That won't be very easy.
But I'll see what I can do.
Okay, Arthur, I think that's enough good-byes, don't you?
Let's see if we can make it back faster than we came.
Take it easy.
Leave him.
He'll be back.
He's scared of the dark.
It's not the dog I'm worried about.
You see?
Arthur was right!
That boy has an overdeveloped imagination.
He'd do anything to see his Princess, even if it means making up a story about a message on a grain of rice.
Wasn't it you who told me that Minimoys only communicate by leaves?
Yes, but this is an emergency.
They had to find something smaller so a spider could carry it.
You two make a fine pair!
Remind me again, which one of you is 12 years old?
Daisy!
This is no laughing matter.
Maybe the Minimoys are in real danger!
And I can't just sit around twiddling my thumbs.
I have to help them!
The Minimoys are thousands of years old.
They have survived countless catastrophes.
I'm not a thousand years old.
I'm not gonna live forever.
And I don't want to lose you again.
Did you hear that?
Shit!
It's gonna pour!
I think we should stop at a gas station.
We should stay ahead of the storm.
I need to stop!
I don't have any bags left in case Arthur doesn't feel well.
Oh, alright.
I see.
I'll pull over.
Five minutes, okay?
No more.
Might as well check the oil.
I need to use your bathroom, thank you.
It's alright, we don't need any gas, thank you!
It feels good to have everything under control again.
You've just saved my life and I'll be eternally grateful!
Everything alright, Rose?
Good.
I feel much better.
Look at that!
He fell asleep.
Good, it won't seem such a long drive for him then!
Oh my God!
Arthur was right.
Arthur?
What are you doing here?
Did you have an accident?
- I ran away!
- You ran away?
You can't do that!
Where are your parents?
Where's anybody?
There's not a minute to lose!
The Bogos are ready.
- I need the telescope.
- The telescope?
The telescope, of course!
Three quarter-turns to the left for the body.
Three quarter-turns to the right for the mind.
And one whole turn for the soul.
Not now!
Please.
I don't believe it!
Arthur, I'm so sorry, but the sky has decided.
Now the Minimoys will have to deal with this on their own.
Do you think they'd call for help if they could handle it on their own?
They're in huge danger, Grandpa!
They need us!
Is the lightbeam the only way to join them?
Is there any another way?
You know, for emergencies?
- There are the vines...
- Perfect!
What do I have to do?
Arthur, the vines are a terribly dangerous way of passing through.
It's the method our ancestors used before the telescope was invented.
A lot of them died trying it.
If something happens to Selenia, I'll die anyway!
Of a broken heart!
I have to find a way to make it through!
I'm their only hope!
I know, Arthur, but you're still such a young boy.
Look!
Have faith in me, Grandpa.
I'll make it back.
I'm ready.
Once you're in the vines, there's no going back.
You'll have to see it through, however painful it gets.
Don't worry about me.
Look after Grandma.
I will.
Nature belongs to you, you belong to nature.
Now!
Pull!
And pull!
Hurry, harder!
Again!
- Please, stop!
- We can't stop now!
Granpa!
Stop!
Pull harder!
Again, harder!
It hurts!
Pull harder!
Pull!
We have to get all the water out of his body!
And pull again!
Harder!
We're almost there!
Pull again!
Stop!
Did he make it?
Yes, I think so.
It's up to him now.
How will he make it back?
Tomorrow the light beam will open the passage back this way.
- He must not miss it.
- And if he does?
If he does, he will have to wait ten moons.
Rose!
What's the matter?
What are you screaming about?
There!
Look!
Arthur!
He turned into a wolf.
You see?
I told you not to joke about that!
Rose, it's Alfred!
Of course.
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have told you all those werewolf stories.
I feel so silly now.
Thinking Arthur could turn into a...
Oh my God!
That was some fall!
Hi.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.
Please, wait!
Who have we got here?
The little prince got itchy feet again?
You shoulda called ahead, I'd have put you on the list.
That way, you coulda came in through the door!
Jack!
Fill 'em up.
This one's on me!
Hi, Jack.
Cheers!
Here's to your dazzling return!
Max, I don't have time for drinks.
I received a message.
The Minimoys are in danger.
Tell me something I don't know.
Life ain't easy when you're 2 mm tall.
Life isn't easy when you're 5 foot tall, believe me.
So, let's drink to now and may it last forever and ever!
I have to get to the Minimoy's village as fast as I can, and I need your help!
Can't you just come into my club, kick back, chill out, have a drink and shake your booty like everybody else?
Max!
Selenia is in danger!
Please!
Help me!
Lordy Lord!
You and your princess!
C'mon, follow me!
There have been big changes round here since you left.
There's a new head honcho.
His name's Kröb.
He's such a nasty piece of work, he makes people nostalgic for Maltazard.
Sometimes.
Maybe he's threatening the village?
And that's why the Minimoys called me.
I don't think so.
Kröb's a woodlouse!
He's a couch potato, he never leaves his hole!
He has an army of unicorns working for him, keeping everything tight.
What do you mean?
The seventh kingdom is locked down, dude.
It's a full-on ghetto.
Nobody gets in or out without his permission.
I don't have time for bureaucracy.
We'll have to find another way.
Chill, cuz.
First, we'll head into town, find out what's going down.
If the Minimoys are in any kind of danger, we'll soon know.
But in town they won't stop us?
The unicorns are everywhere but they leave us alone.
- How come?
- The Koolomassai put on all the shows and keep the whole place going.
Ain't no business like show business!
- That's wassup.
- Cool!
Wassup?
- I shouldn't have been tough on him.
- You were just trying to protect him.
Honey, slow down.
I don't feel too good.
I should have listened to him, taken his feelings into account.
- I feel nauseous.
Honey, slow down.
- We have to get back there fast!
Weird things can happen when there's a full moon.
My little boy!
I love him so much!
You know how much I love him, don't you?
Of course, honey.
But slow down or we're going to have an accident.
An accident?
Oh my gosh.
If anything were to happen to him, I'd never forgive myself!
What are they doing out so late?
They should be asleep!
- Honey, hit the brakes.
- What?
Hit the brakes!
He's not budging!
So sorry!
I was going too fast.
It's all my fault.
Sorry.
See?
I told you!
Yo, man.
Yeah, nice.
My hood.
Hi.
Cool out.
We're safe now.
I'm the king here!
- All you gotta do is look chill.
- How come?
Best way not to get noticed round here is to make sure everybody notices you.
- That's a weird concept.
- Sure!
We call it cruising.
Go slow, arm out the window, look like you're miles away and just laugh.
Okay.
What are you laughing at?
That's not the point.
So long as everybody thinks they missed the joke.
- Dig?
- Not really.
Well, check this!
- What's he laughing at?
- Dunno.
- Anybody get the joke?
- No.
Bummer!
You, try!
What's he laughing at?
I got something on my face?
Let's see... you got a big horn right in the middle of your forehead.
Idiots!
I never thought so much was going on right under the house.
Last year it was just a backwater for retired beetles.
And then there was the great harvest and everybody got stupid rich.
So the Koolomassai opened a couple of bars to attract some artsy types and a smooth operator started a glow-worm business.
In nothin' flat, this sleazy hole became a city of lights open 24/7, where you can find anything you need.
I love this town!
Let's roll.
- What can we do for you?
- Well, I actually...
Some advice, perhaps?
To tell the truth...
I can read your future in the lines of your hand.
- Tell me what you want to hear.
- I don't know...
Beat it, all of you!
Don't listen to this bunch of phonies and roaches!
I am not a roach!
I'm a weather mantis and I can predict the temperature to the nearest degree.
We got to find my cousin, Replay.
He's the only guy I totally trust.
Replay!
Hey, buddy, you dropped your wallet.
No, thank me!
But you better be careful round here because...
- Hey, cuz!
- Hey!
Guys, can we cut it short?
- Your chandelier got all broke up.
- I know.
I know a silkworm who'll fix it for you in 24 hours.
I know.
That little guy to your left, that's Arthur, king of the 1st kingdom.
I know.
You know he got decorated this morning?
How 'bout you tell me something I don't know?
You name it.
Who?
What?
Where?
When?
Why?
- I got it all.
Who's dating who even.
- Tell me about the 1st kingdom.
- What's going down?
You heard anything?
- Nothing to report.
I received a message from the Minimoys saying they were in danger.
Do you know anything about it?
Now that you mention it, I did hear something.
I heard that a major personality with links to the Palace was in trouble.
Trouble?
What kind of trouble?
At the Palace?
The Princess?
More like the young Prince.
- Betameche?
- Affirmative.
Betameche is in trouble?
What happened?
- I'm out of cash.
I'll owe it to you.
- No, no.
No cash, no juice.
Give me the juice, or I'll put the word out you wear a wig!
Max!
Please!
Don't do that!
People'll be so busy laughing, I won't get the juice no more.
Okay.
So tell me everything you know.
Betameche was arrested by the unicorns for some reason.
The way they're headed, looks like they're taking him to Kröb's palace.
The way they're headed?
You crook!
You made me pay for somethin' you seen behind me!
I'll take care of him.
Max, let's take care of Betameche first!
Create a diversion and I'll try to free him.
Wait, wait.
Create a diversion?
Bracelets, bracelets!
Pretty wormy bracelets, ladies!
- Hey!
Snow!
- What?
- Whaddup!
My man!
- Hey, Max!
How's tricks?
Hey, cuz!
Long time no see!
I know, right?
You look good.
Thank you.
- You take 'em?
- No, thank you.
Glasses!
Everybody needs glasses!
- And your sister?
Where's she at now?
- She's pregnant way up to here!
- Again?
- Sure, it'll be her 20th!
No kidding!
You know, I don't think I ever saw your sister... un-pregnant!
Hey, you two!
Break it up!
Get out of the street!
- And your Mom?
- She doing good, she's at home.
- Beta!
- Arthur?
Hey, you.
Hayfever.
Makes me sneeze.
Arthur, hurry.
It's locked.
Use my knife.
Careful, careful.
Okay, now hit the second button to the left of the big one.
Very pretty, but this isn't the time or the place.
Sorry.
Perfect!
Now put them to work on the creeper.
Hey, how about you?
How's your brother doing?
Oh, he cool, he out there doing that blueberry thing.
Man, he makin' a whole lotta money, too.
It's beautiful, man.
Break it up!
Get out of the street, go take your hellos somewhere else!
You're new round here, ain't ya?
Yeah.
That's right.
You know, when you tip into someplace new, you gotta invest.
Gotta take time and know wassup.
Also, you dig?
Hey, I'm in Kröb's army.
I don't have to know what's up!
You dig?
I know that, but out here you're far away from your little hole.
This is our hood.
So, if you're attached to that horn of yours, you better stay polite.
Y'know what I'm saying, brother?
Yeah, I think I do.
Nice!
Now, Snow here is gonna teach you how to say hello, 'cos it looks like your Mama never taught you that!
Okay, cool.
So, first you put one hand out like this.
That shows we think we're of equal strength.
Then, one flat across like this, which means strength ain't an issue.
What about something sharp?
Okay, try the button just beneath it.
What are you doing with that?
Nothing!
I found it on the ground.
- Give it to me!
- Okay.
Hey, what's this?
- Get lost.
- Okay.
What happened to your?
Find me that prisoner!
Come here.
Let's go!
Let's pretend we're tourists.
Yeah, right.
I feel more like a local.
There!
- No, this way!
- Okay.
You know how to drive this thing?
It can't be more difficult than flying a mosquito!
Great
- Let's try the other way.
- Yeah.
Sorry!
Hurry.
Arthur, hurry!
Good luck.
You know where you're going?
This is the basement of the house.
I saw the plans on Grandpa's desk.
So that's nice to know.
Now what are we going to do?
Give me a second to think!
- Time's up!
- Let's lose them one by one.
- What was that?
- A rat trap.
- What's a rat look like?
- Like that!
Faster!
- Are are you sure about this?
- No.
Okay.
Close your eyes.
One, two, three.
Home at last!
Not just yet.
Beta, any idea to get rid of these parasites?
Turn!
What was that?
The rat trap principle, but with a frog!
We're not losing them!
Can't you go any faster?
Speed isn't the problem.
It's the lights.
We need to lose the glow worms before we can lose the Unicorns!
Leave it to me!
Sorry, sorry.
- Arthur!
- I'm not watching!
Oh, great!
- Your turn.
- Okay.
Careful.
Hold on!
No, no.
Not me, please!
Sorry.
Great, Arthur, we did it!
Only trouble is flying without headlights!
Arthur!
I had this terrible nightmare!
I dreamt that Arthur was being chased by these giant insects.
Archie?
Oh, sweetheart!
What a surprise!
You're not asleep?
What's going on?
Where's Arthur?
He's... in the garden.
You let him go back?
Oh my God!
This really is a nightmare!
Daisy!
The Minimoys are in real danger and Arthur is the only one that can help.
I offered to go instead, but he refused.
He wanted me to stay and look after you.
He's an angel.
What about his parents?
Where are they?
Rose!
Armand!
What happened?
- Armand wanted to take a shortcut.
- We had an accident.
- We hit a goat.
- We hit a ram.
- No, it was a little goat.
- It was an animal.
Was the animal hurt?
The animal was fine!
My car is ruined!
Armand, it's just a car.
At least no one was hurt.
Yes, you're right.
There is something that bothers me, though...
- What?
- None of you asked where Arthur is.
At first, we thought he'd turned into a wolf, but actually, he's disappeared!
I'll let you take that one.
Rose, let's get you cleaned up.
- Can you fix this?
- Sure I can.
Armand, let's have a little talk.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Listen, I don't know where Arthur is exactly.
But he knows every inch of that land and he wouldn't have gotten lost.
I know I can be hard on him.
I'm just trying to protect him.
He's better prepared for survival than most young kids.
Well, I know he's clever and...
I trust him, but...
But?
He's still so... little!
Well, don't worry.
Tomorrow... he will be bigger!
Let's go find your car.
- Beta?
- Huh?
What?
Do you have any idea where we are?
A cocoon.
Right.
And how do we get out of a cocoon?
Don't worry, as soon it feels the sun, it'll wake up.
- And then?
- Then, it'll open up and we'll...
Fall out!
I hate being thrown out of bed like that, and you have to start the day without even a proper breakfast.
The house!
Yeah, but let's try getting back to mine, ok?
This is wonderful!
And absolutely impossible to steer!
It goes wherever it feels like, which is not my village!
How do we get off a butterfly?
We have two alternatives.
One, you wait for it to land.
And two, we... jump!
It's so sticky!
Take it easy!
Don't move around or you're gonna get even more stuck.
Beta!
Look.
Are you deaf or something?
I said take a chill pill!
Calm down!
Beta!
Behind you!
No sweat!
- That was amazing!
- It's nothing really.
When I was little, I worked on a spider farm.
They act so big and tough, but they're softer than dewdrops!
Come on.
Hop on!
Don't tell me you're scared of spiders!
Usually, no!
But I've never seen one so big!
Oh, don't worry.
It's only my wife.
She must have seen a spider.
Like every other morning.
In the bed!
It was huge and it was hairy!
And it was staring at me with big fat red eyes!
Calm down, honey!
You're the one with the red eyes.
Didn't you sleep well last night?
How am I supposed to get any sleep with all of these creepy-crawlies around?
- I'll just have a look.
- Careful...
- Hi.
- I called because...
You have called the Police Department.
Please hold the /ine.
I was riding along on my gamullus when this Unicorn patrol cut right in front of me from the left side.
I had the right of way.
That was when the village got worried about your disappearance and sent me a message asking for help?
No!
I left the village just that morning.
No one would have been worried about me til the nightime, at least.
In fact, they were all so excited about the banquet in your honor,
I don't think anyone even noticed I was gone.
That's the message I got.
So, if you weren't in danger, who is?
I don't know.
I think we're gonna find out.
Yes?
What do you want?
I want to get home.
Betameche?
The Prince?
The Palace?
Ring any bells?
Beta!
What are you doing outside?
I didn't even see you leave!
See that?
Nobody cares about me in this kingdom!
Here.
Thanks for the ride.
Now, go on, beat it!
Come mon.
Finally.
Home!
Lucky for you, Betameche, you weren't here!
- You missed a real drama!
- What kind of a drama?
The banquet was canceled!
Arthur never showed up.
Just think!
Your father was in such a state!
Forget about Selenia!
She really believed in him.
I know he's changed a lot since the last time I saw him, but...
- Arthur?
- It looks like him!
Holy bumblebee!
It's a miracle!
What?
Arthur's here?
Oh my Goodness!
Quick!
Come on, Mogoth!
Up we go!
Will you come on!
Now let's go, let's go.
My ceremonial robes!
Our guest has arrived!
Off we go!
What kinda time to arrive is this?
My buffet looks terrible now!
The flowers have all wilted and the dewdrops have almost evaporated!
Prosciutto, stop complaining!
All that matters is that Arthur is here, safe and sound!
Never mind the banquet, whip us up a quick little snack!
I don't do fast-food, sire!
I make the culinary masterpieces!
Fine!
Whip us up a culinary masterpiece!
You have 5 minutes!
Picolo?
Go see if the stores have anything edible.
Mamma mia!
- Pleased to see you, little fella!
- I'm pleased to see all of you, too!
- Yeah, we were worried!
- I'm sorry.
We prayed to the Goddess of the Forest for you.
Okay, that's enough.
Come mon, let's go!
Hi.
My boy!
What joy to see you again!
Arthur!
Here you are at last!
- Let me shake your hand!
- Miro, leave him alone!
My young friend!
What in heavens name happened to you?
Late yesterday, I received an SOS message carved on a grain of rice, so I thought you must be in danger.
A message?
On a grain of rice?
Now, that is a funny idea!
My young friend!
If you had read the great book more attentively, you would know that Minimoys only communicate by leaf!
I know, sir, but...
And there's a leaf for every occasion.
Oak leaves for the great laws.
Birch leaves for labor regulations.
Cabbage leaves for birth announcements.
And wild oat leaves for intimate correspondence.
- My father has a box full of...
- Enough, Betameche!
Quiet!
Had we wanted to send you a message of distress, we wouldn't have carved it on a grain of rice but on a pine needle.
Why, yes!
So much easier to carry!
But continue with your story.
I was about to use the telescope when a cloud passed across the Moon.
So, I had to use the creeper technique!
And I fell in on Max's bar.
Then I met Betameche, who had been captured by the Unicorns.
My son?
What did you do this time?
Refuse to yield the right of way.
I put that bracelet on your wrist so you'd know your right from your left.
I know!
I just keep forgetting which wrist you put it on.
Never mind.
What then?
After that we caught a spider all the way here.
Marvelous!
All's well that ends well!
Let the festivities begin!
Pressure!
Prosciutto?
Allow me to introduce you to the one-and-only Arthur...
Benvenuto.
It's wonderful!
I just knocked it off!
It looks pretty good but actually it tastes like...
Nothing!
Young Prince!
The honor is yours!
What would you like?
It's very kind of you, but, Sire, what I'd really like is to be able to share this occasion with the Princess.
Of course!
Silly me!
Selenia?
Daughter?
Where's she gone to now?
She was so disappointed that she locked herself in her room.
Miro?
Show him the way!
Thank you, Sire
Selenia doesn't live in the Palace?
Ever since she met you, emancipation has been the keyword!
The young lady insists on her independence!
That's the way it is with girls these days!
I have a surprise for you!
Where has she gone to now?
Maybe she sent me the message?
Maybe she's in danger somewhere?
No!
I saw her only a few hours ago.
Or maybe she simply forgot that I was coming to see her.
Selenia?
Forget you?
Now, that is funny!
Let me tell you how she spent the day preparing for your arrival after waiting for so many moons.
Yesterday morning, the Sun had barely caressed her face, she was already up!
As she does every morning, she washed, then gobbled down her breakfast of raspberry purée and fresh hazelnut.
After that, she hurried to her singing lesson.
- She wants to become a singer?
- No, not at all!
Selenia likes pretty words but won't allow them to escare her royal lips without total control.
If you want my opinion, she has something important to tell you and she doesn't want her voice to let her down.
I missed you so much!
The nightingale is acclaimed as the best singing teacher in the kingdom, but he's a mean old bird and Selenia had real trouble persuading him to give her a lesson.
In return, she had to give him the address of a publicity-shy craftsman who breeds worms in apples.
When she got back from her lesson, her throat was so sore,
I had to make her a violet infusion to soothe her vocal chords.
The pain soon went and she ended up falling asleep.
- And she slept through till evening?
- No, my boy!
Far from it!
She spent much of the day in the gym with Gambetto, her trainer.
Maestro Gambetto who is a scarabterus-philanthropis, a distant cousin of the praying mantis, even though he swears he's no relation to that particular maneater.
Selenia hardly ever takes class with him because his astonishing flexibility doesn't extend to his personality and his exercises are exceedingly difficult to follow.
But the Princess was determined to assert her control over every single one of her muscles.
- Then, she slept til evening?
- Yes, but when it was time to go to the Transit Hall to greet your arrival, believe me, she was ready!
How do I look?
Sublime!
I know.
She looked magnificent!
She had chosen the beautiful little dress made of rose petals that she picked herself and stitched together.
And she was wearing a delicious vanilla scent!
She reached the Transit Hall over an hour early.
Which the Ferryman didn't fail to bring to her attention.
Selenia!
What are you doing?
It's way too early!
Then she settled down comfortably to wait for her Prince Charming.
What time is it, my good Miro?
Well past midnight, sire.
I think we can safely conclude that Arthur won't be coming this time.
Unfortunately, her Prince never came.
Selenia was so sad that I couldn't find a single word to console her.
She stayed there without moving for many hours until, suddenly, she jumped up and left the village, headed for the great plains.
What for?
Probably to whisper her woes to the breeze so that it would carry them far away.
That's the whole story.
Or as much of it as I know.
So if it wasn't Selenia in danger, or Betameche or the village, who sent me the message?
I'm sure Selenia can help you figure that out.
Yes, if she ever comes back!
Selenia at the gate!
- Selenia?
- Lf you want, you can go on ahead.
Open the gate.
Malthazar!
Oh my goodness!
What a pleasure to see you again, young Arthur.
The pleasure isn't mutual.
I know, but don't hold it against me.
The necklace you wear around your neck is a reminder that we are all part of nature's great circle, my dear cousin.
Perhaps, between cousins, we can reach an agreement.
I'll give you my life in exchange for Selenia's.
- No!
- Silence!
Sorry, Arthur.
Not so long ago, your little swap might have tempted me, but I have better plans now.
I'm tired of your little world.
I want size.
I want scope.
I want big!
You sent the SOS message!
You knew I'd come and that I'd have to open the passage to do so.
Which would leave the path open for you to take the return trip and grow to your full size.
Bravo!
How perceptive of you!
If I had a hand free, I'd give you a round of applause.
I have never heard such a dastardly plot!
Thank you!
It wasn't easy and it took all of my genius to bring my plan to fruition.
After the bitter defeat Arthur inflicted upon me,
I wandered the lower levels for some time with one single idea in my mind.
I would find him and make him pay for his insolence.
The Bubble Smuggler had mentioned a good vantage point from which to observe the comings and goings of everybody in the house.
Smuggler was right.
It didn't take long for me to get to know the wonderful Daisy.
She initiated me into all the wonders of your world.
That fabulous box that manufactures cold and the smaller one that generates heat.
And all that food that she brought in from who knows where.
But the most amazing thing about her was her constant good humor.
She seemed to do everything with love, which is a foreign concept to me.
Even when she had all of her tools of torture lined up on the counter, it was just to transform vulgar vegetables into works of art.
It was a fascinating spectacle and I could sit for hours just watching her.
And then I encountered your mother.
I have never met a specimen so unadapted to her environment!
Mom?
Fortunately, your Grandfather, the gallant Archibald, was always around to keep things ticking over.
I was able to watch him repair the machine that made fire, the one that made sun
and the one that made water.
My desire for conquest was reignited.
The warrior that I am had regained his appetite.
Nothing and no one could stop me now!
Not even your father and his ridiculous offensives.
I am so rotten inside that only effect his spray had was to rid me of a few parasites.
But your father did reveal to me my only weakness in this world...
My size!
And this is where you come in!
All I had to do was be patient and wait for the day you'd visit the Minimoys, so I could take the lightbeam back, as you so shrewedly pointed out.
Finding out the date was not difficult because the kitchen was not only the nerve center which everybody visited at some point, but it was also the perfect spot to listen in on conversations upstairs.
These are the eternal codes of the nature.
I was accepted into the great circle and tonight there's a big party!
- That's nice, dear!
- Yeah!
It's the tenth moon.
The Minimoys are preparing a feast in my honor.
Everything was going smoothly.
All I had to do was to wait for your departure.
And then, suddenly, it was all catastrophe.
Honey, pack your bags.
We're leaving tonight!
This last minute twist threatened to ruin my plot!
The idea of vegetating for another ten moons in this cabinet was unbearable.
I had to find a ploy to make Arthur disobey his father.
And what better than love to make a young man do something silly?
How could Arthur possibly resist a call to save his Princess from mortal danger?
So I found something to write on and carved the message into it myself.
This is absurd!
Everybody knows that the Minimoys write their messages on leaves!
And only a pine needle would have been appropriate in this case.
My apologies, but there weren't any pine needles in my cabinet.
All that was left was to win over a messenger and point him to your room for personal delivery.
Then, I returned to the seven kingdoms through secret passages that I alone am aware of, and I had the good fortune to encounter the charming Princess wandering the plains like a lost soul.
Now you know the full story, let me tell you what happens next.
What time is it, my good Miro?
Five to noon.
High time for us to head to the Transit Hall to say farewell!
Wait!
What is it now?
I wish to make the trip through the telescope.
Another one?
You people just can't stay in one place!
After me, you can rest in peace.
Say, aren't you little Maltazard?
It's been many moons since I last saw you!
You've grown!
Yes, and I'm going to grow some more!
What's the big deal about growing!
You'd be better off getting some sleep!
Have you seen yourself in a mirror lately?
Hold your tongue, you old fool!
Or your sleep will be eternal!
Yes, sir!
A quarter turn to the right for the body...
Distract him, I have an idea.
Give me something I can throw at him.
Okay.
Too small.
Too big.
Three quarter turns to the left for the mind...
Too cute!
- Beta, hurry!
- I'm coming!
Excuse me, Sir?
You know you're heading for the humans world but having Selenia under your feet will only slow you down.
Don't worry, I have no intention of taking the little pest with me.
I'll find plenty more up there who'll be delighted to serve me.
And one whole turn for the soul!
Amazing!
I didn't touch anything.
I was just looking.
Is that your telescope?
- Yes.
- Really?
Cause in your telescope there's little... with big...
Those are the Minimoys.
- The Mini what?
- The Minimoys.
They're our brothers.
Oh, your brothers.
Really?
How tall was your mother?
- Our mother is nature.
- Your mother is nature.
Right.
Well, that would explain why you're... and they're...
That must be the mechanic.
I'll be right back.
In position!
If his Highness would care to lift off...
With pleasure!
- Beta!
Quick!
- I'm coming!
Be still, be still!
- Now!
- Here.
Did you hear that noise?
- That's your transmission.
- No, it came from the forest.
So I figure this'll take me about a week.
I have to get my boy back to school, and I have to find a job.
Well, I could put a rush on it for ya, but it'll cost ya.
I need it tomorrow.
I'll pay you whatever you want.
- Whatever I want?
- Whatever you want.
You got a deal.
My Prince!
You saved my life again!
That's what Princes are for.
- What happened?
Where's Arthur?
- I don't know.
Something shot out of the telescope, like a cannonball, but I don't think it was Arthur.
It landed somewhere in the forest.
If it wasn't Arthur, what is it?
M... the evil M.
The only rock around for miles and I hit it?
You're not going to eat me, are you?
Yes.
The first law of nature.
Eat or be eaten.
The Evil M. Knew that if he sent an SOS message to Arthur, the boy would do everything to come to the aid of his friends and once the passage was open, it was easy to come the other way.
- Now, he's out there somewhere.
- What about Arthur?
Where is he?
He'll probably show up soon.
Oh my God!
The passage is broken.
Marshmallows!
Arthur, come on, I know you're hiding here somewhere.
Come on, don't hide!
Daddy's worried.
Arthur, I'm not angry with you!
I promise.
You won't be punished.
Thank god I found you.
If you come out now, you'll get a big bag of marshmallows all to yourself.
What do you say?
A plump pack of sweet, juicy marshmallows that melt in your mouth.
I know where you are, come on out, now!
Who are these delicious marshmallows for?
For me.
I'll go get a full bag.
How will Arthur escape Maltazard's diabolical trap?

Arthur and the War of Two Worlds.

The Sun!
Wake Up!
Come on, come on, let's go!
Hurry, come on.
Over here!
This way!
Okay, go, go, go!
Jump, very fast!
Hello!
There.
Okay, let's go.
More, more, stop!
Alright, move it out!
Grapes, berries...
Nuts, I don't have any nuts.
Nuts!
Yes!
Let's look at this one here.
Quick, the Sun is coming!
Calm down, boy.
The sun will have to wait.
The radial and the meridian lines cross and intersect at the point of force, which is... right here!
Amazing!
Aspetta!
Ma, what do you call that?
I want fresh fruit!
Barely kissed by da morning dew!
I'm not making jello here!
It's for zee gala dinner!
Da Royal Full Moon Dinner!
I wanna da best, da best, da best!
Capisce?
Yes, the best!
Sorry, chef.
Give dat to da ants!
Ma che fai?
Hide da pistils before a bee sees them!
Mamma mia!
Move it, everybody out!
Everybody out!
Get up there, hurry!
Okay, here we go.
Get ready
Twenty degrees, right.
Fire!
Twenty degrees, left.
We're losing too much time.
Andiamo!
Not that way!
God rest your soul.
I got you, you little flying nuisance.
Not quite so buzzy-buzzy now, are you?
Honey, it worked!
My honey trap worked!
Check this out!
Where are you?
I can't see you, honey.
Over here!
I'm here!
Is the dog okay?
Did he get stung?
No, you stepped on his tail.
He'll live.
Check this out.
Look at its furry little legs and that ugly bug-eyed head.
- You scared me!
- Me?
You look like an alien.
Will you take that ridiculous mask off?
The bee can't sting you now.
I have everything under control.
Poor little thing!
It must be suffocating in there, without any air!
Right!
I'll put it out of its misery.
Get the spray.
Nature feeds you every day.
One day, you will feed nature.
I've grown, but I'm still a lot smaller than you.
Today is a great day because it marks the end of your initiation.
First, you passed the tree test.
You overcame the boredom of the first few hours.
You managed to open up your senses one by one, and then your heart, until you were able to hear the tree's heartbeat.
You heard it breathe.
You heard it laugh.
You became one with the tree.
You even fooled the bird.
The second test was harder, for you had to gain the acceptance of the mineral world.
Once more, patience was the mother of wisdom.
You persevered until the stone revealed its memory to you, which is vast for it has been on Earth since the dawn of time.
That rock saw the birth of mankind.
It saw humanity grow from a worm and begin to crawl.
The third and final test was the most important because it meant reconnecting with the animal kingdom.
Learning simple actions.
Vital actions.
Actions that unite all these families, who are so different, but who have shared the same home since the dawn of time.
You passed the tests.
You are like the Moon, full and whole, bright and bold.
You are reconciled with nature.
Protect her and she will protect you.
I will.
I think he's trying to tell you something.
I think you're right!
Got it!
See?
There's one left!
- I didn't see it.
- Honey.
You know I like animals and... insects.
It breaks my heart to kill this bee.
But you heard the Doc!
Arthur is allergic to bees.
The teensiest little sting could be fatal.
Do you want me to risk our little angel being stung?
No.
My baby!
I love him so much!
Believe me, this gives me no pleasure, but it's the only way.
It's the bee or Arthur.
Don't worry, little friend.
I'll get you out.
I'm sorry about this.
I'll make sure it never happens again.
Go, go!
Come on, hurry.
Look alive!
Let's go.
No, no, you first.
Go ahead!
Lift up the glass!
It's gone.
The bee disappeared.
Unless this one's called Houdini, it's not about to get out of that glass.
Armand, I swear!
Come look for yourself!
It's gone!
I don't believe it!
How did it do that?
Well...
They say that honey gives you energy.
Maybe the bee ate so much that it raised the glass and...
Rose, please.
If I ate a ton of honey, do you think I could lift the house over my head?
There has to be a logical explanation.
Maybe there's a hole in the glass...
No.
Or maybe he had outside help.
Fingerprints...
Bullseye!
- Hello, angel!
- Hi, Granny!
Somebody needs a bath.
Make that two somebodies.
What have you two been doing?
I was being decorated by the Bogo-Matassalai.
I can see that!
Looks like I have some laundry to do!
- Will you help Grandpa?
- Yes, Ma'am.
Well?
How did it go?
Arthur, I am so proud of you.
You truly are my grandson.
Heart to heart, and soul to soul.
- You passed the tests too?
- Well, that was a long time ago.
I was already a grown man.
Being initiated at such a young age is quite a feat!
Thanks, Grandpa.
- So did you hug a tree?
- For 8 hours!
A red bunting thought I was part of the tree.
It was so cool!
Wonderful!
And which stones did you choose?
The granite boulders near the little lake!
Excellent choice.
And did you find the beaver's hut to take a nap in?
No, I couldn't find a beaver, so I picked a bear.
A bear?
You slept with a bear?
That deserves a real reward!
- It's the Presidential car.
- It's beautiful!
Well, what are you waiting for?
Go try it out!
A bear!
- Hi, Honey!
- Hi, Mom.
How much longer do I have to lie here with this compress on my head?
Another 5 minutes, honey.
That's what it says on the box!
Relax!
Oh, God.
How can I relax with these burns on my face?
At least you know the spray works!
I'm going to Mrs. Kerman's store and buying her entire stock.
As soon as I'm back on my feet, I'll take care of every creepy-crawly for miles around!
Go away!
It's dangerous for you here!
What did you say?
Nothing, honey!
I was just thinking out loud.
About...
About that bee!
It must be awfully smart to escape from your trap.
Smart?
I don't think so!
Their brains are the size of a pin head, they're lighter than a feather.
And you expect them to be able to think?
The human brain weighs over two pounds.
Think about it!
It takes one heck of a brain to invent... the telephone, for example, or the television.
Even if we don't have one!
And the automobile!
Did a spider invent the automobile?
Did bees paint the Sixtine Chapel?
Did mosquitoes sculpt Rodin's Thinker?
I think not!
And poetry and music?
You think any beetle ever wrote music?
No, of course not!
Not to mention architecture!
The Empire State Building...
The Golden Gate Bridge!
You think a bunch of ants could build a bridge?
First class passengers...
All aboard!
Platform number one!
The train is about to depart!
Stand clear, please!
Hey, Mom.
What's up?
- You tell me.
- Nothing.
- Just playing.
- Really?
- Grandpa gave me a new train.
- Let me see!
- What are you doing?
- Checking for illegal immigrants.
Like I have something to hide!
I know you let the bee go free.
You're allergic to it, remember?
I know, Mom, but if you were caught in a trap like that, I'd rescue you.
That's very sweet of you, honey.
But that bee stung your father.
- A sting won't kill him.
- Hopefully not.
Come mon.
Time to take a shower.
Bright as a new penny.
Don't go rolling in the dirt now.
Got you now.
You think honey is sweet?
Have you ever tasted revenge?
Just right.
You scared me!
Could you move to one side a little?
You're in the line of fire.
This tree is 200 years old.
It saw your grandfather come into the world.
If it offers refuge to a beehive, it must have its reasons for doing so.
I'm sorry, but there isn't a tree in the world that has authority over me.
I own this tree.
It's on my land.
So get out of my way.
My land.
My tree.
My rock.
No.
That is my rock.
Your rock...
Well...
Maybe so.
But those bees have it coming to them.
I will be back.
Look at that!
You still have paint on your face.
I don't want you to playing any more war games.
War isn't nice.
It's not warpaint, Mom.
These are the eternal codes of nature.
I was accepted into the great circle today.
Tonight there's a big party.
That's nice, dear.
It's the tenth moon.
The Minimoys are preparing a feast in my honor.
The Mini...
Mini what?
The Minimoys.
They'll all be there and I'll get to see Selenia again.
Where exactly is this party?
In the garden.
As long as you stay in the garden, you can go wherever you want.
Good.
Fire department, please.
You scared me!
- Have you looked in the mirror lately?
- I got stung by a bee!
He must be using steroids.
You look like you've been stung 100 times.
It got me once.
In the rear.
Call you back.
My face...
That was your daughter with the spray.
- Is the bee still alive?
- Unfortunately, yes.
It escaped death this once.
But not for long.
I found the hive in the forest.
My dear Armand, even though my home is your home, it is still my home.
And when I say my home, I mean this house and the magnificient gardens.
That includes the trees and plants that are kind enough to grow here, and all the animals and insects that honor us with their presence.
Including the bees.
Okay.
And one more thing, Arthur.
Who is this Selenia?
- She's a princess.
- Really?
What's this princess like?
She's brave, she's smart and she's never scared.
Except of water.
What does she look like?
She has brown eyes and red hair, like a setting sun.
And when she smiles... she looks like... an angel.
Any chance you might have a teensy weensy crush on her?
No, Mom, don't be silly.
She's way too old for me.
She's over a thousand years old!
Oh, God, you're right!
That is too old for you!
I don't think you should see anyone over five hundred!
Honey, pack your bags, we're leaving tonight.
But, Dad!
We're supposed to be leaving tomorrow.
Change of plans.
It will be easier tonight.
Less traffic.
And cooler.
We can't leave tonight!
- Oh, and why's that?
- Because...
Because it's the tenth moon!
And what happens on the tenth moon?
You turn into a werewolf?
Do not say things like that!
You know how superstitious I am!
God!
Arthur, you've been gazing at the moon for the past two months.
It's time you come down to Earth.
If my maths are as good as yours, you're starting school in two days.
Mom, please!
I'll do whatever you want for the whole year.
I'll be the best son in the whole wide world.
I've been waiting for this moment for months.
I can't leave now.
Just a few hours!
A few minutes.
I have to see her.
Honey!
Armand, honey?
It is a bit rushed.
Besides, it would be rude to leave now.
My mother spent all day cooking our dinner.
And my father...
Don't get me started on your father!
He thinks...
He thinks his precious garden is more important than his grandson's life!
Arthur, come on!
Get dressed and pack your bags.
I'll be waiting in the car.
I'm sorry.
I packed it all up for you.
You just have to heat it up in the oven.
- And some fresh eggs.
- Thank you.
I'm sorry, Mom.
You know how Armand is.
He's always in a rush.
- I know.
Can I get you anything else?
- Yes.
A handkerchief, maybe?
Of course.
Here you go
I'll miss you too, Alfred.
I'll be back at Christmas.
If there's snow we can play Eskimos.
You can be White Fang!
How about it?
Alfred?
I can't play with you right now.
Don't you understand?
I'm leaving!
What is it?
What do you see?
Is that why you were barking?
It's just a spider... that's carrying something?
Thanks.
A grain of rice... with some sort of inscription on it.
Oh my God.
Grandpa!
I've received a message.
The Minimoys are in danger!
Calm down, Arthur!
What message?
Here, on this grain of rice!
A spider gave it to me.
Usually, the Minimoys send messages on leaves they drop from trees.
I know, but...
Read it, Grandpa!
Please!
Sorry, yes, of course...
Hurry up, son!
It's late and we have a long drive ahead of us.
I was just...
saying goodbye to Grandpa.
Sure.
The message on the grain of rice reads...
"Help!"
Are you sure?
Positive.
But I can't do anything.
Only you can save them now!
That won't be very easy.
But I'll see what I can do.
Okay, Arthur, I think that's enough good-byes, don't you?
Let's see if we can make it back faster than we came.
Take it easy.
Leave him.
He'll be back.
He's scared of the dark.
It's not the dog I'm worried about.
You see?
Arthur was right!
That boy has an overdeveloped imagination.
He'd do anything to see his Princess, even if it means making up a story about a message on a grain of rice.
Wasn't it you who told me that Minimoys only communicate by leaves?
Yes, but this is an emergency.
They had to find something smaller so a spider could carry it.
You two make a fine pair!
Remind me again, which one of you is 12 years old?
Daisy!
This is no laughing matter.
Maybe the Minimoys are in real danger!
And I can't just sit around twiddling my thumbs.
I have to help them!
The Minimoys are thousands of years old.
They have survived countless catastrophes.
I'm not a thousand years old.
I'm not gonna live forever.
And I don't want to lose you again.
Did you hear that?
Shit!
It's gonna pour!
I think we should stop at a gas station.
We should stay ahead of the storm.
I need to stop!
I don't have any bags left in case Arthur doesn't feel well.
Oh, alright.
I see.
I'll pull over.
Five minutes, okay?
No more.
Might as well check the oil.
I need to use your bathroom, thank you.
It's alright, we don't need any gas, thank you!
It feels good to have everything under control again.
You've just saved my life and I'll be eternally grateful!
Everything alright, Rose?
Good.
I feel much better.
Look at that!
He fell asleep.
Good, it won't seem such a long drive for him then!
Oh my God!
Arthur was right.
Arthur?
What are you doing here?
Did you have an accident?
- I ran away!
- You ran away?
You can't do that!
Where are your parents?
Where's anybody?
There's not a minute to lose!
The Bogos are ready.
- I need the telescope.
- The telescope?
The telescope, of course!
Three quarter-turns to the left for the body.
Three quarter-turns to the right for the mind.
And one whole turn for the soul.
Not now!
Please.
I don't believe it!
Arthur, I'm so sorry, but the sky has decided.
Now the Minimoys will have to deal with this on their own.
Do you think they'd call for help if they could handle it on their own?
They're in huge danger, Grandpa!
They need us!
Is the lightbeam the only way to join them?
Is there any another way?
You know, for emergencies?
- There are the vines...
- Perfect!
What do I have to do?
Arthur, the vines are a terribly dangerous way of passing through.
It's the method our ancestors used before the telescope was invented.
A lot of them died trying it.
If something happens to Selenia, I'll die anyway!
Of a broken heart!
I have to find a way to make it through!
I'm their only hope!
I know, Arthur, but you're still such a young boy.
Look!
Have faith in me, Grandpa.
I'll make it back.
I'm ready.
Once you're in the vines, there's no going back.
You'll have to see it through, however painful it gets.
Don't worry about me.
Look after Grandma.
I will.
Nature belongs to you, you belong to nature.
Now!
Pull!
And pull!
Hurry, harder!
Again!
- Please, stop!
- We can't stop now!
Granpa!
Stop!
Pull harder!
Again, harder!
It hurts!
Pull harder!
Pull!
We have to get all the water out of his body!
And pull again!
Harder!
We're almost there!
Pull again!
Stop!
Did he make it?
Yes, I think so.
It's up to him now.
How will he make it back?
Tomorrow the light beam will open the passage back this way.
- He must not miss it.
- And if he does?
If he does, he will have to wait ten moons.
Rose!
What's the matter?
What are you screaming about?
There!
Look!
Arthur!
He turned into a wolf.
You see?
I told you not to joke about that!
Rose, it's Alfred!
Of course.
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have told you all those werewolf stories.
I feel so silly now.
Thinking Arthur could turn into a...
Oh my God!
That was some fall!
Hi.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.
Please, wait!
Who have we got here?
The little prince got itchy feet again?
You shoulda called ahead, I'd have put you on the list.
That way, you coulda came in through the door!
Jack!
Fill 'em up.
This one's on me!
Hi, Jack.
Cheers!
Here's to your dazzling return!
Max, I don't have time for drinks.
I received a message.
The Minimoys are in danger.
Tell me something I don't know.
Life ain't easy when you're 2 mm tall.
Life isn't easy when you're 5 foot tall, believe me.
So, let's drink to now and may it last forever and ever!
I have to get to the Minimoy's village as fast as I can, and I need your help!
Can't you just come into my club, kick back, chill out, have a drink and shake your booty like everybody else?
Max!
Selenia is in danger!
Please!
Help me!
Lordy Lord!
You and your princess!
C'mon, follow me!
There have been big changes round here since you left.
There's a new head honcho.
His name's Kröb.
He's such a nasty piece of work, he makes people nostalgic for Maltazard.
Sometimes.
Maybe he's threatening the village?
And that's why the Minimoys called me.
I don't think so.
Kröb's a woodlouse!
He's a couch potato, he never leaves his hole!
He has an army of unicorns working for him, keeping everything tight.
What do you mean?
The seventh kingdom is locked down, dude.
It's a full-on ghetto.
Nobody gets in or out without his permission.
I don't have time for bureaucracy.
We'll have to find another way.
Chill, cuz.
First, we'll head into town, find out what's going down.
If the Minimoys are in any kind of danger, we'll soon know.
But in town they won't stop us?
The unicorns are everywhere but they leave us alone.
- How come?
- The Koolomassai put on all the shows and keep the whole place going.
Ain't no business like show business!
- That's wassup.
- Cool!
Wassup?
- I shouldn't have been tough on him.
- You were just trying to protect him.
Honey, slow down.
I don't feel too good.
I should have listened to him, taken his feelings into account.
- I feel nauseous.
Honey, slow down.
- We have to get back there fast!
Weird things can happen when there's a full moon.
My little boy!
I love him so much!
You know how much I love him, don't you?
Of course, honey.
But slow down or we're going to have an accident.
An accident?
Oh my gosh.
If anything were to happen to him, I'd never forgive myself!
What are they doing out so late?
They should be asleep!
- Honey, hit the brakes.
- What?
Hit the brakes!
He's not budging!
So sorry!
I was going too fast.
It's all my fault.
Sorry.
See?
I told you!
Yo, man.
Yeah, nice.
My hood.
Hi.
Cool out.
We're safe now.
I'm the king here!
- All you gotta do is look chill.
- How come?
Best way not to get noticed round here is to make sure everybody notices you.
- That's a weird concept.
- Sure!
We call it cruising.
Go slow, arm out the window, look like you're miles away and just laugh.
Okay.
What are you laughing at?
That's not the point.
So long as everybody thinks they missed the joke.
- Dig?
- Not really.
Well, check this!
- What's he laughing at?
- Dunno.
- Anybody get the joke?
- No.
Bummer!
You, try!
What's he laughing at?
I got something on my face?
Let's see... you got a big horn right in the middle of your forehead.
Idiots!
I never thought so much was going on right under the house.
Last year it was just a backwater for retired beetles.
And then there was the great harvest and everybody got stupid rich.
So the Koolomassai opened a couple of bars to attract some artsy types and a smooth operator started a glow-worm business.
In nothin' flat, this sleazy hole became a city of lights open 24/7, where you can find anything you need.
I love this town!
Let's roll.
- What can we do for you?
- Well, I actually...
Some advice, perhaps?
To tell the truth...
I can read your future in the lines of your hand.
- Tell me what you want to hear.
- I don't know...
Beat it, all of you!
Don't listen to this bunch of phonies and roaches!
I am not a roach!
I'm a weather mantis and I can predict the temperature to the nearest degree.
We got to find my cousin, Replay.
He's the only guy I totally trust.
Replay!
Hey, buddy, you dropped your wallet.
No, thank me!
But you better be careful round here because...
- Hey, cuz!
- Hey!
Guys, can we cut it short?
- Your chandelier got all broke up.
- I know.
I know a silkworm who'll fix it for you in 24 hours.
I know.
That little guy to your left, that's Arthur, king of the 1st kingdom.
I know.
You know he got decorated this morning?
How 'bout you tell me something I don't know?
You name it.
Who?
What?
Where?
When?
Why?
- I got it all.
Who's dating who even.
- Tell me about the 1st kingdom.
- What's going down?
You heard anything?
- Nothing to report.
I received a message from the Minimoys saying they were in danger.
Do you know anything about it?
Now that you mention it, I did hear something.
I heard that a major personality with links to the Palace was in trouble.
Trouble?
What kind of trouble?
At the Palace?
The Princess?
More like the young Prince.
- Betameche?
- Affirmative.
Betameche is in trouble?
What happened?
- I'm out of cash.
I'll owe it to you.
- No, no.
No cash, no juice.
Give me the juice, or I'll put the word out you wear a wig!
Max!
Please!
Don't do that!
People'll be so busy laughing, I won't get the juice no more.
Okay.
So tell me everything you know.
Betameche was arrested by the unicorns for some reason.
The way they're headed, looks like they're taking him to Kröb's palace.
The way they're headed?
You crook!
You made me pay for somethin' you seen behind me!
I'll take care of him.
Max, let's take care of Betameche first!
Create a diversion and I'll try to free him.
Wait, wait.
Create a diversion?
Bracelets, bracelets!
Pretty wormy bracelets, ladies!
- Hey!
Snow!
- What?
- Whaddup!
My man!
- Hey, Max!
How's tricks?
Hey, cuz!
Long time no see!
I know, right?
You look good.
Thank you.
- You take 'em?
- No, thank you.
Glasses!
Everybody needs glasses!
- And your sister?
Where's she at now?
- She's pregnant way up to here!
- Again?
- Sure, it'll be her 20th!
No kidding!
You know, I don't think I ever saw your sister... un-pregnant!
Hey, you two!
Break it up!
Get out of the street!
- And your Mom?
- She doing good, she's at home.
- Beta!
- Arthur?
Hey, you.
Hayfever.
Makes me sneeze.
Arthur, hurry.
It's locked.
Use my knife.
Careful, careful.
Okay, now hit the second button to the left of the big one.
Very pretty, but this isn't the time or the place.
Sorry.
Perfect!
Now put them to work on the creeper.
Hey, how about you?
How's your brother doing?
Oh, he cool, he out there doing that blueberry thing.
Man, he makin' a whole lotta money, too.
It's beautiful, man.
Break it up!
Get out of the street, go take your hellos somewhere else!
You're new round here, ain't ya?
Yeah.
That's right.
You know, when you tip into someplace new, you gotta invest.
Gotta take time and know wassup.
Also, you dig?
Hey, I'm in Kröb's army.
I don't have to know what's up!
You dig?
I know that, but out here you're far away from your little hole.
This is our hood.
So, if you're attached to that horn of yours, you better stay polite.
Y'know what I'm saying, brother?
Yeah, I think I do.
Nice!
Now, Snow here is gonna teach you how to say hello, 'cos it looks like your Mama never taught you that!
Okay, cool.
So, first you put one hand out like this.
That shows we think we're of equal strength.
Then, one flat across like this, which means strength ain't an issue.
What about something sharp?
Okay, try the button just beneath it.
What are you doing with that?
Nothing!
I found it on the ground.
- Give it to me!
- Okay.
Hey, what's this?
- Get lost.
- Okay.
What happened to your?
Find me that prisoner!
Come here.
Let's go!
Let's pretend we're tourists.
Yeah, right.
I feel more like a local.
There!
- No, this way!
- Okay.
You know how to drive this thing?
It can't be more difficult than flying a mosquito!
Great
- Let's try the other way.
- Yeah.
Sorry!
Hurry.
Arthur, hurry!
Good luck.
You know where you're going?
This is the basement of the house.
I saw the plans on Grandpa's desk.
So that's nice to know.
Now what are we going to do?
Give me a second to think!
- Time's up!
- Let's lose them one by one.
- What was that?
- A rat trap.
- What's a rat look like?
- Like that!
Faster!
- Are are you sure about this?
- No.
Okay.
Close your eyes.
One, two, three.
Home at last!
Not just yet.
Beta, any idea to get rid of these parasites?
Turn!
What was that?
The rat trap principle, but with a frog!
We're not losing them!
Can't you go any faster?
Speed isn't the problem.
It's the lights.
We need to lose the glow worms before we can lose the Unicorns!
Leave it to me!
Sorry, sorry.
- Arthur!
- I'm not watching!
Oh, great!
- Your turn.
- Okay.
Careful.
Hold on!
No, no.
Not me, please!
Sorry.
Great, Arthur, we did it!
Only trouble is flying without headlights!
Arthur!
I had this terrible nightmare!
I dreamt that Arthur was being chased by these giant insects.
Archie?
Oh, sweetheart!
What a surprise!
You're not asleep?
What's going on?
Where's Arthur?
He's... in the garden.
You let him go back?
Oh my God!
This really is a nightmare!
Daisy!
The Minimoys are in real danger and Arthur is the only one that can help.
I offered to go instead, but he refused.
He wanted me to stay and look after you.
He's an angel.
What about his parents?
Where are they?
Rose!
Armand!
What happened?
- Armand wanted to take a shortcut.
- We had an accident.
- We hit a goat.
- We hit a ram.
- No, it was a little goat.
- It was an animal.
Was the animal hurt?
The animal was fine!
My car is ruined!
Armand, it's just a car.
At least no one was hurt.
Yes, you're right.
There is something that bothers me, though...
- What?
- None of you asked where Arthur is.
At first, we thought he'd turned into a wolf, but actually, he's disappeared!
I'll let you take that one.
Rose, let's get you cleaned up.
- Can you fix this?
- Sure I can.
Armand, let's have a little talk.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Listen, I don't know where Arthur is exactly.
But he knows every inch of that land and he wouldn't have gotten lost.
I know I can be hard on him.
I'm just trying to protect him.
He's better prepared for survival than most young kids.
Well, I know he's clever and...
I trust him, but...
But?
He's still so... little!
Well, don't worry.
Tomorrow... he will be bigger!
Let's go find your car.
- Beta?
- Huh?
What?
Do you have any idea where we are?
A cocoon.
Right.
And how do we get out of a cocoon?
Don't worry, as soon it feels the sun, it'll wake up.
- And then?
- Then, it'll open up and we'll...
Fall out!
I hate being thrown out of bed like that, and you have to start the day without even a proper breakfast.
The house!
Yeah, but let's try getting back to mine, ok?
This is wonderful!
And absolutely impossible to steer!
It goes wherever it feels like, which is not my village!
How do we get off a butterfly?
We have two alternatives.
One, you wait for it to land.
And two, we... jump!
It's so sticky!
Take it easy!
Don't move around or you're gonna get even more stuck.
Beta!
Look.
Are you deaf or something?
I said take a chill pill!
Calm down!
Beta!
Behind you!
No sweat!
- That was amazing!
- It's nothing really.
When I was little, I worked on a spider farm.
They act so big and tough, but they're softer than dewdrops!
Come on.
Hop on!
Don't tell me you're scared of spiders!
Usually, no!
But I've never seen one so big!
Oh, don't worry.
It's only my wife.
She must have seen a spider.
Like every other morning.
In the bed!
It was huge and it was hairy!
And it was staring at me with big fat red eyes!
Calm down, honey!
You're the one with the red eyes.
Didn't you sleep well last night?
How am I supposed to get any sleep with all of these creepy-crawlies around?
- I'll just have a look.
- Careful...
- Hi.
- I called because...
You have called the Police Department.
Please hold the /ine.
I was riding along on my gamullus when this Unicorn patrol cut right in front of me from the left side.
I had the right of way.
That was when the village got worried about your disappearance and sent me a message asking for help?
No!
I left the village just that morning.
No one would have been worried about me til the nightime, at least.
In fact, they were all so excited about the banquet in your honor,
I don't think anyone even noticed I was gone.
That's the message I got.
So, if you weren't in danger, who is?
I don't know.
I think we're gonna find out.
Yes?
What do you want?
I want to get home.
Betameche?
The Prince?
The Palace?
Ring any bells?
Beta!
What are you doing outside?
I didn't even see you leave!
See that?
Nobody cares about me in this kingdom!
Here.
Thanks for the ride.
Now, go on, beat it!
Come mon.
Finally.
Home!
Lucky for you, Betameche, you weren't here!
- You missed a real drama!
- What kind of a drama?
The banquet was canceled!
Arthur never showed up.
Just think!
Your father was in such a state!
Forget about Selenia!
She really believed in him.
I know he's changed a lot since the last time I saw him, but...
- Arthur?
- It looks like him!
Holy bumblebee!
It's a miracle!
What?
Arthur's here?
Oh my Goodness!
Quick!
Come on, Mogoth!
Up we go!
Will you come on!
Now let's go, let's go.
My ceremonial robes!
Our guest has arrived!
Off we go!
What kinda time to arrive is this?
My buffet looks terrible now!
The flowers have all wilted and the dewdrops have almost evaporated!
Prosciutto, stop complaining!
All that matters is that Arthur is here, safe and sound!
Never mind the banquet, whip us up a quick little snack!
I don't do fast-food, sire!
I make the culinary masterpieces!
Fine!
Whip us up a culinary masterpiece!
You have 5 minutes!
Picolo?
Go see if the stores have anything edible.
Mamma mia!
- Pleased to see you, little fella!
- I'm pleased to see all of you, too!
- Yeah, we were worried!
- I'm sorry.
We prayed to the Goddess of the Forest for you.
Okay, that's enough.
Come mon, let's go!
Hi.
My boy!
What joy to see you again!
Arthur!
Here you are at last!
- Let me shake your hand!
- Miro, leave him alone!
My young friend!
What in heavens name happened to you?
Late yesterday, I received an SOS message carved on a grain of rice, so I thought you must be in danger.
A message?
On a grain of rice?
Now, that is a funny idea!
My young friend!
If you had read the great book more attentively, you would know that Minimoys only communicate by leaf!
I know, sir, but...
And there's a leaf for every occasion.
Oak leaves for the great laws.
Birch leaves for labor regulations.
Cabbage leaves for birth announcements.
And wild oat leaves for intimate correspondence.
- My father has a box full of...
- Enough, Betameche!
Quiet!
Had we wanted to send you a message of distress, we wouldn't have carved it on a grain of rice but on a pine needle.
Why, yes!
So much easier to carry!
But continue with your story.
I was about to use the telescope when a cloud passed across the Moon.
So, I had to use the creeper technique!
And I fell in on Max's bar.
Then I met Betameche, who had been captured by the Unicorns.
My son?
What did you do this time?
Refuse to yield the right of way.
I put that bracelet on your wrist so you'd know your right from your left.
I know!
I just keep forgetting which wrist you put it on.
Never mind.
What then?
After that we caught a spider all the way here.
Marvelous!
All's well that ends well!
Let the festivities begin!
Pressure!
Prosciutto?
Allow me to introduce you to the one-and-only Arthur...
Benvenuto.
It's wonderful!
I just knocked it off!
It looks pretty good but actually it tastes like...
Nothing!
Young Prince!
The honor is yours!
What would you like?
It's very kind of you, but, Sire, what I'd really like is to be able to share this occasion with the Princess.
Of course!
Silly me!
Selenia?
Daughter?
Where's she gone to now?
She was so disappointed that she locked herself in her room.
Miro?
Show him the way!
Thank you, Sire
Selenia doesn't live in the Palace?
Ever since she met you, emancipation has been the keyword!
The young lady insists on her independence!
That's the way it is with girls these days!
I have a surprise for you!
Where has she gone to now?
Maybe she sent me the message?
Maybe she's in danger somewhere?
No!
I saw her only a few hours ago.
Or maybe she simply forgot that I was coming to see her.
Selenia?
Forget you?
Now, that is funny!
Let me tell you how she spent the day preparing for your arrival after waiting for so many moons.
Yesterday morning, the Sun had barely caressed her face, she was already up!
As she does every morning, she washed, then gobbled down her breakfast of raspberry purée and fresh hazelnut.
After that, she hurried to her singing lesson.
- She wants to become a singer?
- No, not at all!
Selenia likes pretty words but won't allow them to escare her royal lips without total control.
If you want my opinion, she has something important to tell you and she doesn't want her voice to let her down.
I missed you so much!
The nightingale is acclaimed as the best singing teacher in the kingdom, but he's a mean old bird and Selenia had real trouble persuading him to give her a lesson.
In return, she had to give him the address of a publicity-shy craftsman who breeds worms in apples.
When she got back from her lesson, her throat was so sore,
I had to make her a violet infusion to soothe her vocal chords.
The pain soon went and she ended up falling asleep.
- And she slept through till evening?
- No, my boy!
Far from it!
She spent much of the day in the gym with Gambetto, her trainer.
Maestro Gambetto who is a scarabterus-philanthropis, a distant cousin of the praying mantis, even though he swears he's no relation to that particular maneater.
Selenia hardly ever takes class with him because his astonishing flexibility doesn't extend to his personality and his exercises are exceedingly difficult to follow.
But the Princess was determined to assert her control over every single one of her muscles.
- Then, she slept til evening?
- Yes, but when it was time to go to the Transit Hall to greet your arrival, believe me, she was ready!
How do I look?
Sublime!
I know.
She looked magnificent!
She had chosen the beautiful little dress made of rose petals that she picked herself and stitched together.
And she was wearing a delicious vanilla scent!
She reached the Transit Hall over an hour early.
Which the Ferryman didn't fail to bring to her attention.
Selenia!
What are you doing?
It's way too early!
Then she settled down comfortably to wait for her Prince Charming.
What time is it, my good Miro?
Well past midnight, sire.
I think we can safely conclude that Arthur won't be coming this time.
Unfortunately, her Prince never came.
Selenia was so sad that I couldn't find a single word to console her.
She stayed there without moving for many hours until, suddenly, she jumped up and left the village, headed for the great plains.
What for?
Probably to whisper her woes to the breeze so that it would carry them far away.
That's the whole story.
Or as much of it as I know.
So if it wasn't Selenia in danger, or Betameche or the village, who sent me the message?
I'm sure Selenia can help you figure that out.
Yes, if she ever comes back!
Selenia at the gate!
- Selenia?
- Lf you want, you can go on ahead.
Open the gate.
Malthazar!
Oh my goodness!
What a pleasure to see you again, young Arthur.
The pleasure isn't mutual.
I know, but don't hold it against me.
The necklace you wear around your neck is a reminder that we are all part of nature's great circle, my dear cousin.
Perhaps, between cousins, we can reach an agreement.
I'll give you my life in exchange for Selenia's.
- No!
- Silence!
Sorry, Arthur.
Not so long ago, your little swap might have tempted me, but I have better plans now.
I'm tired of your little world.
I want size.
I want scope.
I want big!
You sent the SOS message!
You knew I'd come and that I'd have to open the passage to do so.
Which would leave the path open for you to take the return trip and grow to your full size.
Bravo!
How perceptive of you!
If I had a hand free, I'd give you a round of applause.
I have never heard such a dastardly plot!
Thank you!
It wasn't easy and it took all of my genius to bring my plan to fruition.
After the bitter defeat Arthur inflicted upon me,
I wandered the lower levels for some time with one single idea in my mind.
I would find him and make him pay for his insolence.
The Bubble Smuggler had mentioned a good vantage point from which to observe the comings and goings of everybody in the house.
Smuggler was right.
It didn't take long for me to get to know the wonderful Daisy.
She initiated me into all the wonders of your world.
That fabulous box that manufactures cold and the smaller one that generates heat.
And all that food that she brought in from who knows where.
But the most amazing thing about her was her constant good humor.
She seemed to do everything with love, which is a foreign concept to me.
Even when she had all of her tools of torture lined up on the counter, it was just to transform vulgar vegetables into works of art.
It was a fascinating spectacle and I could sit for hours just watching her.
And then I encountered your mother.
I have never met a specimen so unadapted to her environment!
Mom?
Fortunately, your Grandfather, the gallant Archibald, was always around to keep things ticking over.
I was able to watch him repair the machine that made fire, the one that made sun
and the one that made water.
My desire for conquest was reignited.
The warrior that I am had regained his appetite.
Nothing and no one could stop me now!
Not even your father and his ridiculous offensives.
I am so rotten inside that only effect his spray had was to rid me of a few parasites.
But your father did reveal to me my only weakness in this world...
My size!
And this is where you come in!
All I had to do was be patient and wait for the day you'd visit the Minimoys, so I could take the lightbeam back, as you so shrewedly pointed out.
Finding out the date was not difficult because the kitchen was not only the nerve center which everybody visited at some point, but it was also the perfect spot to listen in on conversations upstairs.
These are the eternal codes of the nature.
I was accepted into the great circle and tonight there's a big party!
- That's nice, dear!
- Yeah!
It's the tenth moon.
The Minimoys are preparing a feast in my honor.
Everything was going smoothly.
All I had to do was to wait for your departure.
And then, suddenly, it was all catastrophe.
Honey, pack your bags.
We're leaving tonight!
This last minute twist threatened to ruin my plot!
The idea of vegetating for another ten moons in this cabinet was unbearable.
I had to find a ploy to make Arthur disobey his father.
And what better than love to make a young man do something silly?
How could Arthur possibly resist a call to save his Princess from mortal danger?
So I found something to write on and carved the message into it myself.
This is absurd!
Everybody knows that the Minimoys write their messages on leaves!
And only a pine needle would have been appropriate in this case.
My apologies, but there weren't any pine needles in my cabinet.
All that was left was to win over a messenger and point him to your room for personal delivery.
Then, I returned to the seven kingdoms through secret passages that I alone am aware of, and I had the good fortune to encounter the charming Princess wandering the plains like a lost soul.
Now you know the full story, let me tell you what happens next.
What time is it, my good Miro?
Five to noon.
High time for us to head to the Transit Hall to say farewell!
Wait!
What is it now?
I wish to make the trip through the telescope.
Another one?
You people just can't stay in one place!
After me, you can rest in peace.
Say, aren't you little Maltazard?
It's been many moons since I last saw you!
You've grown!
Yes, and I'm going to grow some more!
What's the big deal about growing!
You'd be better off getting some sleep!
Have you seen yourself in a mirror lately?
Hold your tongue, you old fool!
Or your sleep will be eternal!
Yes, sir!
A quarter turn to the right for the body...
Distract him, I have an idea.
Give me something I can throw at him.
Okay.
Too small.
Too big.
Three quarter turns to the left for the mind...
Too cute!
- Beta, hurry!
- I'm coming!
Excuse me, Sir?
You know you're heading for the humans world but having Selenia under your feet will only slow you down.
Don't worry, I have no intention of taking the little pest with me.
I'll find plenty more up there who'll be delighted to serve me.
And one whole turn for the soul!
Amazing!
I didn't touch anything.
I was just looking.
Is that your telescope?
- Yes.
- Really?
Cause in your telescope there's little... with big...
Those are the Minimoys.
- The Mini what?
- The Minimoys.
They're our brothers.
Oh, your brothers.
Really?
How tall was your mother?
- Our mother is nature.
- Your mother is nature.
Right.
Well, that would explain why you're... and they're...
That must be the mechanic.
I'll be right back.
In position!
If his Highness would care to lift off...
With pleasure!
- Beta!
Quick!
- I'm coming!
Be still, be still!
- Now!
- Here.
Did you hear that noise?
- That's your transmission.
- No, it came from the forest.
So I figure this'll take me about a week.
I have to get my boy back to school, and I have to find a job.
Well, I could put a rush on it for ya, but it'll cost ya.
I need it tomorrow.
I'll pay you whatever you want.
- Whatever I want?
- Whatever you want.
You got a deal.
My Prince!
You saved my life again!
That's what Princes are for.
- What happened?
Where's Arthur?
- I don't know.
Something shot out of the telescope, like a cannonball, but I don't think it was Arthur.
It landed somewhere in the forest.
If it wasn't Arthur, what is it?
M... the evil M.
The only rock around for miles and I hit it?
You're not going to eat me, are you?
Yes.
The first law of nature.
Eat or be eaten.
The Evil M. Knew that if he sent an SOS message to Arthur, the boy would do everything to come to the aid of his friends and once the passage was open, it was easy to come the other way.
- Now, he's out there somewhere.
- What about Arthur?
Where is he?
He'll probably show up soon.
Oh my God!
The passage is broken.
Marshmallows!
Arthur, come on, I know you're hiding here somewhere.
Come on, don't hide!
Daddy's worried.
Arthur, I'm not angry with you!
I promise.
You won't be punished.
Thank god I found you.
If you come out now, you'll get a big bag of marshmallows all to yourself.
What do you say?
A plump pack of sweet, juicy marshmallows that melt in your mouth.
I know where you are, come on out, now!
Who are these delicious marshmallows for?
For me.
I'll go get a full bag.
How will Arthur escape Maltazard's diabolical trap?
Find out by watching this new adventure:
Arthur and the War of Two Worlds.
Coming soon to cinemas near you.
He's feeling relaxed.
His face does reveals happiness.
But his face and eyes reflect fear too.
For the past 40 years..
Let's ask those coming from Oberoi lobby about the situation.
We've found out that..
Pass me.
-Here.
Be careful.
-Careful.
That's great.
Move them back.
-Get back.
Come on.
-Get back.
Go.
Are we distributing offerings here?
Sir.
Here.
This way.
Come, sir.
What are you doing here?
Get lost.
Go on.
Run!
Yes?
Sir, Mr. Rathi.
Get the door open.
-Ok, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
It's a double murder.
It's in the lane opposite my house.
Yes.
A lady and her son.
She's a teacher, sir.
Mother.
-Yes.
Ok, sir.
Sir. I'll get back to you, sir.
_ _ _ _ _n _gMn _ firmn
No, mother.
-Come inside, child.

Don't fear.
Say it loudly.
-We're here for the public, Mr. Pandey.
We don't live on your support.
We're alive as we're lucky.
If this goes on, some day I'll be found dead too in my house.
Get lost!
-What have I done?
-Go on.
Get lost.
-You can't get away with this.
Pull it.
Help!

Wait for 2 minutes more.
It's enough. I said come down.
Mother, I'm praying.
Don't disturb me.
I'm not disturbing, but you're disturbing..
..the whole colony in the morning.
I'm fed up telling you not to climb up.
But you don't listen to me.
Mother, I'm chanting mantras for your long life.
Don't do it for me.
Now come down quickly.
Or I'm leaving the house.
-Don't go, mother.
I'm coming down, mother.
Mother.

Even your scolding is sweet.
Your love is out of this world.
O' mother!
O' mother!
I love you more than anything else.
You're my life.
On my lips there is your smile.
I won't live without you.
I won't live without you.

My life is tied with yours.
I'll die if this bond breaks.
O' mother!

Let's go.
Quick.
-Turn on the camera.
Hurry up.
-He's coming.
Take him away.
-Did he tell you anything?
Where is his mother's body?
-ln the hospital for post-mortem.
Did you find out why he killed his mother?
He's hot-tempered, sir.
He used to fight with people every day.
He killed his mother.
But there must be some reason.
An insane person needs no reason, sir.
He must've lost his mind and stabbed her.
What's going on?
Close the window.
_n
Brother, my scooter is in garage for servicing.
Bring it back please.
Child Juhi, eat your breakfast.
You're always in a hurry.
First change your clothes, then you'll get tea.
Oh no!
Hey, you threw my phone.
I sold my mother's ring to buy that phone.
Stop the bus.
Now I won't spare you.
Come.
Come on. I'll teach you a lesson.
I'll fix you, smarty pants.
Get down.
Don't stop.
Come.
You fool!
Come on.
You fool!
I won't spare you.
_ _ _ _o fl _go
You don't know me.
Oh!
I've a soul that prophecies evil.
I feel that I see.
Oh!
I've a soul that prophecies evil.
I feel that I see.
Now that you're so much below me..
..as a dead person..
..lying at the bottom of a grave.
Haven't you, Romeo?
And trust me love, in my eye..
..you look pale like a dead body.
Bye, goodbye.
is he dumb or something.
-No, not at all.
Your performance wasn't truthful.
Or else he would've got involved with you.
You know.
-Oh!
You want to see my performance.
I'll involved him so much, that he'll follow me around..
..wagging his tail.
Oh!
Hi!
-Hi!
What are you reading?
Oh!
Laila-Majnu.
Romeo and Juliet.
It's the same thing.
_ _ _ gnM _U_ _O_ _o
You idiot!
Was Romeo like this?
Hey!
Run away.
Come.
Doctor, he's on remand for three days.
But he didn't say why he killed his mother.
_ R fl_ gcr_o
What's there to try, sir.
He looks crazy.
What's your name?
What's your name?
In which class do you study?
Tell me, Ram.
Who is in your family?
What is your mother's name?
Why did you kill your mother?
He's not abnormal, but this isn't his normal behaviour.
Only when we ask about his mother, he reacts.
Specially when we try to tell him..
..that his mother is dead.
And he killed her.
It means his mind can't accept this truth..
..that his mother is dead.
It means, he's mentally unstable.
Yes.
-No.
It doesn't mean he's mentally unstable.
He's only living on the extreme side of his emotions.
Often it happens with normal people.
But why doesn't he talk?
Because this is a case of a brief psychotic disorder.
Anything can happen in such situation.
In such a case, if because of any reason..
..a human's emotion is hurt..
..he refuses to accept the truth..
..and as per his emotion..
..creates his own truth.
And right now his truth is that..
..his mother isn't dead, but she's sleeping.
Why are you wasting time by beating around the bush, doctor?
Just give us certificate that he's mad.
We'll handle the rest.
How did you conclude that he's mad?
Hey!
His appearance suggests that.
And what does my appearance suggest?
Look at me.
_g _ _ _ _ _ gnM _
Do I look like a psychiatrist or a lunatic?
Look, doctor.. -l can see.
I can see that in your eyes..
..that you're very tense.
And you're in a hurry.
It seems not him, but he needs a certificate.
Should I give you one?
Hey, you're unnecessarily..
-Don't try to teach me my job, Mr. Khan.
But this..
-Khan!
Khan!
What should we do, doctor?
After that I'll psycho-analyze him.
And then I'll decide about his mental state.
By the way, doctor, when will he be ready to testify?
It depends.
It's possible, anything or any topic might make him normal.
Or it could take weeks too.
He himself is half mad.
Instead of checking him he was playing with a ball.
is this a way to do it?
-Control, Khan.
We can't force him.
Ok, sir.
Come to police station.
We'll do something.
-Ok, sir.
What is there to be done?
If we thrash him properly, he'll reveal everything.
Get the vehicle.
Driver, stop.
-What happened?
Why do you drive like a blind man?
Can't you see?
How dare you park in the middle of the street?
Move it aside.
-Sorry, sir.
Sir, there is a problem in the vehicle.
-Then fix it.
In case of accident, who would've paid for the damage?
What happened?
-Shukla's wife isn't well.
_ _ _ _o _ _ _o o_ _n
Can't you see that we almost had an accident?
Hey, move it back.
-Push the vehicle.
Get it back.
More.
-Sir.
Sir, the murderer escaped.
-What?
Hello.
Yes.
Phone, sir.
-Who is it?
Mr. Khan, sir.
N_, _o _cr_ _ g _Mg 0_n ln the commotion, that boy fled.
Yes, sir.
There was heated exchange, so..
What are you doing, Khan?
Didn't you handcuff him?
-We did it, sir.
_ _ _ _ _o on _ m_mmn
What can't you understand?
My foot!
Sorry, sir.
-Don't say sorry.
I'm trying.
-Don't try, just do it.
Call doctor Negi.
Hello.
Where is his mother's dead body?
is mother sleeping?
Arith, take the boy from here.
-Ok, sir.
Give it, brother.
Love marriage, sir.
After eloping.
Inter caste.
Her husband?
-He fled..
..when she was pregnant with Ram.
Any relative?
-We didn't see anyone.
Nobody?
-She'd eloped from her house, sir.
So her family never inquired.
And she too didn't return.
She was very dignified, sir.
She was kind hearted.
Never wished anyone harm.
She was living only for her son.
Any fight between mother and son?
No.
Never.
He'd go mad if her mother got even a scratch.
But he was very aggressive.
One day in college..
..during a rehearsal of musical play, Ram got late.
The heart is young.
The ambience is exotic.
Eyes have kindled the desires.
Love has cast a spell.
Let me dwell in your heart.
Come to me.
Come to me.
Shake up the body.
Shake up the body.
Shake up the things.
I'll the in your eyes as tears.
I'll be in your memories.
I won't be away from you.
I will move with like breeze.
Come to me.
Come to me.
I don't like it without you.
I want to be with you.
There is nothing without you.
Come to me.
Come to me.
Yes, from the top.
Yes, lift it.
-Pass it to me.
Come on.
Good.
Great.
Come here.
Pass the ball, Sanju.
Sanju, ball.
Pass the ball, friend.
Give it quickly, dancer.
Don't you understand?
Can't you hear?
Get the ball.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
This sentence of Hamlet, from Shakespeare's play..
..is still relevant and contemporary.
Why?
We'll discuss it today.
Madam, come quickly.
Ram and Vicky are fighting.
What?
-Yes.
Brother, leave me.
Leave me.
Please..
-Ram.
Ram, leave him.
Leave him.
I beg of you.
-Leave him.
I too have some limitations, Archana.
If that boy had been seriously hurt..
..who would've answered his parents?
But sir, it wasn't Ram's mistake.
It's fine. I accept that.
But the way he reacts..
so violently.
I mean..
Look I think he's mentally..
-Sir.
Please.
He has no problem.
Ok.
Ok, fine.
But if he acts like this..
..I fear he might do something untoward some day.
Look, Archana.
I've handled it till date.
But next time I won't be able to do anything.
But sir..
-Archana.
Why don't you leave him alone?
I mean..
Send him to some hostel.
Make him independent.
If he mingles with other people..
..his nature might change.
And if you're ready..
..I can really help you.
I can send him, sir, but he won't go.
Why not?
-Because of me.
Because he thinks he's supporting me.
If he leaves, who will take care of me?
I..
I mean try it once.
It might work.
Ok, thank you.
-Thank you.
His friend?
Why are you standing?
Sit.
What is it, sir?
You called my son for inquiry?
Mr. Khan, it's not inquiry, but some questioning.
_ g_ g, _
Entire world knows that the boy is mad.
I'm doing my duty, Khan.
I know that he's your son.
But he's Ram's friend too.
_ _ _o lt's possible we might find something new.
But sir..
-Will you get him or should I send someone else?
Let it be, sir.
Mr. Khan is senior.
He's kind and honest.
Why are you calling his son, sir?
I too know him personally.
He's a nice lad, sir.
Should I call your son?
No, sir.
-So?
Go and do your work.
Don't increase my general knowledge.
-Yes, sir.
Sameer.
-Father.
Bye.
-Bye.
Get in.
It's nothing.
It won't reach the top.
Mr. Khan is here.
Come.
Get out.
What are you doing here?
God knows from where these bums come from.
Sir.
-Sir.
What happened?
-How much did you get?
Name?
-Sameer.
Full name?
-Sameer Ahmed Khan.
Father's name.
Father's name?
-Sajid Ahmed Khan.
What does he do?
-He's a sub-inspector.
Where?
-Here.
How long do you know Ram?
-For 4-5 years, sir.
Why did he kill his mother?
I..
I don't know, sir.
Answer me honestly.
I won't call you again.
Or else you'll have to come frequently.
Ok, sir.
But father..
You're scared of your father?
Yes, sir.
-Why?
Listen.
Father.
Father, I won't smoke.
_ _ _o ofl _ _o
You smoke. -l won't, father.
Your dad never touched tobacco and you smoke.
Come, I'll make you smoke.
-Father.
Eat chocolate.
It keeps the mind healthy.
Ok, what happened later?
After that I never met him.
I didn't even take that bus again, sir.
Are you telling the truth?
-Yes, sir. I swear.
Sir, I stay away from fights.
Stop this.
Look, you've to come again after a week.
Why, sir?
-Senior officer wants to meet you.
But sir, I'm going out for a month.
-Where?
I'm taking mother on pilgrimage.
Ok, then take your mother to pilgrimage.
Shall we go, sir?
-When you return..
Where?
-SP office.
Oh, yes.
ATS will be there.
Come.
-Yes, sir.
I'll report when I return.
Stop this.
Jaideep, take his mobile from him.
Hey!
-Ok.
-Why didn't you tell me?
Does Ram smoke too?
No, sir.
Not at all.
He's a very nice boy, sir.
He has just one problem.
He gets angry very quickly.
It's possible he got angry on her mother..
I can't say anything, sir.
But he becomes different when he's angry.
It seems as if he's possessed.
He isn't in his senses.
Please leave her.
Please don't do anything.
-Help!
Leave her.
Please don't do anything to her.
Tie him up.
Please leave her.
-Come on.
Tie her up.
-Please leave her.
No.
He'll die.
Leave him.
Thanks, brother. -lt's okay.
Sir, that day I felt that he could kill anyone in anger.
And then I started keeping distance from him.
Ram!
Ram!

You fought?
-No.
How come you're bleeding then?
I thrashed few people.
-Oh God!

Then why did you fight?
_ _g g_ _ _ g _

-Then why did you interfere?
You should've informed the police.
I'd not time to call the police.
You'd time to thrash them.

Should I've watched everything quietly?
No, thrash and throw people.
Break the doors.
Do what you think is right?
You're a judge.
-Yes, I'm.
I won't be quiet if injustice is done in front of my eyes.
Whom will you stop?
-Whomever I see doing injustice?

Will you stop them all?
Yes, mother.
-What if I do something wrong?

One who sides with injustice is a sinner.
And it's every human's duty to destroy such sinner..

He preaches religion to someone or other every day.

What's the matter, Khan?
You know it very well, sir.
Wasn't calling my son enough?
Now you've even called my daughter.
If that won't be enough, call even my wife.
You'll be satisfied.
I've been doing this job for 20 years.
But nobody ever pointed a finger at me.

-Father, no.
Father, I'm telling the truth.
-You lie to me.
You lie to me.
-Why are you hitting your girl?
Keep quiet!
You want to make her like you.
What nonsense!
-You act innocent.
Keep your crazy son away from my daughter.
Just shut up, Mr. Khan!
Talk with respect.
I'm just talking right now.
Or else I know how to deal with women like you.
Women like me?

He's feeling relaxed.
His face does reveals happiness.
But his face and eyes reflect fear too.
For the past 40 years...
Let's ask those coming from Oberoi lobby about the situation.
We've found out that...

A lady and her son.
She's a teacher, sir.
Mother.

Make her stop crying.
Get her in.
No, mother.

It's a public matter.
Say is loudly.
Listen, Pandey, we don't need you here.
Go.
This is a different matter.
- How can I go, sir?
This is a public matter.
I can't go.
Don't fear.
Say it loudly.
- We're here for the public, Mr. Pandey.
We don't live on your support.
We're alive as we're lucky.
If this goes on, some day I'll be found dead too in my house.
Get lost!
- What have I done?
- Go on.
Get lost.
- You can't get away with this.
Pull it.
Help!
What happened?
- Sir, the boy is alive.
Knife is in his hand.
Sir, it's not double, but single murder.
And killer is inside the house.
No, sir.
We thought it was a double murder, but it's single murder.
Son has killed his mother.
Yes, sir.
Ok, sir.
Check properly!
Get in and open the door.

Listen.
If he makes a move, shoot him.

Mother is sleeping.
Give it to me.
Give me.
Hand it to me.
Give me.
Come on.
Very good.

Move aside.
- He's there.
Get aside.
Please move back.
Why did you kill your mother?
Tell us.
Answer us.
What was the reason?
Tell us.
We want to know why you killed your mother.
Answer us.
Move aside.
Let us pass.
Come, sir.

Ram.

Ram, get down.
- Hail Goddess!
When will he understand?
When will he grow up?
Ram, get down.
- What happened?
Nothing, just get down.
Wait for 2 minutes more.
It's enough.
I said come down.
Mother, I'm praying.
Don't disturb me.
I'm not disturbing, but you're disturbing the whole colony in the morning.
I'm fed up telling you not to climb up.
But you don't listen to me.
Mother, I'm chanting mantras for your long life.
Don't do it for me.
Now come down quickly.
Or I'm leaving the house.
- Don't go, mother.
I'm coming down, mother.
Mother.
There is no one like you, O' mother!
There is no one like you, O' mother!
In the entire world.
In the entire world.
In the entire world.
There is no one like you, O' mother!
Even your scolding is sweet.
Your love is out of this world.
O' mother!
O' mother!
I love you more than anything else.
You're my life.
On my lips there is your smile.
I won't live without you.
I won't live without you.
I won't live without you.
There is no one like you, O' mother!
My life is tied with yours.
I'll die if this bond breaks.
O' mother!
O' mother!
I always think of you, mother.
I will sing a lullaby for you like you do for me.
Do you know this?
Do you know this?
There is no one like you, O' mother!
In the entire world.
In the entire world.
There is no one like you, O' mother!
In the entire world.
In the entire world.
Let's go.
Quick.
- Turn on the camera.
Hurry up.
- He's coming.
Take him away.
- Did he tell you anything?
Where is his mother's body?
- In the hospital for post-mortem.
Did you find out why he killed his mother?
He's hot-tempered, sir.
He used to fight with people every day.
He killed his mother.
But there must be some reason.
An insane person needs no reason, sir.
He must've lost his mind and stabbed her.
What's going on?
Close the window.
Tea.
Brother, my scooter is in garage for servicing.
Bring it back please.
Child Juhi, eat your breakfast.
You're always in a hurry.
First change your clothes, then you'll get tea.
Oh no!
Hey, you threw my phone.
I sold my mother's ring to buy that phone.
Stop the bus.
Now I won't spare you.
Come.
Come on.
I'll teach you a lesson.
I'll fix you, smarty pants.
Get down.
Don't stop.
Come.
You fool!
Come on.
You fool!
I won't spare you.
You broke my phone.
I won't spare you.
You don't know me.
Oh!
I've a soul that prophecies evil.
I feel that I see.
Oh!
I've a soul that prophecies evil.
I feel that I see.
Now that you're so much below me as a dead person lying at the bottom of a grave.
Haven't you, Romeo?
And trust me love, in my eye you look pale like a dead body.
Bye, goodbye.
Is he dumb or something.
- No, not at all.
Your performance wasn't truthful.
Or else he would've got involved with you.
You know.
- Oh!
You want to see my performance.
I'll involved him so much, that he'll follow me around wagging his tail.
Oh!
Hi!
- Hi!
What are you reading?
Oh!
Laila-Majnu.
Romeo and Juliet.
It's the same thing.
They were Romeo and Juliet.
We're Laila-Majnu.
You idiot!
Was Romeo like this?
Hey!
Run away.
Come.
Doctor, he's on remand for three days.
But he didn't say why he killed his mother.
Try it in your way.
What's there to try, sir.
He looks crazy.
What's your name?
What's your name?
In which class do you study?
Tell me, Ram.
Who is in your family?
What is your mother's name?
Why did you kill your mother?
He's not abnormal, but this isn't his normal behaviour.
Only when we ask about his mother, he reacts.
Specially when we try to tell him that his mother is dead.
And he killed her.
It means his mind can't accept this truth that his mother is dead.
It means, he's mentally unstable.
Yes.
- No.
It doesn't mean he's mentally unstable.
He's only living on the extreme side of his emotions.
Often it happens with normal people.
But why doesn't he talk?
Because this is a case of a brief psychotic disorder.
Anything can happen in such situation.
In such a case, if because of any reason a human's emotion is hurt he refuses to accept the truth and as per his emotion creates his own truth.
And right now his truth is that his mother isn't dead, but she's sleeping.
Why are you wasting time by beating around the bush, doctor?
Just give us certificate that he's mad.
We'll handle the rest.
How did you conclude that he's mad?
Hey!
His appearance suggests that.
And what does my appearance suggest?
Look at me.
What do you feel looking at my beard and hair?
Do I look like a psychiatrist or a lunatic?
Look, doctor...
- I can see.
I can see that in your eyes that you're very tense.
And you're in a hurry.
It seems not him, but he needs a certificate.
Should I give you one?
Hey, you're unnecessarily...
- Don't try to teach me my job, Mr. Khan.
But this...
- Khan!
Khan!
What should we do, doctor?
We need to perform brain imaging test.
After that I'll psycho-analyze him.
And then I'll decide about his mental state.
By the way, doctor, when will he be ready to testify?
It depends.
It's possible, anything or any topic might make him normal.
Or it could take weeks too.
He himself is half mad.
Instead of checking him he was playing with a ball.
Is this a way to do it?
- Control, Khan.
We can't force him.
Ok, sir.
Come to police station.
We'll do something.
- Ok, sir.
What is there to be done?
If we thrash him properly, he'll reveal everything.
Get the vehicle.
Driver, stop.
- What happened?
Why do you drive like a blind man?
Can't you see?
How dare you park in the middle of the street?
Move it aside.
- Sorry, sir.
Sir, there is a problem in the vehicle.
- Then fix it.
In case of accident, who would've paid for the damage?
What happened?
- Shukla's wife isn't well.
We've to get the doctor.
Move this aside.
- But what happened?
Can't you see that we almost had an accident?
Hey, move it back.
- Push the vehicle.
Get it back.
More.
- Sir.
Sir, the murderer escaped.
- What?
Hello.
Yes.
Phone, sir.
- Who is it?
Mr. Khan, sir.
Yes, Khan.
- Our van dashed a leader's car.
In the commotion, that boy fled.
Yes, sir.
There was heated exchange, so...
What are you doing, Khan?
Didn't you handcuff him?
- We did it, sir.
Then how did he escape.
- I don't understand.
What can't you understand?
My foot!
Sorry, sir.
- Don't say sorry.
I'm trying.
- Don't try, just do it.
Call doctor Negi.
Hello.
Where is his mother's dead body?
Is mother sleeping?
Arith, take the boy from here.
- Ok, sir.
Give it, brother.
Love marriage, sir.
After eloping.
Inter caste.
Her husband?
- He fled when she was pregnant with Ram.
Any relative?
- We didn't see anyone.
Nobody?
- She'd eloped from her house, sir.
So her family never inquired.
And she too didn't return.
She was very dignified, sir.
She was kind hearted.
Never wished anyone harm.
She was living only for her son.
Any fight between mother and son?
No.
Never.
He'd go mad if her mother got even a scratch.
But he was very aggressive.
One day in college during a rehearsal of musical play, Ram got late.
The heart is young.
The ambience is exotic.
Eyes have kindled the desires.
Love has cast a spell.
Let me dwell in your heart.
Come to me.
Come to me.
Shake up the body.
Shake up the body.
Shake up the things.
I'll the in your eyes as tears.
I'll be in your memories.
I won't be away from you.
I will move with like breeze.
Come to me.
Come to me.
I don't like it without you.
I want to be with you.
There is nothing without you.
Come to me.
Come to me.
Yes, from the top.
Yes, lift it.
- Pass it to me.
Come on.
Good.
Great.
Come here.
Pass the ball, Sanju.
Sanju, ball.
Pass the ball, friend.
Give it quickly, dancer.
Don't you understand?
Can't you hear?
Get the ball.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
This sentence of Hamlet, from Shakespeare's play is still relevant and contemporary.
Why?
We'll discuss it today.
Madam, come quickly.
Ram and Vicky are fighting.
What?
- Yes.
Brother, leave me.
Leave me.
Please...
- Ram.
Ram, leave him.
Leave him.
I beg of you.
- Leave him.
I too have some limitations, Archana.
If that boy had been seriously hurt who would've answered his parents?
But sir, it wasn't Ram's mistake.
It's fine.
I accept that.
But the way he reacts...
so violently.
I mean...
Look I think he's mentally...
- Sir.
Please.
He has no problem.
Ok.
Ok, fine.
But if he acts like this I fear he might do something untoward some day.
Look, Archana.
I've handled it till date.
But next time I won't be able to do anything.
But sir...
- Archana.
Why don't you leave him alone?
I mean...
Send him to some hostel.
Make him independent.
If he mingles with other people his nature might change.
And if you're ready I can really help you.
I can send him, sir, but he won't go.
Why not?
- Because of me.
Because he thinks he's supporting me.
If he leaves, who will take care of me?
I...
I mean try it once.
It might work.
Ok, thank you.
- Thank you.
His friend?
Why are you standing?
Sit.
What is it, sir?
You called my son for inquiry?
Mr. Khan, it's not inquiry, but some questioning.
What new information could he give you, sir?
Entire world knows that the boy is mad.
- I'm doing my duty, Khan.
I know that he's your son.
But he's Ram's friend too.
They both study in the same college.
It's possible we might find something new.
But sir...
- Will you get him or should I send someone else?
Let it be, sir.
Mr. Khan is senior.
He's kind and honest.
Why are you calling his son, sir?
I too know him personally.
He's a nice lad, sir.
Should I call your son?
No, sir.
- So?
Go and do your work.
Don't increase my general knowledge.
- Yes, sir.
Sameer.
- Father.
Bye.
- Bye.
Get in.
It's nothing.
It won't reach the top.
Mr. Khan is here.
Come.
Get out.
What are you doing here?
God knows from where these bums come from.
Sir.
- Sir.
What happened?
- How much did you get?
Name?
- Sameer.
Full name?
- Sameer Ahmed Khan.
Father's name.
Father's name?
- Sajid Ahmed Khan.
What does he do?
- He's a sub-inspector.
Where?
- Here.
How long do you know Ram?
- For 4-5 years, sir.
Why did he kill his mother?
I...
I don't know, sir.
Answer me honestly.
I won't call you again.
Or else you'll have to come frequently.
Ok, sir.
But father...
You're scared of your father?
Yes, sir.
- Why?
Listen.
Father.
Father, I won't smoke.
You smoke cigarette.
- I won't, father.
You smoke.
- I won't, father.
Your dad never touched tobacco and you smoke.
Come, I'll make you smoke.
- Father.
Eat chocolate.
It keeps the mind healthy.
Ok, what happened later?
After that I never met him.
I didn't even take that bus again, sir.
Are you telling the truth?
- Yes, sir.
I swear.
Sir, I stay away from fights.
Stop this.
Look, you've to come again after a week.
Why, sir?
- Senior officer wants to meet you.
But sir, I'm going out for a month.
- Where?
I'm taking mother on pilgrimage.
Ok, then take your mother to pilgrimage.
Shall we go, sir?
- When you return...
Where?
- SP office.
Oh, yes.
ATS will be there.
Come.
- Yes, sir.
I'll report when I return.
Stop this.
Jaideep, take his mobile from him.
Hey!
- Ok.
- Why didn't you tell me?
Does Ram smoke too?
No, sir.
Not at all.
He's a very nice boy, sir.
He has just one problem.
He gets angry very quickly.
It's possible he got angry on her mother...
I can't say anything, sir.
But he becomes different when he's angry.
It seems as if he's possessed.
He isn't in his senses.
Please leave her.
Please don't do anything.
- Help!
Leave her.
Please don't do anything to her.
Tie him up.
Please leave her.
- Come on.
Tie her up.
- Please leave her.
No.
He'll die.
Leave him.
Thanks, brother.
- It's okay.
Sir, that day I felt that he could kill anyone in anger.
And then I started keeping distance from him.
Ram!
Ram!
What happened to your hand?
- Nothing.
You fought?
- No.
How come you're bleeding then?
I thrashed few people.
- Oh God!
You thrashed!
Whom?
I don't know.
I don't know them.
Then why did you fight?
Why don't you answer?
Why did you fight?
They were trying to molest a girl.
- Which girl?
I don't know her too.
- Then why did you interfere?
You should've informed the police.
I'd not time to call the police.
You'd time to thrash them.
You don't want to go to hostel so you can do this?
You can't sit peacefully even for a day.
Should I've watched everything quietly?
No, thrash and throw people.
Break the doors.
Do what you think is right?
You're a judge.
- Yes, I'm.
I won't be quiet if injustice is done in front of my eyes.
Whom will you stop?
- Whomever I see doing injustice?
Thousands of people do wrong things in the world.
Will you stop them all?
Yes, mother.
- What if I do something wrong?
Where are you going?
Answer me.
Why don't you answer?
What will you do to me if I err in future?
Will you kill me?
Tell me.
Why don't you answer?
Will you kill me too?
- Yes.
Husband's name?
- Mohammed Hussain.
Mohammed Hussain.
Address?
Yes?
I want to see the inspector.
I mean, Dronacharya, great Bhisma Jaidrath, Aurkat and many warriors were killed by me.
You too kill brave warriors.
Don't fear.
You'll surely get victory over enemies in the battle.
So fight.
Whom are you telling him to fight today?
No, but I'm giving him knowledge about right and wrong.
One who sides with injustice is a sinner.
And it's every human's duty to destroy such sinner whether he's our own or a stranger.
Your knowledge is having a very good effect on him.
He preaches religion to someone or other every day.
Come, Ram.
Greetings, teacher.
- God bless you.
Ram.
Tomorrow eleventh chapter will end.
How many chapters are left now?
- Seven.
Oh God!
If he's in this state now he'll be in prison after the last chapter.
Come.
- Are you chanting mantra of longevity daily.
Yes, he's doing it.
He's doing as you've said.
Standing on one leg.
Come.
- Bye, teacher.
What wrong could've her mother done?
As per this test, circumstances are totally against him.
But I don't think he has...
- I agree with you, doctor.
But...
Let's see.
Thank you.
Come on.
Hail Ram!
Hail Ram!
Hail Krishna!
Hail Ram!
Ram.
Ram.
Oh, dear!
Ram.
Ram!
Madam!
Your stuff is here.
Where are you?
What's your name?
Atmaram.
Oh!
- Get up.
Hey, leave me!
Stop it!
Leave me.
What have I done?
We'll find that out, disloyal!
What?
- Keep your hand down.
Please help me!
No, sir.
I'm not a thief.
Khan.
Who is this idiot?
He frequents teacher's house.
Today we got hold of him.
Oh!
Send him in.
Take him in.
- Come.
Do you want anything?
- No, I got enough from them.
Not that.
Do you want to eat something?
- Yes.
I'm starving since morning.
They didn't even ask for water.
They just started beating me.
What will you've?
- Whiskey.
What?
- Tea will be just fine, sir.
What will you eat?
- I can even eat bricks if you order me.
But it'll be great if I get pilaf, sir.
Order chicken pilaf and tea.
- Ok, sir.
- No chicken.
Order vegetarian pilaf.
My jaw is hurting.
One feeds while other thrashes.
He forgot to add salt.
If you'd less money, you could've asked me.
They've no standard.
Why are you staring me?
Get some water.
Sir, may I sit?
What's your name?
- I erred, sir.
I won't even ask.
What's the problem?
- I can't understand that.
First they ask name, then they start pounding.
Ok, sit here.
Now tell me your name.
Atmaram.
- Father's name.
Parmatmaram.
Are you from this place?
- Yes, sir.
Who else is in your family?
- Nobody, sir.
Parents?
- 5 years ago, sir.
Are you married?
- I tried, but it didn't happen.
What do you do?
- I drive Tata-Sumo.
Show me the license.
- I don't have it, sir.
What?
- Tata-Sumo is name of my horses.
Great.
- Tata is horse and Sumo is mare.
How long do you know Ram?
- Which Ram?
Oh, that powerful one!
That teacher's son.
I know him since childhood, since he was born.
Is he your best friend.
- No, he's like my brother.
Why?
What happened?
- Don't question me.
Just answer my question.
- Ok, sir.
How is Ram's mother...
- She's a nice lady, sir.
She calls me her son.
How is her character?
- Meaning?
I mean did she have an affair?
No, sir.
What are you saying?
She's a virtuous lady.
She gives me new clothes on festivals.
She's very noble.
Then why was such a nice teacher murdered?
What did you say, sir?
Why was the teacher murdered?
No...
- Why was she killed?
I knew that there would be a problem when police picked me up.
Sit down.
- Sir, I didn't do anything.
Leave me.
I'll change my name.
I'll leave the city for good.
Shut up!
Listen.
If you tell the truth, you won't have to come again.
Or else you'll have to come frequently.
- I swear.
Honestly, I heard it from you that the teacher was murdered.
Just today I returned from out of town.
She was a nice lady, just like my mother.
No, no, no.
Please sit.
She's Sumo.
She's very calm.
Nothing will happen.
Ram I'm scared.
I won't sit.
- Why are you scared?
Hop on, I'll help you.
- Why are you stubborn, Ram?
We're here.
We'll take care.
- I'll fall...
- What happened?
You mounted her.
- The horse is fine and you're sitting on it.
Ram, it's enough.
- Now put your leg in it.
Get me down.
- No way.
- This will stop at the hillock now when you'll conquer your fear.
Come.
I won't spare you.
Ram.
- Come now.
Very good.
Now hold the rein and move with hate horse in rhythm.
Very good.
Ram.
Stop.
Mother, don't be scared.
Keep holding the rein.
Come on.
Careful.
- I'll show you...
- You've learnt.
Now I can ride two horses.
- Don't pull...
Should I teach you?
Sorry, mother.
Sorry.
But mother, you don't fear anymore.
You're not scared anymore.
You're a warrior now.
- Shut up.
If you do this again, I won't spare you.
Yes.
Good deeds go unrewarded.
Should I beat you?
- Sorry, madam.
I apologize sincerely.
I'm leaving.
Return home quickly, Ram.
Ok, mother.
Are you riding a jet?
You too may go.
And you've already left.
Hello.
This is all your deed.
But alcoholic horses are yours.
This is our family matter.
Don't get involve.
She's riding a horse, Ram.
Do you see what I'm seeing?
- What?
Let it be.
You can't see anything.
I'll handle it.
Stop!
Excuse me.
- What?
You're going to and fro.
Do you like my face?
Don't be mistaken or your life will be ruined.
There are many thorns on the way.
Your ladies motor cycle will be punctured.
Just mind your business.
Move aside.
He's hot tempered.
You can't woo him.
Hot!
He's very cold, like an ice.
- Really?
Lava inside a mountain isn't cooled by snowfall on its top.
It can erupt anytime.
Yes, I'll see your volcano.
Ok, try it.
But think again.
Think again.
Did you give it a thought?
Did you give it a thought?
- Listen, how is your business?
It's ruined!
There are no tourist.
Business is down.
How much do you want?
- Whatever I can get will be less but I can't think of anything less than 500.
I can count. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.
You even blackmail people.
Not blackmail, it's social service.
- Social service?
Trying to fool me.
- I made a mistake.
Who is that girl?
What do you want, sir?
- Sit outside.
What's the matter, Khan?
You know it very well, sir.
Wasn't calling my son enough?
Now you've even called my daughter.
If that won't be enough, call even my wife.
You'll be satisfied.
I've been doing this job for 20 years.
But nobody ever pointed a finger at me.
And you... for a lowly boy you want to malign my life-earned respect.
I know what's going on in your mind.
This...
Khan.
'Khan' is attached to my name.
This is the reason you're doing this.
Had it been 'Sharma', 'Joshi' or 'Rathi' you would've thought 50 times before calling their children.
I pity people like you, Mr. Khan.
I called your children for inquiry so you're doubting my intentions.
Don't forget that you're the neighbor of the house where murder took place.
And your family frequents that house.
When I called your children here, I never thought of their religion but of the pledge we took while wearing this uniform.
It was because of the duty which pays our salary.
People want to sleep peacefully trusting us, they don't want to die.
And had been someone from different caste instead of you I would've called their children too for questioning.
I would've even called their wives for questioning if necessary.
Your daughter didn't go with that boy for romance after asking me.
Name, Juhi.
BA, first year.
Father is sub-inspector.
And daughter loves a murderer.
Love happens in this age.
But along with that, what else did you like about him?
Wipe your tears and tell me the truth.
I won't call you again.
Or else you'll have to come frequently.
I'll leave.
This is where we part ways.
But you...
- No ifs and buts.
I've important work.
Go now.
- Yes.
Ok.
Now it's up to you.
I've done my work.
Customer is there.
I wish I could get a client of Rs.
500 more.
Hello, Mrs. India.
Lift.
- No, thanks.
Our destination is the same.
Hop on.
This is a horse too with wheels.
Look, it makes sound too.
You go.
- Come on, pal.
I'm not going to bite you.
Don't think too much.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
- Hello.
I'm not allergic to thanks.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Where are you coming from?
- Ruchi's house, father.
Where did you find him?
- Who?
Teacher's son.
- He was walking home.
I thought of giving him a lift.
Is the matter limited to just lift?
Yes, father.
Ok, go.
How long will it take, madam?
Just a little more.
I won't let you go before you apply henna to me.
I won't go.
Promise.
Ok?
She's always in a hurry.
She's just like her father.
Ram!
Madam, it's done.
Even hundred men can't break this door.
Let it be.
You don't know my son.
Take this.
Ram!
Ram!
Ram!
Ram!
Where are you?
Ram!
Ram!
- Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to dear mummy!
Happy birthday to you!
Take this.
Happy birthday, mother.
Where is my gift?
- Tell me, what do you want?
Will I get what I want?
- Sure.
I promise, mother.
Think again.
Don't go back on your words.
I pledge, mother.
Tell me, what do you want?
Pack your luggage.
What, mother?
And that day Ram left for hostel.
Then we never met again, sir.
Ok.
- Bye, sir.
Wait.
Why did your father lodge a report against Ram?
Sir, he got bail.
See to it that you don't return.
Get lost.
Tell me.
Mother's hold their children's hands for some distance.
But they're always in their hearts.
Ram!
Ram, what are you doing?
Practicing self defense.
- What?
If anyone does ragging with me in hostel, I won't spare him.
Even Krishna has said in Geeta one who can't defend himself is a coward.
Oh God!
This... what have you done?
I dropped a senior from the terrace.
Come.
Come.
- Ram, wait.
Come home.
- Why?
We're going to hostel.
We won't go to hostel.
- You're fine here with me.
No, mother.
I've promised you.
I can't do this.
I freed you from that promise.
Come back.
Not like that.
Give me your right hand.
Like this.
I take back my promise.
Ok?
Child, you're not ready yet.
Get ready quickly.
You've to go to your uncle.
- Ok.
Even my shadow is in a quest.
Every moment, life is a test.
Even my shadow is in a quest.
Every moment, life is a test.
How can I live without you?
Tell me.
Tell me.
Guide me.
My heart pines for you.
O' beloved.
O' beloved.
I've crossed all limits in your love.
I've crossed all limits in your love.
Restlessness dwells in my heart.
I wake up when the world goes to sleep.
You have gone away from me.
Our meetings have ended too.
How can I live without you?
Tell me.
Tell me.
Guide me.
My heart pines for you.
O' beloved.
O' beloved.
I've crossed all limits in your love.
I've crossed all limits in your love.
In your love.
In your love.
In your love.
In your love.
I've crossed all limits in your love.
In your love.
In your love.
From lift matter has reached here.
Father, I came to take notes from teacher...
- Do you think I'm a fool?
Do you think I'm a fool?
- Father, no.
Father, I'm telling the truth.
- You lie to me.
You lie to me.
- Why are you hitting your girl?
Keep quiet!
You want to make her like you.
What nonsense!
- You act innocent.
Keep your crazy son away from my daughter.
Just shut up, Mr. Khan!
Talk with respect.
I'm just talking right now.
Or else I know how to deal with women like you.
Women like me?
What do you mean to say?
You know very well what I want to say.
Why did your husband leave you leaving this lunatic in your womb?
Answer me.
Answer me.
Why are you quiet?
What happened, mother?
Nothing.
Come inside.
- Yes, take him in.
And explain to him to stay within his limits.
Ram, come in.
- What have I done, mother?
Why is he talking like this?
- I'm just talking now.
If you don't reform, I'll imprison you and teach you a lesson.
Mother, tell him to keep quiet or else...
- Ram.
Or else what?
- Mother.
Or else what?
- No.
- You threaten a cop.
I'll frame you in such a case that you'll rot for life in prison.
Ram, come inside.
I bind you with my oath.
Come inside.
- Leave me.
I said leave me.
And you...
if I see you around this house I'll...
- What will you do?
You'll kill me.
Shut up!
Father, what sin have I done that you've created this din?
Make him quiet!
- I won't be quiet.
If you can marry, why not me?
Because your mother wasn't an illegitimate child nor crazy.
- Father.
How can you say such lowly things?
I can do many things more than talking.
Then do what you want.
I'll do as I wish.
Really?
Ok.
Hello, police station.
- Khan speaking.
- Yes, sir.
- Did you get any clue in about the arms we seized today?
No, sir.
- Listen.
I've doubt on a boy.
He was seen in the area from where the arms were found.
- Ok.
File a report.
- Sir.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Tell me.
- Name, Ram Kaushik.
Father's name.
- He has no father.
It's happening because of you.
- Mother.
Mother's name is Archana Kaushik.
She's a school teacher.
- Father.
- Father, please.
Don't do this.
I won't meet him again.
- Did you write it?
Yes, sir.
- I won't even talk to him.
Father, please.
I promise.
I won't meet him.
I won't talk to him.
- Sir.
Please, father.
Listen to me.
Don't do this.
Please don't do this.
- Please, father.
I swear.
- Listen, don't proceed this case without my orders.
I just have doubts.
I'll tell you to take action when I get proof.
Ok?
Ok, sir.
Remember.
- Yes, father.
If I see you again with that scum, I'll break your bones.
Come on, everyone!
Come.
You can go now.
Sir, I'm sure Ram didn't do anything.
Love is blind.
Don't follow that.
You won't get anything.
And listen.
Wipe your tears before going out.
Or else it will be difficult to control your father.
What are you looking at?
Is anything left?
Come.
Listen.
- Sir.
Send Ram in.
- Sir.
Listen.
- Yes?
Ok, sir.
Why did you kill your mother?
You stare me, fool!
Sit.
Why did you kill your mother?
With whom did she have an affair?
Who used to come to your house?
Stop.
Take him away.
These pictures are of the biggest terror strike that took place few days ago.
We're going to show you pictures of the place...
Atheist!
- Where small children...
They should be shot in the middle of the road.
They're given guns and they're brainwashed against India...
Take this.
Take it, Sameer.
Did Juhi eat breakfast?
What should I do with this girl?
That dumb has harassed me.
The case will move ahead if he speaks.
One day I'll thrash him so severely his entire body will speak.
No, sir.
He won't speak.
Yes, sir.
We're taking him to court.
His remand is over.
From there we'll take him to admit at doctor Negi's place.
Yes, sir.
I'll be there.
Yes.
Ajay.
- Yes.
- Bring Ram to court at 2 O'clock.
- Ok, sir.
- I'm going to SP office.
I'll come to court from there.
Right, sir.
- Ok?
Irshad Hussain.
- What did you lose?
Purse.
- Ok.
Hello, sir.
- Chain.
Hello.
How are you, Sameer?
Fine, sir.
- Mr. Khan is on field.
Sir, I want to meet Ram, not father.
What?
- I want to meet Ram.
Are you mad?
Nobody is allowed to meet him.
Please, sir.
Just for two minutes.
Will you get me in trouble?
He has already harassed us.
Now you've come to meet him.
I've come to explain to him.
He'll tell everything.
He's my good friend.
Please.
- Ok, but hurry up.
Thank you, sir.
Ram.
Ram.
What has happened, friend?
It was terrible!
Let bygones be bygones.
And accept your mistake.
Humans err.
But don't be quiet.
Accept it, brother.
Or else father will hit you mercilessly.
Sameer, hurry up, my brother.
If Mr. Khan comes, he'll scold both of us.
Just two minutes, please.
- Hurry up.
If you confess, you won't be punished severely.
But don't ruin your life by keeping quiet.
Ram, do you understand me.
Look.
I don't want them to torture you.
I want your well being.
Ram, you don't know, but father hits mercilessly.
Who allowed him in?
What are you doing?
- Get out.
- He came.
Get out.
What are you doing here?
Father...
- Come on.
I just came to meet him.
Come on.
We're showing you picture of another terrorist.
Mother!
Mother!
What happened, mother?
Mother!
Mother, what happened?
Mother.
Mother.
Mother, talk to me.
Mother.

Get out.

Mother is sleeping.
Mother.

Hey!
Stop there.
Where are you going?
Sir.
Sir, that boy fled from police station.
Did you try his house?
Thank you, doctor.
- Come.
Father.
Mother.
Mother.
Ram!
Leave him.
I said leave him.
He killed my mother.
What rubbish!
Mother gave this to me before dying.
And it's from his shirt.
No, father.
He's lying.
He's lying.
He has gone crazy.
I don't know what he's rambling about?
Scoundrel!
Scoundrel!
- What are you doing?
- Why did you do this?
Why did you do this?
- Father.
Tell me.
Why did you do this?
You've defamed me.
Father...
- I won't spare you.
I won't spare you.
Tell me.
Why did you kill his mother?
Tell me the truth or else I'll shoot you.
I'll tell you.
- Tell me.
I apologize on father's behalf.
He has seized arms brought to serve our community.
Oh God!
Have mercy!
Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
- Bye.
Sameer.
Yes?
- Sit.
Read this.
You'll get strength.
- Yes.
And listen.
Be careful.
- Ok.
Goodbye.
God is great!
God is great!
Madam.
- You?
- Madam.
Madam, listen.
Please, madam.
Listen, madam.
Please listen, madam.
Please listen, madam.
Please listen to me, madam.
Madam, please.
- Move aside.
I'll tell your father now.
He calls my son mad and his son is a terrorist.
Madam, I'm not a terrorist.
I was just checking it.
Please, madam.
Ok, give it to me.
- Madam.
I'll show it to your father now.
No.
If father finds out he'll kill me.
Please don't tell him, madam.
- Give it to me.
Give it to me now.
- Please listen to me, madam.
Ok.
- I'm not a terrorist.
- Let the police decide.
Please, madam.
- Move.
Madam, keep the phone down or I'll kill you.
I'm warning you.
Keep the phone down.
Oh!
Very good.
You'll kill me.
Kill me.
Let me see what you can do.
Madam, I'll kill you.
I'm telling the truth.
Now your father will deal with you.
Keep the phone down.
I'll stab you, madam.
What have you done, Sameer?
Get up.
Come.
Hey!
- Hey!
Sameer, what are you doing?
Leave me.
Let me go.
- Give me the gun.
- Move.
Sameer, give the gun back.
- Move back.
I'll shoot.
- Give the gun, child.
Look...
- I'll shoot.
Don't act stupid.
- Let me go.
Don't be mad.
Listen to me.
What have you done, Sameer?
- Move back.
I'll fire, father.
- What?
No, Sameer.
- Don't be mad.
What are you doing?
- I'll shoot, father.
Sameer, what have you done?
Mother is greater than any community, Sameer.
O' mother!
As you can see these are the people who are connected to those arms.
Get aside.
- They were seized...
A big tragedy is averted in this city.
- Move back.
No organization has taken responsibility.
In this operation police officer Mr. Rathi and Mr. Khan were injured...
O' mother!
There is no one like you, O' mother!
There is no one like you, O' mother!
In the entire world.
There is no one like you, O' mother!
My life is tied with yours.
I'll die if this bond breaks.
O' mother!
O' mother!
I always think of you, mother.
I will sing a lullaby for you like you do for me.
Do you know this?
Do you know this?
There is no one like you, O' mother!
In the entire world.
There is no one like you, O' mother!
In the entire world.
Previously on Being Erica...
- Erica strange.
- That's me.
- What happened?
- I'm allergic to nuts, and I had this mocha mint lappa...
Was there any almonds or walnuts in that latte?
Yeah, it's actually "The hazelnut mocha mint latte".
Anything else happen today?
Yes, I was fired from my job and dumped.
So, all in all, a pretty bad day.
You're a doctor, right?
- I'm a therapist.
- I don't need a therapist.
You know, I always thought I'd grow up and I'd have an amazing life.
- What happened to that?
- I blew it.
There's so many things that I would've done differently.
Like what?
What are they, these regrets of yours?
If you could go back, what would you do differently?
Is there a window open in here?
It's really cold.
Help me.
Wait-wait-wait.
Katie, what year is it?
You're hilarious.
This isn't happening.
You think I'm supposed to accept that I'm just like, what, time travelling?
Because this...
this can't be for real.
- Feels real enough.
- It's time for me to go home.
But our next session will begin shortly.
I have your list.
- Oh no, wait-wait-wait, wait, wait!
- We have a lot of work to do, you and me.
Where do I go from here?
A resume, it tells a story.
School, job, hobbies.
It's a snapshot of who we are.
What makes the best impression?
The masters in english lit, for sure.
I don't know.
I think you should go with work experience.
I mean, client representative has heft.
Heft?
No it doesn't.
I was a glorified operator, Judith.
Okay, the masters then.
And at the end of the day, it all comes down to the choices we've made.
This, this is what I've done with my life in ten years.
Wow.
I did a huge workopolis search for you.
Pulled out everything I thought might interest you.
Okay, what do we go here?
Jobs in education, advertising... mortuary science?
- Baby boomers are dying off.
- Hey, wait a minute!
Publishing.
- I like books.
- Yeah, you love books.
That is why I included at least a dozen publishing jobs.
I feel strangely excited.
Why don't you come over tonight and celebrate?
Ethan is coming to town from Montreal, total last minute.
The three of us will crack, open a bottle of wine...
- Wine?
- Or... fizzy... grape juice stuff?
I'm so sorry.
Worst friend ever.
Have you told anyone, yet?
No.
I'm gonna wait for the end of the first trimester, so...
- Okay, hey, mums the word.
- Okay.
All right, I'm gonna get changed and hand deliver these suckers.
- All right.
- Thank you so much.
Choices.
Look close enough and you can see them everywhere.
But what do you do when you see your life as a series of bad choices?
When you would give anything to have made different ones, the questions is:
If you could go back and do it all differently, would you still be you?
Sorry.
My apologies.
- Hi, there.
- Hi, can I help you?
Yes, I'm just here to drop off a resume for the assistant position.
The assistant position.
The assistant to the managing editor of fiction.
All right, so, just contact four or five blurbers for the pre-publication endorsements, see if they'd be willing to... uh...
Oh, I'll see you in a sec.
Erica Strange.
- Oh...
Antigone Kim.
- It's Antigone Morris now.
Wow!
Congratulations.
So, uh... so, do you work here?
Yeah.
I head up green row'sfiction division.
Wow, so, um...
Seeing you again is just...
- I don't know, it's crazy, hunh?
- Yeah, it's really crazy.
My god, do you remember all those pompous debates we used to have about...
god, whatever?
Right.
We were really competitive back in the day, you know?
Sometimes it's great to read a book, just to read a book.
Yeah.
Not if you wanna be an editor.
Yeah...
So, how did you end up in publishing?
Well, do you remember "Literati"?
That "not so secret" society I was in?
Yes, they tapped me to join as well.
That's right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
My boss is here?
Literati.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Literati members like to help each other.
And it doesn't hurt to have friends in high places, if know what I mean?
So, um...
Oh, you're applying for a job... to be my assistant.
Yeah, I'm kind of in the middle of a career change right now.
So...
Unfortunately, that position's been filled.
I just hired this bright young thing,
- right out of her masters.
- Let me guess, Literati?
Well, we are... the sum of our decisions, aren't we?
Yeah.
As long as you're happy, that's all that matters.
It was really great seeing you again.
Bye.
"We're the sum of our decisions, aren't we?"
I guess we are.
Dr. Tom?
Hey, Dr. Tom!

Assembling: keigel2001 :

Your car is not even worth a thousand dollars.
It's 15 years old.
I know, but the suspension is scattered all over Bedford Road.
I mean, I either give her up or I pay the money.
Oh my god.
Sam, that dress is gorgeous.
- I like it.
- All that running around and nobody even called you for an interview?
I'm still trying to look.
You can't expect me to find something in one day.
Well, if it doesn't work out, you can always work for me.
Work for you?
Well, a Toronto account executive just retired, so if you can handle lunches at holt's and martinis with wedding planners...
- Oh, Erica loves martinis.
- Mom.
We offer competitive wages and, uh, benefits.
- Dental!
- I don't even know anything about weddings, people.
Well, what's there to know?
Boy meets girl, boy woos girl, girl blows $10,000 on a lovely pile of lace and organza.
- Oh, save your breath, Ruby.
My daughter thinks she's too good to work for your successful business.
- I do not.
- Mom, leave her alone.
- Thank you, Sam.
I'm just saying, she might wanna consider saying yes to her uncle who's trying to help her.
I'm not saying no.
Would you just give me a second to think about it.
Look, Uncle Ruby.
If...
I were to come and work for you, I mean, it would... it would just be a temporary thing and I'd...
- I'd like to be up front about that.
- Be up front all you want.
All I'm saying is, it's a good group of people, we have a lot of laughs; you'd enjoy yourself.
When can Erica start?
Mom.
Ethan?
!
Oh, I am so sorry.
It's just... the craziest day.
- And you're always late.
- I know, I know.
- What, are you moving in?
- Um, yeah.
I thought I'd sleep in your bathtub.
I did not have a poster of "The Kiss" up on my wall.
Yes, you did.
It was right above your desk.
- No, that was Judith.
- No, that was you.
You bought it at that poster sale in first year.
- Why are you my friend again?
- And do I need to remind you about the uh...
- toaster oven incident?
- No, but you're going to.
Who installs a heat source underneath their bed?
Uh, oh!
That's right, you do.
Like I'm gonna get out of bed to make nachos.
And that, my friend, is the last of it.
I start a new job tomorrow, so...
- no hangover for this girl.
- A new job?
Doing what?
Um, account executive... at my Uncle Ruby's bridal company "White Dreams"
- Wet Dreams?
- White Dreams, you perv.
Wow.
Well, congratulations.
- I guess.
- No, I mean, it-it's gonna be great.
It's, uh... pays the bills, it's downtown, there's dental!
You're, you're just not happy for me at all.
Sorry, I can't go "rah-rah-rah" over something you think is a mistake.
Ha!
Okay, Mr. Honesty, what's with all the luggage?
I left Claire.
Oh my god.
Ethan, what happened?
- She was cheating on me.
- What?
!
Okay, that's bullshit.
She was cheating on you and you had to leave?
Well, her dad owns half the city of Montreal.
He bought us our house in Outremont.
All our friends are her friends.
Feels like there's nothing left there for me.
So, where are you going to stay?
My parents have a granny suite.
No, you're not gonna stay in your parents' basement, you're gonna stay here with me.
Where?
I...
I was joking about the tub.
This place is too small.
Okay, we'll...
we'll find somewhere.
We'll look and we'll get you a place.
I prise you, I'm gonna get you sorted out.
I know.
Morning.
It's magnetic.
Okay, yeah, this way, through here.
Now your catchment zone is gonna be the downtown core.
That's home to some of the most discerning bridal houses in the city.
So you're gonna be dealing with people who are...
Well, okay, they can be prissy little pains in my ass.
Do I ever get to meet any real bridezillas?
O... oh, no-no-no-no-no, no, no, no, no.
We don't have to get our hands dirty with any of that.
White Dreams is strictly import/export.
Ah, now, here you are, right through here.
Go on.
Sit down.
Make yourself at home.
This is your domain.
It's best that you get to know each of our dresses by name, okay?
- Talk amongst yourselves.
- Okay.
"The Ivory Tower".
"The Snow Fairy".
"The Virgin Queen".
Yeah, all right.
Good morning, Erica.
How...
What are you doing in the girls washroom?
Why... why isn't this the girls washroom?
I w...
- I was just at work and...
- "White Dreams".
Such an evocative name.
What?
What?
Okay, just before you go, this is something from...
You've got that out of your system, have you?
Yeah.
Good.
Please, come.
Sit down.
Sit down?
I-I-I have been looking for you everywhere.
- I mean, I have a million questions.
- I can imagine.
- You sent me back in time.
- Indeed.
Very glamorous, I know.
How did you do it?
No, I mean, more importantly, why, why, why did you pick me?
Samuel Johnson said:
"The use of travelling is to regulate imagination by reality, and instead of thinking how things may be, to see them, as they are."
Tell me about...
regret number seven.
- Tell me why you picked me.
- Well, why not you?
- Is your life so insignificant?
- No, but I...
Oh, well, good then.
Your list, please.
Hold on, hold on, I have some questions to ask and I think, at the very least, I'm entitled to ask them, I mean, you kind of made me destroy my car.
We made a contract.
And in order for that contract to work, you have to trust me.
I do.
And you have to trust that my number one regret is Leo.
Please send me back to him.
- I mean, I can, I can warn him.
- No you can't.
You can't go back to fix other peoples' mistakes.
And you can't go back to win the lottery, or to bet on the Stanley Cup, or to save your brother's life.
This, Erica, is about you.
It's your list, it's your regrets.
It's you.
So, tell me about... number seven.
Secret Society.
Secret Society.
Wow.
It was 1995, I was in my second year at university, and I thought that I knew everything.
Normally, I'm not one for confrontation, but when it came to books and literature,
I'd fight my arguments to the death.
And more often than not, it was me versus Antigone Kim.
Literati must have seen something in me and my passion because that year, they tapped me to join.
Graveyard.
Midnight.
Bring a dress.
I mean, that's all the invite said.
Literati was the most respected club on campus.
They only invite a handful of people to join each year.
So...
I mean, I was flattered.
The cool kids wanted to hang out with me, but the initiation process, it proved to be too much... too gothic... robes and masks.
And then they asked us to attack each other, verbally.
And I always liked debating with Antigone in class, but for fun?
I mean, that's just not me.
My gut told me to walk away, so, I quit.
And you regret it.
Why?
Because, in retrospect, I mean, it was a short-sighted decision.
"We are the sum of our decisions, and as long as you're happy that's all it matters."
Antigone Morris.
The thing is, I'm not... happy.
I mean, I could've just gone along with it and I should have.
And if you had joined?
Membership has its privileges.
Just look what it did for Antigone.
If I could do it over, I would...
I would join Literati, and I would do their silly little initiation, and I would get on the right path.
The path that I should've been on all along.
Say "no" to tuition increases.
Say "no" to tuition increases.
Education is a right!
We will fight and fight!
Say "no" to tuition increases.
- What are you doing up front there?
- I have no idea!
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
- Fascists!
- No more fees!
- Move back!
- Let go of me.
Come on, let's get out of here.
What, they think they scare me with their laws and their rules?
You know, you can arrest the body, but the spirit you'll never chain.
I'm late for a women's studies.
- Claire's incredible, isn't she?
- Yeah, that's one word to describe her.
Underneath all that angst and aggression and confidence, she's actually really insecure.
Her parents are rich.
I mean, megabucks.
She never tells anyone because she thinks if people knew,
- it would compromise her message.
- Compromise her message?
I know, she over thinks things, but... in a cute way.
Don't ever tell Claire I told you.
She'd totally kill me.
I won't.
Hey, guys, wait up!
Oh my god.
Judith, look at you.
Look at me?
Look at you.
You're covered in dirt.
Oh god, you radicals really gross me out.
Okay, this is worse than that time right before senior prom, when you got that nasty spiral perm.
Oh, and you had to...
straighten it with your flat iron.
You know, I totally forgot about that.
Forgot?
It was like two years ago.
She's been like this all day.
I think she got beaned by a rock.
Uh, sorry, I thought it was grass.
Freaks.
Uh, yeah, don't do that.
Class.
Today we'll continue talking about James Joyce's modernist masterpiece,
"Ulysses."
Erica, why don't you lead the discussion.
Um, me, Professor Bristow?
Breslow.
And yes, you.
Pick up where we left off.
On the use of "yes, yes, yes" at novel's end?
Okay, just give me one second, it's been a while... since... since our... our last class.
Should I answer, Professor Breslow?
No, that's fine.
I got it.
Thanks.
it was about joyce's, uh, determination to reinstate the male dominated perspectiv in opposition to, um...
Perhaps what Erica is...
trying to say, is that the use of phallo-centric language, like,
"the scrotum tightening sea", was, uh,
- in the parlance of the times, a clear...
- Thank you, by the way,
- for telling me what I was trying to say.
- Cat fight!
Can we get back to the material, please, and put aside our petty rivalries?
- You dropped this.
- Thank you.
Who was that?
No one.
Hey, listen, you guys,
I'm gonna catch up with you back at rez, okay?
This Literati initiation is hugely competitive.
And just so you know, my mom had twins.
Only one of us made it out alive.
Pass the skull and take a card.
Each card has a match.
That is your opponent.
Jokers, step forward.
Use the truth to attack each other.
Don't sensor yourselves.
Go.
I'm Erica Strange.
Daughter of aninsurance salesman.
Granddaughter of a brick layer.
I'm sorry, what's your family crest?
A 20% off coupon?
Oh, you're so obscenely wealthy,
I'm surprised you even know about coupons.
And by the way, shouldn't the silver spoon be in your mouth, not up your ass?
You know, the only reason why you're getting an "A" in our english class is
- because you must be screwing the professor.
- The only reason why you're getting an "A-"
is because you must be screwing the professor.
That's enough.
Thank you both.
You will be moving on to our next round.
You want us to bury ourselves alive?
We want you to bury each other alive.
Refuse, and forfeit membership in our club.
You... you... you, you and you.
You five will be buried first, for 15 minutes.
Climb in the graves and lie in the caskets.
Close the lids.
Tonight if we learn to face our fears, they no longer have power over us.
Grab a shovel.
Bury them.
Fill the entire hole.
No, wait.
Hold on, wait!
It's okay, he's facing his fears.
Wait, I can't breathe!
Let me out, please!
Please, let me out right now!
Please!
Please, let me out!
I can't breathe!
Let me out, please!
Let me outta here, please!
I can't breathe!
'Kay, wait-wait-wait, wait-wait-wait, he's...
He's having a panic attack, he's freaking out.
Everything will be fine.
Erica and Antigone, pick up your shovels.
Pick them up.
Do what we say.
Trust us.
Have faith.
Are you okay?
!
- Please let me out!
- What are we doing?
Screw this.
I can't breathe!
Let me outta here, please!
Please!
- Oh, god.
- I want to suck your blood.
You... you and you.
Go!
You have not passed our test.
What is it?
That's not funny.
Welcome to Literati.
I wish I had a polaroid.
The looks on your faces were priceless.
"We don't want to bury these dudes alive."
Funny.
Hey, over there, isn't that...
Our former Prime Minister?
Yup.
You know, the vast majority of people in your situation tonight just follow orders.
But you two, you think for yourselves.
Your minds are free from convention.
"Veritas vos liberabit."
The truth will set you free.
And joining the Literati is not simply a social affair.
Our most important work is published in our zine, the punisher.
- The "slam" paper?
- It's not a "slam" paper or a gossip rag.
- Our next cover.
- Ah, yes.
Let me guess, you're thinking, Claire does so much good for us students.
The thing is, 10 students got arrested today because of her.
They all now have criminal records.
I don't trust her.
I never have.
- You're friends with Claire.
- Not exactly.
I'm... dig.
Get to the truth.
Pull your weight and earn your place.
Fail, and your membership will be revoked.
Leo, don't be long.
Andre is meeting us in 10.
Mom hasn't heard from you in, like, 48 hours, so... she sent me here to make sure...
Oh, that I wasn't abducted by aliens?
Hey, why don't you come in?
I'll make you breakfast.
You'll make me cereal?
Uh, look, I got plans with the guys, but...
Here.
I made it for your next rave or protest, or...
- whatever.
- Oh, wow, I love it.
Thank you.
- Hey, what happened?
- Yeah, uh...
Darryl and I snuck up onto the long cement thing outside the front of city hall.
It looked like a good place to board.
Leo, you gotta take better care of yourself.
- Seriously.
- Okay, mom!
Why don't you lecture me about eating my vegetables and not dropping out of university.
Wear that in peace.
Thanks.
For this.
You don't know how much this means.
Excuse me, you don't happen to make lattes, do...
Dr. Tom.
You're in a hairnet.
Keeps the crude out of the crudites.
Ah, no.
No lattes.
But I do have carrot sticks.
So... what up?
What up.
Okay, let's see.
Since I've been back, I've buried someone alive.
- Literati, kinda dramatic.
- Kind of?
And the head honcho, Barrett Ironside?
He's a total head case.
A head case who is now a powerful hollywood producer, thanks to his Literati connections,
- and his flair for the dramatic.
- He wants me to destroy Claire.
"Those who plot the destruction of others often perish in the attempt."
Thomas Moore.
Okay.
And what about those who pulverize their husband's hearts
- into tiny little shards of glass?
- Hard to say.
Claire le Duc, she is a liar and a cheater.
And it is your job, your mission, to meet out to justice.
No, I...
Well, I wouldn't say that exactly, but... if Antigone, if she knew what I knew...
She'd have thrown Claire to the lions, of course.
It's that killing spirit which has made Antigone such a success in life.
Exactly.
Killing spirit, that doesn't sound like me.
And that's the reason why I walked away from Literati in the first place.
But Claire, she's...
she is a spoiled little brat that has pulled the wool over everyone's eyes, including Ethan, and she deserves to go down.
- You're sounding nothing like yourself already.
- If I want to achieve anything,
I gotta be a little bit less like me and a little bit more like them.
The egg.
Perfection, both in function and in form.
It has a double arch, top and bottom.
It's what makes an egg so incredibly strong.
But the minute that we begin to chip away at its integrity, the egg collapses in on itself until, in the end, we're left with only... breakfast.
It's still an egg, but it's not the same.
I was so inspired by our last protest, that I've decided to get everyone to chain themselves to the front doors of the registrar's office tomorrow.
Me and hundreds of students.
Like that's true solidarity.
Good morning to you too, Claire.
Erica.
Always so hung up on propriety.
You know, your conventional ways will hold you back.
Wow, you-you really...
you don't have a filter, do you?
Well, what good is filtering the truth?
I just say it like it is.
I am myself, Claire, always.
Oh, really?
And what... what was that down there with the guy and the posters?
Hmm?
Oh my god, Erica, you anglos are so repressed.
Flirting is not cheating.
What, you think Ethan never looks around?
I think that Ethan loves you very much and would put up with a lot from you.
I think you're very lucky to have someone like him.
Yeah, well, Ethan knows me.
He knows where I stand and I would never cheat on him.
Okay, so, let me get this straight.
You're a girl from the wrong side of the tracks, who's fighting against tuition hikes, who always tells the truth, and would never, ever cheat and break my best friend's heart.
- That's you?
- That's right.
Take it or leave it.
Look, I'm telling you, this professor is notorious for breaking her students.
Okay, cast members from her last production said she practiced psychological warfare because "that's the way it works in the theatre world."
Tough prof, so what?
This prof, who claims to have been a professional actress, was really just a stage manager.
Total liar.
That has potential.
Good work.
Strange, you got some competition here.
So?
What do you got?
Um, actually, I, um...
I don't have anything.
Big surprise.
Okay.
What if I told you that Claire le Duc, the working class joan of arc, is actually Claire St. Armand, the daughter of one of Montreal's richest businessmen?
Nice.
"La duchess's cries of poverty are actually a cry for help.
Claire, it seems, is so privileged, she can even afford multiple personalities."
Damn, is this true?
Her being loaded?
I, I guess so.
What else did they say?
I don't know, it's brutal.
I mean, whoever wrote this is...
I don't know, kind of psychotic.
Well, would you look at that, I'm late for class, on the other side of campus.
- Judith, do not abandon me.
- Gotta go.
Hi.
Hey, Claire.
- You see the paper?
- Uh, yeah, I did.
I was trying to help the students, you know?
I was trying to do something good.
I wanted it to be about what I said and what I did, not about my parents and their money, their influence.
They have nothing to do with this.
Wanna eat a piece of my cake?
Look, just ignore him, clearly...
That guy is an idiot!
Everything I worked for is ruined.
I was coming to find you.
I wanna talk.
Let's do this inside.
If you did what I think you did to Claire...
I can't believe it, you went after my girlfriend.
- She lied to everyone.
- You do not get to judge her!
How do you know that she's not lying to you?
I'm not talking about this.
You know, you don't even know the whole story.
Her parents hate what she's doing, what she's becoming.
They've practically disowned her.
I...
I didn't know that.
The punisher asked you to dig up dirt for their own reasons.
What were yours?
She did it out of insecurity and worry people would judge her.
But you, Erica?
I don't think I know you.
Uh, interference, meaning I get to hit again.
Thank you, Erica, always coming through.
I take it you saw our little newspaper?
I saw Claire.
Not a happy anarchist.
You guys, you really went to town.
- Well, we went as far as the truth permitted.
- Throw in a little flair and every last issue was snapped up.
Look, I made a mistake.
I had no right to tell you about Claire.
All you did was tell the truth.
I am this close to giving you our next issue.
I don't want it.
Look, getting to the truth is one thing, but you guys, you... you relish the humiliation.
Degrading someone is fun for you.
But that is not who I am.
So, I quit.
You understand what you're giving up?
You quit and that's it.
Believe me, I understand.
But the price of admission is way too high.
So, the point is we want to block the entrance.
So let's... handcuff ourselves to each other and to the door handle.
Here to dig up more dirt on me?
I'm sorry.
No, but don't apologize to me, apologize to the hundreds of students that won't be able to afford tuition.
Okay.
Yeah.
No, fine.
I will, I'll do it.
I'll do whatever it takes.
What I did was wrong and I really regret it.
Sit, sit!
Education is a right!
We will fight, fight, fight!
Education is a right!
We will fight, fight, fight!
So, I guess you've made it through your first morning.
Before you know it, you're gonna be my rock.
Like, like Jean.
Who's Jean?
Oh, uh, over there.
Jean, you've been with me since... what?
Since we were nothing but a little storage unit in Etobicoke.
Welcome to the team.
Okey-dokey, well, I have got to get to a conference call, you've got some photo copying to do.
Thanks a lot.
And after that, let's go out for a little celebratory lunch.
And, and by lunch, I do mean liquid.
Could you, like, give me a warning sign or something?
Please, have a seat.
Okay, but look.
- For the record, I get it.
- What?
I ended up right back where I started.
I mean, Literati, it's clearly not for me.
And...
I just need to learn to...
be happy with what I have.
As in the cubicle?
Are you happy at "White Dreams"?
- No.
But that's different, it's...
- Our lives are like a house of cards.
You know, some of the cards are... cosmetic.
While others are load bearing walls.
You remove one of those cards and the whole thing comes tumbling down.
- Like the egg.
- Like the egg.
Chip away at what makes you "you" and you become something else.
Your gut told you to avoid Literati the first time around, and you were right to listen to that.
There are many ways to achieve our goals, Erica, but ignoring your inner voice... is not one of them.
So... tell me.
Is this job the right job for you?
No.
Oh, sorry.
Sorry.
No-no, that wasn't my shih tzu, that was me.
Look, I, um...
I'll have to call you back.
Erica, are you trying to kill me?
This face?
Not as young as it looks.
Uncle Ruby, I quit.
And I appreciate so much, this opportunity, but it just... it isn't right.
You haven't even given it a day.
That's just the thing, I don't need to.
I know that it's wrong... for me.
The wedding biz, it's what you always wanted to do, right?
I used to dress your mom up in your bubble's lace curtains when I was six.
Exactly!
You knew.
And I feel that...
You know what?
I know that... there is something out there that I'm supposed to do, and I wanna take the time, right now, to find it.
You know, maybe it's books?
Oh, you could read on your lunch breaks?
Oh, okay.
Okay, okay, fine.
Come here.
Come here.
Now, go.
Go, go-go-go-go-go.
Do what you have to do.
Your mom may not understand, but I do.
And I'll...
I'll talk to her.
Though, I can't promise she won't disembowel me.
Thank you, Uncle Ruby, for everything.
Well, you're right, I mean, it is a little small, but the layout is... is pretty good.
And there's tons of storage.
Yeah, and the rent's cheapish, of course, compared to Montreal.
Well, you can't compare anything to Montreal rent.
Bagels?
Mmm.
It's, uh, right next door, that's not gonna be weird?
No, I don't think so.
Doesn't feel like uh... we're regressing.
Like we've living back in residence?
Yeah, just minus the, uh, the co-ed showers?
No, I think it will be fine.
Besides, rez is where we became best buds.
Totally.
And... where you almost fired me as your friend.
What're you talking about?
You remember... in second year, when I almost joined Literati?
And sold out Claire.
- You remember?
- Yeah, I remember that.
Do you ever wish...
I mean, especially now, given everything that's going on with you and Claire...
What?
Do you ever wish that you would had listened to me and... you know, saved yourself a lot of heartache?
No.
Really?
I mean, she's destroyed my life, but she was my life for a long time, you know?
So, I don't see any reason why I shouldn't take this place.
Great!
Oh, we're gonna have so much fun.
Jenny and Judith, they're gonna be really jealous.
Oh, that's me.
River Rock Pub?
River Rock Publishing.
Oh my god.
Answer it!
Hello.
This is she.
Next week?
Sure, of course I can make it.
Three o'clock?
Mm-hmm.
No, that's...
No, I know where the offices are.
Great.
Okay, thank you.
That's great.
Congratulations.
I got an interview.
You got an apartment.
Global justice now!
Everyone's got their own path.
Some are only just beginning.
While others end all too soon.
However you do it, the fact is, the path you're on, the choices you make, define who you are.
Choices, they're the building blocks of our lives.
They shape our past, present and future and despite all the stakes I've made, every new day brings with it new choices and a whole new world of possibilities.
Previously on Being Erica...
- Erica strange.
- That's me.
- What happened?
- I'm allergic to nuts, and I had this mocha mint lappa...
Was there any almonds or walnuts in that latte?
Yeah, it's actually "The hazelnut mocha mint latte".
Anything else happen today?
Yes, I was fired from my job and dumped.
So, all in all, a pretty bad day.
You're a doctor, right?
- I'm a therapist.
- I don't need a therapist.
You know, I always thought I'd grow up and I'd have an amazing life.
- What happened to that?
- I blew it.
There's so many things that I would've done differently.
Like what?
What are they, these regrets of yours?
If you could go back, what would you do differently?
Is there a window open in here?
It's really cold.
Help me.
Wait-wait-wait.
Katie, what year is it?
You're hilarious.
This isn't happening.
You think I'm supposed to accept that I'm just like, what, time travelling?
Because this...
this can't be for real.
- Feels real enough.
- It's time for me to go home.
But our next session will begin shortly.
I have your list.
- Oh no, wait-wait-wait, wait, wait!
- We have a lot of work to do, you and me.
Where do I go from here?
A resume, it tells a story.
School, job, hobbies.
It's a snapshot of who we are.
What makes the best impression?
The masters in english lit, for sure.
I don't know.
I think you should go with work experience.
I mean, client representative has heft.
Heft?
No it doesn't.
I was a glorified operator, Judith.
Okay, the masters then.
And at the end of the day, it all comes down to the choices we've made.
This, this is what I've done with my life in ten years.
Wow.
I did a huge workopolis search for you.
Pulled out everything I thought might interest you.
Okay, what do we go here?
Jobs in education, advertising... mortuary science?
- Baby boomers are dying off.
- Hey, wait a minute!
Publishing.
- I like books.
- Yeah, you love books.
That is why I included at least a dozen publishing jobs.
I feel strangely excited.
Why don't you come over tonight and celebrate?
Ethan is coming to town from Montreal, total last minute.
The three of us will crack, open a bottle of wine...
- Wine?
- Or... fizzy... grape juice stuff?
I'm so sorry.
Worst friend ever.
Have you told anyone, yet?
No.
I'm gonna wait for the end of the first trimester, so...
- Okay, hey, mums the word.
- Okay.
All right, I'm gonna get changed and hand deliver these suckers.
- All right.
- Thank you so much.
Choices.
Look close enough and you can see them everywhere.
But what do you do when you see your life as a series of bad choices?
When you would give anything to have made different ones, the questions is:
If you could go back and do it all differently, would you still be you?
Sorry.
My apologies.
- Hi, there.
- Hi, can I help you?
Yes, I'm just here to drop off a resume for the assistant position.
The assistant position.
The assistant to the managing editor of fiction.
All right, so, just contact four or five blurbers for the pre-publication endorsements, see if they'd be willing to... uh...
Oh, I'll see you in a sec.
Erica Strange.
- Oh...
Antigone Kim.
- It's Antigone Morris now.
Wow!
Congratulations.
So, uh... so, do you work here?
Yeah.
I head up green row'sfiction division.
Wow, so, um...
Seeing you again is just...
- I don't know, it's crazy, hunh?
- Yeah, it's really crazy.
My god, do you remember all those pompous debates we used to have about...
god, whatever?
Right.
We were really competitive back in the day, you know?
Sometimes it's great to read a book, just to read a book.
Yeah.
Not if you wanna be an editor.
Yeah...
So, how did you end up in publishing?
Well, do you remember "Literati"?
That "not so secret" society I was in?
Yes, they tapped me to join as well.
That's right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
My boss is here?
Literati.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Literati members like to help each other.
And it doesn't hurt to have friends in high places, if know what I mean?
So, um...
Oh, you're applying for a job... to be my assistant.
Yeah, I'm kind of in the middle of a career change right now.
So...
Unfortunately, that position's been filled.
I just hired this bright young thing,
- right out of her masters.
- Let me guess, Literati?
Well, we are... the sum of our decisions, aren't we?
Yeah.
As long as you're happy, that's all that matters.
It was really great seeing you again.
Bye.
"We're the sum of our decisions, aren't we?"
I guess we are.
Dr. Tom?
Hey, Dr. Tom!

Your car is not even worth a thousand dollars.
It's 15 years old.
I know, but the suspension is scattered all over Bedford Road.
I mean, I either give her up or I pay the money.
Oh my god.
Sam, that dress is gorgeous.
- I like it.
- All that running around and nobody even called you for an interview?
I'm still trying to look.
You can't expect me to find something in one day.
Well, if it doesn't work out, you can always work for me.
Work for you?
Well, a Toronto account executive just retired, so if you can handle lunches at holt's and martinis with wedding planners...
- Oh, Erica loves martinis.
- Mom.
We offer competitive wages and, uh, benefits.
- Dental!
- I don't even know anything about weddings, people.
Well, what's there to know?
Boy meets girl, boy woos girl, girl blows $10,000 on a lovely pile of lace and organza.
- Oh, save your breath, Ruby.
My daughter thinks she's too good to work for your successful business.
- I do not.
- Mom, leave her alone.
- Thank you, Sam.
I'm just saying, she might wanna consider saying yes to her uncle who's trying to help her.
I'm not saying no.
Would you just give me a second to think about it.
Look, Uncle Ruby.
If...
I were to come and work for you, I mean, it would... it would just be a temporary thing and I'd...
- I'd like to be up front about that.
- Be up front all you want.
All I'm saying is, it's a good group of people, we have a lot of laughs; you'd enjoy yourself.
When can Erica start?
Mom.
Ethan?
!
Oh, I am so sorry.
It's just... the craziest day.
- And you're always late.
- I know, I know.
- What, are you moving in?
- Um, yeah.
I thought I'd sleep in your bathtub.
I did not have a poster of "The Kiss" up on my wall.
Yes, you did.
It was right above your desk.
- No, that was Judith.
- No, that was you.
You bought it at that poster sale in first year.
- Why are you my friend again?
- And do I need to remind you about the uh...
- toaster oven incident?
- No, but you're going to.
Who installs a heat source underneath their bed?
Uh, oh!
That's right, you do.
Like I'm gonna get out of bed to make nachos.
And that, my friend, is the last of it.
I start a new job tomorrow, so...
- no hangover for this girl.
- A new job?
Doing what?
Um, account executive... at my Uncle Ruby's bridal company "White Dreams"
- Wet Dreams?
- White Dreams, you perv.
Wow.
Well, congratulations.
- I guess.
- No, I mean, it-it's gonna be great.
It's, uh... pays the bills, it's downtown, there's dental!
You're, you're just not happy for me at all.
Sorry, I can't go "rah-rah-rah" over something you think is a mistake.
Ha!
Okay, Mr. Honesty, what's with all the luggage?
I left Claire.
Oh my god.
Ethan, what happened?
- She was cheating on me.
- What?
!
Okay, that's bullshit.
She was cheating on you and you had to leave?
Well, her dad owns half the city of Montreal.
He bought us our house in Outremont.
All our friends are her friends.
Feels like there's nothing left there for me.
So, where are you going to stay?
My parents have a granny suite.
No, you're not gonna stay in your parents' basement, you're gonna stay here with me.
Where?
I...
I was joking about the tub.
This place is too small.
Okay, we'll...
we'll find somewhere.
We'll look and we'll get you a place.
I prise you, I'm gonna get you sorted out.
I know.
Morning.
It's magnetic.
Okay, yeah, this way, through here.
Now your catchment zone is gonna be the downtown core.
That's home to some of the most discerning bridal houses in the city.
So you're gonna be dealing with people who are...
Well, okay, they can be prissy little pains in my ass.
Do I ever get to meet any real bridezillas?
O... oh, no-no-no-no-no, no, no, no, no.
We don't have to get our hands dirty with any of that.
White Dreams is strictly import/export.
Ah, now, here you are, right through here.
Go on.
Sit down.
Make yourself at home.
This is your domain.
It's best that you get to know each of our dresses by name, okay?
- Talk amongst yourselves.
- Okay.
"The Ivory Tower".
"The Snow Fairy".
"The Virgin Queen".
Yeah, all right.
Good morning, Erica.
How...
What are you doing in the girls washroom?
Why... why isn't this the girls washroom?
I w...
- I was just at work and...
- "White Dreams".
Such an evocative name.
What?
What?
Okay, just before you go, this is something from...
You've got that out of your system, have you?
Yeah.
Good.
Please, come.
Sit down.
Sit down?
I-I-I have been looking for you everywhere.
- I mean, I have a million questions.
- I can imagine.
- You sent me back in time.
- Indeed.
Very glamorous, I know.
How did you do it?
No, I mean, more importantly, why, why, why did you pick me?
Samuel Johnson said:
"The use of travelling is to regulate imagination by reality, and instead of thinking how things may be, to see them, as they are."
Tell me about...
regret number seven.
- Tell me why you picked me.
- Well, why not you?
- Is your life so insignificant?
- No, but I...
Oh, well, good then.
Your list, please.
Hold on, hold on, I have some questions to ask and I think, at the very least, I'm entitled to ask them, I mean, you kind of made me destroy my car.
We made a contract.
And in order for that contract to work, you have to trust me.
I do.
And you have to trust that my number one regret is Leo.
Please send me back to him.
- I mean, I can, I can warn him.
- No you can't.
You can't go back to fix other peoples' mistakes.
And you can't go back to win the lottery, or to bet on the Stanley Cup, or to save your brother's life.
This, Erica, is about you.
It's your list, it's your regrets.
It's you.
So, tell me about... number seven.
Secret Society.
Secret Society.
Wow.
It was 1995, I was in my second year at university, and I thought that I knew everything.
Normally, I'm not one for confrontation, but when it came to books and literature,
I'd fight my arguments to the death.
And more often than not, it was me versus Antigone Kim.
Literati must have seen something in me and my passion because that year, they tapped me to join.
Graveyard.
Midnight.
Bring a dress.
I mean, that's all the invite said.
Literati was the most respected club on campus.
They only invite a handful of people to join each year.
So...
I mean, I was flattered.
The cool kids wanted to hang out with me, but the initiation process, it proved to be too much... too gothic... robes and masks.
And then they asked us to attack each other, verbally.
And I always liked debating with Antigone in class, but for fun?
I mean, that's just not me.
My gut told me to walk away, so, I quit.
And you regret it.
Why?
Because, in retrospect, I mean, it was a short-sighted decision.
"We are the sum of our decisions, and as long as you're happy that's all it matters."
Antigone Morris.
The thing is, I'm not... happy.
I mean, I could've just gone along with it and I should have.
And if you had joined?
Membership has its privileges.
Just look what it did for Antigone.
If I could do it over, I would...
I would join Literati, and I would do their silly little initiation, and I would get on the right path.
The path that I should've been on all along.
Say "no" to tuition increases.
Say "no" to tuition increases.
Education is a right!
We will fight and fight!
Say "no" to tuition increases.
- What are you doing up front there?
- I have no idea!
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
- Fascists!
- No more fees!
- Move back!
- Let go of me.
Come on, let's get out of here.
What, they think they scare me with their laws and their rules?
You know, you can arrest the body, but the spirit you'll never chain.
I'm late for a women's studies.
- Claire's incredible, isn't she?
- Yeah, that's one word to describe her.
Underneath all that angst and aggression and confidence, she's actually really insecure.
Her parents are rich.
I mean, megabucks.
She never tells anyone because she thinks if people knew,
- it would compromise her message.
- Compromise her message?
I know, she over thinks things, but... in a cute way.
Don't ever tell Claire I told you.
She'd totally kill me.
I won't.
Hey, guys, wait up!
Oh my god.
Judith, look at you.
Look at me?
Look at you.
You're covered in dirt.
Oh god, you radicals really gross me out.
Okay, this is worse than that time right before senior prom, when you got that nasty spiral perm.
Oh, and you had to...
straighten it with your flat iron.
You know, I totally forgot about that.
Forgot?
It was like two years ago.
She's been like this all day.
I think she got beaned by a rock.
Uh, sorry, I thought it was grass.
Freaks.
Uh, yeah, don't do that.
Class.
Today we'll continue talking about James Joyce's modernist masterpiece,
"Ulysses."
Erica, why don't you lead the discussion.
Um, me, Professor Bristow?
Breslow.
And yes, you.
Pick up where we left off.
On the use of "yes, yes, yes" at novel's end?
Okay, just give me one second, it's been a while... since... since our... our last class.
Should I answer, Professor Breslow?
No, that's fine.
I got it.
Thanks.
it was about joyce's, uh, determination to reinstate the male dominated perspectiv in opposition to, um...
Perhaps what Erica is...
trying to say, is that the use of phallo-centric language, like,
"the scrotum tightening sea", was, uh,
- in the parlance of the times, a clear...
- Thank you, by the way,
- for telling me what I was trying to say.
- Cat fight!
Can we get back to the material, please, and put aside our petty rivalries?
- You dropped this.
- Thank you.
Who was that?
No one.
Hey, listen, you guys,
I'm gonna catch up with you back at rez, okay?
This Literati initiation is hugely competitive.
And just so you know, my mom had twins.
Only one of us made it out alive.
Pass the skull and take a card.
Each card has a match.
That is your opponent.
Jokers, step forward.
Use the truth to attack each other.
Don't sensor yourselves.
Go.
I'm Erica Strange.
Daughter of aninsurance salesman.
Granddaughter of a brick layer.
I'm sorry, what's your family crest?
A 20% off coupon?
Oh, you're so obscenely wealthy,
I'm surprised you even know about coupons.
And by the way, shouldn't the silver spoon be in your mouth, not up your ass?
You know, the only reason why you're getting an "A" in our english class is
- because you must be screwing the professor.
- The only reason why you're getting an "A-"
is because you must be screwing the professor.
That's enough.
Thank you both.
You will be moving on to our next round.
You want us to bury ourselves alive?
We want you to bury each other alive.
Refuse, and forfeit membership in our club.
You... you... you, you and you.
You five will be buried first, for 15 minutes.
Climb in the graves and lie in the caskets.
Close the lids.
Tonight if we learn to face our fears, they no longer have power over us.
Grab a shovel.
Bury them.
Fill the entire hole.
No, wait.
Hold on, wait!
It's okay, he's facing his fears.
Wait, I can't breathe!
Let me out, please!
Please, let me out right now!
Please!
Please, let me out!
I can't breathe!
Let me out, please!
Let me outta here, please!
I can't breathe!
'Kay, wait-wait-wait, wait-wait-wait, he's...
He's having a panic attack, he's freaking out.
Everything will be fine.
Erica and Antigone, pick up your shovels.
Pick them up.
Do what we say.
Trust us.
Have faith.
Are you okay?
!
- Please let me out!
- What are we doing?
Screw this.
I can't breathe!
Let me outta here, please!
Please!
- Oh, god.
- I want to suck your blood.
You... you and you.
Go!
You have not passed our test.
What is it?
That's not funny.
Welcome to Literati.
I wish I had a polaroid.
The looks on your faces were priceless.
"We don't want to bury these dudes alive."
Funny.
Hey, over there, isn't that...
Our former Prime Minister?
Yup.
You know, the vast majority of people in your situation tonight just follow orders.
But you two, you think for yourselves.
Your minds are free from convention.
"Veritas vos liberabit."
The truth will set you free.
And joining the Literati is not simply a social affair.
Our most important work is published in our zine, the punisher.
- The "slam" paper?
- It's not a "slam" paper or a gossip rag.
- Our next cover.
- Ah, yes.
Let me guess, you're thinking, Claire does so much good for us students.
The thing is, 10 students got arrested today because of her.
They all now have criminal records.
I don't trust her.
I never have.
- You're friends with Claire.
- Not exactly.
I'm... dig.
Get to the truth.
Pull your weight and earn your place.
Fail, and your membership will be revoked.
Leo, don't be long.
Andre is meeting us in 10.
Mom hasn't heard from you in, like, 48 hours, so... she sent me here to make sure...
Oh, that I wasn't abducted by aliens?
Hey, why don't you come in?
I'll make you breakfast.
You'll make me cereal?
Uh, look, I got plans with the guys, but...
Here.
I made it for your next rave or protest, or...
- whatever.
- Oh, wow, I love it.
Thank you.
- Hey, what happened?
- Yeah, uh...
Darryl and I snuck up onto the long cement thing outside the front of city hall.
It looked like a good place to board.
Leo, you gotta take better care of yourself.
- Seriously.
- Okay, mom!
Why don't you lecture me about eating my vegetables and not dropping out of university.
Wear that in peace.
Thanks.
For this.
You don't know how much this means.
Excuse me, you don't happen to make lattes, do...
Dr. Tom.
You're in a hairnet.
Keeps the crude out of the crudites.
Ah, no.
No lattes.
But I do have carrot sticks.
So... what up?
What up.
Okay, let's see.
Since I've been back, I've buried someone alive.
- Literati, kinda dramatic.
- Kind of?
And the head honcho, Barrett Ironside?
He's a total head case.
A head case who is now a powerful hollywood producer, thanks to his Literati connections,
- and his flair for the dramatic.
- He wants me to destroy Claire.
"Those who plot the destruction of others often perish in the attempt."
Thomas Moore.
Okay.
And what about those who pulverize their husband's hearts
- into tiny little shards of glass?
- Hard to say.
Claire le Duc, she is a liar and a cheater.
And it is your job, your mission, to meet out to justice.
No, I...
Well, I wouldn't say that exactly, but... if Antigone, if she knew what I knew...
She'd have thrown Claire to the lions, of course.
It's that killing spirit which has made Antigone such a success in life.
Exactly.
Killing spirit, that doesn't sound like me.
And that's the reason why I walked away from Literati in the first place.
But Claire, she's...
she is a spoiled little brat that has pulled the wool over everyone's eyes, including Ethan, and she deserves to go down.
- You're sounding nothing like yourself already.
- If I want to achieve anything,
I gotta be a little bit less like me and a little bit more like them.
The egg.
Perfection, both in function and in form.
It has a double arch, top and bottom.
It's what makes an egg so incredibly strong.
But the minute that we begin to chip away at its integrity, the egg collapses in on itself until, in the end, we're left with only... breakfast.
It's still an egg, but it's not the same.
I was so inspired by our last protest, that I've decided to get everyone to chain themselves to the front doors of the registrar's office tomorrow.
Me and hundreds of students.
Like that's true solidarity.
Good morning to you too, Claire.
Erica.
Always so hung up on propriety.
You know, your conventional ways will hold you back.
Wow, you-you really...
you don't have a filter, do you?
Well, what good is filtering the truth?
I just say it like it is.
I am myself, Claire, always.
Oh, really?
And what... what was that down there with the guy and the posters?
Hmm?
Oh my god, Erica, you anglos are so repressed.
Flirting is not cheating.
What, you think Ethan never looks around?
I think that Ethan loves you very much and would put up with a lot from you.
I think you're very lucky to have someone like him.
Yeah, well, Ethan knows me.
He knows where I stand and I would never cheat on him.
Okay, so, let me get this straight.
You're a girl from the wrong side of the tracks, who's fighting against tuition hikes, who always tells the truth, and would never, ever cheat and break my best friend's heart.
- That's you?
- That's right.
Take it or leave it.
Look, I'm telling you, this professor is notorious for breaking her students.
Okay, cast members from her last production said she practiced psychological warfare because "that's the way it works in the theatre world."
Tough prof, so what?
This prof, who claims to have been a professional actress, was really just a stage manager.
Total liar.
That has potential.
Good work.
Strange, you got some competition here.
So?
What do you got?
Um, actually, I, um...
I don't have anything.
Big surprise.
Okay.
What if I told you that Claire le Duc, the working class joan of arc, is actually Claire St. Armand, the daughter of one of Montreal's richest businessmen?
Nice.
"La duchess's cries of poverty are actually a cry for help.
Claire, it seems, is so privileged, she can even afford multiple personalities."
Damn, is this true?
Her being loaded?
I, I guess so.
What else did they say?
I don't know, it's brutal.
I mean, whoever wrote this is...
I don't know, kind of psychotic.
Well, would you look at that, I'm late for class, on the other side of campus.
- Judith, do not abandon me.
- Gotta go.
Hi.
Hey, Claire.
- You see the paper?
- Uh, yeah, I did.
I was trying to help the students, you know?
I was trying to do something good.
I wanted it to be about what I said and what I did, not about my parents and their money, their influence.
They have nothing to do with this.
Wanna eat a piece of my cake?
Look, just ignore him, clearly...
That guy is an idiot!
Everything I worked for is ruined.
I was coming to find you.
I wanna talk.
Let's do this inside.
If you did what I think you did to Claire...
I can't believe it, you went after my girlfriend.
- She lied to everyone.
- You do not get to judge her!
How do you know that she's not lying to you?
I'm not talking about this.
You know, you don't even know the whole story.
Her parents hate what she's doing, what she's becoming.
They've practically disowned her.
I...
I didn't know that.
The punisher asked you to dig up dirt for their own reasons.
What were yours?
She did it out of insecurity and worry people would judge her.
But you, Erica?
I don't think I know you.
Uh, interference, meaning I get to hit again.
Thank you, Erica, always coming through.
I take it you saw our little newspaper?
I saw Claire.
Not a happy anarchist.
You guys, you really went to town.
- Well, we went as far as the truth permitted.
- Throw in a little flair and every last issue was snapped up.
Look, I made a mistake.
I had no right to tell you about Claire.
All you did was tell the truth.
I am this close to giving you our next issue.
I don't want it.
Look, getting to the truth is one thing, but you guys, you... you relish the humiliation.
Degrading someone is fun for you.
But that is not who I am.
So, I quit.
You understand what you're giving up?
You quit and that's it.
Believe me, I understand.
But the price of admission is way too high.
So, the point is we want to block the entrance.
So let's... handcuff ourselves to each other and to the door handle.
Here to dig up more dirt on me?
I'm sorry.
No, but don't apologize to me, apologize to the hundreds of students that won't be able to afford tuition.
Okay.
Yeah.
No, fine.
I will, I'll do it.
I'll do whatever it takes.
What I did was wrong and I really regret it.
Sit, sit!
Education is a right!
We will fight, fight, fight!
Education is a right!
We will fight, fight, fight!
So, I guess you've made it through your first morning.
Before you know it, you're gonna be my rock.
Like, like Jean.
Who's Jean?
Oh, uh, over there.
Jean, you've been with me since... what?
Since we were nothing but a little storage unit in Etobicoke.
Welcome to the team.
Okey-dokey, well, I have got to get to a conference call, you've got some photo copying to do.
Thanks a lot.
And after that, let's go out for a little celebratory lunch.
And, and by lunch, I do mean liquid.
Could you, like, give me a warning sign or something?
Please, have a seat.
Okay, but look.
- For the record, I get it.
- What?
I ended up right back where I started.
I mean, Literati, it's clearly not for me.
And...
I just need to learn to...
be happy with what I have.
As in the cubicle?
Are you happy at "White Dreams"?
- No.
But that's different, it's...
- Our lives are like a house of cards.
You know, some of the cards are... cosmetic.
While others are load bearing walls.
You remove one of those cards and the whole thing comes tumbling down.
- Like the egg.
- Like the egg.
Chip away at what makes you "you" and you become something else.
Your gut told you to avoid Literati the first time around, and you were right to listen to that.
There are many ways to achieve our goals, Erica, but ignoring your inner voice... is not one of them.
So... tell me.
Is this job the right job for you?
No.
Oh, sorry.
Sorry.
No-no, that wasn't my shih tzu, that was me.
Look, I, um...
I'll have to call you back.
Erica, are you trying to kill me?
This face?
Not as young as it looks.
Uncle Ruby, I quit.
And I appreciate so much, this opportunity, but it just... it isn't right.
You haven't even given it a day.
That's just the thing, I don't need to.
I know that it's wrong... for me.
The wedding biz, it's what you always wanted to do, right?
I used to dress your mom up in your bubble's lace curtains when I was six.
Exactly!
You knew.
And I feel that...
You know what?
I know that... there is something out there that I'm supposed to do, and I wanna take the time, right now, to find it.
You know, maybe it's books?
Oh, you could read on your lunch breaks?
Oh, okay.
Okay, okay, fine.
Come here.
Come here.
Now, go.
Go, go-go-go-go-go.
Do what you have to do.
Your mom may not understand, but I do.
And I'll...
I'll talk to her.
Though, I can't promise she won't disembowel me.
Thank you, Uncle Ruby, for everything.
Well, you're right, I mean, it is a little small, but the layout is... is pretty good.
And there's tons of storage.
Yeah, and the rent's cheapish, of course, compared to Montreal.
Well, you can't compare anything to Montreal rent.
Bagels?
Mmm.
It's, uh, right next door, that's not gonna be weird?
No, I don't think so.
Doesn't feel like uh... we're regressing.
Like we've living back in residence?
Yeah, just minus the, uh, the co-ed showers?
No, I think it will be fine.
Besides, rez is where we became best buds.
Totally.
And... where you almost fired me as your friend.
What're you talking about?
You remember... in second year, when I almost joined Literati?
And sold out Claire.
- You remember?
- Yeah, I remember that.
Do you ever wish...
I mean, especially now, given everything that's going on with you and Claire...
What?
Do you ever wish that you would had listened to me and... you know, saved yourself a lot of heartache?
No.
Really?
I mean, she's destroyed my life, but she was my life for a long time, you know?
So, I don't see any reason why I shouldn't take this place.
Great!
Oh, we're gonna have so much fun.
Jenny and Judith, they're gonna be really jealous.
Oh, that's me.
River Rock Pub?
River Rock Publishing.
Oh my god.
Answer it!
Hello.
This is she.
Next week?
Sure, of course I can make it.
Three o'clock?
Mm-hmm.
No, that's...
No, I know where the offices are.
Great.
Okay, thank you.
That's great.
Congratulations.
I got an interview.
You got an apartment.
Global justice now!
Everyone's got their own path.
Some are only just beginning.
While others end all too soon.
However you do it, the fact is, the path you're on, the choices you make, define who you are.
Choices, they're the building blocks of our lives.
They shape our past, present and future and despite all the stakes I've made, every new day brings with it new choices and a whole new world of possibilities.
Previously on Being Erica...
- Erica strange.
- That's me.
- What happened?
- I'm allergic to nuts, and I had this mocha mint lappa...
Was there any almonds or walnuts in that latte?
Yeah, it's actually "The hazelnut mocha mint latte".
Anything else happen today?
Yes, I was fired from my job and dumped.
So, all in all, a pretty bad day.
You're a doctor, right?
- I'm a therapist.
- I don't need a therapist.
You know, I always thought I'd grow up and I'd have an amazing life.
- What happened to that?
- I blew it.
There's so many things that I would've done differently.
Like what?
What are they, these regrets of yours?
If you could go back, what would you do differently?
Is there a window open in here?
It's really cold.
Help me.
Wait-wait-wait.
Katie, what year is it?
You're hilarious.
This isn't happening.
You think I'm supposed to accept that I'm just like, what, time travelling?
Because this...
this can't be for real.
- Feels real enough.
- It's time for me to go home.
But our next session will begin shortly.
I have your list.
- Oh no, wait-wait-wait, wait, wait!
- We have a lot of work to do, you and me.
Where do I go from here?
A resume, it tells a story.
School, job, hobbies.
It's a snapshot of who we are.
What makes the best impression?
The masters in english lit, for sure.
I don't know.
I think you should go with work experience.
I mean, client representative has heft.
Heft?
No it doesn't.
I was a glorified operator, Judith.
Okay, the masters then.
And at the end of the day, it all comes down to the choices we've made.
This, this is what I've done with my life in ten years.
Wow.
I did a huge workopolis search for you.
Pulled out everything I thought might interest you.
Okay, what do we go here?
Jobs in education, advertising... mortuary science?
- Baby boomers are dying off.
- Hey, wait a minute!
Publishing.
- I like books.
- Yeah, you love books.
That is why I included at least a dozen publishing jobs.
I feel strangely excited.
Why don't you come over tonight and celebrate?
Ethan is coming to town from Montreal, total last minute.
The three of us will crack, open a bottle of wine...
- Wine?
- Or... fizzy... grape juice stuff?
I'm so sorry.
Worst friend ever.
Have you told anyone, yet?
No.
I'm gonna wait for the end of the first trimester, so...
- Okay, hey, mums the word.
- Okay.
All right, I'm gonna get changed and hand deliver these suckers.
- All right.
- Thank you so much.
Choices.
Look close enough and you can see them everywhere.
But what do you do when you see your life as a series of bad choices?
When you would give anything to have made different ones, the questions is:
If you could go back and do it all differently, would you still be you?
Sorry.
My apologies.
- Hi, there.
- Hi, can I help you?
Yes, I'm just here to drop off a resume for the assistant position.
The assistant position.
The assistant to the managing editor of fiction.
All right, so, just contact four or five blurbers for the pre-publication endorsements, see if they'd be willing to... uh...
Oh, I'll see you in a sec.
Erica Strange.
- Oh...
Antigone Kim.
- It's Antigone Morris now.
Wow!
Congratulations.
So, uh... so, do you work here?
Yeah.
I head up green row'sfiction division.
Wow, so, um...
Seeing you again is just...
- I don't know, it's crazy, hunh?
- Yeah, it's really crazy.
My god, do you remember all those pompous debates we used to have about...
god, whatever?
Right.
We were really competitive back in the day, you know?
Sometimes it's great to read a book, just to read a book.
Yeah.
Not if you wanna be an editor.
Yeah...
So, how did you end up in publishing?
Well, do you remember "Literati"?
That "not so secret" society I was in?
Yes, they tapped me to join as well.
That's right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
My boss is here?
Literati.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Literati members like to help each other.
And it doesn't hurt to have friends in high places, if know what I mean?
So, um...
Oh, you're applying for a job... to be my assistant.
Yeah, I'm kind of in the middle of a career change right now.
So...
Unfortunately, that position's been filled.
I just hired this bright young thing,
- right out of her masters.
- Let me guess, Literati?
Well, we are... the sum of our decisions, aren't we?
Yeah.
As long as you're happy, that's all that matters.
It was really great seeing you again.
Bye.
"We're the sum of our decisions, aren't we?"
I guess we are.
Dr. Tom?
Hey, Dr. Tom!

Assembling: keigel2001 :

Your car is not even worth a thousand dollars.
It's 15 years old.
I know, but the suspension is scattered all over Bedford Road.
I mean, I either give her up or I pay the money.
Oh my god.
Sam, that dress is gorgeous.
- I like it.
- All that running around and nobody even called you for an interview?
I'm still trying to look.
You can't expect me to find something in one day.
Well, if it doesn't work out, you can always work for me.
Work for you?
Well, a Toronto account executive just retired, so if you can handle lunches at holt's and martinis with wedding planners...
- Oh, Erica loves martinis.
- Mom.
We offer competitive wages and, uh, benefits.
- Dental!
- I don't even know anything about weddings, people.
Well, what's there to know?
Boy meets girl, boy woos girl, girl blows $10,000 on a lovely pile of lace and organza.
- Oh, save your breath, Ruby.
My daughter thinks she's too good to work for your successful business.
- I do not.
- Mom, leave her alone.
- Thank you, Sam.
I'm just saying, she might wanna consider saying yes to her uncle who's trying to help her.
I'm not saying no.
Would you just give me a second to think about it.
Look, Uncle Ruby.
If...
I were to come and work for you, I mean, it would... it would just be a temporary thing and I'd...
- I'd like to be up front about that.
- Be up front all you want.
All I'm saying is, it's a good group of people, we have a lot of laughs; you'd enjoy yourself.
When can Erica start?
Mom.
Ethan?
!
Oh, I am so sorry.
It's just... the craziest day.
- And you're always late.
- I know, I know.
- What, are you moving in?
- Um, yeah.
I thought I'd sleep in your bathtub.
I did not have a poster of "The Kiss" up on my wall.
Yes, you did.
It was right above your desk.
- No, that was Judith.
- No, that was you.
You bought it at that poster sale in first year.
- Why are you my friend again?
- And do I need to remind you about the uh...
- toaster oven incident?
- No, but you're going to.
Who installs a heat source underneath their bed?
Uh, oh!
That's right, you do.
Like I'm gonna get out of bed to make nachos.
And that, my friend, is the last of it.
I start a new job tomorrow, so...
- no hangover for this girl.
- A new job?
Doing what?
Um, account executive... at my Uncle Ruby's bridal company "White Dreams"
- Wet Dreams?
- White Dreams, you perv.
Wow.
Well, congratulations.
- I guess.
- No, I mean, it-it's gonna be great.
It's, uh... pays the bills, it's downtown, there's dental!
You're, you're just not happy for me at all.
Sorry, I can't go "rah-rah-rah" over something you think is a mistake.
Ha!
Okay, Mr. Honesty, what's with all the luggage?
I left Claire.
Oh my god.
Ethan, what happened?
- She was cheating on me.
- What?
!
Okay, that's bullshit.
She was cheating on you and you had to leave?
Well, her dad owns half the city of Montreal.
He bought us our house in Outremont.
All our friends are her friends.
Feels like there's nothing left there for me.
So, where are you going to stay?
My parents have a granny suite.
No, you're not gonna stay in your parents' basement, you're gonna stay here with me.
Where?
I...
I was joking about the tub.
This place is too small.
Okay, we'll...
we'll find somewhere.
We'll look and we'll get you a place.
I prise you, I'm gonna get you sorted out.
I know.
Morning.
It's magnetic.
Okay, yeah, this way, through here.
Now your catchment zone is gonna be the downtown core.
That's home to some of the most discerning bridal houses in the city.
So you're gonna be dealing with people who are...
Well, okay, they can be prissy little pains in my ass.
Do I ever get to meet any real bridezillas?
O... oh, no-no-no-no-no, no, no, no, no.
We don't have to get our hands dirty with any of that.
White Dreams is strictly import/export.
Ah, now, here you are, right through here.
Go on.
Sit down.
Make yourself at home.
This is your domain.
It's best that you get to know each of our dresses by name, okay?
- Talk amongst yourselves.
- Okay.
"The Ivory Tower".
"The Snow Fairy".
"The Virgin Queen".
Yeah, all right.
Good morning, Erica.
How...
What are you doing in the girls washroom?
Why... why isn't this the girls washroom?
I w...
- I was just at work and...
- "White Dreams".
Such an evocative name.
What?
What?
Okay, just before you go, this is something from...
You've got that out of your system, have you?
Yeah.
Good.
Please, come.
Sit down.
Sit down?
I-I-I have been looking for you everywhere.
- I mean, I have a million questions.
- I can imagine.
- You sent me back in time.
- Indeed.
Very glamorous, I know.
How did you do it?
No, I mean, more importantly, why, why, why did you pick me?
Samuel Johnson said:
"The use of travelling is to regulate imagination by reality, and instead of thinking how things may be, to see them, as they are."
Tell me about...
regret number seven.
- Tell me why you picked me.
- Well, why not you?
- Is your life so insignificant?
- No, but I...
Oh, well, good then.
Your list, please.
Hold on, hold on, I have some questions to ask and I think, at the very least, I'm entitled to ask them, I mean, you kind of made me destroy my car.
We made a contract.
And in order for that contract to work, you have to trust me.
I do.
And you have to trust that my number one regret is Leo.
Please send me back to him.
- I mean, I can, I can warn him.
- No you can't.
You can't go back to fix other peoples' mistakes.
And you can't go back to win the lottery, or to bet on the Stanley Cup, or to save your brother's life.
This, Erica, is about you.
It's your list, it's your regrets.
It's you.
So, tell me about... number seven.
Secret Society.
Secret Society.
Wow.
It was 1995, I was in my second year at university, and I thought that I knew everything.
Normally, I'm not one for confrontation, but when it came to books and literature,
I'd fight my arguments to the death.
And more often than not, it was me versus Antigone Kim.
Literati must have seen something in me and my passion because that year, they tapped me to join.
Graveyard.
Midnight.
Bring a dress.
I mean, that's all the invite said.
Literati was the most respected club on campus.
They only invite a handful of people to join each year.
So...
I mean, I was flattered.
The cool kids wanted to hang out with me, but the initiation process, it proved to be too much... too gothic... robes and masks.
And then they asked us to attack each other, verbally.
And I always liked debating with Antigone in class, but for fun?
I mean, that's just not me.
My gut told me to walk away, so, I quit.
And you regret it.
Why?
Because, in retrospect, I mean, it was a short-sighted decision.
"We are the sum of our decisions, and as long as you're happy that's all it matters."
Antigone Morris.
The thing is, I'm not... happy.
I mean, I could've just gone along with it and I should have.
And if you had joined?
Membership has its privileges.
Just look what it did for Antigone.
If I could do it over, I would...
I would join Literati, and I would do their silly little initiation, and I would get on the right path.
The path that I should've been on all along.
Say "no" to tuition increases.
Say "no" to tuition increases.
Education is a right!
We will fight and fight!
Say "no" to tuition increases.
- What are you doing up front there?
- I have no idea!
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
- Fascists!
- No more fees!
- Move back!
- Let go of me.
Come on, let's get out of here.
What, they think they scare me with their laws and their rules?
You know, you can arrest the body, but the spirit you'll never chain.
I'm late for a women's studies.
- Claire's incredible, isn't she?
- Yeah, that's one word to describe her.
Underneath all that angst and aggression and confidence, she's actually really insecure.
Her parents are rich.
I mean, megabucks.
She never tells anyone because she thinks if people knew,
- it would compromise her message.
- Compromise her message?
I know, she over thinks things, but... in a cute way.
Don't ever tell Claire I told you.
She'd totally kill me.
I won't.
Hey, guys, wait up!
Oh my god.
Judith, look at you.
Look at me?
Look at you.
You're covered in dirt.
Oh god, you radicals really gross me out.
Okay, this is worse than that time right before senior prom, when you got that nasty spiral perm.
Oh, and you had to...
straighten it with your flat iron.
You know, I totally forgot about that.
Forgot?
It was like two years ago.
She's been like this all day.
I think she got beaned by a rock.
Uh, sorry, I thought it was grass.
Freaks.
Uh, yeah, don't do that.
Class.
Today we'll continue talking about James Joyce's modernist masterpiece,
"Ulysses."
Erica, why don't you lead the discussion.
Um, me, Professor Bristow?
Breslow.
And yes, you.
Pick up where we left off.
On the use of "yes, yes, yes" at novel's end?
Okay, just give me one second, it's been a while... since... since our... our last class.
Should I answer, Professor Breslow?
No, that's fine.
I got it.
Thanks.
it was about joyce's, uh, determination to reinstate the male dominated perspectiv in opposition to, um...
Perhaps what Erica is...
trying to say, is that the use of phallo-centric language, like,
"the scrotum tightening sea", was, uh,
- in the parlance of the times, a clear...
- Thank you, by the way,
- for telling me what I was trying to say.
- Cat fight!
Can we get back to the material, please, and put aside our petty rivalries?
- You dropped this.
- Thank you.
Who was that?
No one.
Hey, listen, you guys,
I'm gonna catch up with you back at rez, okay?
This Literati initiation is hugely competitive.
And just so you know, my mom had twins.
Only one of us made it out alive.
Pass the skull and take a card.
Each card has a match.
That is your opponent.
Jokers, step forward.
Use the truth to attack each other.
Don't sensor yourselves.
Go.
I'm Erica Strange.
Daughter of aninsurance salesman.
Granddaughter of a brick layer.
I'm sorry, what's your family crest?
A 20% off coupon?
Oh, you're so obscenely wealthy,
I'm surprised you even know about coupons.
And by the way, shouldn't the silver spoon be in your mouth, not up your ass?
You know, the only reason why you're getting an "A" in our english class is
- because you must be screwing the professor.
- The only reason why you're getting an "A-"
is because you must be screwing the professor.
That's enough.
Thank you both.
You will be moving on to our next round.
You want us to bury ourselves alive?
We want you to bury each other alive.
Refuse, and forfeit membership in our club.
You... you... you, you and you.
You five will be buried first, for 15 minutes.
Climb in the graves and lie in the caskets.
Close the lids.
Tonight if we learn to face our fears, they no longer have power over us.
Grab a shovel.
Bury them.
Fill the entire hole.
No, wait.
Hold on, wait!
It's okay, he's facing his fears.
Wait, I can't breathe!
Let me out, please!
Please, let me out right now!
Please!
Please, let me out!
I can't breathe!
Let me out, please!
Let me outta here, please!
I can't breathe!
'Kay, wait-wait-wait, wait-wait-wait, he's...
He's having a panic attack, he's freaking out.
Everything will be fine.
Erica and Antigone, pick up your shovels.
Pick them up.
Do what we say.
Trust us.
Have faith.
Are you okay?
!
- Please let me out!
- What are we doing?
Screw this.
I can't breathe!
Let me outta here, please!
Please!
- Oh, god.
- I want to suck your blood.
You... you and you.
Go!
You have not passed our test.
What is it?
That's not funny.
Welcome to Literati.
I wish I had a polaroid.
The looks on your faces were priceless.
"We don't want to bury these dudes alive."
Funny.
Hey, over there, isn't that...
Our former Prime Minister?
Yup.
You know, the vast majority of people in your situation tonight just follow orders.
But you two, you think for yourselves.
Your minds are free from convention.
"Veritas vos liberabit."
The truth will set you free.
And joining the Literati is not simply a social affair.
Our most important work is published in our zine, the punisher.
- The "slam" paper?
- It's not a "slam" paper or a gossip rag.
- Our next cover.
- Ah, yes.
Let me guess, you're thinking, Claire does so much good for us students.
The thing is, 10 students got arrested today because of her.
They all now have criminal records.
I don't trust her.
I never have.
- You're friends with Claire.
- Not exactly.
I'm... dig.
Get to the truth.
Pull your weight and earn your place.
Fail, and your membership will be revoked.
Leo, don't be long.
Andre is meeting us in 10.
Mom hasn't heard from you in, like, 48 hours, so... she sent me here to make sure...
Oh, that I wasn't abducted by aliens?
Hey, why don't you come in?
I'll make you breakfast.
You'll make me cereal?
Uh, look, I got plans with the guys, but...
Here.
I made it for your next rave or protest, or...
- whatever.
- Oh, wow, I love it.
Thank you.
- Hey, what happened?
- Yeah, uh...
Darryl and I snuck up onto the long cement thing outside the front of city hall.
It looked like a good place to board.
Leo, you gotta take better care of yourself.
- Seriously.
- Okay, mom!
Why don't you lecture me about eating my vegetables and not dropping out of university.
Wear that in peace.
Thanks.
For this.
You don't know how much this means.
Excuse me, you don't happen to make lattes, do...
Dr. Tom.
You're in a hairnet.
Keeps the crude out of the crudites.
Ah, no.
No lattes.
But I do have carrot sticks.
So... what up?
What up.
Okay, let's see.
Since I've been back, I've buried someone alive.
- Literati, kinda dramatic.
- Kind of?
And the head honcho, Barrett Ironside?
He's a total head case.
A head case who is now a powerful hollywood producer, thanks to his Literati connections,
- and his flair for the dramatic.
- He wants me to destroy Claire.
"Those who plot the destruction of others often perish in the attempt."
Thomas Moore.
Okay.
And what about those who pulverize their husband's hearts
- into tiny little shards of glass?
- Hard to say.
Claire le Duc, she is a liar and a cheater.
And it is your job, your mission, to meet out to justice.
No, I...
Well, I wouldn't say that exactly, but... if Antigone, if she knew what I knew...
She'd have thrown Claire to the lions, of course.
It's that killing spirit which has made Antigone such a success in life.
Exactly.
Killing spirit, that doesn't sound like me.
And that's the reason why I walked away from Literati in the first place.
But Claire, she's...
she is a spoiled little brat that has pulled the wool over everyone's eyes, including Ethan, and she deserves to go down.
- You're sounding nothing like yourself already.
- If I want to achieve anything,
I gotta be a little bit less like me and a little bit more like them.
The egg.
Perfection, both in function and in form.
It has a double arch, top and bottom.
It's what makes an egg so incredibly strong.
But the minute that we begin to chip away at its integrity, the egg collapses in on itself until, in the end, we're left with only... breakfast.
It's still an egg, but it's not the same.
I was so inspired by our last protest, that I've decided to get everyone to chain themselves to the front doors of the registrar's office tomorrow.
Me and hundreds of students.
Like that's true solidarity.
Good morning to you too, Claire.
Erica.
Always so hung up on propriety.
You know, your conventional ways will hold you back.
Wow, you-you really...
you don't have a filter, do you?
Well, what good is filtering the truth?
I just say it like it is.
I am myself, Claire, always.
Oh, really?
And what... what was that down there with the guy and the posters?
Hmm?
Oh my god, Erica, you anglos are so repressed.
Flirting is not cheating.
What, you think Ethan never looks around?
I think that Ethan loves you very much and would put up with a lot from you.
I think you're very lucky to have someone like him.
Yeah, well, Ethan knows me.
He knows where I stand and I would never cheat on him.
Okay, so, let me get this straight.
You're a girl from the wrong side of the tracks, who's fighting against tuition hikes, who always tells the truth, and would never, ever cheat and break my best friend's heart.
- That's you?
- That's right.
Take it or leave it.
Look, I'm telling you, this professor is notorious for breaking her students.
Okay, cast members from her last production said she practiced psychological warfare because "that's the way it works in the theatre world."
Tough prof, so what?
This prof, who claims to have been a professional actress, was really just a stage manager.
Total liar.
That has potential.
Good work.
Strange, you got some competition here.
So?
What do you got?
Um, actually, I, um...
I don't have anything.
Big surprise.
Okay.
What if I told you that Claire le Duc, the working class joan of arc, is actually Claire St. Armand, the daughter of one of Montreal's richest businessmen?
Nice.
"La duchess's cries of poverty are actually a cry for help.
Claire, it seems, is so privileged, she can even afford multiple personalities."
Damn, is this true?
Her being loaded?
I, I guess so.
What else did they say?
I don't know, it's brutal.
I mean, whoever wrote this is...
I don't know, kind of psychotic.
Well, would you look at that, I'm late for class, on the other side of campus.
- Judith, do not abandon me.
- Gotta go.
Hi.
Hey, Claire.
- You see the paper?
- Uh, yeah, I did.
I was trying to help the students, you know?
I was trying to do something good.
I wanted it to be about what I said and what I did, not about my parents and their money, their influence.
They have nothing to do with this.
Wanna eat a piece of my cake?
Look, just ignore him, clearly...
That guy is an idiot!
Everything I worked for is ruined.
I was coming to find you.
I wanna talk.
Let's do this inside.
If you did what I think you did to Claire...
I can't believe it, you went after my girlfriend.
- She lied to everyone.
- You do not get to judge her!
How do you know that she's not lying to you?
I'm not talking about this.
You know, you don't even know the whole story.
Her parents hate what she's doing, what she's becoming.
They've practically disowned her.
I...
I didn't know that.
The punisher asked you to dig up dirt for their own reasons.
What were yours?
She did it out of insecurity and worry people would judge her.
But you, Erica?
I don't think I know you.
Uh, interference, meaning I get to hit again.
Thank you, Erica, always coming through.
I take it you saw our little newspaper?
I saw Claire.
Not a happy anarchist.
You guys, you really went to town.
- Well, we went as far as the truth permitted.
- Throw in a little flair and every last issue was snapped up.
Look, I made a mistake.
I had no right to tell you about Claire.
All you did was tell the truth.
I am this close to giving you our next issue.
I don't want it.
Look, getting to the truth is one thing, but you guys, you... you relish the humiliation.
Degrading someone is fun for you.
But that is not who I am.
So, I quit.
You understand what you're giving up?
You quit and that's it.
Believe me, I understand.
But the price of admission is way too high.
So, the point is we want to block the entrance.
So let's... handcuff ourselves to each other and to the door handle.
Here to dig up more dirt on me?
I'm sorry.
No, but don't apologize to me, apologize to the hundreds of students that won't be able to afford tuition.
Okay.
Yeah.
No, fine.
I will, I'll do it.
I'll do whatever it takes.
What I did was wrong and I really regret it.
Sit, sit!
Education is a right!
We will fight, fight, fight!
Education is a right!
We will fight, fight, fight!
So, I guess you've made it through your first morning.
Before you know it, you're gonna be my rock.
Like, like Jean.
Who's Jean?
Oh, uh, over there.
Jean, you've been with me since... what?
Since we were nothing but a little storage unit in Etobicoke.
Welcome to the team.
Okey-dokey, well, I have got to get to a conference call, you've got some photo copying to do.
Thanks a lot.
And after that, let's go out for a little celebratory lunch.
And, and by lunch, I do mean liquid.
Could you, like, give me a warning sign or something?
Please, have a seat.
Okay, but look.
- For the record, I get it.
- What?
I ended up right back where I started.
I mean, Literati, it's clearly not for me.
And...
I just need to learn to...
be happy with what I have.
As in the cubicle?
Are you happy at "White Dreams"?
- No.
But that's different, it's...
- Our lives are like a house of cards.
You know, some of the cards are... cosmetic.
While others are load bearing walls.
You remove one of those cards and the whole thing comes tumbling down.
- Like the egg.
- Like the egg.
Chip away at what makes you "you" and you become something else.
Your gut told you to avoid Literati the first time around, and you were right to listen to that.
There are many ways to achieve our goals, Erica, but ignoring your inner voice... is not one of them.
So... tell me.
Is this job the right job for you?
No.
Oh, sorry.
Sorry.
No-no, that wasn't my shih tzu, that was me.
Look, I, um...
I'll have to call you back.
Erica, are you trying to kill me?
This face?
Not as young as it looks.
Uncle Ruby, I quit.
And I appreciate so much, this opportunity, but it just... it isn't right.
You haven't even given it a day.
That's just the thing, I don't need to.
I know that it's wrong... for me.
The wedding biz, it's what you always wanted to do, right?
I used to dress your mom up in your bubble's lace curtains when I was six.
Exactly!
You knew.
And I feel that...
You know what?
I know that... there is something out there that I'm supposed to do, and I wanna take the time, right now, to find it.
You know, maybe it's books?
Oh, you could read on your lunch breaks?
Oh, okay.
Okay, okay, fine.
Come here.
Come here.
Now, go.
Go, go-go-go-go-go.
Do what you have to do.
Your mom may not understand, but I do.
And I'll...
I'll talk to her.
Though, I can't promise she won't disembowel me.
Thank you, Uncle Ruby, for everything.
Well, you're right, I mean, it is a little small, but the layout is... is pretty good.
And there's tons of storage.
Yeah, and the rent's cheapish, of course, compared to Montreal.
Well, you can't compare anything to Montreal rent.
Bagels?
Mmm.
It's, uh, right next door, that's not gonna be weird?
No, I don't think so.
Doesn't feel like uh... we're regressing.
Like we've living back in residence?
Yeah, just minus the, uh, the co-ed showers?
No, I think it will be fine.
Besides, rez is where we became best buds.
Totally.
And... where you almost fired me as your friend.
What're you talking about?
You remember... in second year, when I almost joined Literati?
And sold out Claire.
- You remember?
- Yeah, I remember that.
Do you ever wish...
I mean, especially now, given everything that's going on with you and Claire...
What?
Do you ever wish that you would had listened to me and... you know, saved yourself a lot of heartache?
No.
Really?
I mean, she's destroyed my life, but she was my life for a long time, you know?
So, I don't see any reason why I shouldn't take this place.
Great!
Oh, we're gonna have so much fun.
Jenny and Judith, they're gonna be really jealous.
Oh, that's me.
River Rock Pub?
River Rock Publishing.
Oh my god.
Answer it!
Hello.
This is she.
Next week?
Sure, of course I can make it.
Three o'clock?
Mm-hmm.
No, that's...
No, I know where the offices are.
Great.
Okay, thank you.
That's great.
Congratulations.
I got an interview.
You got an apartment.
Global justice now!
Everyone's got their own path.
Some are only just beginning.
While others end all too soon.
However you do it, the fact is, the path you're on, the choices you make, define who you are.
Choices, they're the building blocks of our lives.
They shape our past, present and future and despite all the stakes I've made, every new day brings with it new choices and a whole new world of possibilities.
"The Trip"
Here in the middle, we have a long tradition of kids raising money for their school by hitting up their neighbours, to buy crap they don't want or need.
Following in that great tradition,
Sue is selling cheese and sausage for Orson Junior High.
Four exciting varities of sausage to match whatever sausage meat you may find yourself in.
I think what makes Sue such a good seller is that she can take rejection.
Probably cause she's had so much practice.
Or maybe you can, perhaps, show your love of cheese, cheese ball...
I'll just wait here at the door in case you change your mind.
Let me tell you:
When it come to selling cheese and sausage,
Sue was driven.
She was driven by Mike all over Indiana.
Mike took her to Terre Haute...
They went to Gary.
She hit almost every county in the state.
'Cause if she sells $3,000 worth, she wins a free trip, all the way... to Indianapolis.
So it's okay to sell your stuff, Sue, but, remember, this is a place of business.
People are busy.
Oh, hey, Bob.
Would you like to help my school and send me on a trip to the state capital by buying some delicious--
I'll take ten.
Really?
Oh, my God.
That's great!
I love food you don't have to refrigerate.
Fridges-- they just tie you down.
That's why I just have a hot plate and a P.O. Box.
Okay, that'll be $284.
What?
Are you...
Ehlert.
Just casually scatter.
Oh, hi, Mr. Ehlert.
Would you like to help my--
No.
Frances!
You forgot to make coffee again.
You got me walking around here like an idiot with a doughnut and nothing to dunk it in.
Mr. Ehlert, how come I'm the one who's always asked to make the coffee?
I'm beginning to think it's because I'm a woman.
Well, of course it's because you're a woman.
The day I start telling men to make coffee for women, you have my permission to put a bullet in my head.
Wow.
Mom, that is so unfair.
You are not going to make that coffee, are you?
Eh.
Not worth the fight.
All personnel-
- I've been informed there will be fresh coffee shortly.
Hey, can I interest you in a cheese sampler, so I can win a trip to my state capital?
**Put me down for the jalapeno cheddar ball.
Yes!
Oh, and if you get that,
I can throw in the wild game sausage trio at half price.
Fine.
Sue was really kicking butt.
She was a shining beacon of motivation.
Axl?
Not so much.
Axl, how many times do I have to say it?
Turn off that TV and get dressed for school!
It'll take me, like, two seconds.
Chill.
Hey, hey.
Only one to a customer.
It's for Olivia.
I'm sorry, honey.
Who?
Olivia, my girlfriend.
So this girlfriend of yours-- Is she... here right now?
No.
She's at her house.
So how did this happen?
You're my boyfriend now.
Okay.
Wow, Brick.
That's great!
So this Olivia-- Do you like her?
She says I do.
Is she cute?
Is she nice?
She has a red ribbon in her hair.
I like red ribbons.
All Heck men like red ribbons.
Red ribbons.
Ma, we're out of cereal.
You going to the store or what?
Hey.
I will go to the store when I decide it's time to go to the store.
Actually, we're almost out of a lot of stuff.
I'm going after work.
First I gotta go to the post office.
Then I'm gonna swing by Aunt Edie and Aunt Ginny'S.
They're hosting bridge club, and they're almost out of scotch.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I did it.
I sold over $3,000 worth of cheese and sausage!
Oh!
Honey!
- That's great, Sue.
- That's terrific!
Look at you.
I know.
I just have to send the checks to the company, and then I am off to Indianapolis... the capital!
Oh, honey, I am so proud of you.
You worked hard, and it paid off.
And now you get to see close-up how Indiana state government works.
I know.
It's like a dream!
Damn it, Axl!
I told you, turn off the TV and get ready for school!
Now the bus is here, and you're not ready.
Told you, two seconds.
Chill.
How the hell does he do that?
Now that you're my boyfriend, you have to buy me ice cream, tell me I'm pretty and walk me to and from recess and lunch.
I made you a list so you don't forget.
Okay.
The crash rating on this baby?
Two stars.
Not one, but two.
Out of how many?
Five.
But who cares?
'Cause if you crash, the doors are so thin, they will cut you out like that.
Sue.
What are you doing here?
The school put up a list of winners for the field trip, and my name wasn't on it.
- What?
- Does this car have--
Yeah, yeah, it has everything.
Just give me a minute.
But you were a top seller.
I know.
Can you believe it?
Unfortunately, I could believe it.
This was Sue's whole life in a nutshell.
She tries and tries and never gets any recognition.
It's like people don't even see her.
Sue Heck?
Here.
Sue Heck?
Here.
Okay.
Not here.
Pizza or fish?
Pizza, please.
Oh.
Okay.
# Happy birthday to you, #
# Happy birthday to you, #
# Happy birthday dear... #
# Happy birthday to you #
Oh, honey.
That's just not fair.
What's not fair?
Sue sold enough sausage and cheese to win the big trip, and she's not on the list to go.
Oh, those monsters.
I'm gonna cancel my check.
Looks like I'm not going to Indianapolis.
I was really looking forward to it, too.
What are you talking about?
This is just a mistake.
Things like this happen all the time.
Yes, more often to you, but we'll straighten it out.
Eh.
It's not worth the fight.
Great.
Why do I have to be the only mom in the world whose teenager listens to what they say?
Then Sue turns to me and says, "Eh, it's not worth the fight."
Well, that's your fault.
She gets that from you.
I said it once!
- You say it all the time!
- I do not!
Hey, we don't wear flip-flops to church.
Jesus wore sandals.
Eh, it's not worth the fight.
I'm not paying $6 a month for other fees unless you can tell me what those other fees are.
No, don't transfer me to India.
Don't transfer me-- Eh, it's not worth the fight.
Well, the kids are asleep, so...
Honey, I am so exhausted.
Eh, it's not worth the fight.
And I said it to Mr. Ehlert right in front of her.
Oh, my God!
Am I a horrible mother?
Too soon to tell.
It's just so unfair.
I mean, for once in her life, Sue finally wins something, and--
And then that stupid school has to go and screw it all up.
She earned that trip.
We earned that trip.
Hell, yeah!
I'm the one that spent 50 hours in the car with her.
Oh, did you know that her friend Stacy likes a boy named Ben, but Ben likes Stacy's friend Madison, so now they're not talking to her?
You want more?
I got lots more.
I have got to fix this.
Sue has to stand up for herself.
I mean, if this isn't worth the fight, Mike,
I don't know what is.
Hey, Sue, get in here.
You know what this is?
A teachable moment.
I saw that on "Oprah," or "Project Runway" or something.
I don't remember, but it's teachable.
Am I in trouble?
Sue, I want you to march into that school, talk to who's ever in charge and get yourself on that trip.
I don't know.
Mr. Perez, the teacher, is kind of weird.
Someone said they saw him crying in the parking lot.
Doesn't matter.
You can't just be invisible, so you gotta stand up and fight for what's yours.
I mean, I don't always do that, but I've had kids.
I'm tired.
And don't be afraid to stare 'em down.
Wow.
Okay.
Got it.
How's this?
You got a little something-- You know what?
Lose the stare.
Just be yourself.
Hey, Brick's girlfriend's here.
Hello, Olivia.
So nice to meet you.
Hi!
Can Brick come out and play?
Hey, Brick?
Your girlfriend's here.
Get out there and have fun.
I don't want to.
Hey, you're not getting a lot of offers, bud.
Come on!
She's cute.
I told you I'd be here at 3:00.
Why weren't you waiting outside?
And another thing--make sure you're free on Saturday.
We have a birthday party.
You forgot, didn't you?
!
It's like you don't hear a word I'm saying.
I hear all the words, Olivia.
All of them.
All of them.
And why do you whisper to yourself?
It's so annoying!
This was a big step for Sue.
She was finally making a stand.
Yep, this girl was gonna be heard...
Eventually.
M--Mr.
Perez?
I sold over $3,000 of cheese and sausage to, you know, go on the trip to Indianapolis?
Who are you?
Oh, Sue.
Sue Heck?
I'm in your fifth period Spanish class?
I don't think so.
Anyway...
I sold over $3,000 worth of cheese and sausage to...
You know, go on the trip to Indianapolis.
Well, good for you, Sandy.
We'll see you on the bus.
Uh, see, that's the thing-- I'm not on the list.
But I sold over--
Okay, I'll look into it.
Really?
Gracias.
Tenga un buena dia.
How do you break up with a girl?
You sure you want to break up with that chick?
I mean, you're kind of a weird dude.
You got a little hottie that likes you.
I'm sure.
All right.
Well, girls like it you talk to 'em, so try blowing her off or something.
How do I do that?
Like this.
Great advice, Axl.
Now I'm married, and we have a baby!
I really thought I nailed the Sue thing.
I had taught her to stand up for herself.
I was so pumped, I was even making dinner.
Yep, she's lucky to have me.
I did it.
I talked to Mr. Perez, and neither one of us cried.
Oh, great!
I did it, Dad.
I was a little bit scared at first.
Okay, a lot scared...
But I stood my ground and explained the situation.
And...?
And he said he'd look into it.
Yay!
- Oh!
That's great.
- All right!
See, there you go.
- You stood up for yourself.
- Yes, good for you.
- Good girl.
- Perfect.
I'm going down there and talk to that guy.
Wait, Mike, didn't you hear her?
He said he would look into it.
He's blowing her off.
I tell people all day long, "I'll look into it." I never do.
No.
We are not doing this for her.
We are not helicopter parenting.
"Regis and Kelly."
You saw how excited she was.
If you go down there, you're gonna undermine her self-confidence, and she will never learn to fight her own battles.
Look, the trip is in two weeks.
If we don't hear before then, we'll step in.
So while I had one kid desperately trying to get into something,
I had another desperately trying to get out.
It's her!
Don't make me go out there.
I'll do any other kind of social interaction you want me to.
There's this new boy in my class who eats his boogers.
I bet he'd be my friend.
Anyone, but Olivia.
So if you don't like her, don't play with her.
I tried!
It's not that easy.
Okay, relax.
I'll take care of it.
Can Brick come out and play?
Look, Olivia, Brick asked me to speak to you because he thinks you're a very nice girl, but he's not ready to get married.
But he wants to remain friends because he likes you very much.
It's too late.
We're already married and we have kids.
What God has joined together, let no man put asunder.
Okay.
How about this?
You're not really married, and your kids are dolls.
So why don't you head home, and Brick will see you around school, okay, hon?
Nope.
What?
I've put too much time into this relationship to just walk away.
Well, I think you have to.
Nope.
You can't keep saying "nope" to everything.
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can!
- Okay, that's enough.
I'm not gonna get into this because I'm the grown-up, and I don't have to.
I'm sorry it came down to this, but, uh, it's over, okay?
Brick doesn't want to see you anymore.
Got it?
Nope.
Go home, Olivia.
How ya gonna make me?
Brick, Olivia's here.
Morning.
Trip to Indianapolis is today and they didn't call.
I was all packed and everything.
Now I'll never see the state seal up close.
What?
No, no, no!
You said the trip is next Saturday.
Yeah, it was next Saturday when I said it.
- Now it's today.
- It's today?
Well, they can't do that.
They said they'd look into it.
I'm beginning to think they didn't.
Oh!
That's it.
Come on.
Get your stuff.
What time did you say the bus is leaving?
It's okay, Mom.
They already left.
It's not worth--
Don't you dare say it!
You deserve this, Sue, 'cause you try and try long past when others would have stopped trying and, damn it, you are going on this trip.
Mom, you're still in pajamas.
They're drawstring.
It's almost pants.
Pull the bus over!
Okay, I know this doesn't look safe but I have dual air bags...
I think.
Open up!
Y-yes, I am talking to you.
My daughter, Sue Heck, is supposed to be on this bus.
A-Are--Are those pajamas?
They're drawstring.
It's almost pants.
I'm sorry.
She's not on the list.
Okay, you want to take it from here?
And really give it to him.
Um, I sold more than enough cheese and sausage to be on this trip.
She sold more than enough to be on this trip.
I demand...
to be on this bus.
She demands!
- I strongly suggest--
- Strongly suggests!
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna take it from here.
Good job, though.
I've got your number, Mr. Perez.
You never had any intention of "looking into this," now, did you?
For your information, I called the company, and they had no record of Sue Heck selling anything.
That is baloney!
Nobody ever has a record of Sue, but I was there.
She counted the orders, we mailed in those checks and she is getting on that bus!
Go!
Go, go, go!
I'm sorry.
I can't allow that.
Oh, okay.
Get back on that bus, Sue.
Okay.
No.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
You're gonna penalize this sweet, innocent young girl because you and that stupid company can't get your acts together?
What kind of message are you sending to our young people--
That hard work doesn't pay off?
Because that's what she's hearing, loud and clear.
Yeah, congratulations.
We just lost another teen to cynicism.
So you gonna let my daughter get on the bus or not?
Eh, it's not worth the fight.
Oh, God.
I thought I mailed Sue's envelope, I really did!
I gotta stop puttin' crap up there.
I can't do it anymore.
So you're stuck with her.
It's not all bad.
Olivia's got her strong points.
She's... strong.
I know.
She threw a pumpkin at the car.
Hey, if you and this chick got pretend married, why don't you just get pretend divorced?
She said if we ever broke up, she'd take half my books and we'd split the babies.
She'd get Strawberry Shortcake, and I'd get Rainbow Brite.
I'm not even sure if Rainbow Brite is mine.
I don't know what to tell you, Brick.
Women are complicated.
They're not simple and straightforward like us guys.
Yeah.
I only got two thoughts in my head--driving and sex.
Uh, grades.
I mean driving and grades.
Unfortunately, she's the kind of girl who won't move on till she's found some other poor sucker she can torment.
Oh, yeah.
Olivia called earlier.
She wants you to buy her lunch tomorrow.
She said it's, uh, her favorite and that you would know what that is.
Oh, God.
I don't!
Hey.
Sue make it on the bus?
All right!
That oughta feel good.
Yeah, it does.
Really does.
Yep.
She's lucky to have me.
Well, at least she'd be gone for four days.
Four days is a long time-- plenty of time for forgiveness.
And she did write.
Until finally...
Sue...
I am so, so sorry.
I went to the post office, but before I could go in,
Aunt Ginny called, and then Brick needed more goldfish and I had a million things in my head and...
I love you!
I love you so much!
It was a disaster.
Because you forgot to mail in the envelope...
My name wasn't on any of the lists!
I had to sleep on the floor in the hotel.
They didn't have tickets to any of the museums,
I missed the state government in action, and a junior guidance counselor had to sit outside with me everywhere because legally, I couldn't be left alone!
Well, I'm not invisible to Miss Glover now!
Oh, no.
She hates me!
This is all your fault!
There it was-- Sue found her voice.
And boy, was it loud.
I didn't deserve this!
I strongly suggest...
No, demand that you make it up to me.
Yep, my girl was a fighter.
She was gonna be fine.
And all the cheese and sausage in the world doesn't make you feel prouder than that.
Oh, and Brick?
Turns out he could take care of himself, too.
You're my boyfriend now.
Okay.
Damn I'm good.
FRANCES:
In the middle, we have a long tradition of kids raising money for their school by hitting up their neighbors to buy crap they don't want or need.
In that great tradition, Sue was selling cheese and sausage for Orson Junior High.
Four exciting varieties of sausage to match whatever sausage mood you may find yourself in.
FRANCES:
What makes Sue such a good seller is that she can take rejection.
Probably because she's had so much practice.
Maybe our "Show Your Love With Cheese" cheese ball with faux granite cutting board.
I'll wait here at the door a while in case you change your mind.
FRANCES:
Let me tell you, when it comes to selling cheese and sausage Sue was driven.
She was driven by Mike all over Indiana.
Hey, hey!
FRANCES:
Mike took her to Terre Haute.
They went to Gary.
She hit almost every county in the state.
Because if she sells $3000 worth, she wins a free trip all the way to Indianapolis.
So it's okay to sell your stuff, Sue but remember, this is a place of business.
People are busy.
[YAWNS]
Oh, hey, Bob.
Um, would you like to help my school and send me on a trip to the state capital by buying some delicious...
- I'll take 10.
- Really?
Oh, my God!
That's great!
- I love food you don't have to refrigerate.
Fridges just tie you down.
That's why I just have a hot plate and a PO box.
- Okay, that'll be $284.
- What?
Are you...?
Ehlert.
Just casually scatter.
- Hi, Mr. Ehlert.
Would you like to help...
- No.
Frances, you forgot to make coffee again.
You got me walking like an idiot with a donut and nothing to dunk it in.
Mr. Ehlert, how come I'm the one who's always asked to make the coffee?
I'm beginning to think it's because I'm a woman.
Heh, of course it's because you're a woman!
The day I start telling men to make coffee for women you have my permission to put a bullet in my head.
Heh-heh-heh.
Wow, Mom, that is so unfair.
You are not going to make that coffee, are you?
Ugh, not worth the fight.
MAN [OVER PA]:
All personnel I've been informed there will be fresh coffee shortly.
Can I interest you in a cheese sampler so I can win a trip to my state capital?
MAN:
Put me down for the Jalapeño Cheddar Ball.
SUE:
Yes.
Oh, and if you get that I can throw in the Wild Game Sausage Trio at half price.
[MAN SIGHS]
MAN:
Fine.
FRANCES:
Sue was really kicking butt.
She was a shining beacon of motivation.
Axl?
Not so much.
How many times do I have to say it?
Turn off that TV!
Get dressed for school!
It will take me like two seconds.
Chill.
Hey, hey.
Only one to a customer.
It's for Olivia.
- I'm sorry, honey, who?
- Olivia.
My girlfriend.
So this girlfriend of yours, is she here right now?
- No, she's at her house.
- Ah.
So how did this happen?
- You're my boyfriend now.
- Okay.
- Wow, Brick.
That's great.
- So this Olivia, do you like her?
She says I do.
Is she cute?
Is she nice?
She has a red ribbon in her hair.
I like red ribbons.
All Heck men like red ribbons.
Red ribbons.
Mom, we're out of cereal.
You going to the store or what?
I will go to the store when I decide it's time to go to the store.
- We're almost out of a lot of stuff.
After work.
First I gotta go to the post office then by Aunt Edie and Aunt Ginny's.
They're hosting bridge club and they're almost out of Scotch.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I did it!
I sold over $3000 worth of cheese and sausage!
- Oh, honey, that's terrific!
- That's great, Sue!
I know.
I just have to send the checks to the company and then I'm off to Indianapolis!
The capital!
Heh!
Oh, honey, I am so proud of you.
You worked hard and it paid off.
And now you get to see close-up how Indiana state government works.
- I know.
It's like a dream!
Heh.
[BUS HORN HONKING]
Damn it, Axl!
I told you, turn off the TV and get ready for school!
Now the bus is here and you're not ready!
[GRUNTS]
I told you, two seconds.
Chill.
How the hell does he do that?
Now that you're my boyfriend, you have to buy ice cream tell me I'm pretty, and walk me to and from recess and lunch.
I made you a list so you don't forget.
Okay.
The crash rating on this baby, two stars.
Not one, but two.
- Out of how many?
- Five.
But who cares?
If you crash, the doors are so thin, they will cut you out like that.
[FRANCES GASPS]
Sue, what are you doing here?
The school put up a list of winners for the trip and my name wasn't on it.
- What?
- Does this car...?
- Everything.
Give me a minute.
- But you were a top seller.
- I know.
Can you believe it?
FRANCES:
Unfortunately, I could believe it.
This was Sue's whole life in a nutshell.
She tries and tries and never gets any recognition.
It's like people don't even see her.
- Sue Heck?
- Here.
- Sue Heck?
- Here.
Okay, not here.
- Pizza or fish?
- Pizza, please.
Oh, okay.
ALL [SINGING]:
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday dear...
[ALL MUTTER INDISTINCTLY]
Happy birthday to you
[SIGHS]
- Honey, that's just not fair.
- What's not fair?
Sue sold enough sausage and cheese to win the big trip she's not on the list.
Oh, those monsters!
I'm gonna cancel my check.
Looks like I'm not going to Indianapolis.
I was really looking forward to it too.
What are you talking about?
This is just a mistake.
Things like this happen all the time.
Yes, more often to you, but we'll straighten it out.
Eh, it's not worth the fight.
FRANCES:
Great.
Why do I have to be the only mom in the world whose teenager listens to what they say?
Then Sue turns to me and says:
- "Eh, it's not worth the fight."
- That's your fault.
- She gets that from you.
- I said it once.
- You say it all the time.
- I do not.
- Hey, we don't wear flip-flops to church.
- Jesus wore sandals.
Eh, it's not worth the fight.
I'm not paying $6 a month for other fees unless you tell me what those fees are.
No, don't transfer me to India.
Don't transfer me...
Eh, it's not worth the fight.
Well, the kids are asleep.
So...
Honey, I am so exhausted.
Eh, it's not worth the fight.
And I said it to Mr. Ehlert right in front of her.
Oh, my God.
- Am I a horrible mother?
- Too soon to tell.
It's just so unfair.
I mean, for once in her life Sue finally wins something and then that stupid school has to go and screw it all up.
She earned that trip.
We earned that trip.
Hell, yeah.
I'm the one that spent 50 hours in the car with her.
Oh, did you know her friend Stacy likes a boy named Ben?
But Ben likes Stacy's friend Madison so now they're not talking to her.
- Want more?
I got lots more.
- I have got to fix this.
Sue has to stand up for herself.
If this isn't worth the fight, Mike I don't know what is.
Hey, Sue!
Get in here!
You know what this is?
A teachable moment.
I saw that on Oprah.
Or Project Runway or something.
I don't remember, but it's teachable.
- Am I in trouble?
- Sue.
I want you to march into that school talk to who's ever in charge and get yourself on that trip.
I don't know.
Mr. Perez, the teacher, is kind of weird.
Someone saw him crying in the parking lot.
It doesn't matter.
You can't be invisible, Sue.
You've gotta stand up and fight for what's yours.
I don't always do that, but I've had kids.
I'm tired.
Don't be afraid to stare him down.
Wow, okay.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Got it.
How's this?
You got a little something...
Lose the stare.
Just be yourself.
AXL:
Hey, Brick's girlfriend's here.
- Ooh!
Hello, Olivia.
So nice to meet you.
Hi.
Can Brick come out and play?
Hey, Brick.
Your girlfriend's here.
- Go out there and have fun.
- I don't want to.
You're not getting a lot of offers, bud.
Come on, she's cute.
I told you I'd be here at 3.
Why weren't you waiting outside?
And make sure you're free on Saturday.
We have a birthday party.
You forgot, didn't you?
It's like you don't hear a word I'm saying.
I hear all the words, Olivia.
All of them.
[WHISPERING] All of them.
And why do you whisper to yourself?
It's so annoying.
FRANCES:
This was a big step for Sue.
She was finally making a stand.
Yep, this girl was gonna be heard.
Eventually.
[CLEARS THROAT]
Mr. Perez?
I sold over $3000 of cheese and sausage to, you know, go on the trip to Indianapolis.
- Who are you?
- Sue.
Sue Heck.
- I'm in your fifth period Spanish class?
- I don't think so.
Anyway, I sold over $3000 worth of cheese and sausage to, you know, go on the trip to Indianapolis.
Good for you, Sandy.
See you on the bus.
See, that's the thing.
I'm not on the list.
- But I sold over...
- Okay, I'll look into it.
Really?
Gracias, heh!
[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]
[LAUGHING]
- How do you break up with a girl?
- You wanna break up with that chick?
You're a weird dude.
You got a hottie that likes you.
- I'm sure.
- All right.
Girls like it when you to talk to them so try blowing her off or something.
How do I do that?
Like this.
[GUNFIRE ON TV]
Great advice, Axl!
Now we're married and we have a baby!
FRANCES:
I really thought I nailed the Sue thing.
I had taught her to stand up for herself.
I was so pumped I was even making dinner.
Yup, she's lucky to have me.
I did it.
I talked to Mr. Perez.
And neither one of us cried.
Oh, great.
SUE:
I did it, Dad.
Heh.
I was a little bit scared at first...
Okay, a lot scared.
Heh.
But I stood my ground and explained the situation.
And?
And he said he'd look into it!
Yay!
Heh.
- All right.
See, there you go.
- Oh!
That's great.
- You stood up for yourself.
- Good for you.
Good girl.
- I'm going there and talk to that guy.
- Wait.
Didn't you hear her?
- He'd look into it.
- He's blowing her off.
I tell people all day I'll look into it.
I never do.
No.
We are not doing this for her.
We are not helicopter parenting.
FRANCES:
Regis and Kelly.
You saw how excited she was.
If you go, you're gonna undermine her self-confidence.
She will never learn to fight her own battles.
The trip is in two weeks.
If we don't hear before then, we'll step in.
So while I had one kid desperately trying to get into something I had another desperately trying to get out.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
It's her!
Don't make me go out.
I'll do any kind of social interaction you want me to.
There's this new boy in my class who eats his boogers.
I bet he'd be my friend.
Anyone but Olivia.
So if you don't like her, don't play with her.
I tried.
It's not that easy.
Okay.
Relax.
I'll take care of it.
Can Brick come out and play?
Look, Olivia, Brick asked me to speak to you.
Because he thinks you're a very nice girl, but he's not ready to get married.
But he wants to remain friends because he likes you very much.
It's too late.
We're already married and we have kids.
What God has joined together, let no man put asunder.
Okay, how about this?
You're not really married and your kids are dolls.
So why don't you head home and Brick will see you around school?
Okay, hon?
- Nope.
- What?
I've put too much time into this relationship to just walk away.
- Well, I think you have to.
- Nope.
- You can't keep saying nope.
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.
Enough.
I'm not gonna get into this.
I'm the grown-up and I don't have to.
Sorry it came down to this, but, uh, it's over, okay?
Brick doesn't wanna see you anymore.
- Got it?
- Nope.
Go home, Olivia.
How are you gonna make me?
Brick, Olivia's here!
FRANCES:
Morning.
Trip to Indianapolis is today and they didn't call.
I was all packed and everything.
I'll never see the state seal up close.
What?
No, no, no.
You said the trip is next Saturday.
It was next Saturday when I said it.
Now it's today.
It's today?
What...?
They can't do that.
They said they'd look into it.
I'm beginning to think they didn't.
That's it.
Come on.
Get your stuff.
What time is the bus leaving?
It's okay, Mom.
They already left.
It's not worth...
Uh-uh-uh.
Don't you dare say it.
You deserve this, Sue.
Because you try and try long past when others would stop trying and damn it, you are going on this trip.
- Mom, you're still in pajamas.
- They're drawstring.
It's almost pants.
[HONKING]
Pull the bus over!
Okay.
I know this doesn't look safe, but I have dual air bags.
- You!
I'm talking to you!
- I think.
Open up!
Yes, I am talking to you.
My daughter, Sue Heck, is supposed to be on this bus!
Are those pajamas?
They're drawstring.
It's almost pants.
She's not on the list.
Wanna take it from here?
Really give it to him.
Um, I sold more than enough cheese and sausage to be on this trip.
She sold more than enough to be on this trip!
I demand to be on this bus.
She demands!
- I strongly suggest...
- Strongly suggests...
I'm gonna take it from here.
Good job, though.
I've got your number, Mr. Perez.
You never had any intention of looking into this now, did you?
I called the company.
They had no record of Sue Heck selling anything.
That is baloney.
Nobody ever has a record of Sue.
But I was there.
She counted the orders, we mailed in those checks and she is getting on this bus!
Go.
- Go.
- I'm sorry.
I can't allow that.
Oh, okay.
- Get back on that bus, Sue.
- Okay.
- No.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
You're gonna penalize this innocent young girl because you and that stupid company can't get your acts together?
What message are you sending to our young people?
Hard work doesn't pay off?
That's what she's hearing, loud and clear.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
We just lost another teen to cynicism.
So are you gonna let my daughter get on or not?
Eh, it's not worth the fight.
FRANCES:
Oh, God.
I thought I mailed Sue's envelope.
I really did.
I gotta stop putting crap up there.
- I can't do it anymore.
- So you're stuck with her.
It's not all bad.
Olivia's got her strong points.
She's strong.
- I know.
She threw a pumpkin at a car.
If you got pretend married, why don't you get pretend divorced?
She said if we ever broke up, she'd take half my books and we'd split the babies.
She'd get Strawberry Shortcake and I'd get Rainbow Brite.
I'm not even sure if Rainbow Brite is mine.
I don't know what to tell you, Brick.
Women are complicated.
They're not simple and straightforward like us guys.
Yeah.
I only got two thoughts in my head, driving and sex.
Oh, grades.
I mean, driving and grades.
Unfortunately, she's the kind of girl who won't move on until she's found some other poor sucker she can torment.
Hmm.
Oh, yeah.
Olivia called earlier.
She wants you to buy her lunch tomorrow.
She said it's her favorite and that you would know it is.
Oh, God.
I don't.
- Hey, Sue make it on the bus?
- Uh-huh.
All right!
That ought to feel good.
Yeah, it does.
It really does.
Yeah, she's lucky to have me.
Well, at least she'd be gone for four days.
Four days is a long time.
Plenty of time for forgiveness.
And she did write.
Until finally...
Sue.
I am so, so sorry.
I went to the post office.
Before I could go in, Aunt Ginny called.
Then Brick needed more goldfish and I had a million things in my head...
I love you.
I love you so much.
It was a disaster!
Because you forgot to mail in the envelope my name wasn't on any of the lists!
I had to sleep on the floor in the hotel.
They didn't have tickets to any of the museums!
I missed the state government in action!
A junior guidance counselor had to sit with me everywhere because legally I couldn't be left alone!
I'm not invisible to Miss Glover now!
No, she hates me!
This is all your fault!
FRANCES:
There it was, Sue found her voice.
And boy, was it loud.
I didn't deserve this.
I strongly suggest...
No.
Demand that you make it up to me!
FRANCES:
Yeah.
My girl was a fighter.
She was gonna be fine.
And all the cheese and sausage in the world doesn't make you feel prouder than that.
Oh, and Brick?
Turns out he could take care of himself too.
- You're my boyfriend now.
- Okay.
FRANCES:
Damn, I'm good.

"The Trip"
Here in the middle, we have a long tradition of kids raising money for their school by hitting up their neighbours, to buy crap they don't want or need.
Following in that great tradition,
Sue is selling cheese and sausage for Orson Junior High.
Four exciting varities of sausage to match whatever sausage meat you may find yourself in.
I think what makes Sue such a good seller is that she can take rejection.
Probably cause she's had so much practice.
Or maybe you can, perhaps, show your love of cheese, cheese ball...
I'll just wait here at the door in case you change your mind.
Let me tell you:
When it come to selling cheese and sausage,
Sue was driven.
She was driven by Mike all over Indiana.
Mike took her to Terre Haute...
They went to Gary.
She hit almost every county in the state.
'Cause if she sells $3,000 worth, she wins a free trip, all the way... to Indianapolis.
So it's okay to sell your stuff, Sue, but, remember, this is a place of business.
People are busy.
Oh, hey, Bob.

I'll take ten.
Really?
Oh, my God.
That's great!

That's why I just have a hot plate and a P.O. Box.
Okay, that'll be $284.

Oh, hi, Mr. Ehlert.
Would you like to help my--
No.

Well, of course it's because you're a woman.

**Put me down for the jalapeno cheddar ball.

Fine.

I'm sorry, honey.
Who?

I will go to the store when I decide it's time to go to the store.
Actually, we're almost out of a lot of stuff.
I'm going after work.
First I gotta go to the post office.
Then I'm gonna swing by Aunt Edie and Aunt Ginny'S.
They're hosting bridge club, and they're almost out of scotch.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I did it.
I sold over $3,000 worth of cheese and sausage!
Oh!
Honey!
- That's great, Sue.
- That's terrific!

- What?

Yeah, yeah, it has everything.
Just give me a minute.

Can you believe it?

I saw that on "Oprah," or "Project Runway" or something.
I don't remember, but it's teachable.
Am I in trouble?
Sue, I want you to march into that school, talk to who's ever in charge and get yourself on that trip.
I don't know.
Mr. Perez, the teacher, is kind of weird.
Someone said they saw him crying in the parking lot.
Doesn't matter.
You can't just be invisible, so you gotta stand up and fight for what's yours.
I mean, I don't always do that, but I've had kids.
I'm tired.
And don't be afraid to stare 'em down.
Wow.
Okay.
Got it.
How's this?
You got a little something-- You know what?
Lose the stare.
Just be yourself.
Hey, Brick's girlfriend's here.
Hello, Olivia.
So nice to meet you.
Hi!
Can Brick come out and play?
Hey, Brick?
Your girlfriend's here.
Get out there and have fun.
I don't want to.
Hey, you're not getting a lot of offers, bud.
Come on!
She's cute.
I told you I'd be here at 3:00.
Why weren't you waiting outside?
And another thing--make sure you're free on Saturday.
We have a birthday party.
You forgot, didn't you?
!
It's like you don't hear a word I'm saying.
I hear all the words, Olivia.
All of them.
All of them.
And why do you whisper to yourself?
It's so annoying!
This was a big step for Sue.
She was finally making a stand.
Yep, this girl was gonna be heard...
Eventually.
M--Mr.
Perez?
I sold over $3,000 of cheese and sausage to, you know, go on the trip to Indianapolis?
Who are you?
Oh, Sue.
Sue Heck?
I'm in your fifth period Spanish class?
I don't think so.
Anyway...
I sold over $3,000 worth of cheese and sausage to...
You know, go on the trip to Indianapolis.
Well, good for you, Sandy.
We'll see you on the bus.
Uh, see, that's the thing-- I'm not on the list.
But I sold over--
Okay, I'll look into it.
Really?
Gracias.
Tenga un buena dia.
How do you break up with a girl?
You sure you want to break up with that chick?
I mean, you're kind of a weird dude.
You got a little hottie that likes you.
I'm sure.
All right.
Well, girls like it you talk to 'em, so try blowing her off or something.
How do I do that?
Like this.
Great advice, Axl.
Now I'm married, and we have a baby!
I really thought I nailed the Sue thing.
I had taught her to stand up for herself.
I was so pumped, I was even making dinner.
Yep, she's lucky to have me.
I did it.
I talked to Mr. Perez, and neither one of us cried.
Oh, great!
I did it, Dad.
I was a little bit scared at first.
Okay, a lot scared...
But I stood my ground and explained the situation.
And...?
And he said he'd look into it.
Yay!
- Oh!
That's great.
- All right!
See, there you go.
- You stood up for yourself.
- Yes, good for you.
- Good girl.
- Perfect.
I'm going down there and talk to that guy.
Wait, Mike, didn't you hear her?
He said he would look into it.
He's blowing her off.
I tell people all day long, "I'll look into it." I never do.
No.
We are not doing this for her.
We are not helicopter parenting.
"Regis and Kelly."
You saw how excited she was.
If you go down there, you're gonna undermine her self-confidence, and she will never learn to fight her own battles.
Look, the trip is in two weeks.
If we don't hear before then, we'll step in.
So while I had one kid desperately trying to get into something,
I had another desperately trying to get out.
It's her!
Don't make me go out there.
I'll do any other kind of social interaction you want me to.
There's this new boy in my class who eats his boogers.
I bet he'd be my friend.
Anyone, but Olivia.
So if you don't like her, don't play with her.
I tried!
It's not that easy.
Okay, relax.
I'll take care of it.
Can Brick come out and play?
Look, Olivia, Brick asked me to speak to you because he thinks you're a very nice girl, but he's not ready to get married.
But he wants to remain friends because he likes you very much.
It's too late.
We're already married and we have kids.
What God has joined together, let no man put asunder.
Okay.
How about this?
You're not really married, and your kids are dolls.
So why don't you head home, and Brick will see you around school, okay, hon?
Nope.
What?
I've put too much time into this relationship to just walk away.
Well, I think you have to.
Nope.
You can't keep saying "nope" to everything.
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can!
- Okay, that's enough.
I'm not gonna get into this because I'm the grown-up, and I don't have to.
I'm sorry it came down to this, but, uh, it's over, okay?
Brick doesn't want to see you anymore.
Got it?
Nope.
Go home, Olivia.
How ya gonna make me?
Brick, Olivia's here.
Morning.
Trip to Indianapolis is today and they didn't call.
I was all packed and everything.
Now I'll never see the state seal up close.
What?
No, no, no!
You said the trip is next Saturday.
Yeah, it was next Saturday when I said it.
- Now it's today.
- It's today?
Well, they can't do that.
They said they'd look into it.
I'm beginning to think they didn't.
Oh!
That's it.
Come on.
Get your stuff.
What time did you say the bus is leaving?
It's okay, Mom.
They already left.
It's not worth--
Don't you dare say it!
You deserve this, Sue, 'cause you try and try long past when others would have stopped trying and, damn it, you are going on this trip.
Mom, you're still in pajamas.
They're drawstring.
It's almost pants.
Pull the bus over!
Okay, I know this doesn't look safe but I have dual air bags...
I think.
Open up!
Y-yes, I am talking to you.
My daughter, Sue Heck, is supposed to be on this bus.
A-Are--Are those pajamas?
They're drawstring.
It's almost pants.
I'm sorry.
She's not on the list.
Okay, you want to take it from here?
And really give it to him.
Um, I sold more than enough cheese and sausage to be on this trip.
She sold more than enough to be on this trip.
I demand...
to be on this bus.
She demands!
- I strongly suggest--
- Strongly suggests!
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna take it from here.
Good job, though.
I've got your number, Mr. Perez.
You never had any intention of "looking into this," now, did you?
For your information, I called the company, and they had no record of Sue Heck selling anything.
That is baloney!
Nobody ever has a record of Sue, but I was there.
She counted the orders, we mailed in those checks and she is getting on that bus!
Go!
Go, go, go!
I'm sorry.
I can't allow that.
Oh, okay.
Get back on that bus, Sue.
Okay.
No.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
You're gonna penalize this sweet, innocent young girl because you and that stupid company can't get your acts together?
What kind of message are you sending to our young people--
That hard work doesn't pay off?
Because that's what she's hearing, loud and clear.
Yeah, congratulations.
We just lost another teen to cynicism.
So you gonna let my daughter get on the bus or not?
Eh, it's not worth the fight.
Oh, God.
I thought I mailed Sue's envelope, I really did!
I gotta stop puttin' crap up there.
I can't do it anymore.
So you're stuck with her.
It's not all bad.
Olivia's got her strong points.
She's... strong.
I know.
She threw a pumpkin at the car.
Hey, if you and this chick got pretend married, why don't you just get pretend divorced?
She said if we ever broke up, she'd take half my books and we'd split the babies.
She'd get Strawberry Shortcake, and I'd get Rainbow Brite.
I'm not even sure if Rainbow Brite is mine.
I don't know what to tell you, Brick.
Women are complicated.
They're not simple and straightforward like us guys.
Yeah.
I only got two thoughts in my head--driving and sex.
Uh, grades.
I mean driving and grades.
Unfortunately, she's the kind of girl who won't move on till she's found some other poor sucker she can torment.
Oh, yeah.
Olivia called earlier.
She wants you to buy her lunch tomorrow.
She said it's, uh, her favorite and that you would know what that is.
Oh, God.
I don't!
Hey.
Sue make it on the bus?
All right!
That oughta feel good.
Yeah, it does.
Really does.
Yep.
She's lucky to have me.
Well, at least she'd be gone for four days.
Four days is a long time-- plenty of time for forgiveness.
And she did write.
Until finally...
Sue...
I am so, so sorry.
I went to the post office, but before I could go in,
Aunt Ginny called, and then Brick needed more goldfish and I had a million things in my head and...
I love you!
I love you so much!
It was a disaster.
Because you forgot to mail in the envelope...
My name wasn't on any of the lists!
I had to sleep on the floor in the hotel.
They didn't have tickets to any of the museums,
I missed the state government in action, and a junior guidance counselor had to sit outside with me everywhere because legally, I couldn't be left alone!
Well, I'm not invisible to Miss Glover now!
Oh, no.
She hates me!
This is all your fault!
There it was-- Sue found her voice.
And boy, was it loud.
I didn't deserve this!
I strongly suggest...
No, demand that you make it up to me.
Yep, my girl was a fighter.
She was gonna be fine.
And all the cheese and sausage in the world doesn't make you feel prouder than that.
Oh, and Brick?
Turns out he could take care of himself, too.
You're my boyfriend now.
Okay.
Damn I'm good.
"The Trip"
Here in the middle, we have a long tradition of kids raising money for their school by hitting up their neighbours, to buy crap they don't want or need.
Following in that great tradition,
Sue is selling cheese and sausage for Orson Junior High.
Four exciting varities of sausage to match whatever sausage meat you may find yourself in.
I think what makes Sue such a good seller is that she can take rejection.
Probably cause she's had so much practice.
Or maybe you can, perhaps, show your love of cheese, cheese ball...
I'll just wait here at the door in case you change your mind.
Let me tell you:
When it come to selling cheese and sausage,
Sue was driven.
She was driven by Mike all over Indiana.
Mike took her to Terre Haute...
They went to Gary.
She hit almost every county in the state.
'Cause if she sells $3,000 worth, she wins a free trip, all the way... to Indianapolis.
So it's okay to sell your stuff, Sue, but, remember, this is a place of business.
People are busy.
Oh, hey, Bob.
Would you like to help my school and send me on a trip to the state capital by buying some delicious--
I'll take ten.
Really?
Oh, my God.
That's great!
I love food you don't have to refrigerate.
Fridges-- they just tie you down.
That's why I just have a hot plate and a P.O. Box.
Okay, that'll be $284.
What?
Are you...
Ehlert.
Just casually scatter.
Oh, hi, Mr. Ehlert.
Would you like to help my--
No.
Frances!
You forgot to make coffee again.
You got me walking around here like an idiot with a doughnut and nothing to dunk it in.
Mr. Ehlert, how come I'm the one who's always asked to make the coffee?
I'm beginning to think it's because I'm a woman.
Well, of course it's because you're a woman.
The day I start telling men to make coffee for women, you have my permission to put a bullet in my head.
Wow.
Mom, that is so unfair.
You are not going to make that coffee, are you?
Eh.
Not worth the fight.
All personnel-
- I've been informed there will be fresh coffee shortly.
Hey, can I interest you in a cheese sampler, so I can win a trip to my state capital?
**Put me down for the jalapeno cheddar ball.
Yes!
Oh, and if you get that,
I can throw in the wild game sausage trio at half price.
Fine.
Sue was really kicking butt.
She was a shining beacon of motivation.
Axl?
Not so much.
Axl, how many times do I have to say it?
Turn off that TV and get dressed for school!
It'll take me, like, two seconds.
Chill.
Hey, hey.
Only one to a customer.
It's for Olivia.
I'm sorry, honey.
Who?
Olivia, my girlfriend.
So this girlfriend of yours-- Is she... here right now?
No.
She's at her house.
So how did this happen?
You're my boyfriend now.
Okay.
Wow, Brick.
That's great!
So this Olivia-- Do you like her?
She says I do.
Is she cute?
Is she nice?
She has a red ribbon in her hair.
I like red ribbons.
All Heck men like red ribbons.
Red ribbons.
Ma, we're out of cereal.
You going to the store or what?
Hey.
I will go to the store when I decide it's time to go to the store.
Actually, we're almost out of a lot of stuff.
I'm going after work.
First I gotta go to the post office.
Then I'm gonna swing by Aunt Edie and Aunt Ginny'S.
They're hosting bridge club, and they're almost out of scotch.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I did it.
I sold over $3,000 worth of cheese and sausage!
Oh!
Honey!
- That's great, Sue.
- That's terrific!
Look at you.
I know.
I just have to send the checks to the company, and then I am off to Indianapolis... the capital!
Oh, honey, I am so proud of you.
You worked hard, and it paid off.
And now you get to see close-up how Indiana state government works.
I know.
It's like a dream!
Damn it, Axl!
I told you, turn off the TV and get ready for school!
Now the bus is here, and you're not ready.
Told you, two seconds.
Chill.
How the hell does he do that?
Now that you're my boyfriend, you have to buy me ice cream, tell me I'm pretty and walk me to and from recess and lunch.
I made you a list so you don't forget.
Okay.
The crash rating on this baby?
Two stars.
Not one, but two.
Out of how many?
Five.
But who cares?
'Cause if you crash, the doors are so thin, they will cut you out like that.
Sue.
What are you doing here?
The school put up a list of winners for the field trip, and my name wasn't on it.
- What?
- Does this car have--
Yeah, yeah, it has everything.
Just give me a minute.
But you were a top seller.
I know.
Can you believe it?
Unfortunately, I could believe it.
This was Sue's whole life in a nutshell.
She tries and tries and never gets any recognition.
It's like people don't even see her.
Sue Heck?
Here.
Sue Heck?
Here.
Okay.
Not here.
Pizza or fish?
Pizza, please.
Oh.
Okay.
# Happy birthday to you, #
# Happy birthday to you, #
# Happy birthday dear... #
# Happy birthday to you #
Oh, honey.
That's just not fair.
What's not fair?
Sue sold enough sausage and cheese to win the big trip, and she's not on the list to go.
Oh, those monsters.
I'm gonna cancel my check.
Looks like I'm not going to Indianapolis.
I was really looking forward to it, too.
What are you talking about?
This is just a mistake.
Things like this happen all the time.
Yes, more often to you, but we'll straighten it out.
Eh.
It's not worth the fight.
Great.
Why do I have to be the only mom in the world whose teenager listens to what they say?
Then Sue turns to me and says, "Eh, it's not worth the fight."
Well, that's your fault.
She gets that from you.
I said it once!
- You say it all the time!
- I do not!
Hey, we don't wear flip-flops to church.
Jesus wore sandals.
Eh, it's not worth the fight.
I'm not paying $6 a month for other fees unless you can tell me what those other fees are.
No, don't transfer me to India.
Don't transfer me-- Eh, it's not worth the fight.
Well, the kids are asleep, so...
Honey, I am so exhausted.
Eh, it's not worth the fight.
And I said it to Mr. Ehlert right in front of her.
Oh, my God!
Am I a horrible mother?
Too soon to tell.
It's just so unfair.
I mean, for once in her life, Sue finally wins something, and--
And then that stupid school has to go and screw it all up.
She earned that trip.
We earned that trip.
Hell, yeah!
I'm the one that spent 50 hours in the car with her.
Oh, did you know that her friend Stacy likes a boy named Ben, but Ben likes Stacy's friend Madison, so now they're not talking to her?
You want more?
I got lots more.
I have got to fix this.
Sue has to stand up for herself.
I mean, if this isn't worth the fight, Mike,
I don't know what is.
Hey, Sue, get in here.
You know what this is?
A teachable moment.
I saw that on "Oprah," or "Project Runway" or something.
I don't remember, but it's teachable.
Am I in trouble?
Sue, I want you to march into that school, talk to who's ever in charge and get yourself on that trip.

I missed the state government in action, and a junior guidance counselor had to sit outside with me everywhere because legally, I couldn't be left alone!
Well, I'm not invisible to Miss Glover now!
Oh, no.
She hates me!
This is all your fault!
There it was-- Sue found her voice.
And boy, was it loud.
I didn't deserve this!
I strongly suggest...
No, demand that you make it up to me.
Yep, my girl was a fighter.
She was gonna be fine.
And all the cheese and sausage in the world doesn't make you feel prouder than that.
Oh, and Brick?
Turns out he could take care of himself, too.
You're my boyfriend now.
Okay.
Damn I'm good.
"These violent delights have violent ends,
"and in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
"which, as they kiss, consume."
Gran?
Edward, don't!
She'll see you.
Okay.
Gran, I'd like you to meet...
Happy birthday, Bella.
Happy birthday.
I thought we agreed, no presents.
Well, the one from me's not wrapped, so it doesn't count.
That's actually great.
Thanks, Dad.
It goes with this one from your mom.
We coordinated.
Well, she coordinated me.
It's to put your pictures in from senior year.
Senior year.
-How'd you get so old so fast?
-I didn't.
It's not that old.
I don't know.
Is that a gray hair?
No.
No way.
Happy birthday.
That's really funny.
Another missing hiker brings the total to 3 presumed dead.
Rangers are searching for the killer animal...
Situation's all critical
You've got to look first before you go
It's Bella.
Bella!
-Hi.
-I'm...
Today's the big day, Bella.
R and J essay due.
-Yeah.
-Wherefore art thou, Bella?
Let me take a picture of you guys.
My mom wants me to put together, like, a scrapbook full of memories.
Cool.
Yeah.
I take them.
I'm not in them.
-No, no, no, come here.
-Well, you are today.
You'll photoshop this if my nose looks big, right?
Don't worry, I'm in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.
That's good.
Good.
Cullen's here.
Well, talk to you later.
-Happy birthday.
-Don't remind me.
Bella, your birth is definitely something to celebrate.
-Yeah, but my aging's not.
-Your aging?
I think 18 is a little young to start worrying about that.
It's one year older than you.
No, it isn't.
I'm 109.
Well, maybe I shouldn't be dating such an old man.
It's gross.
I should be thoroughly repulsed.
-We have to go to class.
-Okay.
Wait a second.
Someone wants you.
-Bella!
-Jacob!
What?
I'll leave you to talk.
Hello, biceps!
You know, anabolic steroids are really bad for you.
Well, I'm just filling out, Bella.
You know, it wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more.
You should switch schools.
You can come hang out with the palefaces.
I'm all right.
I prefer the rez school's exclusivity.
They let any old riffraff into this place.
I see.
Then why are you slumming it?
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.
You should really come take a ride when it's done.
Is it fast?
It's decent.
-I'm kidding.
-Okay.
Good.
Hey, happy birthday.
Your dad told my dad, so...
Yeah, of course he did.
I saw this the other day and thought of you.
Catches bad dreams.
That's kind of perfect.
Thank you.
No problem.
-Good seeing you.
-Yeah, I'll see you later.
Bye.
So how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?
Because I have nothing to give back to you.
Bella, you give me everything just by breathing.
See?
Thank you.
-That's all I want.
-Bella!
Happy birthday!
I thought I said no presents.
I've already seen you open it, and guess what, you love it.
You're gonna wear it tonight.
Our place.
Come on.
Please?
It'll be fun.
-Okay.
All right.
-Great!
Okay, I'll see you at 7:00.
Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing.
Sorry, Bella.
Happy...
Never mind.
You can't trust vampires.
Trust me.
O my love!
My wife!
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Thou art not conquered.
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks.
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
I hate being celebrated.
There are worse tragedies.
I mean, look at Romeo.
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.
Yeah.
Though I do envy him one thing.
Juliet is, like, perfect.
If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.
Not the girl, the suicide.
It's nearly impossible for...
For some people.
For humans, a little poison, a dagger to the heart.
There's so many different options.
Why would you say that?
Because I had to consider it once.
I didn't know if I'd get to you in time.
I had to come up with some kind of plan.
What was the plan?
That I'd go to Italy and provoke the Volturi.
-The what?
-The Volturi.
Now, who'd like to repeat the last few lines of iambic pentameter just to show they were paying attention?
Mr. Cullen?
Yes, Mr. Berty.
"O here will I set up my everlasting rest
"and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.
"Eyes, look your last.
"Arms, take your last embrace!
"And, lips, O you, the doors of breath,
"seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death!"
Eyes on the screen, people.
Thus with a kiss I die.
The Volturi are a very old, very powerful family.
I guess they're the closest thing to royalty my world has.
-Is that Carlisle?
-Yeah.
He lived with them for a few decades.
Described them as very refined.
No respect for human life, of course, but a respect for the arts and the sciences, at least.
And the law.
Above all, the law.
Vampires have laws?
Not very many.
And only one that's regularly enforced.
What is it?
That we keep the existence of our kind a secret.
We don't make spectacles of ourselves, and we don't kill conspicuously.
Unless, of course, you want to die.
You gotta stop talking about that.
I can't even think about someone hurting you.
Bella, the only thing that can hurt me is you.
And I don't have anything else to be afraid of.
That's not true.
Victoria?
She'll come for me one day.
Alice will see when she decides, and we'll be ready.
I could protect you if you change me.
Bella, you already do protect me.
You're my only reason to stay alive, if that's what I am.
But it's my job to protect you.
From everyone except my sister.
It's time!
It's time!
(The Violet Hour)
Your lips are nettles
Your tongue is wine
You're left as liquid But your body's pine
Sorry about all this.
-We tried to rein Alice in.
-As if that were even possible.
-Happy birthday, Bella.
-Thanks.
I found it in your bag.
You mind?
Dating an older woman.
Hot.
-What?
-You first, Rosalie.
It's a necklace.
Alice picked it out.
Thanks.
Show me the love.
This one's from Emmett.
Already installed it in your truck.
Finally a decent sound system
-for that piece of...
-Hey!
Don't hate the truck.
Open Esme and Carlisle's.
Just a little something to brighten your day.
Yes, you've been looking kind of pale lately.
Paper cut.
Jaz, Jaz.
It's okay.
It's just a little blood.
Get Jasper out of here.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.
Check on Jasper.
I'm sure he's very upset with himself, and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.
Edward.
-I never wanted to have a party.
-It's not your fault.
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.
How do you do it?
Years and years of practice.
Did you ever think of just doing it the easy way?
No.
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.
It brings me happiness, even if I am damned regardless.
Damned?
Like hell?
Carlisle, you couldn't be damned.
You couldn't.
It's impossible.
Thank you, Bella.
You've always been very gracious about us.
So that's it?
That's why he won't change me?
Imagine the situation in reverse.
If you believed as Edward does, could you take away his soul?
You can't protect me from everything.
At some point, something's gonna separate us.
It's gonna be an accident or illness or old age,
as long as I'm human.
And the only solution is to change me.
That's not a solution.
That's a tragedy.
You're not gonna want me when I look like a grandmother.
Bella, do you not understand my feelings for you at all?
Carlisle told me
how you feel about your soul.
I don't believe that.
So don't worry about mine.
You should go inside.
It's still my birthday.
So can I ask one thing?
Kiss me?
I love you.
I love you.
(Roslyn)
Up with your turret
Aren't we just terrified?
Shale, screen your worry
From what you won't ever find
Don't let it fool you
Don't let it fool you
Down
Hey.
Just come take a walk with me.
We have to leave Forks.
Why?
Carlisle's supposed to be 10 years older than he looks, and people are starting to notice.
Okay, I've gotta think of something to say to Charlie.
When you say "we"...
I mean my family and myself.
Edward, what happened with Jasper, it's nothing.
You're right.
It was nothing, nothing but what I always expected and nothing compared to what could have happened.
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.
I belong with you.
No.
You don't.
I'm coming.
Bella,
I don't want you to come.
You don't want me?
No.
That changes things a lot.
But if it's not too much to ask, can you just promise me something?
Don't do anything reckless.
For Charlie's sake.
And I'll promise something to you in return.
This is the last time you'll ever see me.
I won't come back, and you can go on with your life without any interference from me.
It will be like
I never existed, I promise.
If this is about my soul, take it.
I don't want it without you.
It's not about your soul.
You're just not good for me.
Not good enough for you.
I'm just sorry I let this go on for so long.
Please...
Don't...
Goodbye.
Edward.
Edward.
Edward.
Edward!
Edward.
I'm gonna try the Cullens' place again.
-The Cullens left town, Charlie.
-Good riddance.
Where'd they go?
We'll find her, Charlie.
-Thanks, Harry.
-Charlie!
Hey.
She's all right.
I got her.
Thank you, Sam.
(Possibility)
There's a possibility
There's a possibility
All that I had
Was all I'm gonna get
Alice, you've disappeared, like everything else.
Now who else can I talk to?
I'm lost.
When you left, and he left,
you took everything with you.
But the absence of him is everywhere I look.
It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest.
Bella.
But in a way I'm glad.
The pain is my only reminder that he was real, that you all were.
All right.
That's it.
What?
You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother.
I'm not leaving Forks.
Bells, he's not coming back.
I know.
It's just not normal, this behavior.
Quite frankly, it's scaring the hell out of me and your mother.
Baby, I don't want you to leave.
I don't, but just go.
Go to Jacksonville.
-Make some new friends.
-I like my old friends.
-Well, you never see them anymore.
-I do.
I'm... gonna go shopping tomorrow with Jessica.
-You hate shopping.
-I...
I need a girls' night out.
All right.
Girls' night.
Shopping.
I like it.
Go buy some stuff.
Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.
Yeah, Bella Swan.
I don't know why you want to sit through all those zombies eating people and no hot guys kissing anybody.
It's gross.
Like...
And why are there that many zombie movies anyway?
'Cause if it's supposed to, like, draw a parallel about leprosy, my cousin had leprosy.
It's not funny, you know?
And, like, is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism?
Because don't be so pleased with your own, like, self-referential cleverness, you know?
Like, some girls like to shop.
Not all girls, apparently.
Although I was surprised you even called at all.
You know?
Like, your depression thing, I get it.
I'm totally, totally worried.
But after a while it's like,
-you're still bumming...
-You want a ride, girls?
and I'm going through stuff, too.
You know?
Like Mike deciding he just wants to be friends.
What's up?
Look what we found.
It's hard, you know?
Like, and since when does "just friends"...
-What's up guys?
-Look what we found.
Hey, where you going?
Keep walking.
This is dangerous.
-Dude, come on.
-Come here for a sec!
I think I know those guys.
We got beer!
We got bikes!
Well, they seem great.
Can we go?
I'm just gonna see something.
Hey, girlie!
All right, all right.
We got a taker.
Turn around.
-Shut up!
-You shut up!
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
No, that's cool.
I'll be whoever you want me to be, honey.
So, what do you say?
You promised me, nothing reckless.
You promised it would be as if you never existed.
-You lied.
-You say something, babe?
You know what?
Never mind.
Stop!
Stop, stop, stop!
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?
Just curious.
-I thought that I saw something.
-You...
You're insane, actually.
Or suicidal.
That homeboy could've been a psycho.
I was about to end up in an FBI interview room like some lame TV show.
God, that was such a rush.
Awesome.
So you're an adrenaline junkie now?
That's cool.
You can go bungee jumping.
You don't get on the back of some random loser's motorcycle.
Crazy.
Alice, I saw him.
Maybe I'm crazy now.
I guess that's okay.
If a rush of danger is what it takes to see him, then that's what I'll find.
Bella!
Where the hell have you been, loca?
I brought you something.
-Okay.
-It's a little crazy.
Scrap metal.
You shouldn't have.
I saved it from the junkyard.
I think they'll probably cost more to fix than they're worth, but then I thought that if I had a mechanic friend to help me out then...
-Me being the mechanic-type friend?
-That's right.
-Since when are you into motorcycles?
-Since now.
I get it if you think that this is really stupid and reckless.
Yeah, I mean, it's completely stupid and reckless.
When do we start?
Now.
-Please?
-All right.
Hey, be careful.
Those things are actually really heavy, so...
Jake, you're, like, buff.
How did that happen?
You're, like, 16.
I don't get it.
Age is just a number, baby.
What are you, like, 40 now?
It feels like that sometimes.
That song's good.
You don't like it?
I don't really like... music anymore, kind of.
Okay.
No more music.
So I was thinking, if we're gonna do this every day, and hopefully we will, we have to, like, fit some homework in there somewhere.
I don't want Billy thinking that I'm a bad influence on you.
You?
Influence me?
Please.
Are you...
I'm older than you, so that makes me the influencer and you the influencee.
No, no, no.
My size and knowledge base actually makes me older than you because of your general paleness and lack of know-how.
I convinced you to build 2-wheeled death machines with me.
Don't you think that makes you kind of young and naive?
Okay.
So where do we stand?
-I'm 35.
And you might be, like, 32.
-Come on.
-Yo, Jake, you in there?
-It's okay.
It's just my boys.
-Hey, Jake.
-Hey.
Guys, this is Bella.
-Bella, that's Quil and Embry.
-Hi.
I'm Quil Ateara.
So the bike building story is true.
Yeah, yeah, I taught him everything he knows.
What about the part where you're his girlfriend?
We're friends, you know.
-Burn.
-Actually, remember I said she's a girl and a friend.
Embry, do you remember him making that distinction?
Nope.
So you guys have girlfriends?
That's awesome.
Yeah, right.
Quil's actually taking his cousin to prom.
Yeah, that's still a riot.
You want funny, Black?
I'll give you funny.
Jeez.
Hey, that hold's illegal!
I got 5 bucks on Quil.
You're on.
(Shooting The Moon)
All of the astronauts Champagne in plastic cups
Waiting for the big hero to show
Outside the door he stands His head in his hands
And his heart in his throat
What can he tell them now
Dear Alice,
I wish I had your real address.
I wish I could tell you about Jake.
He makes me feel better.
I mean, he makes me feel alive.
The hole in my chest, well, when I'm with Jake, it's like it's almost healed
for a while.
So, Quil keeps asking to come over.
I think he likes you a little too much.
Well, I'm really not into the whole cougar thing.
You know?
What's up with you and age?
I mean, how old was that Cullen guy, anyway?
But even Jake can't keep the dreams away.
Hey, hey, hey!
Wake up, Bella.
You're okay.
You're okay.
I thought this thing was starting to work, but
I guess not.
Can I ask you something?
Hanging out with Jacob, that seems to take your mind off things a bit, doesn't it?
You know, sometimes you gotta learn to love what's good for you.
You know what I mean?
Of course, what do I know?
I'm just a terminal bachelor.
Famous ladies' man.
Okay.
I'm gonna go to bed.
I love you.
If I told you
I couldn't have fixed these bikes, what would you have said?
Are you doubting your mad skills?
No.
Definitely not.
I mean, they'll run fine.
It's just, maybe if I was smart, I would have dragged out the rebuild a bit.
If you told me you couldn't fix these bikes, I would say that that's... really too bad, but... that we're just gonna have to find something else to do.
Is that Sam Uley?
Yeah.
Him and his cult.
My God.
Did you see that?
They're not really fighting, Bella.
They're cliff diving.
Scary as hell, but a total rush.
-A rush?
-Most of us jump from lower down.
We leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples.
You have some kind of beef with him or something?
I don't know.
They just think they run this place.
Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids.
-Now look at him.
-That's Embry?
-Yeah.
-What happened to him?
He missed some school.
Now all of a sudden, he started following Sam around like a little puppy.
Same thing happened with Paul and Jared.
Sam keeps giving me this look, like he's waiting for me or something.
It's kind of starting to freak me out.
Well, you should just avoid him.
I try.
Okay.
-You look scared.
-I'm not.
All right.
-Brake?
-That one.
Clutch?
Good.
Gas?
Ready?
Now, slowly release the clutch.
Bella.
Stop.
You all right?
I'm gonna go again.
Okay.
Hit the brake!
I wanna go again.
Are you trying to get yourself killed?
-No.
I want to go again.
-No.
Forget it.
No more bikes.
Man, your head.
-Yeah.
-My God, I'm sorry.
What, you're apologizing for bleeding?
Yeah.
I guess I am.
Well, it's just blood, Bella.
No big deal.
There.
What are you staring at?
You're sort of beautiful.
How hard did you hit your head?
I don't know.
Let's go.
I did see something in the woods.
Totally.
Baby, I believe you.
No, he doesn't.
He's just trying to get lucky.
No, okay.
It was jet black and huge.
On all 4s, it was still taller than a person.
A bear, maybe?
Or an alien.
You're lucky you didn't get probed.
Well, I saw it.
You know, you're not the only one.
My dad's been getting reports at the station.
Like, 5 hikers have been killed by some bear.
But they can't find the bear.
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.
So?
I mean,
Bella's back?
Yeah, I guess so.
All right, that's...
Well, welcome.
So, listen, now that you're talking and eating again, which, you know, you've got to get that protein in there,
I was just wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me.
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah, I do.
Cool.
Let me see, we could check out
Love Spelled Backwards Is Love.
You know, it's a dumb title, but it's a romantic comedy.
-I mean, it's supposed to be pretty...
-No.
No romance.
How about Face Punch?
Have you heard of that?
I mean, that's an action movie.
Yeah, that's perfect.
Guns, adrenaline.
That's my thing.
Okay.
We should get a bunch of people to go.
Do you guys want to go see
-Face Punch?
-Face Punch, yeah!
Mike, hey, we were supposed to watch that.
Remember, the trailer's like...
-"Punch faces."
-I remember.
Yeah!
Movie night with Bella.
So Face Punch?
You like action movies?
Not really.
I heard it sucks.
Bad.
Are you even old enough to see this movie?
I mean, you know, without, like, adult supervision.
Right, yeah, well, she's buying my ticket for me.
She's buying it.
Okay.
Jessica bailed, and Angela got the stomach flu, so Eric's taking care of her.
-It's just us 3.
-Great!
-Great.
-Yeah.
Put your gun down.
Put your gun down or I'm gonna blow your frickin' head off.
Both of you put both of your guns down or I'm gonna blow both of your frickin' heads off.
All right, forget it, let's do this!
Okay, I think I'm gonna throw up.
He's...
What a marshmallow!
You should hold out for someone with a stronger stomach.
Someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit.
Yeah.
I'll keep my eye open for that.
I feel bad.
He probably has that flu that's going around.
What?
I can't hold your hand?
No, of course you can.
I just think it means, you know, something a little different to you.
So...
Okay, well, tell me something.
You like me, right?
And you think I'm sort of beautiful?
Jacob, please, don't do this.
Why?
Because you're about to ruin everything.
And I need you.
Well, I've got loads of time.
I'm not gonna give up.
I don't want you to, but it's just 'cause I don't want you to go anywhere.
And that's really selfish.
You know, I'm not like a car that you can fix up.
I'm never gonna run right.
So I should be fair to you.
It's because of him, right?
Look,
I know what he did to you.
But, Bella, I would never ever do that.
I won't ever hurt you.
I promise.
I won't let you down.
You can count on me.
Well,
I need to go home.
I was feeling sick before the movie.
Okay?
What is your problem?
Right now?
You're my problem.
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.
You want me to put you in the hospital?
Jake!
Jake, the movie's over.
What are you doing?
You're really hot.
Like, you feel like you have a fever.
Are you okay?
I don't know what's happening.
I gotta go.
That dude is weird.
Jake, your dad says you have mono.
He won't let me visit, but would you call me?
Hey, it's me again.
I just...
I'm sorry about what I said at the movie theater.
I just wanted to hear your voice, so no pressure.
Jacob, please...
Call me.
Okay.
We should be back around 3:00.
Hey.
Look, I don't have to go fishing today.
Yes, you do.
Yeah, you do.
Go.
What are you talking about?
Just be careful.
Always am.
Those bears won't get the drop on me, Bella.
My kung fu is strong.
Jake!
Hey!
You cut your hair off?
And got a tattoo?
Bella.
I thought you were too sick to come outside or pick up the phone when I call.
Go away.
What?
Go away.
What happened to you?
What's...
Hey!
What happened?
Did Sam get to you?
Is that what's happening?
Sam's trying to help me.
Don't blame him.
But if you want somebody to blame, how about those filthy bloodsuckers you love, the Cullens?
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
You've been lying to everyone.
Charlie.
But you can't lie to me.
-Not anymore, Bella.
-Jacob!
Jacob!
Look, Bella, we can't be friends anymore.
Look, Jake, I know that I've been hurting you.
It's killing me.
It kills me.
I just need...
Maybe give me, like,
-some time or something.
-Look, don't.
It's not you.
It's not you, it's me, right?
Really?
It's true.
It is me.
I'm not good.
I used to be a good kid.
Not anymore.
This doesn't even matter.
All right?
This is over.
You can't break up with me.
I mean...
I mean, you're my best friend.
You promised me.
I know.
I promised I wouldn't hurt you, Bella.
And this is me keeping that promise.
Go home and don't come back or you're gonna get hurt.
Alice, things are...
Things are bad again.
Without Jake, I just...
I can't stand it.
I don't see Edward anymore.
Will it really feel like he never existed?
I will find the place where I can see him again.
Bella.
Laurent.
I didn't expect to find you here.
I went to visit the Cullens, but the house is empty.
I'm surprised they left you behind.
Weren't you sort of a... pet of theirs?
Yeah.
You could say that.
Do the Cullens visit often?
Lie.
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.
Lie better.
I'll tell them that you stopped by.
But I probably shouldn't tell Edward,
'cause he's pretty protective.
But he's far away, isn't he?
Why are you here?
I came as a favor to Victoria.
-Victoria?
-She asked me to see if you were still under the protection of the Cullens.
Victoria feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate, given he killed hers.
An eye for an eye.
Threaten him.
Edward would know who did it.
And he'd come after you.
I don't think he will.
After all, how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected?
Victoria won't be happy about my killing you, but I can't help myself.
You are so mouth-watering.
-Please, don't.
I mean, you helped us.
-No, no...
Don't be afraid.
I'm doing you a kindness.
Victoria plans on killing you slowly, painfully, whereas I'll make it quick.
I promise.
You will feel nothing.
Edward, I love you.
I don't believe it.
-Dad!
I saw them.
-What's the matter?
-In the woods.
They're not bears.
-What do you mean "in the woods"?
Bell, what the hell were you doing out in the woods?
They're wolves.
I mean, they're like huge wolves.
Are you sure about that, Bella?
Yeah!
I just saw them.
They were after something.
Wolves?
You saw them?
All right, well, Harry, feel like going hunting?
Get some of your guys together?
Sure, yeah, I'll just...
By now, those wolves will be dead, and Laurent would have told her I'm unprotected.
Victoria.
I should go to the station.
Yeah, you should.
You should go.
Can you just stay in the house?
Bella!
You scared me.
-What the hell are you doing?
-Back up.
I'm coming up.
Hey.
Look, I'm sorry.
-For what?
-I wish I could explain.
But I literally can't.
Have you ever had a secret you couldn't tell anyone, one that wasn't yours to share?
Well, that's what it's like for me.
But worse.
You have no idea how tight I'm bound.
I hate this.
I hate what they've done to you.
I mean, the killer part is, you already know.
Bella, do you remember when we walked on the beach at La Push?
The...
The story.
The story about the cold ones.
I guess I understand why that's the only part you remember.
There's gotta be something that you can do.
No.
I'm in it for life.
Well, maybe we should just get out of here for a while.
Just leave, just you and me.
You'd do that?
I would do it for you.
It's not something I can just run away from, Bella.
But I would run away with you
if I could.
I gotta go.
They'll start wondering where I am.
Come here.
Please, try to remember.
It'd be so much easier if you knew.
I'll try.
But, Jake...
Jake, what are you doing?
Wait, Jake.
Jake.
Edward, I'm scared.
You should be.
Really, it's just like an old story.
I'm not really supposed to say anything about it.
Did you know Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?
Bella?
I need to see him.
He's not in.
Okay, I'm sorry, I really need to see him.
Bella!
What did you do?
-Okay, what did you do?
-Hey.
-What did you do to him?
-Easy!
He didn't want this.
What did we do?
What did he do?
What'd he tell you?
-Both of you calm down.
-Nothing.
He tells me nothing because he's scared of you.
-Too late now.
-Bella, get back!
Paul, calm down, now!
Bella!
Run!
Jake, run!
Paul!
Hey!
Take Bella back to Emily's place.
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.
Alice, is it possible that everything is true?
The fairy tales and horror stories?
Is it possible that there isn't anything sane or normal at all?
Hey, I think we should go back and see if Jacob's okay.
I hope Paul sinks some teeth in him.
Serves him right.
No way.
Jacob's a natural.
You see him phase on the fly?
I got 5 says Paul doesn't touch him.
Come on in, Bella.
We won't bite.
Speak for yourself.
(Done All Wrong)
I done me wrong
And done all wrong
All the wrong I've done I'm sure I'll live quite long
Hey, about Emily, Sam's fiancée?
Don't stare.
It bugs Sam.
Why would I stare?
Are you guys hungry?
Like I have to ask.
Who's this?
Bella Swan.
Who else?
So, you're the vampire girl.
So, you're the wolf girl.
Guess so.
Well, I'm engaged to one.
Save some for your brothers.
And ladies first.
Muffin?
Sure.
Thanks.
Leave it to Jacob to find a way around Sam's gag order.
He didn't say anything to me.
That's a wolf thing.
Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want them to or not.
And check it out.
We can hear each other's thoughts.
Would you shut up?
These are trade secrets.
Damn it!
This chick runs with vampires.
You can't really run with vampires.
'Cause they're fast.
Yeah?
Well, we're faster.
Freaked out yet?
You're not the first monsters I've met.
Jake's right.
You're good with weird.
Hey.
Sorry.
So you're a werewolf?
Yeah.
Last time I checked.
A few lucky members of the tribe have the gene.
A bloodsucker moves into town and the fever sets in.
Mono.
Yeah.
I wish.
Well, can't you find a way to just... stop?
I mean, it's wrong.
It's not a lifestyle choice, Bella.
I was born this way.
I can't help it.
You're such a hypocrite.
What, I'm not the right kind of monster for you?
It's not what you are.
It's what you do.
They never hurt anybody.
You've killed people, Jake.
Bella, we're not killing anyone.
Then who is?
What we're trying to protect you people from, the only thing we do kill,
vampires.
Wait, Jake, you can't.
Don't worry.
We can't touch your little precious Cullens unless they violate the treaty.
That's not what I'm saying.
You can't kill vampires.
They'll...
They'll kill you.
Really?
We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough.
Laurent?
And his red-headed girlfriend is next.
Victoria's here?
Was.
We chased her all the way to the Canadian border the other night.
She keeps coming back.
We don't know what she's after.
I do.
Me.
Don't worry.
We've got this place covered.
She won't get near you or Charlie.
Look, you've got to be careful.
She's fast.
You don't know how fast she is.
You know, your lack of confidence in us is a little insulting.
All right, I'd better go.
You gotta go?
Yeah.
Got a vampire to kill.
Alice, I'm all right.
Until I'm alone.
And lately, that's all the time.
Jacob's gone.
He's hunting Victoria.
And Charlie's hunting Jacob.
And you're gone.
And so is Edward.
And there's just nothing now.
You got something, Harry?
Nope.
Nothing.
But I realize where I have to go, what I have to do to see him again.
(Hearing Damage)
A tear in my brain
Allows the voices in
They wanna push you off the path
With their frequency wires
And you can do no wrong
In my eyes
In my eyes
You can do no wrong
In my eyes
In my eyes
A drunken salesman
Your hearing damage
Your mind is restless
They say you're getting better
But you don't feel any better
Your speakers are blowing
Your ears are wrecking
Your hearing damage
You wish you felt better
You wish you felt better
You can do no wrong
In my eyes
In my eyes
In my eyes
Don't do this.
You wanted me to be human.
Watch me.
Please.
For me.
You won't stay with me any other way.
Bella, please.
(Slow Life)
This constant noise all the time
Even though you're the only one I see
Breathe!
Breathe!
Come on, Bella, breathe!
Bella?
Bella, can you hear me?
Jake?
Come here.
What the hell were you thinking?
I just wanted to see something.
Get her home!
I'm gonna go help out over at Harry's place.
What happened at Harry's?
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.
Charlie and my dad are over at his place with his family.
Is he okay?
He's gone.
Come on.
I'll get you something dry and drive you home.
108 degrees over here.
God!
My hands are freezing.
It must be nice, never getting cold.
It's a wolf thing.
It's not.
It's a Jacob thing.
You're just warm.
You're like your own sun.
This is better, now that you know about me.
But...
You saw what happened to Emily.
Sam got angry.
Lost it for a split second.
Em was standing too close.
He'll never be able to take that back.
What if I got mad at you?
Sometimes,
I feel like I'm gonna disappear.
Okay, not that you need me to tell you something like this,
but I always will.
You're not gonna lose yourself.
I wouldn't let that happen.
How?
I'll tell you all the time
how special you are.
Thank you.
For everything.
Wait.
There's a vampire.
How do you know?
I can smell it.
I'm getting you out of here.
That's Carlisle's car.
They're here.
Bella, it's a trick!
Stop!
You gotta come with me!
They won't hurt me.
If a Cullen is back here, this is their territory.
Treaty says we can only defend on our own lands.
-I can't protect you here.
-Okay.
That's okay.
You don't have to.
You're about to cross a line.
Then don't draw one.
Please?
Alice?
-My God!
What are you...
-Bella!
I'm sorry, I just, I can't believe you're here.
Is...
Would you like to explain to me how you're alive?
What?
I saw a vision of you.
You jumped off a cliff.
Why in the hell would you try and kill yourself?
I mean, what about Charlie?
-What about...
-I didn't try to kill myself.
I was cliff jumping.
Recreationally.
It was fun.
I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy.
Does...
Did you tell him?
No.
He only calls in once every few months.
He said he wants to be alone.
Bella, what is that God-awful wet dog smell?
That's probably me.
Or it's Jacob.
Jacob who?
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.
Bella!
Werewolves are not good company to keep.
Speak for yourself.
I had to see you were safe.
I thought you couldn't protect me here.
Guess I don't care.
Well, I'm not gonna hurt her.
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.
I'm talking about the other bloodsucker who tried to kill Bella because of you.
Victoria?
Yeah, Victoria's been around.
I didn't see her.
I didn't see you get pulled out of the water, either.
I can't see past you and your pack of mutts.
Don't get me upset...
-Hey, stop.
Stop, stop...
-or things are gonna get very ugly.
I'll give you a minute.
Hey.
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna come back,
-right?
-As soon as you put the dog out.
Is he...
Are there others?
How many Cullens are here and how long are they staying?
No.
It's just Alice.
And she can stay as long as she'd like.
Well, are the rest coming back?
No.
Not that I know of.
Anything else?
That's it.
Well, if that's all, then you'd better go run back to Sam.
I've done it again.
I keep breaking my promise.
We don't have to do this to each other.
Yes, we do.
Bella...
Swan residence.
He's not here right now.
He's arranging a funeral.
Who was that?
What?
Always in the way.
Who was that?
Bella, step back.
-Jake, who was that?
-Bella!
Bella, it's Edward.
He thinks you're dead.
Rosalie told him why I came here.
Why would you...
Why didn't you let me speak to him?
-He didn't ask for you.
-Bella.
-I don't care!
-Bella.
Bella!
He's going to the Volturi.
He wants to die, too.
He left you, Bella.
He didn't want you anymore.
Remember?
No, I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt.
What about your dad?
I'm 18.
I'm legally free to go, and I left a note.
Please, Bella, just stay here.
For Charlie.
Or for me.
I have to go.
I'm begging you.
Please.
Goodbye, Jacob.
Okay.
So you've made up your minds.
I'm afraid your particular gifts are too valuable to destroy.
But if you're unhappy with your lot, join us.
We would be delighted to utilize your skills.
Won't you consider staying with us?
You know it will happen anyway.
Not without cause.
Such a waste.
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?
I figured you wouldn't be opposed to grand theft auto.
Not today.
What?
What do you see?
They refused him.
-So?
-He's gonna make a scene.
-Show himself to the humans.
-No!
When?
He's gonna wait until noon, when the sun's at its highest.
God, Alice, you got to hurry up.
There's Volterra.
-Why are they all in red?
-San Marco's Day festival.
They're commemorating the expulsion of vampires from the city.
It's the perfect setting.
The Volturi will never let him get far enough to reveal himself.
We have 5 minutes.
I know, Bella, just breathe.
Alice!
Bella, you're the only one he can't see coming.
If I go, he'll read my thoughts.
He'll think I'm lying.
He'll rush into it.
-Where do I go?
-He'll be under the clock tower.
Go!
Don't!
Heaven.
You have to move.
Open your eyes.
Look at me.
I'm alive.
You have to move.
Bella.
-You're here.
-I'm here.
You're alive.
Yes.
I needed to make you see me once.
You had to know that I was alive, that you didn't have to feel guilty about anything.
I can let you go now.
I never acted out of guilt.
I just couldn't live in a world where you don't exist.
-But you said...
-I lied.
I had to lie.
But you believed me so easily.
Because it doesn't make sense for you to love me.
I mean, I'm nothing.
I'm human.
I'm nothing.
Bella, you're everything to me.
You're everything.
I won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen.
Aro wants to speak with you again.
No rules were broken.
Nonetheless, we should take this conversation to a more appropriate venue.
Fine.
Bella, why don't you go and enjoy the rest of the festival?
The girl comes with us.
No.
You can go to hell.
Come on, guys.
It's a festival.
You wouldn't want to make a scene.
We wouldn't.
Enough.
Jane.
Aro sent me to see what was taking so long.
Just do as she says.
Go ahead.
Don't be scared.
Are you?
No.
-Is she human?
-Yes.
Does she know?
Yes.
Then, why would...
She wants to be.
And so she will be.
Or dessert.
Sister.
They send you out to get 1 and you bring back 2.
And a half.
Such a clever girl.
What a happy surprise!
Bella is alive after all.
Isn't that wonderful?
I love a happy ending.
They are so rare.
Her blood appeals to you so much it makes me thirsty.
How can you stand to be so close to her?
-It's not without difficulty.
-Yes, I can see that.
Aro can read every thought I've ever had with one touch.
And now you know everything.
So get on with it.
You are quite a soul reader yourself, Edward.
Though you can't read Bella's thoughts.
Fascinating.
I would love to see if you are an exception to my gifts, as well.
Would you do me the honor?
Interesting.
I see nothing.
I wonder if...
Let us see if she's immune to all our powers.
Shall we, Jane?
-No!
-Pain.
Stop!
Stop!
Please!
Stop!
Stop!
Just stop hurting him!
Please!
Please!
Jane?
Master?
Go ahead, my dear.
This may hurt just a little.
Remarkable!
She confounds us all.
So what do we do with you now?
You already know what you're going to do, Aro.
She knows too much.
She's a liability.
That's true.
Felix?
No!
Please!
No!
No!
please!
Kill me!
Kill me!
Not him.
How extraordinary.
You would give up your life for someone like us.
A vampire.
A soulless monster.
Just get away from her!
You don't know a thing about his soul.
This is a sadness.
If only it were your intention to give her immortality.
Wait!
Bella will be one of us.
I've seen it.
I'll change her myself.
Mesmerizing.
To see what you have seen before it has happened.
Your gifts will make for an intriguing immortal,
Isabella.
Go now.
Make your preparations.
Let us be done with this.
Heidi will arrive any moment.
Thank you for your visit.
We will return the favor.
I would advise that you follow through on your promise soon.
We do not offer second chances.
Goodbye, my young friends.
Nice fishing, Heidi.
Yes, they do look rather juicy.
Save some for me.
This way, please.
Stay together.
Stop!
Stop!
You're here.
You can sleep.
I'll still be here when you wake up.
Bella, the only reason I left was because I thought I was protecting you.
I needed you to have a chance at a normal, happy life.
It was so easy for you to leave.
Leaving you was the hardest thing I've done in 100 years.
And I swear,
I will never fail you again.
I'm so sorry.
-Charlie's coming.
-Hey.
You okay?
I'm fine.
Dad, you don't have to worry.
You know, last time you said that, you took off.
I didn't see you for 3 days.
I'm really sorry, Dad.
Bella, do not ever do that to me again.
Ever.
And you're grounded for the rest of your life.
Okay.
I'm not technically breaking any of his rules.
He did say I couldn't take a step inside the door.
I came in through the window.
He's not gonna forgive me easily.
I know.
Can you?
I hope you can, 'cause I honestly don't know how to live without you.
Come here.
Once Alice changes me, you can't get rid of me.
She won't need to change you.
There are always ways to keep the Volturi in the dark.
No.
No.
You all know what I want.
And I know how much I'm asking for.
The only thing that I can think of for it to be fair is to just vote.
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-Shut up.
Alice?
I already consider you my sister.
-Yes.
-Thank you.
I vote "yes."
It would be nice to not want to kill you all the time.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry to both of you for how I've acted, and I'm really grateful that you were brave enough to go and save my brother.
But this isn't a life I would have chosen for myself.
And I wish that there'd been someone to vote "no" for me.
So, no.
I vote "Hell, yeah."
And we can pick a fight with these Volturi some other way.
I already consider you a part of the family.
Yes.
Why are you doing this to me?
You know what this means.
You've chosen not to live without her, which leaves me no choice.
I won't lose my son.
I'll wait until after graduation to make it easier on Charlie.
Edward, I want you to be the one to do it.
He wants to talk to me.
So you're still alive for now.
He thinks it's me keeping you away.
You stay the hell out of my head.
Jacob, I know you have something to say to me.
But I want to say something to you first, if that's all right.
Thank you.
Thank you for keeping Bella alive when I didn't.
No.
You didn't.
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.
I'm still grateful.
But I'm here now.
I'm not gonna leave her side until she orders me away.
We'll see.
Hey, my turn to talk.
I'm here to remind you about a key point in the treaty.
I haven't forgotten.
What key point?
If any of them bites a human, the truce is over.
But if I choose it, it has nothing to do with you.
No.
No, I won't let you.
You're not gonna be one of them, Bella.
It's not up to you.
You know what we'll do to you.
I won't have a choice.
Bella, please, come.
Wait.
Is he gonna hurt me?
Read his mind.
Jake,
I love you.
So, please,
don't make me choose,
'cause it'll be him.
It's always been him.
Bella...
-Goodbye, Jacob.
-No, you don't speak for her!
Bella, get out of here.
Stop!
Stop!
You can't hurt each other without hurting me.
Jake.
He's right.
You shouldn't become what I am.
I can't do this alone.
Then, please, just wait.
Just give me 5 years.
That's too long.
Then 3?
You're so stubborn.
What are you waiting for?
I have one condition if you want me to do it myself.
What's the condition?
And then forever.
That's what I'm asking.
Marry me, Bella.
(A White Demon Love Song)
White demon love song down the hall
White demon shadow on the road
Back up your mind, there is a call
He isn't coming after all
Love this time
She likes the way he sings
White demon love song's in her dreams
White demon, where's your selfish kiss?
White demon sorrow will arrange
Let's not forget about the fear
Black invitation to this place that cannot change
While strangely holy
Come for a rain
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friend go?
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friend go?
Let us be in love
Let's do old and gray
I won't make you cry
I will never stray
I will do my part
Let us be in love tonight
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friend go?
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friend go?
Stand it anymore, darling
Stand it
(Meet Me On The Equinox)
Meet me on the equinox
Meet me halfway
When the sun is perched at its highest peak
In the middle of the day
Let me give my love to you
Let me take your hand
As we walk in the dimming light
Oh, darling, understand
That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything ends
Meet me on your best behavior
Meet me at your worst
For there will be no stone unturned
Or bubble left to burst
Let me lay beside you, darling
Let me be your man
And let our bodies intertwine
But always understand
That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything, everything ends
A window
An opened tomb
The sun crawls
Across your bedroom
A halo
A waiting room
Your last breaths
Moving through you
As everything, everything ends
As everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything ends
Meet me on the equinox
Meet me halfway
When the sun is perched at its highest peak
In the middle of the day
Let me give my love to you
Let me take your hand
And as we walk in the dimming light
Oh, darling, understand
That everything, everything ends

BELLA: "These violent delights have violent ends,
"and in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
"which, as they kiss, consume. "
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
(BELL TOLLS)
(PANTING)
Gran?
(GASPS SOFTLY)
Edward, don't!
She'll see you.
Hmm.
Okay.
(IN BELLA'S VOICE) Gran, I'd like you to meet...
(GASPS)
Happy birthday, Bella.
(GASPS)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Happy birthday.
(BELLA CLICKS TONGUE)
I thought we agreed, no presents.
Well, the one from me's not wrapped, so it doesn't count.
That's actually great.
Thanks, Dad.
It goes with this one from your mom.
We coordinated.
Well, she coordinated me.
It's to put your pictures in from senior year.
(SIGHS) Senior year.
How'd you get so old so fast?
I didn't.
It's not that old.
I don't know.
Is that a gray hair?
No.
No way.
(SIGHS)
Happy birthday.
That's really funny.
ANNOUNCER ON RADIO:
Another missing hiker brings the total to 3 presumed dead.
Rangers are searching for the killer animal... (SWITCHING RADIO STATION)
(MONSTERS PLAYING)
Situation's all critical
You've got to look first before you go
ERIC:
It's Bella.
Bella!
-Hi.
-MIKE:
I'm...
JESSICA:
Today's the big day, Bella.
R and J essay due.
-Oh, yeah.
-Wherefore art thou, Bella?
(ALL LAUGH)
Let me take a picture of you guys.
My mom wants me to put together, like, a scrapbook full of memories.
ERIC:
Oh.
MIKE:
Cool.
Yeah.
I take them.
I'm not in them.
No, no, no, come here.
BELLA:
Well, you are today.
You'll photoshop this if my nose looks big, right?
ERIC:
Don't worry, I'm in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.
BELLA:
That's good.
Oh, good.
Cullen's here.
(ERIC CHEERS WEAKLY)
Well, talk to you later.
-Happy birthday.
-Don't remind me.
EDWARD:
Mmm.
Bella, your birth is definitely something to celebrate.
-Yeah, but my aging's not.
-Your aging?
(CHUCKLES)
I think 18 is a little young to start worrying about that.
It's one year older than you.
No, it isn't.
I'm 109.
Well, maybe I shouldn't be dating such an old man.
It's gross.
I should be thoroughly repulsed.
Uh-huh.
(BOTH SIGHING)
-We have to go to class.
-Okay.
(EDWARD MOANS SOFTLY)
Wait a second.
Someone wants you.
-JACOB:
Bella!
-Jacob!
What?
I'll leave you to talk.
Hello, biceps!
You know, anabolic steroids are really bad for you.
(JACOB LAUGHS)
Well, I'm just filling out, Bella.
You know, it wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more.
You should switch schools.
You can come hang out with the palefaces.
I'm all right.
I prefer the rez school's exclusivity.
They let any old riffraff into this place.
-I see.
Then why are you slumming it?
-Mmm-hmm.
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.
You should really come take a ride when it's done.
Is it fast?
Um.
It's decent.
(BOTH LAUGH)
-I'm kidding.
-Okay.
Good.
Hey, happy birthday.
Your dad told my dad, so...
Yeah, of course he did.
I saw this the other day and thought of you.
Catches bad dreams.
That's kind of perfect.
Thank you.
No problem.
-Good seeing you.
-Yeah, I'll see you later.
Bye.
So how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?
Because I have nothing to give back to you.
Bella, you give me everything just by breathing.
(EXHALES)
See?
Thank you.
-That's all I want.
-ALICE:
Bella!
-Happy birthday!
-Shh, shh!
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
I thought I said no presents.
I've already seen you open it, and guess what, you love it.
You're gonna wear it tonight.
Our place.
Come on.
Please?
It'll be fun.
-Okay.
All right.
-Great!
Okay, I'll see you at 7:00.
Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing.
(ALICE LAUGHS)
Sorry, Bella.
Happy...
Never mind.
You can't trust vampires.
Trust me.
ROMEO: (ON VIDEO) O my love!
My wife!
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Thou art not conquered.
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks.
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
BELLA:
I hate being celebrated.
EDWARD:
There are worse tragedies.
I mean, look at Romeo.
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.
BELLA:
Yeah.
Though I do envy him one thing.
BELLA:
Juliet is, like, perfect.
If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.
(EDWARD LAUGHS)
Not the girl, the suicide.
It's nearly impossible for...
For some people.
For humans, a little poison, a dagger to the heart.
There's so many different options.
Why would you say that?
Because I had to consider it once.
(BELLA SCREAMING)
I didn't know if I'd get to you in time.
I had to come up with some kind of plan.
What was the plan?
That I'd go to Italy and provoke the Volturi.
-The what?
-The Volturi.
MR. BERTY:
Now, who'd like to repeat the last few lines of iambic pentameter just to show they were paying attention?
Mr. Cullen?
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Yes, Mr. Berty.
"O here will I set up my everlasting rest
"and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.
"Eyes, look your last.
"Arms, take your last embrace!
"And, lips, O you, the doors of breath,
"seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death!"
Eyes on the screen, people.
ROMEO:
Thus with a kiss I die.
The Volturi are a very old, very powerful family.
I guess they're the closest thing to royalty my world has.
-Is that Carlisle?
-Yeah.
He lived with them for a few decades.
Described them as very refined.
No respect for human life, of course, but a respect for the arts and the sciences, at least.
And the law.
Above all, the law.
BELLA:
Vampires have laws?
EDWARD:
Not very many.
And only one that's regularly enforced.
BELLA:
What is it?
EDWARD:
That we keep the existence of our kind a secret.
We don't make spectacles of ourselves, and we don't kill conspicuously.
Unless, of course, you want to die.
(SCREAMS)
You gotta stop talking about that.
I can't even think about someone hurting you.
Bella, the only thing that can hurt me is you.
And I don't have anything else to be afraid of.
That's not true.
Victoria?
She'll come for me one day.
Alice will see when she decides, and we'll be ready.
I could protect you if you change me.
Bella, you already do protect me.
You're my only reason to stay alive, if that's what I am.
But it's my job to protect you.
(BELLA SIGHS)
From everyone except my sister.
It's time!
It's time.
It's time.
It's time!
(THE VIOLET HOUR PLAYING)
Your lips are nettles
Your tongue is wine
You're left as liquid But your body's pine
DR. CULLEN:
Sorry about all this.
We tried to rein Alice in.
As if that were even possible.
-Happy birthday, Bella.
-Thanks.
I found it in your bag.
You mind?
Dating an older woman.
Hot.
(SIGHS EXASPERATEDLY)
-What?
-You first, Rosalie.
It's a necklace.
Alice picked it out.
Thanks.
Show me the love.
This one's from Emmett.
Already installed it in your truck.
Finally a decent sound system
-for that piece of...
-Hey!
Don't hate the truck.
(ALICE LAUGHS)
Open Esme and Carlisle's.
DR. CULLEN:
Just a little something to brighten your day.
Yes, you've been looking kind of pale lately.
Ow.
Paper cut.
(GLASS SHATTERING)
(JASPER GROWLS)
Jaz, Jaz.
It's okay.
It's just a little blood.
(GASPS SOFTLY)
(JASPER SNARLS)
DR. CULLEN:
Get Jasper out of here.
(BELLA GASPS)
I'm sorry, I can't.
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.
Check on Jasper.
I'm sure he's very upset with himself, and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.
Edward.
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY)
BELLA:
I never wanted to have a party.
DR. CULLEN:
It's not your fault.
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.
How do you do it?
Years and years of practice.
Did you ever think of just doing it the easy way?
No.
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.
It brings me happiness, even if I am damned regardless.
Damned?
Like hell?
Carlisle, you couldn't be damned.
You couldn't.
It's impossible.
Thank you, Bella.
You've always been very gracious about us.
So that's it?
That's why he won't change me?
Imagine the situation in reverse.
Hmm.
If you believed as Edward does, could you take away his soul?
You can't protect me from everything.
At some point, something's gonna separate us.
It's gonna be an accident or illness or old age,
as long as I'm human.
And the only solution is to change me.
That's not a solution.
That's a tragedy.
You're not gonna want me when I look like a grandmother.
Bella, do you not understand my feelings for you at all?
Carlisle told me
how you feel about your soul.
I don't believe that.
So don't worry about mine.
You should go inside.
It's still my birthday.
So can I ask one thing?
Kiss me?
(BELLA GASPS)
(BOTH GASPING)
I love you.
I love you.
(ROSLYN PLAYING)
Up with your turret
Aren't we just terrified?
Shale, screen your worry
From what you won't ever find
Don't let it fool you
Don't let it fool you
Down
Hey.
Just come take a walk with me.
We have to leave Forks.
Why?
Carlisle's supposed to be 10 years older than he looks, and people are starting to notice.
Okay, I've gotta think of something to say to Charlie.
When you say "we"...
I mean my family and myself.
Edward, what happened with Jasper, it's nothing.
You're right.
It was nothing, nothing but what I always expected and nothing compared to what could have happened.
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.
I belong with you.
No.
You don't.
I'm coming.
Bella,
I don't want you to come.
(SIGHS)
You don't want me?
No.
That changes things a lot.
But if it's not too much to ask, can you just promise me something?
Don't do anything reckless.
For Charlie's sake.
And I'll promise something to you in return.
This is the last time you'll ever see me.
I won't come back, and you can go on with your life without any interference from me.
It will be like I never existed, I promise.
If this is about my soul, take it.
I don't want it without you.
It's not about your soul.
You're just not good for me.
Not good enough for you.
I'm just sorry I let this go on for so long.
(SOBS)
Please...
Don't...
Goodbye.
(BELLA SOBBING)
Edward.
Edward.
Edward.
Edward!
Edward.
(BELLA CRYING)
(SOFT GROWLING)
(GRASS RUSTLING)
(CHATTERING OVER POLICE RADIO)
I'm gonna try the Cullens' place again.
-BILLY:
The Cullens left town, Charlie.
-Good riddance.
Where'd they go?
We'll find her, Charlie.
-Thanks, Harry.
-Charlie!
BILLY:
Hey.
She's all right.
I got her.
Thank you, Sam.
(POSSIBILITY PLAYING)
There's a possibility
There's a possibility
All that I had
Was all I'm gonna get
BELLA:
Alice, you've disappeared, like everything else.
Now who else can I talk to?
I'm lost.
When you left, and he left,
you took everything with you.
But the absence of him is everywhere I look.
It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest.
(BELLA SCREAMING)
Bella.

All right.
That's it.
What?
You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother.
I'm not leaving Forks.
Bells, he's not coming back.
I know.
It's just not normal, this behavior.
Quite frankly, it's scaring the hell out of me and your mother.
Baby, I don't want you to leave.
I don't, but just go.
Go to Jacksonville.
Make some new friends.
I like my old friends.
-Well, you never see them anymore.
-I do.
I'm... gonna go shopping tomorrow with Jessica.
-You hate shopping.
-I...
I need a girls' night out.
All right.
Girls' night.
Shopping.
I like it.
Go buy some stuff.
(I BELONG TO YOU PLAYING)
BELLA: (ON PHONE) Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.
Yeah, Bella Swan.
JESSICA:
I don't know why you want to sit through all those zombies eating people and no hot guys kissing anybody.
It's gross.
Like... ..And why are there that many zombie movies anyway?
'Cause if it's supposed to, like, draw a parallel about leprosy, my cousin had leprosy.
It's not funny, you know?
And, like, is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism?
Because don't be so pleased with your own, like, self-referential cleverness, you know?
Like, some girls like to shop.
Not all girls, apparently.
Although I was surprised you even called at all.
You know?
Like, your depression thing, I get it.
I'm totally, totally worried.
But after a while it's like,
-you're still bumming...
-CHET:
You want a ride, girls?
and I'm going through stuff, too.
You know?
Like Mike deciding he just wants to be friends.
CHET:
What's up?
Look what we found.
JESSICA:
It's hard, you know?
Like, and since when does "just friends"...
BIKER 1:
What's up guys?
BIKER 2:
Look what we found.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, where you going?
(TIRES SCREECHING)
Keep walking.
(GASPING)
This is dangerous.
Dude, come on.
CHET:
Come here for a sec!
I think I know those guys.
CHET:
We got beer!
We got bikes!
Well, they seem great.
Can we go?
I'm just gonna see something.
CHET:
Hey, girlie!
All right, all right.
We got a taker.
Turn around.
(GASPS)
(FRIENDS PLAYING)
BIKER 2:
Shut up!
BIKER 3:
You shut up!
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
No, that's cool.
I'll be whoever you want me to be, honey.
So, what do you say?
You promised me, nothing reckless.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
You promised it would be as if you never existed.
(CHET CLEARS THROAT)
-You lied.
-You say something, babe?
You know what?
Never mind.
(ENGINE ROARING)
Stop!
Stop, stop, stop!
(BRAKES SCREECHING)
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?
Just curious.
-I thought that I saw something.
-You...
Oh.
You're insane, actually.
Or suicidal.
That homeboy could've been a psycho.
I was about to end up in an FBI interview room like some lame TV show.
God, that was such a rush.
Awesome.
So you're an adrenaline junkie now?
That's cool.
You can go bungee jumping.
You don't get on the back of some random loser's motorcycle.
Crazy.
BELLA:
Alice, I saw him.
Maybe I'm crazy now.
I guess that's okay.
If a rush of danger is what it takes to see him, then that's what I'll find.
Bella!
Where the hell have you been, loca?
(BELLA LAUGHING)
(SIGHS) I brought you something.
-Okay.
-It's a little crazy.
Wow.
Scrap metal.
You shouldn't have.
I saved it from the junkyard.
(BELLA CLEARS THROAT)
I think they'll probably cost more to fix than they're worth, but then I thought that if I had a mechanic friend
-to help me out then...
-Ah!
-Me being the mechanic-type friend?
-That's right.
-Since when are you into motorcycles?
-Since now.
I get it if you think that this is really stupid and reckless.
Yeah, I mean, it's completely stupid and reckless.
When do we start?
Um.
Now.
-Please?
-(CHUCKLES) All right.
Oh, hey, be careful.
Those things are actually really heavy, so...
Jake, you're, like, buff.
How did that happen?
You're, like, 16.
I don't get it.
Mmm-hmm.
Age is just a number, baby.
What are you, like, 40 now?
It feels like that sometimes.
(ROMANTIC SONG PLAYING ON STEREO)
(TURNS OFF STEREO)
That song's good.
You don't like it?
I don't really like music anymore, kind of.
Okay.
No more music.
So I was thinking, if we're gonna do this every day, and hopefully we will, we have to, like, fit some homework in there somewhere.
I don't want Billy thinking that I'm a bad influence on you.
You?
Influence me?
Please.
Are you...
I'm older than you, so that makes me the influencer and you the influencee.
(LAUGHS) No, no, no.
My size and knowledge base actually makes me older than you because of your general paleness and lack of know-how.
I convinced you to build 2-wheeled death machines with me.
Don't you think that makes you kind of young and naive?
Okay.
So where do we stand?
-I'm 35.
And you might be, like, 32.
-Come on.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
QUIL:
Yo, Jake, you in there?
It's okay.
It's just my boys.
-Hey, Jake.
-Hey.
Guys, this is Bella.
-Bella, that's Quil and Embry.
-Hi.
I'm Quil Ateara.
So the bike building story is true.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I taught him everything he knows.
What about the part where you're his girlfriend?
Uh...
We're friends, you know.
-(LAUGHS) Burn.
-Actually, remember I said she's a girl and a friend.
Embry, do you remember him making that distinction?
Nope.
So you guys have girlfriends?
That's awesome.
(JACOB LAUGHING)
Yeah, right.
Quil's actually taking his cousin to prom.
Yeah, that's still a riot.
You want funny, Black?
I'll give you funny.
(JACOB AND QUIL LAUGHING)
Jeez.
JACOB:
Hey, that hold's illegal!
EMBRY:
I got 5 bucks on Quil.
You're on.
(SHOOTING THE MOON PLAYING)
All of the astronauts Champagne in plastic cups
Waiting for the big hero to show
Outside the door he stands His head in his hands
And his heart in his throat
What can he tell them now
BELLA:
Dear Alice,
I wish I had your real address.
I wish I could tell you about Jake.
He makes me feel better.
I mean, he makes me feel alive.
The hole in my chest, well, when I'm with Jake, it's like it's almost healed
for a while.
So, Quil keeps asking to come over.
I think he likes you a little too much.
Oh.
Well, I'm really not into the whole cougar thing.
You know?
(CHUCKLES)
What's up with you and age?
I mean, how old was that Cullen guy, anyway?
BELLA:
But even Jake can't keep the dreams away.
(BELLA WHIMPERING)
(SCREAMING)
Hey, hey, hey!
Wake up, Bella.
(SHUSHING) You're okay.
You're okay.
I thought this thing was starting to work, but I guess not.
(CHARLIE SIGHS)
Can I ask you something?
Hanging out with Jacob, that seems to take your mind off things a bit, doesn't it?
You know, sometimes you gotta learn to love what's good for you.
You know what I mean?
Of course, what do I know?
I'm just a terminal bachelor.
Famous ladies' man.
Okay.
I'm gonna go to bed.
Uh...
I love you.
If I told you
I couldn't have fixed these bikes, what would you have said?
Are you doubting your mad skills?
No.
Definitely not.
I mean, they'll run fine.
It's just, maybe if I was smart, I would have dragged out the rebuild a bit.
If you told me you couldn't fix these bikes, I would say that that's really too bad, but... that we're just gonna have to find something else to do.
(LAUGHS)
Is that Sam Uley?
Yeah.
Him and his cult.
(SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
(WHOOPS)
Oh, my God.
Did you see that?
(JACOB LAUGHING)
They're not really fighting, Bella.
They're cliff diving.
Scary as hell, but a total rush.
-A rush?
-Most of us jump from lower down.
We leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples.
You have some kind of beef with him or something?
I don't know.
They just think they run this place.
Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids.
-Now look at him.
-That's Embry?
(CONTINUE WHOOPING)
-Yeah.
-What happened to him?
He missed some school.
Now all of a sudden, he started following Sam around like a little puppy.
Same thing happened with Paul and Jared.
Sam keeps giving me this look, like he's waiting for me or something.
It's kind of starting to freak me out.
Well, you should just avoid him.
I try.
Okay.
-You look scared.
-I'm not.
All right.
-Brake?
-That one.
Clutch?
Good.
Gas?
(ENGINE ROARS)
Ready?
Now, slowly release the clutch.
EDWARD:
Bella.
Stop.
(BELLA GASPS)
Whoa!
You all right?
I'm gonna go again.
Okay.
(GASPS)
Ah!
Whoa!
Hit the brake!
(GRUNTS)
I wanna go again.
Are you trying to get yourself killed?
No.
I want to go again.
No.
Forget it.
No more bikes.
Man, your head.
Ow.
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
What, you're apologizing for bleeding?
Yeah.
I guess I am.
Well, it's just blood, Bella.
No big deal.
There.
What are you staring at?
You're sort of beautiful.
How hard did you hit your head?
I don't know.
(JACOB CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Let's go.
ANGELA:
I did see something in the woods.
Totally.
Baby, I believe you.
No, he doesn't.
He's just trying to get lucky.
(ERIC LAUGHS)
ANGELA:
No, okay.
It was jet black and huge.
On all 4s, it was still taller than a person.
A bear, maybe?
Or an alien.
You're lucky you didn't get probed.
(ERIC AND MIKE SNICKERING)
ANGELA:
Well, I saw it.
You know, you're not the only one.
My dad's been getting reports at the station.
Like, 5 hikers have been killed by some bear.
But they can't find the bear.
Hmm.
(LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.
MIKE:
Um... (MIKE CLEARS THROAT)
So?
I mean,
Bella's back?
(LAUGHS)
Yeah, I guess so.
All right, that's...
Well, welcome.
So, listen, now that you're talking and eating again, which, you know, you've got to get that protein in there,
I was just wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me.
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah, I do.
Cool.
Let me see, we could check out
Love Spelled Backwards Is Love.
You know, it's a dumb title, but it's a romantic comedy.
-I mean, it's supposed to be pretty...
-No.
No romance.
How about Face Punch?
Have you heard of that?
I mean, that's an action movie.
Yeah, that's perfect.
Guns, adrenaline.
That's my thing.
Okay.
We should get a bunch of people to go.
Do you guys want to go see Face Punch?
ERIC:
Face Punch, yeah!
Mike, hey, we were supposed to watch that.
Remember, the trailer's like...
-"Punch faces."
-I remember.
(SARCASTICALLY) Yeah!
Movie night with Bella.
JACOB:
So Face Punch, huh?
You like action movies?
Not really.
(JACOB SCOFFING)
I heard it sucks.
Bad.
Are you even old enough to see this movie?
I mean, you know, without, like, adult supervision.
Right, yeah, well, she's buying my ticket for me.
She's buying it.
Okay.
Jessica bailed, and Angela got the stomach flu, so Eric's taking care of her.
-It's just us 3.
-Great!
-Great.
-Yeah.
(GUN COCKING ON SCREEN)
MAN 1 ON SCREEN:
Put your gun down.
MAN 2 ON SCREEN:
Put your gun down or I'm gonna blow your frickin' head off.
MAN 3 ON SCREEN:
Both of you put both of your guns down or I'm gonna blow both of your frickin' heads off.
MAN 1 ON SCREEN:
All right, forget it, let's do this!
(GUNS FIRING)
(MAN SCREAMS)
(GUNS FIRING)
(WOMAN SCREAMS)
Okay, I think I'm gonna throw up.
(SCREAMING CONTINUES)
He's... (SCOFFS) What a marshmallow!
You should hold out for someone with a stronger stomach.
Someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit.
Yeah.
I'll keep my eye open for that.
(JACOB CHUCKLES)
I feel bad.
He probably has that flu that's going around.
What?
I can't hold your hand?
No, of course you can.
I just think it means, you know, something a little different to you.
So...
Okay, well, tell me something.
You like me, right?
And you think I'm sort of beautiful?
(SOFTLY) Jacob, please, don't do this.
(BELLA SIGHS)
Why?
Because you're about to ruin everything.
And I need you.
(SIGHS)
Well, I've got loads of time.
I'm not gonna give up.
I don't want you to, but it's just 'cause I don't want you to go anywhere.
And that's really selfish.
You know, I'm not like a car that you can fix up.
I'm never gonna run right.
So I should be fair to you.
It's because of him, right?
(JACOB SIGHS DEEPLY)
Look,
I know what he did to you.
But, Bella, I would never ever do that.
I won't ever hurt you.
I promise.
I won't let you down.
You can count on me.
MIKE:
Well,
(SNIFFLES)
(SIGHS)
I need to go home.
I was feeling sick before the movie.
Okay?
(JACOB SCOFFS)
What is your problem?
Right now?
You're my problem.
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.
You want me to put you in the hospital?
Jake!
Jake.
Jake, the movie's over.
What are you doing?
You're really hot.
Like, you feel like you have a fever.
Are you okay?
I don't know what's happening.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I gotta go.
That dude is weird.
BELLA: (ON PHONE) Jake, your dad says you have mono.
He won't let me visit, but would you call me?
Hey, it's me again.
I just...
I'm sorry about what I said at the movie theater.
I just wanted to hear your voice, so no pressure.
Jacob, please...
Call me.
Okay.
We should be back around 3:00.
(SIGHS)
Hey.
Look, I don't have to go fishing today.
Yes, you do.
Yeah, you do.
Go.
What are you talking about?
Just be careful.
Always am.
Those bears won't get the drop on me, Bella.
My kung fu is strong.
Jake!
Hey!
You cut your hair off?
And got a tattoo?
Bella.
I thought you were too sick to come outside or pick up the phone when I call.
Go away.
What?
Go away.
What happened to you?
What's...
Hey!
What happened?
Did Sam get to you?
Is that what's happening?
Sam's trying to help me.
Don't blame him.
But if you want somebody to blame, how about those filthy bloodsuckers you love, the Cullens?
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
You've been lying to everyone.
Charlie.
But you can't lie to me.
-Not anymore, Bella.
-SAM:
Jacob!
Jacob!
Look, Bella, we can't be friends anymore.
(CRYING) Look, Jake, I know that I've been hurting you.
It's killing me.
It kills me.
I just need...
Maybe give me, like,
-some time or something.
-Look, don't.
It's not you.
It's not you, it's me, right?
Really?
It's true.
It is me.
I'm not good.
I used to be a good kid.
Not anymore.
This doesn't even matter.
All right?
This is over.
You can't break up with me.
I mean...
I mean, you're my best friend.
You promised me.
I know.
I promised I wouldn't hurt you, Bella.
And this is me keeping that promise.
Go home and don't come back or you're gonna get hurt.
BELLA:
Alice, things are...
Things are bad again.
Without Jake, I just...
..I can't stand it.
I don't see Edward anymore.
Will it really feel like he never existed?
I will find the place where I can see him again.

Bella.
Laurent.
I didn't expect to find you here.
I went to visit the Cullens, but the house is empty.
I'm surprised they left you behind.
Weren't you sort of a pet of theirs?
Yeah.
You could say that.
Do the Cullens visit often?
Lie.
(GASPS)
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.
Lie better.
I'll tell them that you stopped by.
But I probably shouldn't tell Edward,
'cause he's pretty protective.
But he's far away, isn't he?
Why are you here?
I came as a favor to Victoria.
-Victoria?
-She asked me to see if you were still under the protection of the Cullens.
Victoria feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate, given he killed hers.
An eye for an eye.
Threaten him.
Edward would know who did it.
And he'd come after you.
I don't think he will.
After all, how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected?
(LAURENT SIGHS)
Victoria won't be happy about my killing you, but I can't help myself.
You are so mouth-watering.
Please, don't.
I mean, you helped us.
No, no, no, no.
(SHUSHING)
Don't be afraid.
I'm doing you a kindness.
(SOFTLY) Victoria plans on killing you slowly, painfully, whereas I'll make it quick.
I promise.
You will feel nothing.
Edward, I love you.
(TWIGS SNAPPING)
I don't believe it.
(LOW GROWLING)
(ROARS)
(GASPS)
(WEREWOLVES RUNNING)
(YELPING)
(GASPS)
-Dad!
I saw them.
-What's the matter?
In the woods.
They're not bears.
What do you mean "in the woods"?
Bell, what the hell were you doing out in the woods?
They're wolves.
I mean, they're like huge wolves.
Are you sure about that, Bella?
Yeah!
I just saw them.
They were after something.
(HARRY CLEARS THROAT)
Wolves?
You saw them?
All right, well, Harry, feel like going hunting?
Get some of your guys together?
Sure, yeah, I'll just...
BELLA:
By now, those wolves will be dead, and Laurent would have told her I'm unprotected.
Victoria.
I should go to the station.
Yeah, you should.
You should go.
CHARLIE:
Can you just stay in the house?
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
(CLATTERING)
(CLATTERING CONTINUES)
JACOB: (WHISPERS) Bella!
You scared me.
What the hell are you doing?
Back up.
I'm coming up.
(GASPS)
Hey.
Look, I'm sorry.
-For what?
-I wish I could explain.
But I literally can't.
(SIGHS)
Have you ever had a secret you couldn't tell anyone, one that wasn't yours to share?
Well, that's what it's like for me.
But worse.
You have no idea how tight I'm bound.
I hate this.
I hate what they've done to you.
I mean, the killer part is, you already know.
Bella, do you remember when we walked on the beach at La Push?
The...
The story.
The story about the cold ones.
I guess I understand why that's the only part you remember.
There's gotta be something that you can do.
No.
I'm in it for life.
Well, maybe we should just get out of here for a while.
Just leave, just you and me.
You'd do that?
I would do it for you.
It's not something I can just run away from, Bella.
But I would run away with you
if I could.
I gotta go.
They'll start wondering where I am.
Come here.
(SOFTLY) Please, try to remember.
It'd be so much easier if you knew.
I'll try.
But, Jake...
Jake, what are you doing?
Wait, Jake.
(GASPS)
Jake.
(GASPS)
Edward, I'm scared.
You should be.
JACOB:
Really, it's just like an old story.
I'm not really supposed to say anything about it.
Did you know Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?
(WEREWOLF SNARLS)
Bella?
I need to see him.
He's not in.
-Okay, I'm sorry, I really need to see him.
-Bella!
What did you do?
-Okay, what did you do?
-Hey.
-What did you do to him?
-Easy!
He didn't want this.
What did we do?
What did he do?
What'd he tell you?
-Both of you calm down.
-Nothing.
He tells me nothing because he's scared of you.
(SNICKERING)
Too late now.
SAM:
Bella, get back!
(PAUL GROWLING SOFTLY)
SAM:
Paul, calm down, now!
Bella!
Run!
Jake, run!
(GROWLING)
(WHIMPERS)
(BOTH SNARLING)
SAM:
Paul!
Hey!
Take Bella back to Emily's place.
EMBRY:
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.
BELLA:
Alice, is it possible that everything is true?
The fairy tales and horror stories?
Is it possible that there isn't anything sane or normal at all?
(BOTH WHOOP)
Hey, I think we should go back and see if Jacob's okay.
I hope Paul sinks some teeth in him.
Serves him right.
No way.
Jacob's a natural.
You see him phase on the fly?
I got 5 says Paul doesn't touch him.
Come on in, Bella.
We won't bite.
Speak for yourself.
(DONE ALL WRONG PLAYING)
I done me wrong
And done all wrong
All the wrong I've done I'm sure I'll live quite long
Oh, hey, about Emily, Sam's fiancée?
Don't stare.
It bugs Sam.
Why would I stare?
Are you guys hungry?
Like I have to ask.
(EMILY LAUGHING)
Who's this?
JARED:
Bella Swan.
Who else?
Hmm.
So, you're the vampire girl.
So, you're the wolf girl.
Guess so.
Well, I'm engaged to one.
Save some for your brothers.
And ladies first.
Muffin?
Sure.
Thanks.
Leave it to Jacob to find a way around Sam's gag order.
He didn't say anything to me.
That's a wolf thing.
Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want them to or not.
And check it out.
We can hear each other's thoughts.
Would you shut up?
These are trade secrets.
Damn it!
This chick runs with vampires.
You can't really run with vampires.
(EMILY GIGGLES)
'Cause they're fast.
Yeah?
Well, we're faster.
Freaked out yet?
You're not the first monsters I've met.
SAM:
Jake's right.
You're good with weird.
Hey.
(EMILY GIGGLING)
Sorry.
So you're a werewolf?
Yeah.
Last time I checked.
A few lucky members of the tribe have the gene.
A bloodsucker moves into town and the fever sets in.
Mono.
Yeah.
I wish.
Well, can't you find a way to just stop?
I mean, it's wrong.
It's not a lifestyle choice, Bella.
I was born this way.
I can't help it.
You're such a hypocrite.
What, I'm not the right kind of monster for you?
It's not what you are.
It's what you do.
They never hurt anybody.
You've killed people, Jake.
Bella, we're not killing anyone.
Then who is?
What we're trying to protect you people from, the only thing we do kill,
vampires.
Wait, Jake, you can't.
Don't worry.
We can't touch your little precious Cullens unless they violate the treaty.
That's not what I'm saying.
You can't kill vampires.
They'll...
They'll kill you.
Really?
We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough.
(WEREWOLVES GROWLING)
Laurent?
And his red-headed girlfriend is next.
Victoria's here?
Was.
We chased her all the way to the Canadian border the other night.
She keeps coming back.
We don't know what she's after.
I do.
Me.
Don't worry.
We've got this place covered.
She won't get near you or Charlie.
Look, you've got to be careful.
She's fast.
You don't know how fast she is.
You know, your lack of confidence in us is a little insulting.
All right, I'd better go.
You gotta go?
Yeah.
Got a vampire to kill.
BELLA:
Alice, I'm all right.
Until I'm alone.
And lately, that's all the time.
Jacob's gone.
He's hunting Victoria.
And Charlie's hunting Jacob.
And you're gone.
And so is Edward.
And there's just nothing now.
You got something, Harry?
Nope.
Nothing.
But I realize where I have to go, what I have to do to see him again.
(HEARING DAMAGE PLAYING)
A tear in my brain
Allows the voices in
They wanna push you off the path
With their frequency wires
And you can do no wrong
In my eyes
In my eyes
You can do no wrong
In my eyes
In my eyes
A drunken salesman
Your hearing damage
Your mind is restless
They say you're getting better
But you don't feel any better
Your speakers are blowing
Your ears are wrecking
Your hearing damage
You wish you felt better
You wish you felt better
You can do no wrong
In my eyes
In my eyes
In my eyes
(GROWLING)
EDWARD:
Don't do this.
You wanted me to be human.
Watch me.
EDWARD:
Please.
For me.
You won't stay with me any other way.
Bella, please.
(GASPING)
(SLOW LIFE PLAYING)
This constant noise all the time
Even though you're the only one I see
JACOB:
Breathe!
Breathe!
Come on, Bella, breathe!
(BELLA SPLUTTERING)
Bella?
Bella, can you hear me?
Jake?
Come here.
What the hell were you thinking?
I just wanted to see something.
Get her home!
I'm gonna go help out over at Harry's place.
What happened at Harry's?
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.
Charlie and my dad are over at his place with his family.
Is he okay?
He's gone.
Come on.
I'll get you something dry and drive you home.
(BELLA SHIVERING) 108 degrees over here.
God!
My hands are freezing.
It must be nice, never getting cold.
It's a wolf thing.
It's not.
It's a Jacob thing.
You're just warm.
You're like your own sun.
This is better, now that you know about me.
But...
You saw what happened to Emily.
Sam got angry.
Lost it for a split second.
Em was standing too close.
He'll never be able to take that back.
What if I got mad at you?
(JACOB SIGHS)
Sometimes,
I feel like I'm gonna disappear.
Okay, not that you need me to tell you something like this,
but I always will.
You're not gonna lose yourself.
I wouldn't let that happen.
How?
I'll tell you all the time
how special you are.
(BELLA INHALES SHARPLY)
Thank you.
For everything.
Wait.
There's a vampire.
How do you know?
I can smell it.
I'm getting you out of here.
That's Carlisle's car.
They're here.
Bella, it's a trick!
Stop!
You gotta come with me!
(BELLA GRUNTS)
They won't hurt me.
If a Cullen is back here, this is their territory.
Treaty says we can only defend on our own lands.
I can't protect you here.
Okay.
That's okay.
You don't have to.
You're about to cross a line.
Then don't draw one.
Please?
(BELLA GASPS)
Alice?
-Oh, my God!
What are you...
-Bella!
I'm sorry, I just, I can't believe you're here.
Is...
Would you like to explain to me how you're alive?
What?
I saw a vision of you.
You jumped off a cliff.
Why in the hell would you try and kill yourself?
I mean, what about Charlie?
-What about...
-I didn't try to kill myself.
I was cliff jumping.
Recreationally.
It was fun.
(EXHALES)
I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy.
Does...
Did you tell him?
No.
He only calls in once every few months.
He said he wants to be alone.
Bella, what is that God-awful wet dog smell?
Um...
That's probably me.
Or it's Jacob.
Jacob who?
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.
Bella!
Werewolves are not good company to keep.
Speak for yourself.
I had to see you were safe.
I thought you couldn't protect me here.
Guess I don't care.
Well, I'm not gonna hurt her.
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.
I'm talking about the other bloodsucker who tried to kill Bella because of you.
Victoria?
Yeah, Victoria's been around.
I didn't see her.
I didn't see you get pulled out of the water, either.
I can't see past you and your pack of mutts.
Don't get me upset...
Hey, stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
...or things are gonna get very ugly.
I'll give you a minute.
Hey.
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna come back,
-right?
-As soon as you put the dog out.

I keep breaking my promise.
We don't have to do this to each other.
Yes, we do.

(SPEAKS QUILEUTE)
(PHONE RINGING)
Swan residence.
(SIGHS)
He's not here right now.
He's arranging a funeral.
(CELL PHONE CRACKING)
Who was that?
What?
Always in the way.
Who was that?
Bella, step back.
Jake, who was that?
Bella!
Bella, it's Edward.
He thinks you're dead.
Rosalie told him why I came here.
Why would you...
Why didn't you let me speak to him?
-He didn't ask for you.
-Bella.
I don't care!
Bella.
Bella!
He's going to the Volturi.
He wants to die, too.
JACOB:
He left you, Bella.
He didn't want you anymore.
Remember?
No, I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt.
What about your dad?
I'm 18.
I'm legally free to go, and I left a note.
Please, Bella, just stay here.
For Charlie.
Or for me.
I have to go.
I'm begging you.
Please.
Goodbye, Jacob.
Okay.
(AIRPLANE WHOOSHING)
(CAR ACCELERATING)
So you've made up your minds.
I'm afraid your particular gifts are too valuable to destroy.
But if you're unhappy with your lot, join us.
We would be delighted to utilize your skills.
Won't you consider staying with us?
You know it will happen anyway.
Not without cause.
Such a waste.
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?
I figured you wouldn't be opposed to grand theft auto.
Not today.
What?
What do you see?
They refused him.
-So?
-He's gonna make a scene.
-Show himself to the humans.
-No!
When?
ALICE:
He's gonna wait until noon, when the sun's at its highest.
(GRUNTS)
God, Alice, you got to hurry up.
There's Volterra.
(HORN HONKING)
(TIRES SQUEALING)
(HONKING CONTINUES)
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
Why are they all in red?
San Marco's Day festival.
They're commemorating the expulsion of vampires from the city.
It's the perfect setting.
The Volturi will never let him get far enough to reveal himself.
(PANTING) We have 5 minutes.
I know, Bella, just breathe.
(HORN HONKING)
Alice!
Bella, you're the only one he can't see coming.
If I go, he'll read my thoughts.
He'll think I'm lying.
He'll rush into it.
Where do I go?
He'll be under the clock tower.
Go!
(CROWD CHANTING)
(BELL TOLLS)
Don't!
(BELLA PANTING)
Heaven.
You have to move.
Open your eyes.
Look at me.
I'm alive.
You have to move.
Bella.
-You're here.
-I'm here.
You're alive.
Yes.
I needed to make you see me once.
You had to know that I was alive, that you didn't have to feel guilty about anything.
I can let you go now.
I never acted out of guilt.
I just couldn't live in a world where you don't exist.
-But you said...
-I lied.
I had to lie.
But you believed me so easily.
Because it doesn't make sense for you to love me.
I mean, I'm nothing.
I'm human.
I'm nothing.
Bella, you're everything to me.
You're everything.
(GATE OPENS)
I won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen.
Aro wants to speak with you again.
No rules were broken.
Nonetheless, we should take this conversation to a more appropriate venue.
Fine.
Bella, why don't you go and enjoy the rest of the festival?
The girl comes with us.
No.
You can go to hell.
(LOCK BREAKS)
Come on, guys.
It's a festival.
You wouldn't want to make a scene.
We wouldn't.
Enough.
Jane.
Aro sent me to see what was taking so long.
Just do as she says.
Go ahead.
Don't be scared.
Are you?
No.
(JANE SCOFFS)
(OPERA PLAYING)
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
-Is she human?
-Yes.
Does she know?
Yes.
Then, why would...
She wants to be.
And so she will be.
Or dessert.
ALEC:
Sister.
They send you out to get 1 and you bring back 2.
And a half.
Such a clever girl.
What a happy surprise!
Bella is alive after all.
Isn't that wonderful?
I love a happy ending.
ARO:
Ah.
(GASPS)
They are so rare.
(GASPS)
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
Her blood appeals to you so much it makes me thirsty.
How can you stand to be so close to her?
It's not without difficulty.
Yes, I can see that.
(ARO CHUCKLING)
Aro can read every thought I've ever had with one touch.
And now you know everything.
So get on with it.
You are quite a soul reader yourself, Edward.
Though you can't read Bella's thoughts.
Fascinating.
I would love to see if you are an exception to my gifts, as well.
Would you do me the honor?
Interesting.
Hmm.
I see nothing.
I wonder if...
Let us see if she's immune to all our powers.
Shall we, Jane?
-No!
-Pain.
(GROANS)
BELLA:
Stop!
Stop!
Please!
Stop!
(GRUNTS) Stop!
Just stop hurting him!
Please!
Please!
Jane?
Master?
(GASPS)
Go ahead, my dear.
This may hurt just a little.
(LAUGHING EXCITEDLY)
Remarkable!
She confounds us all.
So what do we do with you now?
You already know what you're going to do, Aro.
She knows too much.
She's a liability.
Hmm.
That's true.
Felix?
EDWARD:
No!
(GASPS)
Please!
No!
No!
Please, please!
Kill me!
Kill me!
Not him.
How extraordinary.
You would give up your life for someone like us.
A vampire.
A soulless monster.
Just get away from her!
You don't know a thing about his soul.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
This is a sadness.
If only it were your intention to give her immortality.
Wait!
Bella will be one of us.
I've seen it.
I'll change her myself.
Mesmerizing.
To see what you have seen before it has happened.
Your gifts will make for an intriguing immortal,
Isabella.
Go now.
Make your preparations.
Let us be done with this.
Heidi will arrive any moment.
Thank you for your visit.
CAIUS:
We will return the favor.
I would advise that you follow through on your promise soon.
We do not offer second chances.
ARO:
Goodbye, my young friends.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
DEMETRI:
Nice fishing, Heidi.
Yes, they do look rather juicy.
Save some for me.
HEIDI:
This way, please.
Stay together.
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
(GASPING)
(SCREAMS ECHOING)
Stop!
Stop!
You're here.
You can sleep.
I'll still be here when you wake up.
Bella, the only reason I left was because I thought I was protecting you.
I needed you to have a chance at a normal, happy life.
It was so easy for you to leave.
Leaving you was the hardest thing I've done in 100 years.
(SIGHING)
And I swear,
I will never fail you again.
I'm so sorry.
-Charlie's coming.
-Hey.
You okay?
I'm fine.
Dad, you don't have to worry.
You know, last time you said that, you took off.
I didn't see you for 3 days.
I'm really sorry, Dad.
Bella, do not ever do that to me again.
Ever.
And you're grounded for the rest of your life.
Okay.
I'm not technically breaking any of his rules.
He did say I couldn't take a step inside the door.
I came in through the window.
He's not gonna forgive me easily.
I know.
Can you?
I hope you can, 'cause I honestly don't know how to live without you.
Come here.
Once Alice changes me, you can't get rid of me.
She won't need to change you.
There are always ways to keep the Volturi in the dark.
No.
No.
You all know what I want.
And I know how much I'm asking for.
The only thing that I can think of for it to be fair is to just vote.
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-Shut up.
Alice?
I already consider you my sister.
-Yes.
-Thank you.
JASPER:
I vote "yes."
It would be nice to not want to kill you all the time.
Hmm.
ROSALIE:
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry to both of you for how I've acted, and I'm really grateful that you were brave enough to go and save my brother.
But this isn't a life I would have chosen for myself.
And I wish that there'd been someone to vote "no" for me.
So, no.
I vote "Hell, yeah."
And we can pick a fight with these Volturi some other way.
I already consider you a part of the family.
Yes.
(DR. CULLEN SIGHS)
Why are you doing this to me?
You know what this means.
You've chosen not to live without her, which leaves me no choice.
I won't lose my son.
BELLA:
I'll wait until after graduation to make it easier on Charlie.
Edward, I want you to be the one to do it.
(TIRES SCREECH)
He wants to talk to me.
JACOB:
So you're still alive for now.
EDWARD:
He thinks it's me keeping you away.
JACOB:
You stay the hell out of my head.
Jacob, I know you have something to say to me.
But I want to say something to you first, if that's all right.
Thank you.
Thank you for keeping Bella alive when I didn't.
No.
You didn't.
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.
I'm still grateful.
But I'm here now.
I'm not gonna leave her side until she orders me away.
We'll see.
Hey, my turn to talk.
I'm here to remind you about a key point in the treaty.
I haven't forgotten.
What key point?
If any of them bites a human, the truce is over.
But if I choose it, it has nothing to do with you.
No.
No, I won't let you.
You're not gonna be one of them, Bella.
It's not up to you.
You know what we'll do to you.
I won't have a choice.
Bella, please, come.
Wait.
Is he gonna hurt me?
Read his mind.
Jake,
I love you.
(JACOB BREATHES DEEPLY)
So, please,
don't make me choose,
'cause it'll be him.
It's always been him.
Bella...
Goodbye, Jacob.
No, you don't speak for her!
(GROWLING)
(ROARS)
Bella, get out of here.
BELLA:
Stop!
Stop!
You can't hurt each other without hurting me.
Jake.

That's too long.
(SIGHS)
Then 3?
You're so stubborn.
What are you waiting for?
I have one condition if you want me to do it myself.
What's the condition?
And then forever.
That's what I'm asking.
Marry me, Bella.
(GASPS)
(A WHITE DEMON LOVE SONG PLAYING)
White demon love song down the hall
White demon shadow on the road
Back up your mind, there is a call
He isn't coming after all
Love this time
She likes the way he sings
White demon love song's in her dreams
White demon, where's your selfish kiss?
White demon sorrow will arrange
Let's not forget about the fear
Black invitation to this place that cannot change
While strangely holy
Come for a rain
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friend go?
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friend go?
Let us be in love
Let's do old and gray
I won't make you cry
I will never stray
I will do my part
Let us be in love tonight
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friend go?
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friend go?
Stand it anymore, darling
Stand it
(MEET ME ON THE EQUINOX PLAYING)
Meet me on the equinox
Meet me halfway
When the sun is perched at its highest peak
In the middle of the day
Let me give my love to you
Let me take your hand
As we walk in the dimming light
Oh, darling, understand
That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything ends
Meet me on your best behavior
Meet me at your worst
For there will be no stone unturned
Or bubble left to burst
Let me lay beside you, darling
Let me be your man
And let our bodies intertwine
But always understand
That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything, everything ends
A window
An opened tomb
The sun crawls
Across your bedroom
A halo
A waiting room
Your last breaths
Moving through you
As everything, everything ends
As everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything ends
Meet me on the equinox
Meet me halfway
When the sun is perched at its highest peak
In the middle of the day
Let me give my love to you
Let me take your hand
And as we walk in the dimming light
Oh, darling, understand
That everything, everything ends

"These violent delights have violent ends."
"And in their triumph die, like fire and powder."
"Which, as they kiss, consume."
Gran?
Edward, don't, she'll see you.
Okay.
Gran, I'd like you to meet...
Happy birthday, Bella.
Happy birthday.
I thought we agreed, no presents.
The one from me's not wrapped.
So it doesn't count.
That's actually great.
Thanks, Dad.
It goes with this one from your mom.
We coordinated.
Well, she coordinated me.
It's to put your pictures in from senior year.
Senior year.
How'd you get so old so fast?
I didn't.
It's not that old.
I don't know.
Is that a gray hair?
No.
No way.
Happy birthday.
That's really funny.
Another missing hiker brings the total to three presumed dead.
Rangers are searching for the killer animal.
It's Bella.
Bella!
Hi!
Today's the big day, Bella.
R and J essay due.
Oh yeah.
Wherefore art thou, Bella?
Let me take a picture of you guys.
My mom... wants me to put together a scrapbook full of memories.
- Cool.
Yeah.
- I take 'em.
I'm not in 'em.
No, come here.
- You'll photoshop this if my nose looks big, right?
Don't worry, I'm in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.
That's good.
Oh, good.
Cullen's here.
Yay.
Talk to you later.
- Happy birthday.
- Don't remind me.
Bell, your birth is definitely something to celebrate.
Yeah, but my aging's not.
Your aging?
I think 18 is a little young to start worrying about that.
It's one year older than you.
No, it isn't.
I'm 109.
Maybe I shouldn't be dating such an old man.
It's gross.
I should be thoroughly repulsed.
We have to go to class.
Okay.
Wait a second.
Someone wants you.
Bella!
Jacob!
I'll leave you to talk.
Hello, Biceps!
You know, anabolic steroids are really bad for you.
I'm just filling out, Bella.
It wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more.
You should switch schools.
You can come hang out with the palefaces.
I'm all right.
I prefer the rez school's exclusivity.
They let any old riff-raff into this place.
I see.
Then why are you slumming it'?
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.
You should really come take a ride when it's done.
Is it fast?
It's decent.
- You're kidding.
- Okay.
Good.
Hey, happy birthday.
Your dad told my dad, so...
Yeah, of course, he did.
I saw this the other day and thought of you.
Catches bad dreams.
That's kinda perfect.
Thank you.
No problem.
- Good seeing you.
- Yeah, I'll see you later.
So how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?
Cause I have nothing to give back to you.
Bella, you give me everything just by breathing.
Gee?
Thank you.
That's all I want
Bella!
Happy birthday!
I thought I said no presents?
I've already seen you open it and guess what?
You love it.
You're gonna wear it tonight.
Our place.
Come on.
Please?
It'll be fun.
- Okay.
All right.
- Great!
I'll see you at seven.
Jasper!
No fair with the mood control thing.
Sorry, Bella.
Happy...
Never mind.
You can't trust vampires.
Trust me.
"Oh my love.
My wife."
"Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath..."
"but hath no power yet upon thy beauty."
"Thou art not conquered."
"Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks."
"Death's pale flag is not advanced there."
I hate being celebrated.
There are worse tragedies.
Look at Romeo.
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.
But I do envy him one thing.
Juliet.
That's perfect.
If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.
Not the girl.
The suicide.
It's nearly impossible for... for some... people.
For humans, a little poison... a dagger to the heart.
There're so many different options.
Why would you say that?
'Cause I had to consider it once.
I didn't know if I'd get to you in time.
I had to come up with some kind of plan.
What was the plan?
That I'd go to Italy and provoke the Volturi.
The what?
The Volturi.
Now, who'd like to repeat the last few lines of iambic pentameter... just to show they were paying attention?
Mr. Cullen?
Yes, Mr. Berty.
"O here..."
"will I set up my everlasting rest..."
"and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh."
"Eyes, look your last."
"Arms, take your last embrace."
"And lips, O you the doors of breath..."
"seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death."
Eyes on the screen, people.
"Thus, with a kiss, I die."
The Volturi are a very old very powerful family.
I guess they're the closest thing to royalty my world has.
Is that Carlisle?
Yeah.
He lived with them for a few decades.
Described 'em as very refined.
No respect for human life, of course.
But a respect for the arts and the sciences, at least.
And the law.
Above all, the law.
Vampires have laws?
Not very many.
And only one that's regularly enforced.
What is it?
That we keep the existence of our kind a secret.
We don't make spectacles of ourselves.
And we don't kill conspicuously.
Unless, of course, you want to die.
You gotta stop talking about that.
I can't even think about someone hurting you.
Bella... the only thing that can hurt me is you.
And I don't have anything else to be afraid of.
That's not true.
Victoria?
She'll come for me one day.
Alice will see when she decides... and we'll be ready.
I could protect you... if you change me.
Bella, you already do protect me.
You're my only reason... to stay alive.
If that's what I am.
But it's my job to protect you.
From everyone except my sister.
It's time!
It's time!
Sorry about all this.
- We tried to rein Alice in.
- As if that were even possible.
- Happy birthday, Bella.
- Thanks.
I found it in your bag.
You mind?
Dating an older woman.
Hot.
What?
You first, Rosalie.
It's a necklace.
- Alice picked it out.
- Thanks.
Show me the love.
This one's from Emmett.
Already installed it in your truck.
Finally a decent sound system for that piece of.
Hey!
Don't hate the truck.
Open Esme and Carlisle's.
Just a little something to brighten your day.
Yes, you've been looking kind of pale lately.
Paper cut.
Jaz!
Ssh!
It's okay.
It's just a little... blood.
Get Jasper out of here.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.
Check on Jasper.
I'm sure he's very upset with himself... and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.
Edward.
I never wanted to have a party.
It's not your fault.
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.
How do you do it?
Years and years of practice.
Did you ever think of just doing it the easy way?
No.
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.
Brings me happiness.
Even if I am damned regardless.
Damned?
Like hell?
Carlisle, you couldn't be damned.
You couldn't.
It's impossible.
Thank you, Bella.
You've always been very gracious about us.
So that's it?
That's why he won't change me?
Imagine the situation in reverse.
If you believed as Edward does... could you take away his soul?
You can't protect me.
From everything.
At some point, something's going to separate us.
It's gonna be an accident... or illness... or old age.
As long as I'm human.
And the only solution is to change me.
That's not a solution.
It's a tragedy.
You're not gonna want me when I look like a grandmother.
Bella... do you not understand my feelings for you at all?
Carlisle told me... how you feel about your soul.
I don't believe that.
So don't worry about mine.
You should go inside.
It's still my birthday.
So can I ask one thing?
Kiss me?
I love you.
I love you.
He)'
Come take a walk with me.
We have to leave Forks.
Why?
Carlisle's supposed to be 10 years older than he looks.
And people are starting to notice.
Qkay...
I've got to think of something to say to Charlie.
When you say "we"...?
I mean my family and myself.
Edward, what happened with Jasper, it's nothing.
You're right.
It was nothing.
Nothing but what I always expected.
And nothing compared to what could have happened.
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.
I belong with you.
No.
You don't.
I'm coming.
Bella...
I don't want you to come.
You don't want me?
No.
That changes things.
A lot.
But if it's not too much to ask... can you just promise me something?
Don't do anything reckless.
For Charlie's sake.
And I'll promise something to you in return.
This is the last time you'll ever see me.
I won't come back.
And you can go on with your life without any interference from me.
It Will be like...
I never existed, I promise.
If this is about my soul, take it.
I don't want it without you.
It's not about your soul.
You're just not good for me.
Not good enough for you.
I'm just sorry I let this go on for so long.
Please...
Don't...
Good bye.
Edward.
Edward!
Edward.
I'm gonna try the Cullens' place again.
The Cullens left town, Charlie.
Good riddance.
Where'd they go?
We'll find her.
Thanks, Harry
Charlie!
She's all right.
I got her.
Thank you, Sam.
OCTOBER
NOVEMBER
Alice...
You have disappeared.
Like everything else.
Now who else can I talk to?
I'm lost.
DECEMBER
When you left...
And he left... you took everything with you.
But the absence of him is everywhere I look.
It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest.
Bella.
But in a way I'm glad.
The pain is my only reminder that he was real.
That you all were.
All right.
That's it.
What?
You're going to Jacksonville.
Live with your mother.
I'm not leaving Forks.
Bells... he's not coming back.
I know.
It's just not normal.
This behavior.
Quite frankly, it's scaring the hell out of me.
And your mother.
Baby, I don't want you to leave.
I don't, but, just go.
Go to Jacksonville.
Make some new friends.
I like my old friends.
- You never see 'em any more.
- I do.
I... m gonna go shopping tomorrow with Jessica.
- You hate shopping.
- I...
I need a girl's night out.
All right.
Girl's night.
Shopping.
I like it.
Go... buy some stuff.
Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.
Yes, Bella Swan.
- THE DEAD come BACK.
- I don't know why you want to sit through... all those zombies, eating people and no hot guys kissing anybody.
It's gross.
Why are there that many zombie movies anyway?
If it's supposed to draw a parallel about leprosy... my cousin had leprosy.
It's not funny.
And is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism?
Cause don't be so pleased with your own self-referential cleverness.
Some girls like to shop.
Not all girls, apparently.
Although I was surprised you even called at all.
Your depression thing, I get it, I'm totally worried.
But you're still bumming?
I'm going through stuff, too.
You want a ride, girls?
You know?
What's up?
It's hard, you know?
And since when does "just friends"...
What's up, guys?
Keep walking.
This is dangerous.
Dude, come on.
Come here for a sec!
I think I know those guys.
We got beer!
We got bikes!
Well, they seem great.
Can we go?
I'm just gonna see something.
Hey, girlie!
All right!
We got a taker.
Turn around.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
No, that's cool.
I'll be whoever you want me to be, honey.
So... what do you say?
You promised me, nothing reckless.
You promised it would be as if you never existed.
You lied.
You say somethin', babe?
You know what?
Never mind.
S'£Op!
Stop, stop, 9/EOD!
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?
Just curious.
I thought that I saw something.
You thought-?
You're insane, actually.
Or suicidal.
That homeboy could've been a psycho.
I was about to end up in an FBI interview room like some lame TV show.
That was such a rush.
Awesome.
So you're an adrenaline junkie now?
That's cool.
You can go bungee jumping.
You don't get on some random loser's motorcycle.
Crazy.
Alice...
I saw him.
Maybe I'm crazy now.
I guess that's okay.
If a rush of danger is what it takes to see him... then that's what I'll find.
Bella!
Where the hell have you been, loca?
I brought you something.
Okay.
It's a little crazy.
Wow!
Scrap metal.
You shouldn't have.
I saved it from the junkyard.
I think they'll probably cost more to fix than they're worth.
But then I thought that if I had a mechanic friend to help me out then...
Me being the mechanic-type friend?
That's right.
Since when are you into motorcycles?
Since now.
I get it if you think that this is really stupid and reckless.
Yeah, it's completely stupid and reckless.
When do we start?
Now.
- Please?
- Alright.
Wait, be careful.
Those things are actually really... heavy, so...
Jake, you're like buff.
How did that happen?
You're 16.
I don't get it.
Age is just a number, baby.
What are you, 40 now?
It feels like that sometimes.
That song's good.
You don't like it?
I don't really like... music any more, kind of.
Okay.
No more music.
So I was thinking, if we're gonna do this every day.
And hopefully we will.
We have to fit some homework in there somewhere.
I don't want Billy thinking that I'm a bad influence on you.
You?
Influence me?
Please.
Are you-?
I'm older than you.
So... that makes me the influencer.
And you the influencee.
No no no.
My size and knowledge base actually makes me older than you... because of your general paleness and lack of know-how.
I convinced you to build 2-wheeled death machines with me.
Don't you think that makes you kinda young and naive?
Okay.
So where do we stand?
I'm 35.
And you might be 32.
Come on.
- Yo.
Jake, You in there?
- It's okay.
It's just my boys.
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey.
Guys, this is Bella.
- Bella, that's Quil and Embry.
- Hi.
I'm Quil Ateara.
So the bike building story is true.
Yeah, I taught him everything he knows.
What about the part where you're his girlfriend?
We're friends.
- Burn.
- Actually... remember I said she's a girl and a friend.
Embiy, do you remember him making that distinction?
Nope.
So you guys have girlfriends?
That's awesome.
Yeah, right.
Quil's actually taking his cousin to prom.
Yeah, that's still a riot.
You want funny, Black?
I'll give you funny.
Jeez.
That hold is illegal!
I got 5 bucks on Quil.
You're on.
Dear Alice...
I wish I had your real address.
I wish I could tell you about Jake.
He makes me feel better.
I mean, he makes me feel alive.
The hole in my chest...
When I'm with Jake... it's like it's almost healed.
For a while.
So Quil keeps asking to come over.
I think he likes you a little too much.
Well, I'm really not into the whole cougar thing.
You know?
What's up with you and age?
I mean, how old was that Cullen guy, anyway?
But even Jake can't keep the dreams away.
Hey, hey, hey!
Wake up, Bella.
Ssh!
You're okay.
You're okay.
I thought this thing was starting to work, but I guess not.
Can I ask you something?
Hanging out with Jacob... that seems to take your mind off things a bit, doesn't it?
You know, sometimes... you gotta learn to love what's good for you.
You know what I mean?
Of course, what do I know?
I'm just a terminal bachelor.
Famous ladies' man.
Okay.
I'll go to bed.
I love you.
If I told you I couldn't fix these bikes, what would you have said?
Are you doubting your mad skills?
No.
Definitely not.
They'll run fine.
It's just... maybe if I was smart, I woulda dragged out the rebuild a bit.
If you told me you couldn't fix these bikes, I would say that's... really too bad, but... that we're just gonna have to find something else to do.
Is that Sam Uley?
Yeah.
Him and his cult.
Oh my God.
Did you see that?
They're not really fighting, Bella.
They're cliff diving.
Scary as hell.
But a total rush.
- A rush?
- Most of us jump from lower down.
We leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples.
You have some kind of beef with him or something?
I don't know.
They just think they run this place.
Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids.
- Now look at him.
- That's Embry?
Yeah.
What happened to him?
He missed some school.
Then all of a sudden, he started following Sam around like a little puppy.
Same thing happened with Paul and Jared.
Sam keeps giving me this look.
Like he's waiting for me or something.
It's kinda starting to freak me out.
You should just avoid him.
I UV...
Okay.
- You look scared.
- I'm not.
All right.
- Brake?
- That one.
Clutch?
Good.
Gas?
Ready?
Now, slowly release the clutch.
Bella.
S'toP...
Whoa.
You all right?
I'm gonna go again.
Okay.
Whoa whoa whoa!
Hit the brake.
I'm gonna go again.
Are you trying to get yourself killed?
- I want to go again.
- No.
Forget it.
No more bikes.
Man, your head.
- Yeah.
- Oh my God, I'm sorry.
You're apologizing for bleeding?
Yeah.
I guess I am.
It's just blood, Bella.
No big deal.
There.
What are you staring at?
You're sort of beautiful.
How hard did you hit your head?
I don't know.
Let's go.
I did see something in the woods.
Totally.
Baby, I believe you.
No, he doesn't.
He's just trying to get lucky.
No, okay.
It was jet black.
And huge.
On all fours, it was still taller than a person.
A bear, maybe?
Or an alien.
You're lucky you didn't get probed.
Well, I saw it.
You're not the only one.
My Dad's been getting reports at the station.
Like, 5 hikers have been killed by some bear.
But they can't find the bear.
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.
So?
I mean...
Bella's back.
Yeah, I guess so.
All right, that's-Well, welcome.
So listen, now that you're talking and eating again, which...
You've gotta get that protein in there.
I was just wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me.
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah, I do.
Cool.
Let me see, we could check out...
"Love Spelled Backwards ls Love".
It's a dumb title, but it's a romantic comedy,
- It's supposed to be pretty-
- No.
No romance.
How 'bout "Face Punch"?
Have you heard of that?
I mean, that's an action movie.
Yeah, it's perfect.
Guns, adrenaline.
That's my thing.
Okay.
We should get a bunch of people to go.
- "Face Punch"?
- "Face Punch"?
Yeah!
Mike?
We were supposed to watch that.
Remember, the trailer's like...
- Punch faces!
- I remember.
Yeah!
Movie night with Bella.
So "Face Punch", huh?
You like action movies?
Not really.
I heard it sucks.
Bad.
Are you even old enough to see this movie?
I mean, without adult supervision.
- She's buying my ticket for me.
- She's buying it.
Okay.
Jessica bailed and Angela got the stomach flu.
So Eric's taking care of her.
It's just us 3.
Great!
- Great.
- Yeah.
Put your gun down.
Put your gun down.
Or I'm gonna blow your frickin' head off.
Put your guns down.
Or I'm gonna blow both of your frickin' heads off.
All right, forget it, let's do this!
Okay, I think I'm gonna throw up.
He's...
What a marshmallow!
You should hold out for someone with a stronger stomach.
Someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit.
Yeah.
I'll keep my eye open for that.
I feel bad.
He probably has that flu that's going around.
I can't hold your hand?
Of course you can.
I just think it means something a little different to you.
So...
Okay, tell me something... you like me, right?
And you think I'm "sort of beautiful."
Jacob, please... don't do this.
Why?
Because you're about to ruin everything.
And I need you.
Well, I've got loads of time.
I'm not gonna give up.
I don't want you to.
But... it's just 'cause I don't want you to go anywhere.
And that's really selfish.
You know, I'm not like a car that you can fix up.
I'm never gonna run right.
So I should be fair to you.
It's because of him, right?
Look...
I know what he did to you.
But, Bella...
I would never ever do that.
I won't ever hurt you.
I promise.
I won't let you down.
You can count on me.
Well...
I need to go home.
I was feeling sick before the movie.
Okay?
What is your problem?
Right now?
You're my problem.
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.
You want me to put you in the hospital?
Jake!
The movie's over.
What are you doing?
You're really hot.
Like you have a fever.
Are you okay?
I don't know what's happening.
I gotta go.
Dude is weird.
Jake, your Dad says you have mono.
He won't let me visit, but would you call me?
Hey, it's me again.
I just...
I'm sorry about what I said at the movie theater.
I just wanted to hear your voice, so no pressure.
Jacob, please...
Call me.
Okay.
We should be back around 3.
He)'
I don't have to go fishing today.
Yes, you do.
Yeah.
Go.
What are you talking about?
Just be careful.
Always am.
Those bears won't get the drop on me, Bella.
My Kung Fu is strong.
Jake!
Hey!
You cut your hair off?
And got a tattoo?
Bella.
I thought you were too sick to come outside.
Or pick up the phone when I call.
Go away.
What?
Go away.
What happened to you?
What's wrong-?
Hey!
What happened?
Did Sam get to you?
Is that what's happening?
Sam's trying to help me.
Don't blame him.
But if you want somebody to blame... how about those filthy bloodsuckers youlove?
The Cullens.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
You've been lying to everyone.
But you can't lie to me.
- Not any more, Bella.
- Jacob!
Jacob!
Look, Bella...
We can't be friends any more.
Jake, I know that I've been... hurting you.
It's killing me.
It kills me.
I just need-Maybe- Give me some time or something.
It's not you.
It's not you, it's me, right?
Really?
It's true.
It is me.
I'm not good.
I used to be.
A good kid.
Not any more.
This doesn't even matter.
All right?
This is over.
You can't break up with me.
I mean...
I mean you're my best friend.
You promised me.
I know.
I promised I wouldn't hurt you, Bella.
And this is me keeping that promise.
Go home.
And don't come back.
Or you're gonna get hurt.
Alice...
Things are...
Things are bad again.
Without Jake, I just can't stand it.
I don't see Edward any more.
Will it really feel like he never existed?
I will find a place where I can see him again.
Bella.
Laurent.
I didn't expect to find you here.
I went to visit the Cullens, but... the house is empty.
I'm surprised they left you behind.
Weren't you sort of a... pet of theirs?
You could say that.
Do the Cullens visit often?
Lie.
Yeah, all the time.
Lie better.
I'll tell them that you stopped by.
But I probably shouldn't...
I'm surprised they left you behind.
Edward.
'Cause he's pretty protective.
But he's far away, isn't he?
Why are you here?
I came as a... favor to Victoria.
Victoria?
She asked me to see if you were still under the protection of the Cullens.
Victoria feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate... given he killed hers.
An eye for an eye.
Threaten him.
Edward would know who did it.
And he'd come after you.
I don't think he will.
After all, how much could you mean to him... if he left you here unprotected?
Victoria won't be happy about my killing you.
But I can't help myself.
You are so mouth-watering.
Please, don't.
I mean, you helped us.
Ssh!
Don't be afraid.
I'm doing you a kindness.
Victoria plans on killing you slowly.
Painfully.
Whereas I'll make it quick.
I promise.
You will feel nothing.
Edward, I love you.
I don't believe it.
Dad!
I saw them.
What's the matter?
In the woods.
They're not bears.
What the hell were you doing out in the woods?
They're wolves.
I mean, they're huge wolves.
Are you sure about that, Bella?
Yeah!
I just saw them.
They were after... something.
Wolves?
You saw 'em?
All right, well, Harry?
Feel like going hunting?
Get some of your guys together?
Sure, yeah, I'll just...
By now, those wolves will be dead.
And Laurent would have told her I'm unprotected.
Victoria.
I should go to the station.
Yeah, you should.
You should go.
Can you just stay in the house?
Bella!
You scared me.
What the hell are you doing?
Back up.
I'm coming up.
He)'
Look, I'm sorry.
For what?
I wish I could explain.
But I literally... can't.
Have you ever had a secret you couldn't tell anyone?
One that wasn't yours to share?
That's what it's like for me.
But worse.
You have no idea... how tight I'm bound.
I hate this.
I hate what they've done to you.
The killer part is you already know.
Bella... do you remember when we walked on the beach at La Push?
The st...
The story.
The story about... the cold ones.
I guess I understand why that's the only part you remember.
There's gotta be something...
- that You can do.
- No.
I'm in it for life.
Maybe we should just get out of here for a while.
Just leave.
Just you and me.
You'd do that?
I would do it for you.
It's not something I can just run away from, Bella.
But I would... run away with you.
If I could.
I gotta go.
They'll start wondering where I am.
Come here.
Please... try to remember.
It'd be so much easier... if you knew.
I'll try.
But Jake...
Jake, what are you doing?
Wait!
Jake.
Edward, I'm scared.
You should be.
Really, it's just an old story.
I'm not really supposed to say anything about it...
Did you know Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?
Bella?
I need to see him.
He's not in.
- I'm sorry, I really need to see him.
- Bella!
What did you do?
What did you do?
- What did You do to him?
- Easy!
He didn't want this.
What did we do?
What did he do?
What'd he tell you?
Both of you calm down.
He tells me nothing, because he's scared of you.
Too late now.
Bella, get back!
Paul?
Calm down, now!
Bella!
Run!
Jake, run!
Hey!
Take Bella back to Emily's place.
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.
Alice... is it possible that everything is true?
The fairy tales and horror stories?
Is it possible that there isn't anything sane or normal, at all?
I think we should go back and see if Jacob's okay.
I hope Paul sinks some teeth in him.
Serves him right.
No way.
Jacob's a natural.
You see him phase on the fly?
I got $5 says Paul doesn't touch him.
Come on in, Bella!
We won't bite.
Speak for yourself.
Hey, about Emily, Sam's fiancee?
Don't stare.
It bugs Sam.
Why would I stare?
Are you guys hungry?
Like I have to ask.
Who's this?
Bella Swan.
Who else?
So, you're the vampire girl?
So you're the wolf girl?
Guess so.
Well...
I'm engaged to one.
Save some for your brothers.
And ladies first.
Muffin?
Sure.
Thanks.
Leave it to Jacob to find a way around Sam's gag order.
He didn't say anything to me.
That's a wolf thing.
Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want 'em to or not.
And check it out!
We can hear each other's thoughts.
Would you shut up?
These are trade secrets.
Damn it!
This chick runs with vampires.
You can't really run with vampires.
'Cause they're fast.
Yeah?
Well, we're faster.
Freaked out yet?
You're not the first monsters I've met.
Jake's right.
You're good with weird.
He)'
Sorry.
So you're a werewolf?
Yeah.
Last time I checked.
A few lucky members of the tribe have the gene.
A bloodsucker moves into town, and the fever sets in.
Mono.
Yeah.
I wish.
Can't you find a way to just... stop?
I mean it's wrong.
It's not a lifestyle choice.
I was born this way.
I can't help it.
You're such a hypocrite.
What?
I'm not the right kind of monster for you?
It's not what you are.
It's what you do.
They never hurt anybody.
You've killed people.
Bella, we're not killing anyone.
Then who is?
What we're trying to protect you people from.
The only thing we do kill.
Vampires.
Wait, Jake, you can't.
Don't worry, we can't touch your little precious Cullens unless... they violate the Treaty.
That's not what I'm saying.
You can't kill vampires.
They'll...
They'll kill you.
Really?
We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough.
Laurent?
And his red-headed girlfriend is next.
Victoria's here?
Was.
We chased her all the way to the Canadian border the other night.
She keeps coming back.
We don't know what she's after.
I do.
Me.
Don't worry.
We've got this place covered.
She won't get near you or Charlie.
You've got to be careful.
She's fast.
You don't know how fast she is.
You know, your lack of confidence in us is a little insulting.
I'd better go.
You gotta go?
Yeah.
Got a vampire to kill.
Alice...
I'm all right.
Until I'm alone.
And lately, that's all the time.
Jacob's gone.
He's hunting Victoria.
And Charlie's hunting Jacob.
And you're gone.
And so is Edward.
There's just nothing now.
You got something, Harry?
Nope.
Nothing.
But I realize where I have to go.
What I have to do to see him again.
Don't do this.
You wanted me to be human.
Watch me.
Please.
For me.
You won't stay with me any other way.
Bella, please.
Breathe!
Breathe!
Come on, Bella, breathe!
Bella?
Bella, can you hear me?
Jake?
Come here.
What the hell were you thinking?
I just wanted to see something.
Get her home!
I'm gonna go help out over at Harry's place
Bella, please.
Harry Clearvvater had a heart attack.
Charlie and my Dad are over at his place with his family.
Is he okay?
He's gone.
Come on.
I'll get you something dry and drive you home.
Hundred and eight degrees over here.
God!
My hands are freezing.
It must be nice, never getting cold.
It's a wolf thing.
It's not.
It's a Jacob thing.
You're just warm.
You're like your own sun.
Is this better?
Now that you know about me.
But...?
You saw what happened to Emily.
Sam go'E 8n9W...
Lost it for a split second.
Em was standing too close.
He'll never be able to take that back.
What if I got mad at you?
Sometimes...
I feel like I'm gonna disappear.
Okay, not that you need me... to tell you something like this... but I always will.
You're not gonna lose yourself.
I wouldn't let that happen.
How?
I'll tell you, all the time... how special you are.
Thank you.
For everything.
Wait.
There's a vampire.
How do you know?
I can smell it.
I'm getting you out of here.
That's Carlisle's car.
They're here.
Bella, it's a trick!
Stop!
You gotta come with me!
They won't hurt me.
If a Cullen is back here, this is their territory.
Treaty says we can only defend on our own lands.
I can't protect you here.
That's okay.
You don't have to.
You're about to cross a line.
Then don't draw one.
Please?
Alice?
Oh my God!
What are you-?
I'm sorry, I just can't believe you're here. ls...?
Would you like to explain to me how you're alive?
What?
I saw a vision of you.
You jumped off a cliff.
Why in the hell would you try and kill yourself?
What about Charlie?
I didn't try to kill myself.
I was cliff jumping.
Recreationally.
It was fun.
I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy.
Did you tell him?
No.
He only calls in once every few months.
He said he wants to be alone.
What is that God-awful wet dog smell?
That's probably me.
Or it's Jacob.
Jacob who?
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.
Bella!
Werewolves are not good company to keep.
Speak for yourself.
I had to see you were safe.
I thought you couldn't protect me here.
Guess I don't care.
I'm not gonna hurt her.
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.
I'm talking about the other bloodsucker who tried to kill Bella because of you.
Victoria?
Yeah, Victoria's been around.
I didn't see her.
I didn't see you get pulled out of the water, either.
I can't see past you and your pack of mutts.
Don't get me upset.
Stop.
Stop.
I'm not gonna hurt her.
I'll give you a minute.
He)'
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna come back.
- Right?
- As soon As You put THE dog out.
Is he-?
Are there others?
How many Cullens are here and how long are they staying?
No.
It's just Alice.
And she can stay as long as she'd like.
Are the rest coming back?
No.
Not that I know of.
Anything else?
That's it.
If that's all, then you'd better go run back to Sam.
I've done it again.
I keep breaking my promise.
We don't have to do this to each other.
Yes, we do.
Bella...
Swan residence.
He's not here right now.
He's arranging a funeral.
Who was that?
What?
Always in the way.
Who was that?
Bella, step back.
- Who was that?
- It's Edward.
He thinks you're dead.
Rosalie told him why I came here.
Why didn't you let me speak to him?
He didn't ask for you.
- I don't care!
- He's going to the Volturi.
He wants to die, too.
He left you, Bella.
He didn't want you any more.
Remember?
I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt.
What about your Dad?
I'm 18.
I'm legally free to go and I left a note.
Please, Bella... just stay here.
For Charlie.
Or for me.
I have to go.
I'm begging you.
Please.
Goodbye, Jacob.
Okay.
So you've made up your minds.
I'm afraid your particular gifts... are too valuable to destroy.
But, if you're unhappy with your lot... join us.
We would be delighted to utilize yourskms.
Won't you consider staying with us?
You know it will happen anyway.
Not without cause.
Such a waste.
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?
I figured you wouldn't be opposed to grand theft auto.
Not today.
What?
What do you see?
They refused him.
So?
He's gonna make a scene.
- Show himself to The humans.
- No!
When?
He's gonna wait until noon.
When the sun's at its highest.
God, Alice, you gotta hurry up.
There's Volterra.
- Why are they All in red?
- San Marco's Day festival.
They're commemorating the expulsion of vampires from the city.
It's the perfect setting.
The Volturi will never let him reveal himself.
We have 5 minutes.
Bella, just breathe.
Alice!
Bella, you're the only one he can't see coming.
If I go, he'll read my thoughts, he'll think I'm lying, he'll rush into it.
Where do I go?
He'll be under the clock tower.
Go!
Don't!
Heaven.
You have to move.
Open your eyes.
Look at me.
I'm alive.
You have to move.
Bella.
- You're here.
- I'm here.
Bella!
Yes.
I needed to make you see me once.
You had to know I was alive, that you didn't have to feel guilty or anything.
I can let you go now.
I never acted out of guilt.
I just couldn't live in a world where you don't exist.
But you said...
I lied.
I had to lie.
But you believed me so easily.
Because it doesn't make sense.
For you to love me.
I'm nothing.
I'm human.
I'm nothing.
Bella... you're everything to me.
You're everything.
I won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen.
Aro wants to speak with you again.
No rules were broken.
Nonetheless we should take this to a more appropriate venue.
Fine.
Bella, why don't you go and enjoy the rest of the festival?
The girl comes with us.
No.
You can go to hell.
Come on, guys.
It's a festival.
You wouldn't want to make a scene.
We wouldn't.
Enough.
Jane.
Aro sent me to see what was taking so long.
Just do as she says.
Go ahead.
Don't be scared.
Are you?
No.
- Is she human?
- Yes.
Does she know?
Yes.
Then, why would...
She wants to be.
And so she will be.
Or dessert.
Sister.
They send you out to get one... and you bring back two.
And a half.
Such a clever girl.
What a happy surprise!
Bella is alive after all.
Isn't that wonderful?
I love a happy ending.
They are so rare.
Her blood appeals to you so much... it makes me thirsty.
How can you stand to be so close to her?
It's not without difficulty.
Yes, I can see that.
Aro can read every thought I've ever had with one touch.
And now you know everything.
So get on with it.
You are quite a soul reader yourself, Edward.
Though, you can't read Bella's thoughts.
Fascinating.
I would love to see if... you are an exception to my gifts, as well.
Would you do me the honor?
Interesting.
I see nothing.
I wonder...
Let us see if she's immune to all our powers.
Shall we, Jane?
No!
Pain.
S'£Op!
Stop!
Please!
Stop!
Stop!
Just stop hurting him!
Please!
Jane?
Master?
Go ahead, my dear.
This may hurt just a little.
Remarkable!
She confounds us all.
So what do we do with you now?
You already know what you're going to do, Aro.
She knows too much.
She's a liability.
That's true.
Felix?
No!
Please!
No!
Please, please!
Kill me!
Not him.
How extraordinary!
You would give up your life... for someone like us.
A vampire.
A soulless monster.
Just get away from her!
You don't know a thing about his soul.
This is a sadness.
If only it were your intention to give her immortality.
Wait!
Bella will be one of us.
I've seen it.
I'll change her myself.
Mesmerizing.
To see what you have seen... before it has happened.
Your gifts will make for an intriguing... immortal.
IsabeHa.
Go now.
Make your preparations.
Let us be done with this.
Heidi will arrive any moment.
Thank you for your visit.
We will return the favor.
I would advise that you follow through on your promise soon.
We do not offer second chances.
Goodbye, my young friends.
Nice fishing, Heidi.
Yes, they do look ratherjuicy.
Save some for me.
This way, please.
Stay together.
Stop it!
Stop!
You're here.
You can sleep.
I'll still be here when you wake up.
Bella... the only reason I left... was because I thought I was protecting you.
I needed you... to have a chance at a normal, happy life.
It was so easy for you to leave.
Leaving you was the hardest thing I've done in 100 years.
And I swear...
I will never fail you again.
I'm so sorry.
Charlie's coming.
He)'
You okay?
I'm fine.
Dad, you don't have to worry.
Last time you said that, you took off.
I didn't see you for 3 days.
I'm really sorry, Dad.
Bella... do not ever do that to me again.
Even.
And you're grounded... for the rest of your life.
Okay.
We're not technically breaking any of his rules.
He did say I couldn't take a step inside the door.
I came in through the window.
He's not gonna forgive me easily.
I know.
Can you?
I hope you can, because...
I honestly don't know how to live without you.
Come here.
Once...
Alice changes me... you can't get rid of me.
She won't need to change you.
There are always ways to keep the Volturi in the dark.
No.
No.
You all know what I want.
And I know how much I'm asking for.
The only thing I can think of for it to be fair is...
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Shut up.
Alice?
I already consider you my sister.
"Yes."
- Thank you.
- I vote "yes."
It would be nice to not want to kill you all the time.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry to both of you for how I acted.
And I'm really grateful that you were brave enough to go and save my brother.
But this isn't a life I would have chosen for myself.
And I wish that there'd been someone to vote "no" for me.
So...
So, "no."
I vote "hell, yeah."
And we can pick a fight with these Volturi some other way.
I already consider you a part of the family.
"Yes."
Why are you doing this to me?
You know what this means.
You've chosen not to live without her.
Which leaves me no choice.
I won't lose my son.
I'll wait until after graduation to make it easier on Charlie.
Edward, I want you to be the one to do it.
He wants to talk to me.
So you're still alive for now.
He thinks it's me keeping you away.
You stay the hell out of my head.
Jacob...
I know you have something to say to me.
But I want to say something to you first, if that's all right.
Thank you.
Thank you for keeping Bella alive when I didn't.
No.
You didn't.
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.
I'm still grateful.
But I'm here now.
I'm not gonna leave her side until she orders me away.
We'll see.
Hey, my turn to talk.
I'm here to remind you about a key point in the Treaty.
I haven't forgotten.
What key point?
If any of them bites a human... the truce is over.
But if I choose it, it has nothing to do with you.
No.
No, I won't let you.
You're not gonna be one of them.
It's not up to you.
You know what we'll do to you.
I won't have a choice.
Bella, please, come.
Wait.
Is he gonna hurt me?
Read his mind.
Jake...
I love you.
So, please... don't make me choose.
'Cause it'll be him.
It's always been him.
Bella...
Goodbye, Jacob.
No, you don't speak for her!
Bella, get out of here.
S'£Op!
S'£Op!
You can't hurt each other without hurting me.
Jake.
He's right.
You shouldn't become what I am.
I can't do this alone.
Please, just wait.
Just give me 5 years.
That's too long.
Then three?
You're so stubborn.
What are you waiting for?
I have one condition... if you want me to do it myself.
What's the condition?
And then forever.
That's what I'm asking.
Marry me, Bella.

It goes with this one from your mom.
We coordinated.
Well, she coordinated me.
It's to put your pictures in from senior year.

It's not that old.
I don't know.

-Yeah, but my aging's not.
-Your aging?
(CHUCKLES)
I think 18 is a little young to start worrying about that.
Its one year older than you.
No, it isn't.
I'm 109.
Well, maybe I shouldn't be dating such an old man.
-Mmm.
-It's gross.
I should be thoroughly repulsed.
Uh-huh.
(BOTH SIGHING)
-We have to go to class.
-Okay.
(EDWARD MOANS SOFTLY)
Wait a second.
Someone wants you.
-JACOB:
Bella!
-Jacob!
What?
I'll leave you to talk.
Hello, biceps!
You know, anabolic steroids are really bad for you.
(JACOB LAUGHS)
Well, I'm just filling out, Bella.
You know, it wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more.
You should switch schools.
You can come hang out with the palefaces.
I'm all right.
I prefer the rez school's exclusivity.
They let any old riffraff into this place.
-I see.
Then why are you slumming it?
-Mmm-hmm.
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.
You should really come take a ride when it's done.
Is it fast?
Um.
It's decent.
(BOTH LAUGH)
-I'm kidding.
-Okay.
Good.
Hey, happy birthday.
Your dad told my dad, so...
Yeah, of course he did.
I saw this the other day and thought of you.
Catches bad dreams.
That's kind of perfect.
Thank you.
No problem.
-Good seeing you.
-Yeah, I'll see you later.
Bye.
So how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?
Because I have nothing to give back to you.
Bella, you give me everything just by breathing.
(EXHALES)
See?
Thank you.
-That's all I want.
-ALICE:
Bella!
-Happy birthday!
-Shh, shh!
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
I thought I said no presents.
I've already seen you open it, and guess what, you love it.
You're gonna wear it tonight.
Our place.
Come on.
Please?
It'll be fun.
-Okay.
All right.
-Great!
Okay, I'll see you at 7:00.
Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing.
ALICE LAUGHS)
Sorry, Bella.
Happy...
Never mind.
You can't trust vampires.
Trust me.
ROMEO: (ON VIDEO) O my love!
My wife!
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Thou art not conquered.
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks.
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
BELLA:
I hate being celebrated.
EDWARD:
There are worse tragedies.
I mean, look at Romeo.
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.
BELLA:
Yeah.
Though I do envy him one thing.
BELLA:
Juliet is, like, perfect.
If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.
(EDWARD LAUGHS)
Not the girl, the suicide.
It's nearly impossible for...
For some people.
For humans, a little poison, a dagger to the heart.
There's so many different options.
Why would you say that?
Because I had to consider it once.
(BELLA SCREAMING)
I didn't know if I'd get to you in time.
I had to come up with some kind of plan.
What was the plan?
That I'd go to Italy and provoke the Volturi.
-The what?
-The Volturi.
MR. BERTY:
Now, who'd like to repeat the last few lines of iambic pentameter just to show they were paying attention?
Mr. Cullen?
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Yes, Mr. Berty.
"O here will I set up my everlasting rest
"and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.
"Eyes, look your last.
"Arms, take your last embrace!
"And, lips, O you, the doors of breath,
"seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death!"
Eyes on the screen, people.
ROMEO:
Thus with a kiss I die.
The Volturi are a very old, very powerful family.
I guess they're the closest thing to royalty my world has.
-Is that Carlisle?
-Yeah.
He lived with them for a few decades.
Described them as very refined.
No respect for human life, of course, but a respect for the arts and the sciences, at least.
And the law.
Above all, the law.
BELLA:
Vampires have laws?
EDWARD:
Not very many.
And only one that's regularly enforced.
BELLA:
What is it?
EDWARD:
That we keep the existence of our kind a secret.
We don't make spectacles of ourselves, and we don't kill conspicuously.
Unless, of course, you want to die.
(SCREAMS)
You gotta stop talking about that.
I can't even think about someone hurting you.
Bella, the only thing that can hurt me is you.
And I don't have anything else to be afraid of.
That's not true.
Victoria?
She'll come for me one day.
Alice will see when she decides, and we'll be ready.
I could protect you if you change me.
Bella, you already do protect me.
You're my only reason to stay alive, if that's what I am.
But it's my job to protect you.
(BELLA SIGHS)
From everyone except my sister.
It's time!
It's time.
It's time.
It's time!
(THR VIOLRTHOUA PLAYING)
Your lips are nettles
Your tongue is wine
You're left as liquid But your body's pine
DR. CULLEN:
Sorry about all this.
-We tried to rein Alice in.
-As if that were even possible.
-Happy birthday, Bella.
-Thanks.
I found it in your bag.
You mind?
Dating an older woman.
Hot.
(SIGHS EEXSPERATEDLY)
-What?
-You first, Rosalie.
It's a necklace.
Alice picked it out.
Thanks.
Show me the love.
This one's from Emmett.
Already installed it in your truck.
Finally a decent sound system
-for that piece of...
-Hey!
Don't hate the truck.
ALICE LAUGHS)
Open Esme and Carlisle's.
DR. CULLEN:
Just a little something to brighten your day.
Yes, you've been looking kind of pale lately.
Ow.
Paper cut.
(GLASS SHATTERING)
(JASPER GROWLS)
Jaz, Jaz.
It's okay.
It's just a little blood.
(GASPS SOFTLY)
(JASPER SNARLS)
DR. CULLEN:
Get Jasper out of here.
(BELLA GASPS)
I'm sorry, I can't.
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.
Check on Jasper.
I'm sure he's very upset with himself, and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.
Edward.
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY)
BELLA:
I never wanted to have a party.
DR. CULLEN:
It's not your fault.
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.
How do you do it?
Years and years of practice.
Did you ever think of just doing it the easy way?
No.
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.
It brings me happiness, even if I am damned regardless.
Damned?
Like hell?
Carlisle, you couldn't be damned.
You couldn't.
It's impossible.
Thank you, Bella.
You've always been very gracious about us.
So that's it?
That's why he won't change me?
Imagine the situation in reverse.
Hmm.
If you believed as Edward does, could you take away his soul?
You can't protect me from everything.
At some point, something's gonna separate us.
It's gonna be an accident or illness or old age,
as long as I'm human.
And the only solution is to change me.
That's not a solution.
That's a tragedy.
You're not gonna want me when I look like a grandmother.
Bella, do you not understand my feelings for you at all?
Carlisle told me
how you feel about your soul.
I don't believe that.
So don't worry about mine.
You should go inside.
It's still my birthday.
So can I ask one thing?
Kiss me?
(BELLA GASPS)
(BOTH GASPING)
I love you.
(AOSLYE PLAYING)
Up with your turret
Aren't we just terrified?
Shale, screen your worry
From what you won't ever find
Don't let it fool you
Down
Hey.
Just come take a walk with me.
We have to leave Forks.
Why?
Carlisle's supposed to be 1 0 years older than he looks, and people are starting to notice.
Okay, I've gotta think of something to say to Charlie.
When you say "we"...
I mean my family and myself.
Edward, what happened with Jasper, it's nothing.
You're right.
It was nothing, nothing but what I always expected and nothing compared to what could have happened.
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.
I belong with you.
No.
You don't.
I'm coming.
Bella,
I don't want you to come.
(SIGHS)
You don't want me?
No.
That changes things a lot.
But if it's not too much to ask, can you just promise me something?
Don't do anything reckless.
For Charlie's sake.
And I'll promise something to you in return.
This is the last time you'll ever see me.
I won't come back, and you can go on with your life without any interference from me.
It will be like I never existed, I promise.
If this is about my soul, take it.
I don't want it without you.
It's not about your soul.
You're just not good for me.
Not good enough for you.
I'm just sorry I let this go on for so long.
(SOBS)
Please...
Don't...
Goodbye.
(BELLA SOBBING)
Edward.
Edward!
Edward.
(BELLA CRYING)
(SOFT GROWLING)
(GRASS RUSTLING)
(CHATTERING OVER POLICE RADIO)
I'm gonna try the Cullens' place again.
-BILLY:
The Cullens left town, Charlie.
-Good riddance.
Where'd they go?
We'll find her, Charlie.
-Thanks, Harry.
-Charlie!
BILLY:
Hey.
She's all right.
I got her.
Thank you, Sam.
(POSSIBILITY PLAYING)
There's a possibility
All that I had
Was all I'm gonna get
BELLA:
Alice, you've disappeared, like everything else.
Now who else can I talk to?
I'm lost.
When you left, and he left,
you took everything with you.
But the absence of him is everywhere I look.
It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest.
(BELLA SCREAMING)
Bella.
(INAUDIBLE)
(BELLA SCREAMING)
BELLA:
But in a way I'm glad.
The pain is my only reminder that he was real, that you all were.
All right.
That's it.
What?
You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother.
I'm not leaving Forks.
Bells, he's not coming back.
I know.
It's just not normal, this behavior.
Quite frankly, it's scaring the hell out of me and your mother.
Baby, I don't want you to leave.
I don't, but just go.
Go to Jacksonville.
Make some new friends.
I like my old friends.
-Well, you never see them anymore.
-I do.
I'm gonna go shopping tomorrow with Jessica.
-You hate shopping.
-I...
I need a girls' night out.
All right.
Girls' night.
Shopping.
I like it.
Go buy some stuff.
(I BRLOEG TO YOU PLAYING)
BELLA: (ON PHONE) Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.
Yeah, Bella Swan.
JESSICA:
I don't know why you want to sit through all those zombies eating people and no hot guys kissing anybody.
It's gross.
Like...
And why are there that many zombie movies anyway?
'Cause if it's supposed to, like, draw a parallel about leprosy, my cousin had leprosy.
It's not funny, you know?
And, like, is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism?
Because don't be so pleased with your own, like, self-referential cleverness, you know?
Like, some girls like to shop.
Not all girls, apparently.
Although I was surprised you even called at all.
You know?
Like, your depression thing, I get it.
I'm totally, totally worried.
But after a while it's like,
-you're still bumming...
-CHET:
You want a ride, girls?
...and I'm going through stuff, too.
You know?
Like Mike deciding he just wants to be friends.
CHET:
What's up?
Look what we found.
JESSICA:
It's hard, you know?
Like, and since when does "just friends"...
BIKER 1 :
What's up guys?
BIKER 2:
Look what we found.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, where you going?
(TIRES SCREECHING)
Keep walking.
(GASPING)
This is dangerous.
-Dude, come on.
-CHET:
Come here for a sec!
I think I know those guys.
CHET:
We got beer!
We got bikes!
Well, they seem great.
Can we go?
I'm just gonna see something.
CHET:
Hey, girlie!
All right, all right.
We got a taker.
Turn around.
(GASPS)
(FRIENDS PLAYING)
BIKER 2:
Shut up!
BIKER 3:
You shut up!
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
No, that's cool.
I'll be whoever you want me to be, honey.
So, what do you say?
You promised me, nothing reckless.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
You promised it would be as if you never existed.
(CHET CLEARS THROAT)
-You lied.
-You say something, babe?
You know what?
Never mind.
(ENGINE ROARING)
Stop!
Stop, stop, stop!
(BRAKES SCREECHING)
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?
Just curious.
-l thought that I saw something.
-You...
Oh.
You're insane, actually.
Or suicidal.
That homeboy could've been a psycho.
I was about to end up in an FBI interview room like some lame TV show.
God, that was such a rush.
Awesome.
So you're an adrenaline junkie now?
That's cool.
You can go bungee jumping.
You don't get on the back of some random loser's motorcycle.
Crazy.
BELLA:
Alice, I saw him.
Maybe I'm crazy now.
I guess that's okay.
If a rush of danger is what it takes to see him, then that's what I'll find.
Bella!
Where the hell have you been, loca?
(BELLA LAUGHING)
(SIGHS) I brought you something.
-Okay.
-It's a little crazy.
Wow.
Scrap metal.
You shouldn't have.
I saved it from the junkyard.
(BELLA CLEARS THROAT)
I think they'll probably cost more to fix than they're worth, but then I thought that if I had a mechanic friend
-to help me out then...
-Ah!
-Me being the mechanic-type friend?
-That's right.
-Since when are you into motorcycles?
-Since now.
I get it if you think that this is really stupid and reckless.
Yeah, I mean, it's completely stupid and reckless.
When do we start?
Um.
Now.
-Please?
-(CHUCKLES) All right.
Oh, hey, be careful.
Those things are actually really heavy, so...
Jake, you're, like, buff.
How did that happen?
You're, like, 16.
I don't get it.
Mmm-hmm.
Age is just a number, baby.
What are you, like, 40 now?
It feels like that sometimes.
(ROMANTIC SONG PLAYING ON STEREO)
(TURNS OFF STEREO)
That song's good.
You don't like it?
I don't really like music anymore, kind of.
Okay.
No more music.
So I was thinking, if we're gonna do this every day, and hopefully we will, we have to, like, fit some homework in there somewhere.
I don't want Billy thinking that I'm a bad influence on you.
You?
Influence me?
Please.
Are you...
I'm older than you, so that makes me the influencer and you the influence.
(LAUGHS) No, no, no.
My size and knowledge base actually makes me older than you because of your general paleness and lack of know-how.
I convinced you to build two-wheeled death machines with me.
Don't you think that makes you kind of young and naive?
Okay.
So where do we stand?
-I'm 35.
And you might be, like, 32.
-Come on.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
-QUIL:
Yo, Jake, you in there?
-It's okay.
It's just my boys.
-Hey, Jake.
-Hey.
Guys, this is Bella.
-Bella, that's Quil and Embry.
-Hi.
I'm Quil Ateara.
So the bike building story is true.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I taught him everything he knows.
What about the part where you're his girlfriend?
Uh...
We're friends, you know.
-(LAUGHS) Burn.
-Actually, remember I said she's a girl and a friend.
Embry, do you remember him making that distinction?
Nope.
So you guys have girlfriends?
That's awesome.
(JACOB LAUGHING)
Yeah, right.
Quil's actually taking his cousin to prom.
Yeah, that's still a riot.
You want funny, Black?
I'll give you funny.
(JACOB AND QUIL LAUGHING)
Jeez.
JACOB:
Hey, that hold's illegal!
EMBRY:
I got five bucks on Quil.
You're on.
(SHOOTING THE MOON PLAYING)
All of the astronauts Champagne in plastic cups
Waiting for the big hero to show
Outside the door he stands His head in his hands
And his heart in his throat
What can he tell them now
BELLA:
Dear Alice,
I wish I had your real address.
I wish I could tell you about Jake.
He makes me feel better.
I mean, he makes me feel alive.
The hole in my chest, well, when I'm with Jake, it's like it's almost healed
for a while.
So, Quil keeps asking to come over.
I think he likes you a little too much.
Oh.
Well, I'm really not into the whole cougar thing.
You know?
(CHUCKLES)
What's up with you and age?
I mean, how old was that Cullen guy, anyway?
BELLA:
But even Jake can't keep the dreams away.
(BELLA WHIMPERING)
(SCREAMING)
Hey, hey, hey!
Wake up, Bella.
(SHUSHING) You're okay.
You're okay.
I thought this thing was starting to work, but I guess not.
(CHARLIE SIGHS)
Can I ask you something?
Hanging out with Jacob, that seems to take your mind off things a bit, doesn't it?
You know, sometimes you gotta learn to love what's good for you.
You know what I mean?
Of course, what do I know?
I'm just a terminal bachelor.
Famous ladies' man.
Okay.
I'm gonna go to bed.
Uh...
I love you.
If I told you I couldn't have fixed these bikes, what would you have said?
Are you doubting your mad skills?
No.
Definitely not.
I mean, they'll run fine.
It's just, maybe if I was smart, I would have dragged out the rebuild a bit.
If you told me you couldn't fix these bikes, I would say that that's really too bad, but that we're just gonna have to find something else to do.
(LAUGHS)
Is that Sam Uley?
Yeah.
Him and his cult.
(SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
(WHOOPS)
Oh, my God.
Did you see that?
(JACOB LAUGHING)
They're not really fighting, Bella.
They're cliff diving.
Scary as hell, but a total rush.
-A rush?
-Most of us jump from lower down.
We leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples.
You have some kind of beef with him or something?
I don't know.
They just think they run this place.
Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids.
-Now look at him.
-That's Embry?
(CONTINUE WHOOPING)
-Yeah.
-What happened to him?
He missed some school.
Now all of a sudden, he started following Sam around like a little puppy.
Same thing happened with Paul and Jared.
Sam keeps giving me this look, like he's waiting for me or something.
It's kind of starting to freak me out.
Well, you should just avoid him.
I try.
Okay.
-You look scared.
-I'm not.
All right.
-Brake?
-That one.
Clutch?
Good.
Gas?
(ENGINE ROARS)
Ready?
Now, slowly release the clutch.
EDWARD:
Bella.
Stop.
(BELLA GASPS)
Whoa!
You all right?
I'm gonna go again.
Okay.
(GASPS)
Ah!
Whoa!
Hit the brake!
(GRUNTS)
I wanna go again.
Are you trying to get yourself killed?
-No. I want to go again.
-No.
Forget it.
No more bikes.
Man, your head.
Ow.
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
What, you're apologizing for bleeding?
Yeah.
I guess I am.
Well, it's just blood, Bella.
No big deal.
There.
What are you staring at?
You're sort of beautiful.
How hard did you hit your head?
I don't know.
(JACOB CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Let's go.
ANGELA:
I did see something in the woods.
Totally.
Baby, I believe you.
No, he doesn't.
He's just trying to get lucky.
(ERIC LAUGHS)
ANGELA:
No, okay.
It was jet black and huge.
On all fours, it was still taller than a person.
A bear, maybe?
Or an alien.
You're lucky you didn't get probed.
(ERIC AND MIKE SNICKERING)
ANGELA:
Well, I saw it.
You know, you're not the only one.
My dad's been getting reports at the station.
Like, five hikers have been killed by some bear.
But they can't find the bear.
Hmm.
(LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.
MIKE:
Um... (MIKE CLEARS THROAT)
So?
I mean,
Bella's back?
(LAUGHS)
Yeah, I guess so.
All right, that's...
Well, welcome.
So, listen, now that you're talking and eating again, which, you know, you've got to get that protein in there,
I was just wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me.
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah, I do.
Cool.
Let me see, we could check out
Love Spelled Backwards Is Love.
You know, it's a dumb title, but it's a romantic comedy.
-I mean, it's supposed to be pretty...
-No.
No romance.
How about Face Punch?
Have you heard of that?
I mean, that's an action movie.
Yeah, that's perfect.
Guns, adrenaline.
That's my thing.
Okay.
We should get a bunch of people to go.
Do you guys want to go see Face Punch?
ERIC:
Face Punch, yeah!
Mike, hey, we were supposed to watch that.
Remember, the trailer's like...
-"Punch faces."
-I remember.
(SARCASTICALLY) Yeah!
Movie night with Bella.
JACOB:
So Face Punch, huh?
You like action movies?
Not really.
(JACOB SCOFFING)
I heard it sucks.
Bad.
Are you even old enough to see this movie?
I mean, you know, without, like, adult supervision.
Right, yeah, well, she's buying my ticket for me.
She's buying it.
Okay.
Jessica bailed, and Angela got the stomach flu, so Eric's taking care of her.
-It's just us three.
-Great!
-Great.
-Yeah.
(GUN COCKING ON SCREEN)
MAN 1 ON SCREEN:
Put your gun down.
MAN 2 ON SCREEN:
Put your gun down or I'm gonna blow your frickin' head off.
MAN 3 ON SCREEN:
Both of you put both of your guns down or I'm gonna blow both of your frickin' heads off.
MAN 1 ON SCREEN:
All right, forget it, let's do this!
(GUNS FIRING)
(MAN SCREAMS)
(GUNS FIRING)
(WOMAN SCREAMS)
Okay, I think I'm gonna throw up.
(SCREAMING CONTINUES)
He's... (SCOFFS) What a marshmallow!
You should hold out for someone with a stronger stomach.
Someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit.
Yeah.
I'll keep my eye open for that.
(JACOB CHUCKLES)
I feel bad.
He probably has that flu that's going around.
What?
I can't hold your hand?
No, of course you can.
I just think it means, you know, something a little different to you.
So...
Okay, well, tell me something.
You like me, right?
And you think I'm sort of beautiful?
(SOFTLY) Jacob, please, don't do this.
(BELLA SIGHS)
Why?
Because you're about to ruin everything.
And I need you.
(SIGHS)
Well, I've got loads of time.
I'm not gonna give up.
I don't want you to, but it's just 'cause I don't want you to go anywhere.
And that's really selfish.
You know, I'm not like a car that you can fix up.
I'm never gonna run right.
So I should be fair to you.
It's because of him, right?
(JACOB SIGHS DEEPLY)
Look,
I know what he did to you.
But, Bella, I would never ever do that.
I won't ever hurt you. I promise.
I won't let you down.
You can count on me.
MIKE:
Well,
(SNIFFLES)
(SIGHS)
I need to go home.
I was feeling sick before the movie.
Okay?
(JACOB SCOFFS)
What is your problem?
Right now?
You're my problem.
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.
You want me to put you in the hospital?
Jake!
Jake.
Jake, the movie's over.
What are you doing?
You're really hot.
Like, you feel like you have a fever.
Are you okay?
I don't know what's happening.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I gotta go.
That dude is weird.
BELLA: (ON PHONE) Jake, your dad says you have mono.
He won't let me visit, but would you call me?
Hey, it's me again.
I just...
I'm sorry about what I said at the movie theater.
I just wanted to hear your voice, so no pressure.
Jacob, please...
Call me.
Okay.
We should be back around 3:00.
(SIGHS)
Hey.
Look, I don't have to go fishing today.
Yes, you do.
Yeah, you do.
Go.
What are you talking about?
Just be careful.
Always am.
Those bears won't get the drop on me, Bella.
My kung fu is strong.
Jake!
Hey!
You cut your hair off?
And got a tattoo?
Bella.
I thought you were too sick to come outside or pick up the phone when I call.
Go away.
What?
Go away.
What happened to you?
What's...
Hey!
What happened?
Did Sam get to you?
Is that what's happening?
Sam's trying to help me.
Don't blame him.
But if you want somebody to blame, how about those filthy bloodsuckers you love, the Cullens?
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
You've been lying to everyone.
Charlie.
But you can't lie to me.
-Not anymore, Bella.
-SAM:
Jacob!
Jacob!
Look, Bella, we can't be friends anymore.
(CRYING) Look, Jake, I know that I've been hurting you.
It's killing me.
It kills me.
I just need...
Maybe give me, like,
-some time or something.
-Look, don't.
It's not you.
It's not you, it's me, right?
Really?
It's true.
It is me.
I'm not good.
I used to be a good kid.
Not anymore.
This doesn't even matter.
All right?
This is over.
You can't break up with me.
I mean... I mean, you're my best friend.
You promised me.
I know.
I promised I wouldn't hurt you, Bella.
And this is me keeping that promise.
Go home and don't come back or you're gonna get hurt.
BELLA:
Alice, things are...
Things are bad again.
Without Jake, I just...
I can't stand it.
I don't see Edward anymore.
Will it really feel like he never existed?
I will find the place where l can see him again.
(SOBBING)
Bella.
Laurent.
I didn't expect to find you here.
I went to visit the Cullens, but the house is empty.
I'm surprised they left you behind.
Weren't you sort of a pet of theirs?
Yeah.
You could say that.
Do the Cullens visit often?
Lie.
(GASPS)
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.
Lie better.
I'll tell them that you stopped by.
But I probably shouldn't tell Edward,
'cause he's pretty protective.
But he's far away, isn't he?
Why are you here?
I came as a favor to Victoria.
-Victoria?
-She asked me to see if you were still under the protection of the Cullens.
Victoria feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate, given he killed hers.
An eye for an eye.
Threaten him.
Edward would know who did it.
And he'd come after you.
I don't think he will.
After all, how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected?
(LAURENT SIGHS)
Victoria won't be happy about my killing you, but I can't help myself.
You are so mouth-watering.
-Please, don't. I mean, you helped us.
-No, no, no, no.
(SHUSHING)
Don't be afraid.
I'm doing you a kindness.
(SOFTLY) Victoria plans on killing you slowly, painfully, whereas I'll make it quick.
I promise.
You will feel nothing.
Edward, I love you.
(TWIGS SNAPPING) I don't believe it.
(LOW GROWLING)
(ROARS)
(GASPS)
(WEREWOLVES RUNNING)
(YELPING)
(GASPS)
-Dad!
I saw them.
-What's the matter?
-In the woods.
They're not bears.
-What do you mean "in the woods"?
Bell, what the hell were you doing out in the woods?
They're wolves.
I mean, they're like huge wolves.
Are you sure about that, Bella?
Yeah!
I just saw them.
They were after something.
(HARRY CLEARS THROAT)
Wolves?
You saw them?
All right, well, Harry, feel like going hunting?
Get some of your guys together?
Sure, yeah, I'll just...
BELLA:
By now, those wolves will be dead, and Laurent would have told her I'm unprotected.
Victoria.
I should go to the station.
Yeah, you should.
You should go.
CHARLIE:
Can you just stay in the house?
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
(CLATTERING)
(CLATTERING CONTINUES)
JACOB: (WHISPERS) Bella!
You scared me.
-What the hell are you doing?
-Back up.
I'm coming up.
(GASPS)
Hey.
Look, I'm sorry.
-For what?
-l wish I could explain.
But I literally can't.
(SIGHS)
Have you ever had a secret you couldn't tell anyone, one that wasn't yours to share?
Well, that's what it's like for me.
But worse.
You have no idea how tight I'm bound.
I hate this.
I hate what they've done to you.
I mean, the killer part is, you already know.
Bella, do you remember when we walked on the beach at La Push?
The...
The story.
The story about the cold ones.
I guess I understand why that's the only part you remember.
There's gotta be something that you can do.
No.
I'm in it for life.
Well, maybe we should just get out of here for a while.
Just leave, just you and me.
You'd do that?
I would do it for you.
It's not something I can just run away from, Bella.
But I would run away with you
if I could.
I gotta go.
They'll start wondering where l am.
Come here.
(SOFTLY) Please, try to remember.
It'd be so much easier if you knew.
I'll try.
But, Jake...
Jake, what are you doing?
Wait, Jake.
(GASPS)
Jake.
(GASPS)
Edward, I'm scared.
You should be.
JACOB:
Really, it's just like an old story.
I'm not really supposed to say anything about it.
Did you know Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?
(WEREWOLF SNARLS)
Bella?
I need to see him.
He's not in.
-Okay, I'm sorry, I really need to see him.
-Bella!
What did you do?
-Okay, what did you do?
-Hey.
-What did you do to him?
-Easy!
He didn't want this.
What did we do?
What did he do?
What'd he tell you?
-Both of you calm down.
-Nothing.
He tells me nothing because he's scared of you.
(SNICKERING)
-Too late now.
-SAM:
Bella, get back!
(PAUL GROWLING SOFTLY)
SAM:
Paul, calm down, now!
Bella!
Run!
Jake, run!
(GROWLING)
(WHIMPERS)
(BOTH SNARLING)
SAM:
Paul!
Hey!
Take Bella back to Emily's place.
EMBRY:
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.
BELLA:
Alice, is it possible that everything is true?
The fairy tales and horror stories?
Is it possible that there isn't anything sane or normal at all?
(BOTH WHOOP)
Hey, I think we should go back and see if Jacob's okay.
I hope Paul sinks some teeth in him.
Serves him right.
No way.
Jacob's a natural.
You see him phase on the fly?
I got five says Paul doesn't touch him.
Come on in, Bella.
We won't bite.
Speak for yourself.
(DOER ALL WAOEG PLAYING) I done me wrong
And done all wrong
All the wrong I've done I'm sure I'll live quite long
Oh, hey, about Emily, Sam's fiancée?
Don't stare.
It bugs Sam.
Why would I stare?
Are you guys hungry?
Like I have to ask.
(EMILY LAUGHING)
Who's this?
JARED:
Bella Swan.
Who else?
Hmm.
So, you're the vampire girl.
So, you're the wolf girl.
Guess so.
Well, I'm engaged to one.
Save some for your brothers.
And ladies first.
Muffin?
Sure.
Thanks.
Leave it to Jacob to find a way around Sam's gag order.
He didn't say anything to me.
That's a wolf thing.
Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want them to or not.
And check it out.
We can hear each other's thoughts.
Would you shut up?
These are trade secrets.
Damn it!
This chick runs with vampires.
You can't really run with vampires.
(EMILY GIGGLES)
'Cause they're fast.
Yeah?
Well, we're faster.
Freaked out yet?
You're not the first monsters I've met.
SAM:
Jake's right.
You're good with weird.
Hey.
(EMILY GIGGLING)
Sorry.
So you're a werewolf?
Yeah.
Last time I checked.
A few lucky members of the tribe have the gene.
A bloodsucker moves into town and the fever sets in.
Mono.
Yeah. I wish.
Well, can't you find a way to just stop?
I mean, it's wrong.
It's not a lifestyle choice, Bella.
I was born this way. I can't help it.
You're such a hypocrite.
What, I'm not the right kind of monster for you?
It's not what you are.
It's what you do.
They never hurt anybody.
You've killed people, Jake.
Bella, we're not killing anyone.
Then who is?
What we're trying to protect you people from, the only thing we do kill,
vampires.
Wait, Jake, you can't.
Don't worry.
We can't touch your little precious Cullens unless they violate the treaty.
That's not what I'm saying.
You can't kill vampires.
They'll...
They'll kill you.
Really?
We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough.
(WEREWOLVES GROWLING)
Laurent?
And his red-headed girlfriend is next.
Victoria's here?
Was.
We chased her all the way to the Canadian border the other night.
She keeps coming back.
We don't know what she's after.
I do.
Me.
Don't worry.
We've got this place covered.
She won't get near you or Charlie.
Look, you've got to be careful.
She's fast.
You don't know how fast she is.
You know, your lack of confidence in us is a little insulting.
All right, I'd better go.
You gotta go?
Yeah.
Got a vampire to kill.
BELLA:
Alice, I'm all right.
Until I'm alone.
And lately, that's all the time.
Jacob's gone.
He's hunting Victoria.
And Charlie's hunting Jacob.
And you're gone.
And so is Edward.
And there's just nothing now.
You got something, Harry?
Nope.
Nothing.
But I realize where l have to go, what I have to do to see him again.
(HEARING DAMAGE PLAYING)
A tear in my brain
Allows the voices in
They wanna push you off the path
With their frequency wires
And you can do no wrong
In my eyes
You can do no wrong
In my eyes
A drunken salesman
Your hearing damage
Your mind is restless
They say you're getting better
But you don't feel any better
Your speakers are blowing
Your ears are wrecking
Your hearing damage
You wish you felt better
You can do no wrong
In my eyes
(GROWLING)
EDWARD:
Don't do this.
You wanted me to be human.
Watch me.
EDWARD:
Please.
For me.
You won't stay with me any other way.
Bella, please.
(GASPING)
(SLOWLIFR PLAYING)
This constant noise all the time
Even though you're the only one I see
JACOB:
Breathe!
Breathe!
Come on, Bella, breathe!
(BELLA SPLUTTERING)
Bella?
Bella, can you hear me?
Jake?
Come here.
What the hell were you thinking?
I just wanted to see something.
Get her home!
I'm gonna go help out over at Harry's place.
What happened at Harry's?
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.
Charlie and my dad are over at his place with his family.
Is he okay?
He's gone.
Come on.
I'll get you something dry and drive you home.
(BELLA SHIVERING) 1 08 degrees over here.
God!
My hands are freezing.
It must be nice, never getting cold.
It's a wolf thing.
It's not.
It's a Jacob thing.
You're just warm.
You're like your own sun.
This is better, now that you know about me.
But...
You saw what happened to Emily.
Sam got angry.
Lost it for a split second.
Em was standing too close.
He'll never be able to take that back.
What if I got mad at you?
(JACOB SIGHS)
Sometimes, I feel like I'm gonna disappear.
Okay, not that you need me to tell you something like this,
but I always will.
You're not gonna lose yourself.
I wouldn't let that happen.
How?
I'll tell you all the time
how special you are.
(BELLA INHALES SHARPLY)
Thank you.
For everything.
Wait.
There's a vampire.
How do you know?
I can smell it.
I'm getting you out of here.
That's Carlisle's car.
They're here.
Bella, it's a trick!
Stop!
You gotta come with me!
(BELLA GRUNTS)
They won't hurt me.
If a Cullen is back here, this is their territory.
Treaty says we can only defend on our own lands.
-l can't protect you here.
-Okay.
That's okay.
You don't have to.
You're about to cross a line.
Then don't draw one.
Please?
(BELLA GASPS)
Alice?
-Oh, my God!
What are you...
-Bella!
I'm sorry, I just, I can't believe you're here.
Is...
Would you like to explain to me how you're alive?
What?
I saw a vision of you.
You jumped off a cliff.
Why in the hell would you try and kill yourself?
I mean, what about Charlie?
-What about...
-l didn't try to kill myself.
I was cliff jumping.
Recreationally.
It was fun.
(EXHALES) I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy.
Does...
Did you tell him?
No.
He only calls in once every few months.
He said he wants to be alone.
Bella, what is that God-awful wet dog smell?
Um...
That's probably me.
Or it's Jacob.
Jacob who?
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.
Bella!
Werewolves are not good company to keep.
Speak for yourself.
I had to see you were safe.
I thought you couldn't protect me here.
Guess I don't care.
Well, I'm not gonna hurt her.
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.
I'm talking about the other bloodsucker who tried to kill Bella because of you.
Victoria?
Yeah, Victoria's been around.
I didn't see her.
I didn't see you get pulled out of the water, either.
I can't see past you and your pack of mutts.
Don't get me upset...
-Hey, stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
-...or things are gonna get very ugly.
I'll give you a minute.
Hey.
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna come back,
-right?
-As soon as you put the dog out.
Is he...
Are there others?
How many Cullens are here and how long are they staying?
No.
It's just Alice.
And she can stay as long as she'd like.
Well, are the rest coming back?
No.
Not that I know of.
(BELLA SCOFFS)
Anything else?
That's it.
Well, if that's all, then you'd better go run back to Sam.
I've done it again.
I keep breaking my promise.
We don't have to do this to each other.
Yes, we do.
(SOFTLY) Bella...
(SPEAKS QUILEUTE)
(PHONE RINGING)
Swan residence.
(SIGHS)
He's not here right now.
He's arranging a funeral.
(CELL PHONE CRACKING)
Who was that?
What?
Always in the way.
Who was that?
Bella, step back.
-Jake, who was that?
-Bella!
Bella, it's Edward.
He thinks you're dead.
Rosalie told him why I came here.
Why would you...
Why didn't you let me speak to him?
-He didn't ask for you.
-Bella.
-l don't care!
-Bella.
Bella!
He's going to the Volturi.
He wants to die, too.
JACOB:
He left you, Bella.
He didn't want you anymore.
Remember?
No, I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt.
What about your dad?
I'm 1 8.
I'm legally free to go, and I left a note.
Please, Bella, just stay here.
For Charlie.
Or for me.
I have to go.
I'm begging you.
Please.
Goodbye, Jacob.
Okay.
AIRPLANE WHOOSHING)
(CAR ACCELERATING)
So you've made up your minds.
I'm afraid your particular gifts are too valuable to destroy.
But if you're unhappy with your lot, join us.
We would be delighted to utilize your skills.
Won't you consider staying with us?
You know it will happen anyway.
Not without cause.
Such a waste.
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?
I figured you wouldn't be opposed to grand theft auto.
Not today.
What?
What do you see?
They refused him.
-So?
-He's gonna make a scene.
-Show himself to the humans.
-No!
When?
ALICE:
He's gonna wait until noon, when the sun's at its highest.
(GRUNTS)
God, Alice, you got to hurry up.
There's Volterra.
(HORN HONKING)
(TIRES SQUEALING)
(HONKING CONTINUES)
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
-Why are they all in red?
-San Marco's Day festival.
They're commemorating the expulsion of vampires from the city.
It's the perfect setting.
The Volturi will never let him get far enough to reveal himself.
(PANTING) We have five minutes.
I know, Bella, just breathe.
(HORN HONKING)
Alice!
Bella, you're the only one he can't see coming.
If I go, he'll read my thoughts.
He'll think I'm lying.
He'll rush into it.
-Where do I go?
-He'll be under the clock tower.
Go!
(CROWD CHANTING)
(BELL TOLLS)
Don't!
(BELLA PANTING)
Heaven.
You have to move.
Open your eyes.
Look at me.
I'm alive.
You have to move.
Bella.
-You're here.
-I'm here.
You're alive.
Yes.
I needed to make you see me once.
You had to know that I was alive, that you didn't have to feel guilty about anything.
I can let you go now.
I never acted out of guilt.
I just couldn't live in a world where you don't exist.
-But you said...
-l lied.
I had to lie.
But you believed me so easily.
Because it doesn't make sense for you to love me.
I mean, I'm nothing.
I'm human.
I'm nothing.
Bella, you're everything to me.
You're everything.
(GATE OPENS)
I won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen.
Aro wants to speak with you again.
No rules were broken.
Nonetheless, we should take this conversation to a more appropriate venue.
Fine.
Bella, why don't you go and enjoy the rest of the festival?
The girl comes with us.
No.
You can go to hell.
(LOCK BREAKS)
Come on, guys.
It's a festival.
You wouldn't want to make a scene.
We wouldn't.
Enough.
Jane.
Aro sent me to see what was taking so long.
Just do as she says.
Go ahead.
Don't be scared.
Are you?
No.
(JANE SCOFFS)
(OPERA PLAYING)
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
-Is she human?
-Yes.
Does she know?
Yes.
Then, why would...
She wants to be.
And so she will be.
Or dessert.
ALEC:
Sister.
They send you out to get one and you bring back two.
And a half.
Such a clever girl.
What a happy surprise!
Bella is alive after all.
Isn't that wonderful?
I love a happy ending.
ARO:
Ah.
(GASPS)
They are so rare.
(GASPS)
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
Her blood appeals to you so much it makes me thirsty.
How can you stand to be so close to her?
-It's not without difficulty.
-Yes, I can see that.
ARO CHUCKLING)
Aro can read every thought I've ever had with one touch.
And now you know everything.
So get on with it.
You are quite a soul reader yourself, Edward.
Though you can't read Bella's thoughts.
Fascinating.
I would love to see if you are an exception to my gifts, as well.
Would you do me the honor?
Interesting.
Hmm.
I see nothing.
I wonder if...
Let us see if she's immune to all our powers.
Shall we, Jane?
-No!
-Pain.
(GROANS)
BELLA:
Stop!
Stop!
Please!
Stop!
(GRUNTS) Stop!
Just stop hurting him!
Please!
Please!
Jane?
Master?
(GASPS)
Go ahead, my dear.
This may hurt just a little.
(LAUGHING EXCITEDLY)
Remarkable!
She confounds us all.
So what do we do with you now?
You already know what you're going to do, Aro.
She knows too much.
She's a liability.
Hmm.
That's true.
Felix?
EDWARD:
No!
(GASPS)
Please!
No!
No!
Please, please!
Kill me!
Kill me!
Not him.
How extraordinary.
You would give up your life for someone like us.
A vampire.
A soulless monster.
Just get away from her!
You don't know a thing about his soul.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
This is a sadness.
If only it were your intention to give her immortality.
Wait!
Bella will be one of us.
I've seen it.
I'll change her myself.
Mesmerizing.
To see what you have seen before it has happened.
Your gifts will make for an intriguing immortal,
Isabella.
Go now.
Make your preparations.
Let us be done with this.
Heidi will arrive any moment.
Thank you for your visit.
CAIUS:
We will return the favor.
I would advise that you follow through on your promise soon.
We do not offer second chances.
ARO:
Goodbye, my young friends.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
DEMETRI:
Nice fishing, Heidi.
Yes, they do look rather juicy.
Save some for me.
HEIDI:
This way, please.
Stay together.
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
(GASPING)
(SCREAMS ECHOING)
Stop!
Stop!
You're here.
You can sleep.
I'll still be here when you wake up.
Bella, the only reason I left was because I thought I was protecting you.
I needed you to have a chance at a normal, happy life.
It was so easy for you to leave.
Leaving you was the hardest thing I've done in 1 00 years.
(SIGHING)
And I swear, I will never fail you again.
I'm so sorry.
-Charlie's coming.
-Hey.
You okay?
I'm fine.
Dad, you don't have to worry.
You know, last time you said that, you took off.
I didn't see you for three days.
I'm really sorry, Dad.
Bella, do not ever do that to me again.
Ever.
And you're grounded for the rest of your life.
Okay.
I'm not technically breaking any of his rules.
He did say I couldn't take a step inside the door.
I came in through the window.
He's not gonna forgive me easily.
I know.
Can you?
I hope you can, 'cause I honestly don't know how to live without you.
Come here.
Once Alice changes me, you can't get rid of me.
She won't need to change you.
There are always ways to keep the Volturi in the dark.
No.
No.
You all know what I want.
And I know how much I'm asking for.
The only thing that I can think of for it to be fair is to just vote.
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-Shut up.
Alice?
I already consider you my sister.
-Yes.
-Thank you.
JASPER:
I vote "yes."
It would be nice to not want to kill you all the time.
Hmm.
ROSALIE:
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry to both of you for how I've acted, and I'm really grateful that you were brave enough to go and save my brother.
But this isn't a life I would have chosen for myself.
And I wish that there'd been someone to vote "no" for me.
So, no.
I vote "Hell, yeah."
And we can pick a fight with these Volturi some other way.
I already consider you a part of the family.
Yes.
(DR. CULLEN SIGHS)
Why are you doing this to me?
You know what this means.
You've chosen not to live without her, which leaves me no choice.
I won't lose my son.
BELLA:
I'll wait until after graduation to make it easier on Charlie.
Edward, I want you to be the one to do it.
(TIRES SCREECH)
He wants to talk to me.
JACOB:
So you're still alive for now.
EDWARD:
He thinks it's me keeping you away.
JACOB:
You stay the hell out of my head.
Jacob, I know you have something to say to me.
But I want to say something to you first, if that's all right.
Thank you.
Thank you for keeping Bella alive when I didn't.
No.
You didn't.
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.
I'm still grateful.
But I'm here now.
I'm not gonna leave her side until she orders me away.
We'll see.
Hey, my turn to talk.
I'm here to remind you about a key point in the treaty.
I haven't forgotten.
What key point?
If any of them bites a human, the truce is over.
But if I choose it, it has nothing to do with you.
No.
No, I won't let you.
You're not gonna be one of them, Bella.
It's not up to you.
You know what we'll do to you.
I won't have a choice.
Bella, please, come.
Wait.
Is he gonna hurt me?
Read his mind.
Jake,
I love you.
(JACOB BREATHES DEEPLY)
So, please,
don't make me choose,
'cause it'll be him.
It's always been him.
Bella...
-Goodbye, Jacob.
-No, you don't speak for her!
(GROWLING)
(ROARS)
Bella, get out of here.
BELLA:
Stop!
Stop!
You can't hurt each other without hurting me.
Jake.
He's right.
You shouldn't become what I am.
I can't do this alone.
Then, please, just wait.
Just give me five years.
That's too long.
(SIGHS)
Then three?
You're so stubborn.
What are you waiting for?
I have one condition if you want me to do it myself.
What's the condition?
And then forever.
That's what I'm asking.
Marry me, Bella.

Let me give my love to you
Let me take your hand
As we walk in the dimming light
Oh, darling, understand
That everything, everything ends
Meet me on your best behavior
Meet me at your worst
For there will be no stone unturned
Or bubble left to burst
Let me lay beside you, darling
Let me be your man
And let our bodies intertwine
But always understand
That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything, everything ends
A window
An opened tomb
The sun crawls
Across your bedroom
A halo
A waiting room
Your last breaths
Moving through you
As everything, everything ends
As everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything ends
Meet me on the equinox
Meet me halfway
When the sun is perched at its highest peak
In the middle of the day
Let me give my love to you
Let me take your hand
And as we walk in the dimming light
Oh, darling, understand
That everything, everything ends
These violent delights have violent ends...
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder...
Which, as they kiss, consume...
Gran?
Edward, don't!
She will see you.
Okay.
Grandma, I would like you to meet...
Happy birthday, Bella.
Happy birthday, Bells.
I thought we agreed, no presents.
Well, the one from me is not wrapped.
So, don't count.
It's actually great.
Thanks, Dad.
Uh, goes with this one from your mom.
We coordinated.
Well, she coordinated me.
It's to put your pictures in, from senior year.
Senior year.
How'd you get so old so fast?
- I didn't.
It's not that old.
- I don't know.
Is that a grey hair?
No!
No way!
Happy Birthday.
It's really funny.
Another missing hiker brings the total to three presumed deaths.
The Rangers are searching for the killer animal...
Oh, it's Bella.
Bella!
Today is the big day, Bella.
Uh, R and J essay due?
- Oh, yeah!
Wherefore art thou, Bella?
I want to take a picture of you guys.
My Mom wants me to put together, like a scrapbook full of memories.
- Oh, of course, yeah.
I take them, I'm not in them.
- No, no, no, come here.
You'll Photoshop my nose if it looks big, right?
Don't worry, I'm in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.
It's good.
Oh, good.
Cullen's here.
Well, catch you later.
Happy birthday.
- Don't remind me.
Bella, your birth is definitely something to celebrate.
But my aging is not.
- Your aging?
I think 18 is all youngster, don't worry about that.
It's one year older than you.
No, it isn't.
I'm a hundred and nine.
- Wow!
Maybe I should not be dating such an old man.
It's gross!
I should feel certainly repulse.
We have to go to class.
- Yeah.
Wait a second.
Someone wants you.
Bella.
- Jacob!
I'll leave you to talk.
Hello, biceps!
You know, anabolic steroids are really bad for you.
Well, I'm just filling out, Bella.
You know, wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more.
We should switch schools.
Then you can come hang out with the pale faces.
I'm alright.
I prefer the Res school's exclusivity.
They let any old rift raft into this place.
I see.
Why are you summing it?
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.
You should really come, take a ride, when it's done.
Is it fast?
- Huh, it's decent.
Okay.
- Okay, good.
Hey, happy birthday.
Your Dad told my Dad.
So...
Yeah, of course, he did.
I saw this the other day and thought of you.
It catches bad dreams.
It's perfect.
Thank you.
- No problem.
See you soon.
Bye.
- Yeah, see you later.
So, how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?
Because I have nothing to give back to you.
Bella, you give me everything just by breathing.
See?
Thank you.
That's all I want.
Bella!
Happy Birthday!
- Shhh!
I thought, I said you, no presents.
I've already seen you open it and guess what?
You love it!
You're goanna wear it tonight, our house.
Come on, please?
It will be fun.
Okay. alright.
- Great!
Okay, I'll see you at 7:00.
Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing.
Sorry, Bella.
Happy...
Never mind.
You can't trust vampires.
Trust me!
O, my love!
My wife!
Death that hath sucked the honey of thy breath.
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Thou art not conquered.
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks.
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
I hate being celebrated.
There are worse tragedies.
Him, look at Romeo.
He kills his true love out of sheer stupidity.
Yeah.
Though I do envy him, one thing.
Juliet.
She's like perfect.
If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.
No, not the girl, dear.
The suicide.
It's nearly impossible for some people.
For humans, a little poison a dagger to the heart...
So many different options.
Why would you say that?
Because I considered it once.
I didn't know, if I'd get to you in time.
I had to come up with some kind of plan.
And what was the plan?
I would go to Italy, ...and provoke the Volturi.
The what?
- The Volturi...
Now, who would like to repeat the last few lines... just to show, they were paying attention?
Mr. Cullen.
Oh, yes, Mr. Birdy.
O, here.
Will I set up my everlasting rest,
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.
Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your last embrace!
And lips, O you, the doors of breath, ...seal with a righteous kiss.
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
Eyes on the screen, people.
Thus with a kiss I die.
The Volturi are a very old, very powerful family.
I guess, the closest thing to royalty my world has.
Is that Carlisle?
- Yeah.
He lived with them for a few decades.
Described them as very refined.
No respect for human life, of course, but respect for the arts and science as at least.
And the law above all of law.
And vampires have laws?
Not very many.
There's only one and it's regularly enforced.
What is it?
To keep the existence of our kind a secret.
We don't make spectacles of ourselves,
And we don't kill conspicuously.
Unless, of course, you want to die.
We have to talking about that.
I can't even think about someone hurting you.
Bella, the only thing that can hurt me is you.
And I don't have anything else to be afraid of.
That's not true.
Victoria?
She will come for me one day.
Alice will see what she decides and we will be ready.
- I can protect you.
If you change me.
Bella, you already do protect me.
You're my only reason to stay alive, if that's what I am.
But it's my job to protect you.
From everyone except my sister.
It's time!
It's time!
It's time!
It's time!
Sorry about all this.
We tried to rein Alice in.
Like it's even possible.
Happy big Birthday, Bella!
- Thanks.
I found it in your bag, mind?
Dating an older woman?
Hot!
What?
You first, Rosalie.
It's a necklace.
Alice picked it up.
- Thanks.
Show me the love!
This is from Emmett.
Already installed it in your truck.
Finally, a decent sound system for that piece of...
Hey, don't... don't hate the truck.
Open Esme and Carlisle's.
Just a little something to brighten your day.
We think, you looking kind of pale lately.
Paper cut.
Jas...
Jas!
It's okay.
It's just a little blood.
Get Jasper out of here.
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry, I can't.
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.
Check on Jasper.
I'm sure, he's very upset with himself.
And I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.
Edward?
I never wanted that party.
- It's not your fault.
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.
How do you do it?
Years and years of practice.
Did you ever think it of just doing it the easier way?
No.
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.
Brings me happiness.
Even if I'm damned about this.
Damned?
Like...
like hell?
Carlisle, you can't be damned.
You couldn't, it's impossible.
Thank you, Bella.
You always been very gracious about us.
So, that's it?
That's why he won't change me?
Imagine the situation in reverse.
If you believed as Edward does would you take away his soul?
You can't protect me.
From everything.
At some point, something's goanna separate us.
It's goanna be an accident, ...or illness, ...or old age.
As long as I'm human.
And the only solution is to change me.
That's not a solution, it's a tragedy.
You're not goanna love me when I look like a grandmother.
Bella, do you not understand my feelings for you?
No?
Carlisle told me how you feel about your soul.
I don't believe that.
So don't worry about mine.
You should go inside.
It's still my birthday.
Can I ask one thing?
Kiss me?
I love you.
I love you.
Hi.
Come for a walk with me.
We got to leave Forks.
Why?
Carlisle's supposed to be ten years older than he looks.
People are starting to notice.
Okay, I...
I got to think of something to say to Charlie.
When you say "we"...
I mean to my family and myself.
Edward, what happened with Jasper, ...it's nothing.
- You're right.
It was nothing.
Nothing the way I always expected.
And nothing compared to what could have happened.
You just don't belong to my world, Bella.
I belong with you.
No, you don't.
I'm coming.
Bella.
I don't want you to come.
You don't want me?
No.
This changes things.
alright.
But if it's not too much to ask can you at least promise me something?
Don't do anything reckless.
For Charlie's sake.
And I'll promise something to you in return.
This is the last time you'll ever see me.
I won't come back.
And you can go on with your life without any interference from me.
It will be like...
I never existed, I promise.
If this is about my soul, take it.
I don't want without you.
- It's not about your soul.
You're just not good for me.
I'm not good enough for you?
I'm just sorry, I let this go on for so long.
Please don't.
Goodbye.
Edward?
Edward!
Edward!
I'll try to call Cullen's place again.
The Cullen's left town, Charlie.
- Good riddance!
Where did they go?
We'll find her, Charlie.
- Thanks, Harry.
Charlie?
She's alright.
I got her.
Thank you, Sam.
Alice, ...you have disappeared.
Like everything else.
But who else can I talk to?
I'm lost.
When you left... and he left...
You took everything with you.
But the absence of him is everywhere I look...
It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest.
But in a way I'm glad.
The pain is my only reminder that he was real that you all were.
alright, that's it.
What?
You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother.
I'm not leaving Forks.
Bells he's not coming back.
I know.
It's just not normal, this behaviour.
Quite frankly, it's scaring the hell out me, ...and you Mother.
Baby, I...
I don't want you to leave.
I don't.
But... just go...
Go to Jacksonville, make some new friends...
I like my old friends.
- Well, you never see them anymore.
I do, yeah.
I'm goanna go shopping tomorrow, with Jessica.
You hate shopping.
I...
I need a girl's night out.
alright.
Girl's night.
Shopping.
I like it, go.
Buy some good stuff.
Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.
Oh, yeah, Bella Swan.
I don't know, why you want to sit through all those zombies eating people, ...and no hot guys kissing anybody.
It's gross.
Like why there are so many zombie movies anyway?
Is it supposed to like draw a parallel with leprosy?
My cousin had leprosy, it's not funny, you know?
And like is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism?
Because don't be so pleased with your own like self-reverential cleverness, you know?
Like, some girls like to shop.
Not all girls, apparently.
I was surprised you called at all, you know?
Like, your depression thing.
I'm totally... totally worried.
After a while, it's like, she's still bumming?
And I'm going through stuff too, you know?
Like Mike deciding he wanted to "I just be friends? "
That's hard, you know?
What's up, guys?
Where you going?
Keep walking.
This is dangerous.
Dude, come on.
I think, I know those guys.
Well, they seem great.
Can we go?
I just need to see something.
Hey, girlie!
alright, alright!
We got a taker.
Turn around.
Sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
That's cool!
I'll be whomever you want to be, honey.
So, what do you say?
You promised me nothing reckless.
You promised, it would as you never existed.
You lied.
- Say some, babe?
You know what?
Never mind.
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Hey, um, what the hell is wrong with you?
Just curious.
I thought that I saw something.
You're insane, actually.
Or suicidal.
That homeboy could have been a psycho.
I was about to end up in a FBI interview room, ...like some lame TV show.
Oh, that was such a rush.
Awesome!
So, you're an adrenaline junky now?
That's cool!
You can go bungee jumping.
You don't get on the back of some random loser's motorcycle!
Crazy!
Alice, I saw him.
Maybe I'm crazy now, but I guess that's okay.
If the rush of danger is what it takes to see him then that's what I'll find.
Bella!
Where the hell have you been, crazy?
I... brought you something.
- Okay.
It's a little crazy.
Wow, scrap metal!
You shouldn't have.
- I saved them from the junkyard.
I think, they'll probably cost more to fix than they're worth.
...but then I thought that... if I had a mechanic-type friend to help me out,
Huh, me?
Being the mechanic-type friend?
- That's right.
Since when are you into motorcycles?
- Since now.
I get it if you think this is really stupid and reckless.
Yeah, it's completely stupid and reckless.
When do we start?
Now.
Please.
- alright.
Oh, hey, be careful.
These things are actually really heavy.
So,
Jacob, you're like buff.
How that can happen?
You're like 16, I don't get it.
Age is just a number, baby.
What, you're like 40, now?
Feels like that sometimes.
That song was good.
You don't like it?
I don't really like music anymore kind of...
Okay.
No more music.
I was thinking, if we're goanna do this every day, ...and hopefully we will...
We have to, like, fit some homework in there somewhere.
I don't want Billy thinking that I'm a bad influence on you.
You influence me?
Please.
Are you...?
I'm older than you.
So that makes me the influencer and you the influence.
No, no, no.
My size and knowledge base actually makes me older than you.
Because of your gentle paleness and lack of know-how.
I convinced you to build two-wheeled death machines with me.
Don't you think that makes you funny, young and naive?
Okay.
So, where do we stand?
I'm thirty five and you might be like 32.
- Come on.
Jake, you in there?
- No, it's okay.
It's...
It's just my boys.
Hey, Jake.
- Hey.
Guys, this is Bella.
Bella, that's Quill and Embry.
I'm Quill Ateara.
So the bike building story is true.
Oh, yeah, yeah!
I taught him everything he knows.
What about the part where you're his girlfriend?
Uh, we're friends, you know?
- Hmm.
Burn!
Actually, I remember, I said she's a girl and a friend.
Embry, do you remember him making that distinction?
Nope!
So you guys have girlfriends.
It's awesome.
Yeah, right.
Quill's actually taken his cousin to prom.
Yeah, that's still a riot.
You want funny, Black?
I'll give you funny.
Jesus!
I got five bucks on Quill.
- You're on.
Dear Alice, I wish, I had your real address.
I wish, I could tell you about Jake.
He makes me feel better.
I mean, he makes me feel alive.
The hole in my chest while when I'm with Jake,
It's like, it almost healed.
For a while.
Quill keeps asking to come over.
I think he likes you a little too much.
Oh, I'm really not into the whole cougar thing, you know?
What's up with you and age?
I mean, how old was that Cullen guy anyway?
But even Jake can't keep the dreams away.
Hey, Bella!
You're alright.
You're okay?
- No.
I thought this thing was starting to work, ...but I guess not.
Can I ask you something?
Hanging out with Jacob does seems to take your mind off things for a bit, doesn't it?
You know, sometimes you got to learn to love what's good for you.
You know, what I mean?
Of course, what do I know?
I'm just a terminal bachelor.
Famous ladies man.
Okay...
Go to bed.
I love you.
If I told you, ...I couldn't have fixed these bikes, what would you say?
Are you doubting your mad skills?
No, definitely not.
I mean, they're all fine.
It's just...
May be if I was smarter would have dragged out to rebuild them.
If you told me, you couldn't fix these bikes.
I would say that that's really too bad but he's goanna find something else to do.
Is that Sam Utley?
Yeah, and his cult.
Oh, my God!
Did you see that?
They're not really fighting, Bella.
They're cliff diving.
Scary as hell, but a total rush.
Rush?
- Most of us jump from lower down.
We'll leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples.
Is some kind of beef with them or something?
Oh, no.
They just think they run this place.
Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids.
Now, look at him.
- That's Embry?
Yeah.
- What happened to him?
He missed some school and all of a sudden started following Sam around like a little puppy.
Same thing with Paul and Jared.
Sam keeps giving me this look, ...like he's waiting for me or something.
It's kind of starting to freak me out.
Well, you should just avoid him.
I'll try.
Okay.
You look scared.
- I'm not.
Alright!
Brake.
Clutch.
Good.
Gas.
Ready?
Now slowly... release the clutch.
Bella.
Stop.
You alright?
I'm goanna go again.
Hit the brake!
I want to go again.
- Are you trying to get yourself killed?
I'll try again.
- No, forget it.
No more bikes.
Man, your head.
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
You're apologizing for bleeding?
Yeah, I guess, I am.
It's just blood, Bella.
No big deal.
What are you staring at?
You're sort of beautiful.
How hard did you hit your head?
I don't know.
Let's go.
I did see something in the woods.
- Sure, baby, I believe you.
No, he doesn't.
He's just trying to get lucky.
It was jet black and huge.
On all fours, it was still taller than a person.
A bear, may be?
Or an alien.
You're lucky that you didn't get probed.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I saw it.
You're not the only one.
My Dad's been getting reports at the station.
Like five hikers been killed by some bear.
But they can't find the bear.
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.
So, I mean...
Bella is back.
Yeah, I guess so.
- Huh, that's...
Welcome.
So listen, not now that...
You know, you're talking and eating again, you know?
You got to get that protein in there.
I was just wondering, if you wanted to go see a movie with me.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, I do.
Cool, um, let me see...
We could check out "Love spelled backwards is love. "
Yeah, it's a dumb title, but, um, it's a romantic comedy.
I mean, it's supposed to be.
- No.
No romance.
How about "Face Punch"?
You heard of that?
Well, it's an action movie.
- Yeah, it's perfect.
With guns... adrenaline it's my thing
- Okay.
We should get a bunch of people to go.
Do you guys want to go see "Face Punch"?
- "Face Punch"?
Yeah!
Mike, hey, we were supposed to watch that?
Remember the trailer's like...
- Yeah?
Punch his face in.
- I don't remember that.
Movie night with Bella!
So, "Face Punch", huh?
You like action movies?
Not really.
I heard it sucks.
Bad.
Hey, are you even old enough to see this movie?
I mean, you know, without adult supervision?
- Right, yeah.
Well, she's buying my ticket for me.
- She's buying it, okay.
Jessica bailed and Angela's got the stomach flu ...so Eric's taking care of her.
So, it's just us three.
- Great.
Great.
- Yeah.
Put the gun down.
Put your gun down or I'm goanna blow your freaking head off.
Both of you!
Put both of your guns down or I'm goanna blow both of your freaking heads off.
Alright, let's do this!
Okay, I think I'm goanna throw up!
Jesus!
- What a marshmallow!
You should hold out for someone with a stronger stomach.
Someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit.
Yeah, I'll keep my eye open for that.
I feel bad.
He probably has that flu that's going around.
What?
I can't hold your hand?
- No, of course, you can.
I just think it means something really different to you.
So...
Okay, tell me something.
You like me, right?
And you think, I'm sort beautiful?
Jake, please...
don't do this.
Why?
Because you are about to ruin everything.
And I need you.
Well, I've got loads of time.
I'm not goanna give up.
I don't want you to.
But...
It's just because I don't want you to go anywhere.
It's... it's really selfish.
You know, I'm not like a car that you can fix up.
I'm never goanna run right.
So I should be fair to you.
It's because of him, right?
Look, I know what he did to you.
But, Bella, I would never, ever do that.
I won't ever hurt you.
I promise.
I won't let you down.
You can count on me.
Well...
I need to go home.
I'm...
I was feeling sick before the movie, okay?
What is your problem?
- Right now?
You are my problem.
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.
Do you want me to put you in the hospital?
Jake...
Jake, the movie's over.
What are you doing?
Jake, you're really hot.
Like, you feel like you have a fever.
Are you okay?
I don't know what's happening.
I got to go.
That dude is weird.
Jake.
Uh, your Dad says you have mono.
He won't let me visit but...
would you call me?
Hey, uh, it's me again.
I just...
I'm sorry about what I said at the movie theatre.
I just wanted to hear your voice.
So, no pressure.
Jacob, please call me.
Okay, we should be back around three.
Hey!
Look, I don't have to go fishing today.
- Yes, you do.
Yeah, you do.
Go.
What are you talking about?
Just be careful.
- I always am.
Those bears won't get the drop on me, Bella.
My kung foo is strong.
Jake!
You cut your hair?
And got a tattoo?
Bella...
I thought you were too sick to come outside.
Or pick up the phone when I'd call.
Go away.
- What?
Go away.
What happened to you?
What's wrong?
Hey, what happened?
Did Sam get to you?
Is that what's happening?
Sam's trying to help me, don't blame him.
But if you want somebody to blame,
How about those filthy bloodsuckers, you love?
The Cullen's.
I don't know what are you talking about.
You know exactly what I'm talking about.
You been lying to everyone.
Charlie...
But you can't lie to me.
Not anymore, Bella.
- Come on!
Jacob!
Look, Bella...
We can't be friends anymore.
Jake, I know that I have been hurting you.
It's... it's killing me.
It kills me.
If you, may be, give me like some time.
Don't!
It's not you.
It's not you, it's me, right?
Really?
It's true!
It is me.
I'm not good.
I used to be... a great kid.
Not anymore.
It doesn't even matter, alright?
This is over.
You can't break up with me.
I mean...
I mean, you're my best friend.
You promised me.
I know.
I promised that I won't hurt you, Bella.
And this is me keeping that promise.
Go home.
And don't come back.
Or you're goanna get hurt.
Alice...
Things are...
Things are bad again.
Without Jake, I just...
I can't stand it.
I don't see Edward anymore.
Now it really feels like he never existed.
I will find a place where I can see him again.
Bella.
- Laurent!
I didn't expect to find you here.
I went to visit the Cullen's, but...
the house is empty.
I'm surprised they left you behind.
Weren't you sort of a, um, ...a pet of theirs?
Yeah.
You could say that.
Do they Cullen's visit often?
Lie.
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.
- Lie better.
I'll tell them that you stopped by.
I probably shouldn't tell to Edward.
Because he's pretty protective.
- But he's far away, isn't he?
Why are you here?
I came as a favour to Victoria.
Victoria?
She asked me to see if you were still under the protection of the Cullen's.
Victoria feels it's only fair to kill Edwards mate given he killed hers.
An eye for an eye.
Threaten him.
- Edward would know who did it!
And he'd come after you.
I don't think he will.
After all, how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected?
Victoria won't be happy about me killing you.
But I can't help myself.
You're so mouth-watering.
- Please, don't!
I mean, you'd helped us.
- Shhhh!
Don't be afraid.
I'm doing you a kindness.
Victoria plans on killing you slowly, painfully, ...whereas I'll make it quick.
I promise.
You will feel nothing.
Edward, I love you.
I don't believe it.
Dad, I saw them!
What's the matter?
- In the woods.
They are not bears!
What you mean in the woods?
Bella, what the hell were you doing out in the woods?
They are wolves.
I mean, they're like huge wolves!
Are you sure about that, Bella?
- Yeah, I just saw them.
They were after... something.
Wolves?
You saw?
Alright.
Well, Harry, ...feel like going hunting?
Can you get some of your guys together?
Sure, yeah.
I'll...
I'll just...
I know that those wolves will be dead.
And Laurent would have told her I'm unprotected.
Victoria.
I should go to the station.
Dad, you should...
You should go.
You can just stay in the house?
Bella!
Oh, you scared me.
What the hell are you doing?
- Back up.
I'm coming up.
Look, look, I'm sorry.
For what?
- I wish I could explain, ...but I literally... can't!
Have you ever had a secret you couldn't tell anyone?
One that wasn't yours to share.
Well, that's what it's like for me.
Or worse.
You have no idea, how tight I'm bounded.
I hate this.
I hate what they have done to you.
I mean, the killer part is you already know!
Bella, do you remember, when walked on the beach in La Push?
The stop...
The story...
The story about the cold ones.
I guess, I understand why that's the only part you remember.
There must got to be something You can do...
No.
I'm in it for life.
May be we should just get out of here for a while.
We'll just leave.
Just you and me.
You can do that?
I'll do it for you.
It's not something I can just run away from, Bella.
But I would run away with you.
If I could.
I got to go.
They'll certainly wonder where I am.
Come here.
Please...
Try to remember.
It would be so much easier if you knew...
I tried, but...
Jake.
Jake, what are you doing?
Wait, Jake.
Jake!
Edward, I'm scared.
You should be.
Really it's just like an old story...
That we're not supposed to say anything about...
Did you know, the Quileute are supposed to be descendants from wolves?
Bella.
I need to see him.
He's not in.
I'm sorry, really need to see him.
- Bella?
What did you do?
Okay, what did you do?
- Hey!
What did you do to him?
- Easy!
He didn't want this!
- But we do.
What did he do?
What did he tell you?
- Both of you calm...
Nothing!
He told me nothing, because he's scared of you!
Too late, now.
- Bella, get back.
Paul, calm down now.
Bella!
Run!
Jake, run!
Take Bella back to Emily's place.
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.
Alice...
Is it possible that everything is true?
The fairy tales and horror stories?
Is it possible that there isn't anything sane and normal at all?
Hey, I think, we should go back and see if Jacob's okay.
I hope Paul gets some teeth in him.
Serve him right.
No way.
Jake's a natural.
You see him phase on the fly?
I got to fiver says, Paul doesn't touch him.
Come on in, Bella.
We won't bite.
Speak for yourself.
Oh, hey, about Emily...
Sam's fiancé, ...don't stare.
It bugs him.
Why would I stare?
You guys hungry?
Like I have to ask...
Who's this?
Bella Swan.
Who else?
So, you're the vampire girl.
So, you're the wolf girl.
Guess so.
Well, I'm engaged to one.
Save some for your brothers.
And the ladies first.
Muffin?
- Sure.
Thanks.
Leave it to Jake up to find a way around Sam's gag order.
He didn't say anything to me.
- That's a wolf thing.
Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want to or not.
Alright, check it out!
We can hear each other's thoughts.
Will you just shut up?
These are trade secrets.
Damn it!
This chick runs with vampires.
I can't really run with vampires.
Because they are fast.
Yeah?
Oh, we are faster.
Freaked out yet?
You're not the first monsters, I met.
Jake's right.
You are good with the weird.
Sorry.
So you're a werewolf?
Yeah, last time I checked.
A few lucky members of the tribe that have the gene.
If a bloodsucker moves into town, and the fever sets in.
Mono?
Yeah, I wish.
You can't find a way to stop?
I mean it's wrong.
It's not a life-style choice, Bella.
I was born this way, I can't help it.
You are such a hypocrite.
What, I'm not the right kind of monster for you?
It's not what you are.
It's what you do.
They never hurt anybody.
You killed people, Jake.
Bella, we're not killing anyone.
Then, who is?
We're trying to protect you people from them.
The only thing we do kill.
Vampires.
Jake, you can't...
Don't worry, we can't touch your little precious Cullen's.
Unless they violate the Treaty.
It's not what I'm saying.
You can't kill vampires, though.
They will kill you.
- Really?
We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough.
Laurent?
And his redhead girlfriend is next.
Vic...
Victoria is here?
- Was.
We chased her all the way to the Canadian border the other night.
But she keeps coming back.
We don't know what she's after.
- I do.
Me.
Don't worry, we've got this place covered.
She won't get near you or Charlie.
But you got to be careful.
She's fast, you don't know, how fast she is.
You know, your lack of confidence in us is a little insulting.
Alright, I better go.
And you got to go.
- Yeah.
I got a vampire to kill.
Alice, I'm alright.
Until I'm alone.
And lately, that's all the time.
Jacob's gone, he's hunting for Victoria.
And Charlie is hunting Jacob.
And you're gone.
And so is Edward.
And I just have nothing now.
You got something, Harry?
Nope, nothing.
But I realize where I have to go,
What I have to do to see him again.
Don't do this.
You wanted me to be human.
Watch me.
Please?
For me?
You won't stay with me any other way.
Bella.
Please.
Breathe!
Breathe!
Come on, Bella.
Breathe.
Bella?
Bella, can you hear me?
Jake.
What the hell were you thinking, huh?
I just needed to see something.
Take her home.
I'm goanna go help over at Harry's place.
What happened at Harry's?
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.
Charlie and my Dad are at Harry's place with his family.
Is he okay?
- He's gone.
Come on, I'll give you something to dry and drive you home.
Hundred and eight degrees over here.
God!
My hands are freezing.
It must be nice, never getting cold.
It's a wolf thing.
- It's not.
It's a Jacob thing.
You're just warm.
You're like, your own sun.
This is better.
Now that you know about me.
But...?
You saw what happened to Emily.
Sam got angry, ...lost it for a split second Em was standing too close.
He will never be able to take that back.
What if I get mad at you?
Sometimes...
I feel like, I'm goanna disappear.
You need not hear it from me.
But I always will.
You're not goanna lose yourself.
I won't let that happen.
How?
I'll tell you all the time.
How special you are.
Thank you for everything.
Wait!
There's a vampire.
- How do you know?
I can smell it.
I'm getting you out.
That's Carlisle's car!
They're here.
Bella, it's a trick.
Stop!
You got to come with me.
They won't hurt me.
If a Cullen is back here, this is their territory.
The treaty says we can only defend our own lands.
I can't protect you here.
- Okay, it's okay.
You don't have to.
You're about to cross a line.
- Then don't draw one.
Please.
Alice!
- You're dead!
Bella?
- What are you...?
I'm sorry, I just...
I can't believe you're here.
Is...
Is...?
Would you like to explain to me how you're alive?
What?
- I saw a vision of you.
You jumped off a cliff.
Why in the hell would you try and kill yourself?
I mean, what about Charlie?
What about...?
- I didn't try to kill myself.
I was cliff jumping.
Recreationally!
It was fun.
I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy.
Did you... did you tell him?
- No.
He only calls once in a few months.
He said he wants to be alone.
Aw, what is that God awful wet dog smell?
That's probably me.
Or... it's Jacob.
Jacob who?
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.
Ugh!
Bella!
Werewolf's are not good company to keep!
Speak for yourself.
I had to see if you were safe.
I thought you couldn't protect me here.
Guess, I don't care.
Well, I'm not goanna hurt her.
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.
We're talking about the other bloodsucker who tried to kill Bella because of you.
Victoria?
- Yeah, Victoria has been around.
I didn't see her.
I didn't see you getting pulled out of the water either.
I can't see past you and your pack of mutts!
Don't get me upset.
- Hey, stop!
Things are goanna get very ugly!
- Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
I will give you a minute.
You're going anywhere, you're goanna come back, right?
As soon as you put the dog out.
Is he...?
Are there others?
How many Cullen's are here and how long are they staying?
No.
It's just Alice.
And she can stay as long as she like.
Are the rest coming back?
No.
Not that I know of.
Anything else?
That's it.
Well, if that's all, then you better go run back to Sam.
I have done it again.
I keep breaking my promise.
We don't have to do this to each other.
Yes, we do.
Bella...
Stay with me forever.
Swan Residence.
He's not here right now.
He's arranging a funeral.
Who is that?
What?
- Always in the way.
Who was that?
- Bella, step back.
Jacob, who was that?
- Stop.
Bella, it's Edward.
He thinks you are dead.
Rosalie told him, why I came here.
Why would you...?
Why didn't you let me speak to him?
He didn't ask for you.
- I don't care!
Bella, he's going to the Volturi.
He wants to die too.
He left you, Bella.
He didn't want you anymore, remember?
But I'm not goanna let him kill himself out of guilt.
What about your Dad?
I'm eighteen,
I'm legally free to go.
And I left a note.
Please, Bella.
Just... stay here.
Not for Charlie.
For me...
I got to go.
I'm begging you.
Please.
Bye, Jacob.
Okay.
So you made up your mind?
I'm afraid your particular gifts are too valuable to destroy.
But if you're unhappy with your lot, ...join us.
We would be delighted to utilize your skills.
Won't you consider staying with us?
You know what will happen anyway.
Not without cause.
Such a waste.
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?
I figured, you wouldn't be opposed to grand theft auto.
Not today.
What?
What are you seeing?
- They refused him.
So...?
- He's goanna make a scene.
Show himself to the humans.
- No!
When?
He's goanna wait until noon, when the sun's at its highest.
Alice, you got to hurry up.
- There's Volterra.
Why are they all in red?
- San Marcos Day festival.
They're commemorating the expulsion of the vampires from the city.
It's the perfect setting.
The Volturi will never let him get far enough to reveal himself.
We have 5 minutes.
- You know, Bella?
Breathe.
Alice?
!
Bella, you're the only one he can't see coming.
If I go, he will read my thoughts he'll think I'm lying and rush into it.
Where do I go?
- He'll be under the clock tower.
Go!
No!
Heaven.
You have to move!
Open your eyes, look at me.
I'm alive.
You have to move!
Bella?
You're here.
- Yeah.
You're alive!
Yes.
I needed you to see me once.
You had to know that I was alive.
You didn't have to feel guilty or anything.
I can let you go now.
You never had to let it go.
I just couldn't live in a world where you don't exist.
But you said...
- I lied.
I had to lie and you believe me so easily.
Because it doesn't make sense for you to love me.
I'm nothing... human.
Nothing.
Bella, you're everything to me.
Everything.
I won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen.
Aro wants to speak with you again.
No rules were broken.
Nevertheless, we should take this conversation to a more appropriate venue.
Fine.
Bella, why don't you go enjoy the rest of the festival?
The girl comes with us.
- No.
You can go to hell.
Come on, guys.
It's a festival.
We wouldn't want to make a scene.
We wouldn't.
Enough!
Jane.
Aro send me to see what's taking so long.
Just do as she says.
Go ahead.
Are you scared?
Are you?
No.
Good afternoon.
Is she human?
- Yes.
Does she know?
- Yes.
Then why would...
She wants to be...
And so she will be.
- Or dessert!
Sister, sent you out to get one and you bring back two.
And a half.
Such a clever girl.
What a happy surprise!
Bella is alive after all.
Isn't that wonderful?
I love a happy ending.
They are so rare.
"La Tua Cantante. " 'Your Singer'
Your blood appeals to you so much it makes me thirsty.
How can you stand to be so close to her?
It's not without difficulty.
- Yes, I can see that.
Aro can read every thought I ever had.
With one touch.
And now you know everything.
So, get on with it.
You're quite soul reader yourself, Edward.
Though you can't read Bella's thoughts.
Fascinating!
I would love to see if you are an exception to my gifts, as well.
Would you do me the honour?
Interesting.
I see nothing.
I wonder if...
Let's see if she is immune to all our powers.
Shall we, Jane?
No!
- Pain.
Stop!
Stop, please!
Stop!
Stop!
Just stop hurting him, please!
Please!
Jane?
Master?
Go ahead, my dear.
This may hurt just a little.
Remarkable!
She confounds us all.
So, what we do with you now?
You already know what you're going to do, Aro.
She knows too much, she's a liability.
That's true.
Felix?
Please!
No, no!
Please!
Kill me... kill me.
Not him.
How extraordinary.
You would give up your life for someone like us.
A vampire.
A soulless monster.
Just get away from him!
You don't know a thing about his soul.
Maybe it's one or the other.
This is a sadness.
If only it be your intention to give her immortality.
Wait!
Bella will be one of us.
I've seen it.
I'll change her myself.
Mesmerizing!
To see, what you have seen.
Before it is happened.
Your gifts will make for an intriguing immortal.
Isabella.
Go now.
Make your preparations.
Let's be done with this.
Heidi will arrive, any moment.
Thank you for the visit.
- We'll return the favour.
I would advise that you follow through on your promise soon.
We do not offer second chances.
Goodbye my young friends.
Nice fishing, Heidi.
Yes, they do look rather juicy.
Save some for me.
This way, please.
Stay together.
You're here.
You can sleep.
I'll still be here when you wake up.
Bella, the only reason that I left was because I thought I was protecting you.
I needed you to have a chance at a normal, happy life.
It was so easy for you to leave.
Leaving you was the hardest thing I've done in a 100 years.
I swear...
I will never fail you again.
I'm so sorry.
Charlie's coming.
- Hey!
You okay?
Fine.
Dad, you don't have to worry.
Yeah, last time you said that you took off.
I didn't see you for three days.
I'm really sorry, Dad.
Bella, do not ever do that to me again.
Ever.
And you're grounded for the rest of your life.
Okay.
I'm not technically breaking any of his rules.
He did say, I couldn't take a step inside through the door.
I came in through the window.
He's not going to forgive me easily.
I know.
Can you?
I hope you can because...
I honestly don't know how to live without you.
Come here.
Once Alice changes me, ...you can't get rid of me.
She won't need to change you.
There are always ways to keep the Volturi in the dark.
No.
No!
You all know what I want.
And I know, how much I'm asking for.
The only thing I can think of...
for it to be fair is to just vote.
You don't know what you just...
- Just... shut up!
Alice?
I already consider you my sister.
Yes!
- Thank you.
I vote, yes.
It would be nice to not want to kill you all the time.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry, both of you, for the way I've acted.
And I'm really grateful that you were brave enough to go and save my brother.
But this isn't a life I would have chosen for myself.
And I wish that there had been someone to vote no for me.
So... no.
I vote hell yeah!
We can pick a fight with these Vulture's some other way.
I already consider you, a part of the family.
Yes!
Why are you doing this to me?
You know what this means.
- You've chosen not to live without her, ...which leaves me no choice.
I won't lose my son.
I'll wait until after graduation to make it easier on Charlie.
I want you to be the one to do it.
He wants to talk to me.
See, you're still alive for now.
He thinks, it's me keeping you away.
You stay the hell out of my head.
Jacob I know you have something to say to me.
But I want to say something to you first.
If that's alright?
Thank you.
Thank you for keeping Bella alive when I didn't.
No, you didn't.
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.
I'm still grateful.
But I'm here now.
And I'm not goanna leave her side till she orders me away.
We'll see.
Hey, my turn to talk.
I'm here to remind you about a key point in the Treaty.
I haven't forgotten.
What key point?
If any of them bites a human, the truce is over.
But if I choose it, it has nothing to do with you.
No...
No, I won't let you.
You're not goanna be one of them, Bella.
It's not up to you.
You know what we'll do to you.
I won't have choice.
- Bella, please come.
Wait.
Is he goanna hurt me?
Read his mind.
Jake...
I love you.
So, please...
Don't make me choose.
Because it'll be him.
It's always been him.
Bella...
Goodbye, Jacob.
- No, you don't speak for her!
Bella, get out of here.
Stop!
Stop!
You can't hurt each other without hurting me.
Jake?
He's right.
You shouldn't become one of us.
I can't do this alone.
Then please just wait.
Just give me... five years.
It's too long.
Then, three?
You're so stubborn.
What are you waiting for?
I have one condition if you want me to do it myself.
What's the condition?
And then, forever.
That's what I'm asking.
Marry me, Bella.
BELLA: "These violent delights have violent ends,
"and in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
"which, as they kiss, consume."
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
(BELL TOLLS)
(PANTING)
Gran?
(GASPS SOFTLY)
Edward, don't!
She'll see you.
Hmm.
Okay.
(IN BELLA'S VOICE) Gran, I'd like you to meet...
(GASPS)
Happy birthday, Bella.
(GASPS)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Happy birthday.
(BELLA CLICKS TONGUE)
I thought we agreed, no presents.
Well, the one from me's not wrapped, so it doesn't count.
Thas actually great.
Thanks, Dad.
It goes with this one from your mom.
We coordinated.
Well, she coordinated me.
Is to put your pictures in from senior year.
(SIGHS) Senior year.
- How'd you get so old so fast?
- I didn't.
Is not that old.
I don't know.
Is that a gray hair?
No.
No way.
(SIGHS)
Happy birthday.
Thas really funny.
ON RADIO:
Another missing hiker brings the total to three presumed dead.
Rangers are searching for the killer animal... (SWITCHING RADIO STATION)
(MOESTRAS PLAYING)
Situation's a!
Critica!
You've got to look first before you go
ERIC:
Is Bella.
Bella!
- Hi.
- MIKE:
I'm...
JESSICA:
Today's the big day, Bella.
A and J essay due.
- Oh, yeah.
- Wherefore art thou, Bella?
ALL LAUGH)
Let me take a picture of you guys.
My mom wants me to put together, like, a scrapbook full of memories.
ERIC:
Oh.
MIKE:
Cool.
Yeah.
I take them.
I'm not in them.
- No, no, no, come here.
- BELLA:
Well, you are today.
You'll photoshop this if my nose looks big, right?
ERIC:
Don't worry, I'm in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.
BELLA:
Thas good.
Oh, good.
Cullen's here.
(ERIC CHEERS WEAKLY)
Well, talk to you later.
- Happy birthday.
- Don't remind me.
EDWARD:
Mmm.
Bella, your birth is definitely something to celebrate.
- Yeah, but my aging's not.
- Your aging?
(CHUCKLES)
I think 18 is a little young to start worrying about that.
Its one year older than you.
No, it isn't.
I'm 109.
Well, maybe I shouldn't be dating such an old man.
Is gross.
I should be thoroughly repulsed.
Uh-huh.
(BOTH SIGHING)
- We have to go to class.
- Okay.
(EDWARD MOANS SOFTLY)
Wait a second.
Someone wants you.
- JACOB:
Bella!
- Jacob!
What?
I'll leave you to talk.
Hello, biceps!
You know, anabolic steroids are really bad for you.
(JACOB LAUGHS)
Well, I'm just filling out, Bella.
You know, it wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more.
You should switch schools.
You can come hang out with the palefaces.
I'm all right.
I prefer the rez school's exclusivity.
They let any old riffraff into this place.
- I see.
Then why are you slumming it?
- Mmm-hmm.
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.
You should really come take a ride when is done.
Is it fast?
Uh.
Is decent.
(BOTH LAUGH)
- I'm kidding.
- Okay.
Good.
Hey, happy birthday.
Your dad told my dad, so...
Yeah, of course he did.
I saw this the other day and thought of you.
Catches bad dreams.
Thas kind of perfect.
Thank you.
No problem.
- Good seeing you.
- Yeah, I'll see you later.
Bye.
So how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?
Because I have nothing to give back to you.
Bella, you give me everything just by breathing.
(EXHALES)
See?
Thank you.
- Thas all I want.
- ALICE:
Bella!
- Happy birthday!
- Shh, shh!
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
I thought I said no presents.
I've already seen you open it, and guess what, you love it.
You're gonna wear it tonight.
Our place.
Come on.
Please?
Lll be fun.
- Okay.
All right.
- Great!
Okay, I'll see you at 7:00.
Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing.
(ALICE LAUGHS)
Sorry, Bella.
Happy...
Never mind.
You can't trust vampires.
Trust me.
ROMEO: (ON VIDEO) O my love!
My wife!
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Thou art not conquered.
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks.
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
BELLA:
I hate being celebrated.
EDWARD:
There are worse tragedies.
I mean, look at Romeo.
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.
BELLA:
Yeah.
Though I do envy him one thing.
BELLA:
Juliet is, like, perfect.
If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.
(EDWARD LAUGHS)
Not the girl, the suicide.
Is nearly impossible for...
For some people.
For humans, a little poison, a dagger to the heart.
There's so many different options.
Why would you say that?
Because I had to consider it once.
(BELLA SCREAMING)
I didn't know if I'd get to you in time.
I had to come up with some kind of plan.
What was the plan?
That I'd go to Italy and provoke the Volturi.
- The what?
- The Volturi.
MR. BERTY:
Now, who'd like to repeat the last few lines of iambic pentameter just to show they were paying attention?
Mr. Cullen?
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Yes, Mr. Berty.
"O here will I set up my everlasting rest
"and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.
"Eyes, look your last.
"Arms, take your last embrace!
"And, lips, O you, the doors of breath,
"seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death!"
Eyes on the screen, people.
ROMEO:
Thus with a kiss I die.
The Volturi are a very old, very powerful family.
I guess they're the closest thing to royalty my world has.
- Is that Carlisle?
- Yeah.
He lived with them for a few decades.
Described them as very refined.
No respect for human life, of course, but a respect for the arts and the sciences, at least.
And the law.
Above all, the law.
BELLA:
Vampires have laws?
EDWARD:
Not very many.
And only one thas regularly enforced.
BELLA:
What is it?
EDWARD:
That we keep the existence of our kind a secret.
We don't make spectacles of ourselves, and we don't kill conspicuously.
Unless, of course, you want to die.
(SCREAMS)
You gotta stop talking about that.
I can't even think about someone hurting you.
Bella, the only thing that can hurt me is you.
And I don't have anything else to be afraid of.
Thas not true.
Victoria?
She'll come for me one day.
Alice will see when she decides, and we'll be ready.
I could protect you if you change me.
Bella, you already do protect me.
You're my only reason to stay alive, if thas what I am.
But is my job to protect you.
(BELLA SIGHS)
From everyone except my sister.
Is time!
Is time.
Is time.
Is time!
(THR VIOLRTHOUA PLAYING)
Your lips are nettles
Your tongue is wine
You're left as liquid But your body's pine
DR. CULLEN:
Sorry about all this.
- We tried to rein Alice in.
- As if that were even possible.
- Happy birthday, Bella.
- Thanks.
I found it in your bag.
You mind?
Dating an older woman.
Hot.
(SIGHS EEXSPERATEDLY)
- What?
- You first, Rosalie.
Is a necklace.
Alice picked it out.
Thanks.
Show me the love.
This one's from Emmett.
Already installed it in your truck.
Finally a decent sound system
- for that piece of...
- Hey!
Don't hate the truck.
ALICE LAUGHS)
Open Esme and Carlisle's.
DR. CULLEN:
Just a little something to brighten your day.
Yes, you've been looking kind of pale lately.
Ow.
Paper cut.
(GLASS SHATTERING)
(JASPER GROWLS)
Jaz, Jaz.
Is okay.
Is just a little blood.
(GASPS SOFTLY)
(JASPER SNARLS)
DR. CULLEN:
Get Jasper out of here.
(BELLA GASPS)
I'm sorry, I can't.
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.
Check on Jasper.
I'm sure he's very upset with himself, and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.
Edward.
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY)
BELLA:
I never wanted to have a party.
DR. CULLEN:
Is not your fault.
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.
How do you do it?
Years and years of practice.
Did you ever think of just doing it the easy way?
No.
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.
It brings me happiness, even if I am damned regardless.
Damned?
Like hell?
Carlisle, you couldn't be damned.
You couldn't.
Is impossible.
Thank you, Bella.
You've always been very gracious about us.
So thas it?
Thas why he won't change me?
Lmagine the situation in reverse.
Hmm.
If you believed as Edward does, could you take away his soul?
You can't protect me from everything.
At some point, something's gonna separate us.
Is gonna be an accident or illness or old age,
as long as I'm human.
And the only solution is to change me.
Thas not a solution.
Thas a tragedy.
You're not gonna want me when I look like a grandmother.
Bella, do you not understand my feelings for you at all?
Carlisle told me
how you feel about your soul.
I don't believe that.
So don't worry about mine.
You should go inside.
Is still my birthday.
So can I ask one thing?
Kiss me?
(BELLA GASPS)
(BOTH GASPING)
I love you.
(AOSLYE PLAYING)
Up with your turret
Aren't we just terrified?
Shale, screen your worry
From what you won't ever find
Don't let it fool you
Down
Hey.
Just come take a walk with me.
We have to leave Forks.
Why?
Carlisle's supposed to be 10 years older than he looks, and people are starting to notice.
Okay, I've gotta think of something to say to Charlie.
When you say "we"...
I mean my family and myself.
Edward, what happened with Jasper, is nothing.
You're right.
It was nothing, nothing but what I always expected and nothing compared to what could have happened.
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.
I belong with you.
No.
You don't.
I'm coming.
Bella,
I don't want you to come.
(SIGHS)
You don't want me?
No.
That changes things a lot.
But if is not too much to ask, can you just promise me something?
Don't do anything reckless.
For Charlie's sake.
And I'll promise something to you in return.
This is the last time you'll ever see me.
I won't come back, and you can go on with your life without any interference from me.
It will be like I never existed, I promise.
If this is about my soul, take it.
I don't want it without you.
Is not about your soul.
You're just not good for me.
Not good enough for you.
I'm just sorry I let this go on for so long.
(SOBS)
Please...
Don't...
Goodbye.
(BELLA SOBBING)
Edward.
Edward!
Edward.
(BELLA CRYING)
(SOFT GROWLING)
(GRASS RUSTLING)
(CHATTERING OVER POLICE RADIO)
I'm gonna try the Cullens' place again.
- BILLY:
The Cullens left town, Charlie.
- Good riddance.
Where'd they go?
We'll find her, Charlie.
- Thanks, Harry.
- Charlie!
BILLY:
Hey.
She's all right.
I got her.
Thank you, Sam.
(POSSIBILITY PLAYING)
There's a possibility
All that I had
Was all I'm gonna get
BELLA:
Alice, you've disappeared, like everything else.
Now who else can I talk to?
I'm lost.
When you left, and he left,
you took everything with you.
But the absence of him is everywhere I look.
Is like a huge hole has been punched through my chest.
(BELLA SCREAMING)
Bella.
(INAUDIBLE)
(BELLA SCREAMING)
BELLA:
But in a way I'm glad.
The pain is my only reminder that he was real, that you all were.
All right.
Thas it.
What?
You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother.
I'm not leaving Forks.
Bells, he's not coming back.
I know.
Is just not normal, this behavior.
Quite frankly, is scaring the hell out of me... and your mother.
Baby, I don't want you to leave.
I don't, but just go.
Go to Jacksonville.
Make some new friends.
I like my old friends.
- Well, you never see them anymore.
- I do.
I'm gonna go shopping tomorrow with Jessica.
- You hate shopping.
- I...
I need a girls' night out.
All right.
Girls' night.
Shopping.
I like it.
Go buy some stuff.
(I BRLOEG TO YOU PLAYING)
BELLA (ON PHONE):
Hi, Jessica, is Bella.
Yeah, Bella Swan.
JESSICA:
I don't know why you want to sit through all those zombies eating people and no hot guys kissing anybody.
Is gross.
Like...
And why are there that many zombie movies anyway?
'Cause if is supposed to, like, draw a parallel about leprosy, my cousin had leprosy.
Is not funny, you know?
And, like, is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism?
Because don't be so pleased with your own, like, self-referential cleverness, you know?
Like, some girls like to shop.
Not all girls, apparently.
Although I was surprised you even called at all.
You know?
Like, your depression thing, I get it.
I'm totally, totally worried.
But after a while is like,
- you're still bumming...
- CHET:
You want a ride, girls?
...and I'm going through stuff, too.
You know?
Like Mike deciding he just wants to be friends.
CHET:
Whas up?
Look what we found.
JESSICA:
Is hard, you know?
Like, and since when does "just friends"...
BIKER 1:
Whas up guys?
BIKER 2:
Look what we found.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, where you going?
(TIRES SCREECHING)
Keep walking.
(GASPING)
This is dangerous.
- Dude, come on.
- CHET:
Come here for a sec!
I think I know those guys.
CHET:
We got beer!
We got bikes!
Well, they seem great.
Can we go?
I'm just gonna see something.
CHET:
Hey, girlie!
All right, all right.
We got a taker.
Turn around.
(GASPS)
(FRIENDS PLAYING)
BIKER 2:
Shut up!
BIKER 3:
You shut up!
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
No, thas cool.
I'll be whoever you want me to be, honey.
So, what do you say?
You promised me, nothing reckless.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
You promised it would be as if you never existed.
(CHET CLEARS THROAT)
- You lied.
- You say something, babe?
You know what?
Never mind.
(ENGINE ROARING)
Stop!
Stop, stop, stop!
(BRAKES SCREECHING)
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?
Just curious.
- I thought that I saw something.
- You...
Oh.
You're insane, actually.
Or suicidal.
That homeboy coulïve been a psycho.
I was about to end up in an FBI interview room like some lame TV show.
God, that was such a rush.
Awesome.
So you're an adrenaline junkie now?
Thas cool.
You can go bungee jumping.
You don't get on the back of some random loser's motorcycle.
Crazy.
BELLA:
Alice, I saw him.
Maybe I'm crazy now.
I guess thas okay.
If a rush of danger is what it takes to see him, then thas what I'll find.
Bella!
Where the hell have you been, loca?
(BELLA LAUGHING)
(SIGHS) I brought you something.
- Okay.
- Is a little crazy.
Wow.
Scrap metal.
You shouldn't have.
I saved it from the junkyard.
(BELLA CLEARS THROAT)
I think they'll probably cost more to fix than they're worth, but then I thought that if I had a mechanic friend
- to help me out then...
- Ah!
- Me being the mechanic-type friend?
- Thas right.
- Since when are you into motorcycles?
- Since now.
I get it if you think that this is really stupid and reckless.
Yeah, I mean, is completely stupid and reckless.
When do we start?
Uh.
Now.
- Please?
- (CHUCKLES) All right.
Oh, hey, be careful.
Those things are actually really heavy, so...
Jake, you're, like, buff.
How did that happen?
You're, like, 16.
I don't get it.
Mmm-hmm.
Age is just a number, baby.
What are you, like, 40 now?
It feels like that sometimes.
(ROMANTIC SONG PLAYING ON STEREO)
(TURNS OFF STEREO)
That song's good.
You don't like it?
I don't really like music anymore, kind of.
Okay.
No more music.
So I was thinking, if we're gonna do this every day, and hopefully we will, we have to, like, fit some homework in there somewhere.
I don't want Billy thinking that I'm a bad influence on you.
You?
Influence me?
Please.
Are you...
I'm older than you, so that makes me the influencer and you the influence.
(LAUGHS) No, no, no.
My size and knowledge base actually makes me older than you because of your general paleness and lack of know-how.
I convinced you to build two-wheeled death machines with me.
Don't you think that makes you kind of young and naive?
Okay.
So where do we stand?
- I'm 35.
And you might be, like, 32.
- Come on.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- QUIL:
Yo, Jake, you in there?
- Is okay.
Is just my boys.
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey.
Guys, this is Bella.
- Bella, thas Quil and Embry.
- Hi.
I'm Quil Ateara.
So the bike building story is true.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I taught him everything he knows.
What about the part where you're his girlfriend?
Uh...
We're friends, you know.
- (LAUGHS) Burn.
- Actually, remember I said she's a girl and a friend.
Embry, do you remember him making that distinction?
Nope.
So you guys have girlfriends?
Thas awesome.
(JACOB LAUGHING)
Yeah, right.
Quil's actually taking his cousin to prom.
Yeah, thas still a riot.
You want funny, Black?
I'll give you funny.
(JACOB AND QUIL LAUGHING)
Jeez.
JACOB:
Hey, that holïs illegal!
EMBRY:
I got five bucks on Quil.
You're on.
(SHOOTING THE MOON PLAYING)
All of the astronauts Champagne in plastic cups
Waiting for the big hero to show
Outside the door he stands His head in his hands
And his heart in his throat
What can he tell them now
BELLA:
Dear Alice,
I wish I had your real address.
I wish I could tell you about Jake.
He makes me feel better.
I mean, he makes me feel alive.
The hole in my chest, well, when I'm with Jake, is like is almost healed
for a while.
So, Quil keeps asking to come over.
I think he likes you a little too much.
Oh.
Well, I'm really not into the whole cougar thing.
You know?
(CHUCKLES)
Whas up with you and age?
I mean, how old was that Cullen guy, anyway?
BELLA:
But even Jake can't keep the dreams away.
(BELLA WHIMPERING)
(SCREAMING)
Hey, hey, hey!
Wake up, Bella.
(SHUSHING) You're okay.
You're okay.
I thought this thing was starting to work, but I guess not.
(CHARLIE SIGHS)
Can I ask you something?
Hanging out with Jacob, that seems to take your mind off things a bit, doesn't it?
You know, sometimes you gotta learn to love whas good for you.
You know what I mean?
Of course, what do I know?
I'm just a terminal bachelor.
Famous ladies' man.
Okay.
I'm gonna go to bed.
Uh...
I love you.
If I told you I couldn't have fixed these bikes, what would you have said?
Are you doubting your mad skills?
No.
Definitely not.
I mean, they'll run fine.
Is just, maybe if I was smart, I would have dragged out the rebuild a bit.
If you told me you couldn't fix these bikes, I'd say that thas really too bad, but that we're just gonna have to find something else to do.
(LAUGHS)
Is that Sam Uley?
Yeah.
Him and his cult.
(SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
(WHOOPS)
Oh, my God.
Did you see that?
(JACOB LAUGHING)
They're not really fighting, Bella.
They're cliff diving.
Scary as hell, but a total rush.
- A rush?
- Most of us jump from lower down.
We leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples.
You have some kind of beef with him or something?
I don't know.
They just think they run this place.
Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids.
- Now look at him.
- Thas Embry?
(CONTINUE WHOOPING)
- Yeah.
- What happened to him?
He missed some school.
Now all of a sudden, he started following Sam around like a little puppy.
Same thing happened with Paul and Jared.
Sam keeps giving me this look, like he's waiting for me or something.
Is kind of starting to freak me out.
Well, you should just avoid him.
I r y.
Okay.
- You look scared.
- I'm not.
All right.
- Brake?
- That one.
Clutch?
Good.
Gas?
(ENGINE ROARS)
Ready?
Now, slowly release the clutch.
EDWARD:
Bella.
Stop.
(BELLA GASPS)
Whoa!
You all right?
I'm gonna go again.
Okay.
(GASPS)
Ah!
Whoa!
Hit the brake!
(GRUNTS)
I wanna go again.
Are you trying to get yourself killed?
- No.
I want to go again.
- No.
Forget it.
No more bikes.
Man, your head.
Ow.
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
What, you're apologizing for bleeding?
Yeah.
I guess I am.
Well, is just blood, Bella.
No big deal.
There.
What are you staring at?
You're sort of beautiful.
How hard did you hit your head?
I don't know.
(JACOB CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Les go.
ANGELA:
I did see something in the woods.
Totally.
Baby, I believe you.
No, he doesn't.
He's just trying to get lucky.
(ERIC LAUGHS)
ANGELA:
No, okay.
It was jet black and huge.
On all fours, it was still taller than a person.
A bear, maybe?
Or an alien.
You're lucky you didn't get probed.
(ERIC AND MIKE SNICKERING)
ANGELA:
Well, I saw it.
You know, you're not the only one.
My daïs been getting reports at the station.
Like, five hikers have been killed by some bear.
But they can't find the bear.
Hmm.
(LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.
MIKE:
Um... (MIKE CLEARS THROAT)
So?
I mean,
Bella's back?
(LAUGHS)
Yeah, I guess so.
All right, thas...
Well, welcome.
So, listen, now that you're talking and eating again, which, you know, you've got to get that protein in there,
I was just wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me.
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah, I do.
Cool.
Let me see, we could check out
Love Spelled Backwards Is Love.
You know, is a dumb title, but is a romantic comedy.
- I mean, is supposed to be pretty...
- No.
No romance.
How about Face Punch?
Have you heard of that?
I mean, thas an action movie.
Yeah, thas perfect.
Guns, adrenaline.
Thas my thing.
Okay.
We should get a bunch of people to go.
Do you guys want to go see Face Punch?
ERIC:
Face Punch, yeah!
Mike, hey, we were supposed to watch that.
Remember, the trailer's like...
- "Punch faces."
- I remember.
(SARCASTICALLY) Yeah!
Movie night with Bella.
JACOB:
So Face Punch, huh?
You like action movies?
Not really.
(JACOB SCOFFING)
I heard it sucks.
Bad.
Are you even old enough to see this movie?
I mean, you know, without, like, adult supervision.
Right, yeah, well, she's buying my ticket for me.
She's buying it.
Okay.
Jessica bailed, and Angela got the stomach flu, so Eric's taking care of her.
- Is just us three.
- Great!
- Great.
- Yeah.
(GUN COCKING ON SCREEN)
MAN 1 ON SCREEN:
Put your gun down.
MAN 2 ON SCREEN:
Put your gun down or I'm gonna blow your frickin' head off.
MAN 3 ON SCREEN:
Both of you put both of your guns down or I'm gonna blow both of your frickin' heads off.
MAN 1 ON SCREEN:
All right, forget it, les do this!
(GUNS FIRING)
(MAN SCREAMS)
(GUNS FIRING)
(WOMAN SCREAMS)
Okay, I think I'm gonna throw up.
(SCREAMING CONTINUES)
He's... (SCOFFS) What a marshmallow!
You should hold out for someone with a stronger stomach.
Someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit.
Yeah.
I'll keep my eye open for that.
(JACOB CHUCKLES)
I feel bad.
He probably has that flu thas going around.
What?
I can't hold your hand?
No, of course you can.
I just think it means, you know, something a little different to you.
So...
Okay, well, tell me something.
You like me, right?
And you think I'm sort of beautiful?
(SOFTLY) Jacob, please, don't do this.
(BELLA SIGHS)
Why?
Because you're about to ruin everything.
And I need you.
(SIGHS)
Well, I've got loads of time.
I'm not gonna give up.
I don't want you to, but is just 'cause I don't want you to go anywhere.
And thas really selfish.
You know, I'm not like a car that you can fix up.
I'm never gonna run right.
So I should be fair to you.
Is because of him, right?
(JACOB SIGHS DEEPLY)
Look,
I know what he did to you.
But, Bella, I would never ever do that.
I won't ever hurt you.
I promise.
I won't let you down.
You can count on me.
MIKE:
Well,
(SNIFFLES)
(SIGHS)
I need to go home.
I was feeling sick before the movie.
Okay?
(JACOB SCOFFS)
What is your problem?
Right now?
You're my problem.
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.
You want me to put you in the hospital?
Jake!
Jake.
Jake, the movie's over.
What are you doing?
You're really hot.
Like, you feel like you have a fever.
Are you okay?
I don't know whas happening.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I gotta go.
That dude is weird.
BELLA: (ON PHONE) Jake, your dad says you have mono.
He won't let me visit, but would you call me?
Hey, is me again.
I just...
I'm sorry about what I said at the movie theater.
I just wanted to hear your voice, so no pressure.
Jacob, please...
Call me.
Okay.
We should be back around 3:00.
(SIGHS)
Hey.
Look, I don't have to go fishing today.
Yes, you do.
Yeah, you do.
Go.
What are you talking about?
Just be careful.
Always am.
Those bears won't get the drop on me, Bella.
My kung fu is strong.
Jake!
Hey!
You cut your hair off?
And got a tattoo?
Bella.
I thought you were too sick to come outside or pick up the phone when I call.
Go away.
What?
Go away.
What happened to you?
Whas...
Hey!
What happened?
Did Sam get to you?
Is that whas happening?
Sam's trying to help me.
Don't blame him.
But if you want somebody to blame, how about those filthy bloodsuckers you love, the Cullens?
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
You've been lying to everyone.
Charlie.
But you can't lie to me.
- Not anymore, Bella.
- SAM:
Jacob!
Jacob!
Look, Bella, we can't be friends anymore.
(CRYING) Look, Jake, I know that I've been hurting you.
Is killing me.
It kills me.
I just need...
Maybe give me, like,
- some time or something.
- Look, don't.
Is not you.
Is not you, is me, right?
Really?
Is true.
It is me.
I'm not good.
I used to be a good kid.
Not anymore.
This doesn't even matter.
All right?
This is over.
You can't break up with me.
I mean...
I mean, you're my best friend.
You promised me.
I know.
I promised I wouldn't hurt you, Bella.
And this is me keeping that promise.
Go home and don't come back or you're gonna get hurt.
BELLA:
Alice, things are...
Things are bad again.
Without Jake, I just...
I can't stand it.
I don't see Edward anymore.
Will it really feel like he never existed?
I will find the place where I can see him again.
(SOBBING)
Bella.
Laurent.
I didn't expect to find you here.
I went to visit the Cullens, but the house is empty.
I'm surprised they left you behind.
Weren't you sort of a pet of theirs?
Yeah.
You could say that.
Do the Cullens visit often?
Lie.
(GASPS)
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.
Lie better.
I'll tell them that you stopped by.
But I probably shouldn't tell Edward,
'cause he's pretty protective.
But he's far away, isn't he?
Why are you here?
I came as a favor to Victoria.
- Victoria?
- She asked me to see if you were still under the protection of the Cullens.
Victoria feels is only fair to kill Edwarïs mate, given he killed hers.
An eye for an eye.
Threaten him.
Edward would know who did it.
And he'd come after you.
I don't think he will.
After all, how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected?
(LAURENT SIGHS)
Victoria won't be happy about my killing you, but I can't help myself.
You are so mouth-watering.
- Please, don't.
I mean, you helped us.
- No, no, no, no.
(SHUSHING)
Don't be afraid.
I'm doing you a kindness.
(SOFTLY) Victoria plans on killing you slowly, painfully,
whereas I'll make it quick.
I promise.
You will feel nothing.
Edward, I love you.
(TWIGS SNAPPING)
I don't believe it.
(LOW GROWLING)
(ROARS)
(GASPS)
(WEREWOLVES RUNNING)
(YELPING)
(GASPS)
- Dad!
I saw them.
- Whas the matter?
- In the woods.
They're not bears.
- What do you mean "in the woods"?
Bell, what the hell were you doing out in the woods?
They're wolves.
I mean, they're like huge wolves.
Are you sure about that, Bella?
Yeah!
I just saw them.
They were after something.
(HARRY CLEARS THROAT)
Wolves?
You saw them?
All right, well, Harry, feel like going hunting?
Get some of your guys together?
Sure, yeah, I'll just...
BELLA:
By now, those wolves will be dead, and Laurent would have told her I'm unprotected.
Victoria.
I should go to the station.
Yeah, you should.
You should go.
CHARLIE:
Can you just stay in the house?
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
(CLATTERING)
(CLATTERING CONTINUES)
JACOB: (WHISPERS) Bella!
You scared me.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Back up.
I'm coming up.
(GASPS)
Hey.
Look, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- I wish I could explain.
But I literally can't.
(SIGHS)
Have you ever had a secret you couldn't tell anyone, one that wasn't yours to share?
Well, thas what is like for me.
But worse.
You have no idea how tight I'm bound.
I hate this.
I hate what they've done to you.
I mean, the killer part is, you already know.
Bella, do you remember when we walked on the beach at La Push?
The...
The story.
The story about the cold ones.
I guess I understand why thas the only part you remember.
There's gotta be something that you can do.
No.
I'm in it for life.
Well, maybe we should just get out of here for a while.
Just leave, just you and me.
You'd do that?
I would do it for you.
Is not something I can just run away from, Bella.
But I would run away with you
if I could.
I gotta go.
They'll start wondering where I am.
Come here.
(SOFTLY) Please, try to remember.
Id be so much easier if you knew.
I'll try.
But, Jake...
Jake, what are you doing?
Wait, Jake.
(GASPS)
Jake.
(GASPS)
Edward, I'm scared.
You should be.
JACOB:
Really, is just like an old story.
I'm not really supposed to say anything about it.
Did you know Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?
(WEREWOLF SNARLS)
Bella?
I need to see him.
He's not in.
- OK, I'm sorry, I really need to see him.
- Bella!
What did you do?
- Okay, what did you do?
- Hey.
- What did you do to him?
- Easy!
He didn't want this.
What did we do?
What did he do?
Whad he tell you?
- Both of you calm down.
- Nothing.
He tells me nothing because he's scared of you.
(SNICKERING)
- Too late now.
- SAM:
Bella, get back!
(PAUL GROWLING SOFTLY)
SAM:
Paul, calm down, now!
Bella!
Run!
Jake, run!
(GROWLING)
(WHIMPERS)
(BOTH SNARLING)
SAM:
Paul!
Hey!
Take Bella back to Emily's place.
EMBRY:
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.
BELLA:
Alice, is it possible that everything is true?
The fairy tales and horror stories?
Is it possible that there isn't anything sane or normal at all?
(BOTH WHOOP)
Hey, I think we should go back and see if Jacob's okay.
I hope Paul sinks some teeth in him.
Serves him right.
No way.
Jacob's a natural.
You see him phase on the fly?
I got five says Paul doesn't touch him.
Come on in, Bella.
We won't bite.
Speak for yourself.
(DOER ALL WAOEG PLAYING)
I done me wrong
And done all wrong
All the wrong I've done I'm sure I'll live quite long
Oh, hey, about Emily, Sam's fiance?
Don't stare.
It bugs Sam.
Why would I stare?
Are you guys hungry?
Like I have to ask.
(EMILY LAUGHING)
Who's this?
JARED:
Bella Swan.
Who else?
Hmm.
So, you're the vampire girl.
So, you're the wolf girl.
Guess so.
Well, I'm engaged to one.
Save some for your brothers.
And ladies first.
Muffin?
Sure.
Thanks.
Leave it to Jacob to find a way around Sam's gag order.
He didn't say anything to me.
Thas a wolf thing.
Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want them to or not.
And check it out.
We can hear each other's thoughts.
Would you shut up?
These are trade secrets.
Damn it!
This chick runs with vampires.
You can't really run with vampires.
(EMILY GIGGLES)
'Cause they're fast.
Yeah?
Well, we're faster.
Freaked out yet?
You're not the first monsters I've met.
SAM:
Jake's right.
You're good with weird.
Hey.
(EMILY GIGGLING)
Sorry.
So you're a werewolf?
Yeah.
Last time I checked.
A few lucky members of the tribe have the gene.
A bloodsucker moves into town and the fever sets in.
Mono.
Yeah.
I wish.
Well, can't you find a way to just stop?
I mean, is wrong.
Is not a lifestyle choice, Bella.
I was born this way.
I can't help it.
You're such a hypocrite.
What, I'm not the right kind of monster for you?
Is not what you are.
Is what you do.
They never hurt anybody.
You've killed people, Jake.
Bella, we're not killing anyone.
Then who is?
What we're trying to protect you people from, the only thing we do kill,
vampires.
Wait, Jake, you can't.
Don't worry.
We can't touch your little precious Cullens unless they violate the treaty.
Thas not what I'm saying.
You can't kill vampires.
They'll...
They'll kill you.
Really?
We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough.
(WEREWOLVES GROWLING)
Laurent?
And his red-headed girlfriend is next.
Victoria's here?
Was.
We chased her all the way to the Canadian border the other night.
She keeps coming back.
We don't know what she's after.
I do.
Me.
Don't worry.
We've got this place covered.
She won't get near you or Charlie.
Look, you've got to be careful.
She's fast.
You don't know how fast she is.
You know, your lack of confidence in us is a little insulting.
All right, I'd better go.
You gotta go?
Yeah.
Got a vampire to kill.
BELLA:
Alice, I'm all right.
Until I'm alone.
And lately, thas all the time.
Jacob's gone.
He's hunting Victoria.
And Charlie's hunting Jacob.
And you're gone.
And so is Edward.
And there's just nothing now.
You got something, Harry?
Nope.
Nothing.
But I realize where I have to go, what I have to do to see him again.
(HEARING DAMAGE PLAYING)
A tear in my brain
Allows the voices in
They wanna push you off the path
With their frequency wires
And you can do no wrong
In my eyes
You can do no wrong
In my eyes
A drunken salesman
Your hearing damage
Your mind is restless
They say you're getting better
But you don't feel any better
Your speakers are blowing
Your ears are wrecking
Your hearing damage
You wish you felt better
You can do no wrong
In my eyes
(GROWLING)
EDWARD:
Don't do this.
You wanted me to be human.
Watch me.
EDWARD:
Please.
For me.
You won't stay with me any other way.
Bella, please.
(GASPING)
(SLOWLIFR PLAYING)
This constant noise all the time
Even though you're the only one I see
JACOB:
Breathe!
Breathe!
Come on, Bella, breathe!
(BELLA SPLUTTERING)
Bella?
Bella, can you hear me?
Jake?
Come here.
What the hell were you thinking?
I just wanted to see something.
Get her home!
I'm gonna go help out over at Harry's place.
What happened at Harry's?
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.
Charlie and my dad are over at his place with his family.
Is he okay?
He's gone.
Come on.
I'll get you something dry and drive you home.
(BELLA SHIVERING) 108 degrees over here.
God!
My hands are freezing.
It must be nice, never getting cold.
Is a wolf thing.
Is not.
Is a Jacob thing.
You're just warm.
You're like your own sun.
This is better, now that you know about me.
But...
You saw what happened to Emily.
Sam got angry.
Lost it for a split second.
Em was standing too close.
He'll never be able to take that back.
What if I got mad at you?
(JACOB SIGHS)
Sometimes,
I feel like I'm gonna disappear.
Okay, not that you need me to tell you something like this,
but I always will.
You're not gonna lose yourself.
I wouldn't let that happen.
How?
I'll tell you all the time
how special you are.
(BELLA INHALES SHARPLY)
Thank you.
For everything.
Wait.
There's a vampire.
How do you know?
I can smell it.
I'm getting you out of here.
Thas Carlisle's car.
They're here.
Bella, is a trick!
Stop!
You gotta come with me!
(BELLA GRUNTS)
They won't hurt me.
If a Cullen is back here, this is their territory.
Treaty says we can only defend on our own lands.
- I can't protect you here.
- Okay.
Thas okay.
You don't have to.
You're about to cross a line.
Then don't draw one.
Please?
(BELLA GASPS)
Alice?
- Oh, my God!
What are you...
- Bella!
I'm sorry, I just, I can't believe you're here.
Is...
Would you like to explain to me how you're alive?
What?
I saw a vision of you.
You jumped off a cliff.
Why in the hell would you try and kill yourself?
I mean, what about Charlie?
- What about...
- I didn't try to kill myself.
I was cliff jumping.
Recreationally.
It was fun.
(EXHALES)
I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy.
Does...
Did you tell him?
No.
He only calls in once every few months.
He said he wants to be alone.
Bella, what is that God-awful wet dog smell?
Uh...
Thas probably me.
Or is Jacob.
Jacob who?
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.
Bella!
Werewolves are not good company to keep.
Speak for yourself.
I had to see you were safe.
I thought you couldn't protect me here.
Guess I don't care.
Well, I'm not gonna hurt her.
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.
I'm talking about the other bloodsucker who tried to kill Bella because of you.
Victoria?
Yeah, Victoria's been around.
I didn't see her.
I didn't see you get pulled out of the water, either.
I can't see past you and your pack of mutts.
Don't get me upset...
- Hey, stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
...or things are gonna get very ugly.
I'll give you a minute.
Hey.
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna come back,
- right?
- As soon as you put the dog out.
Is he...
Are there others?
How many Cullens are here and how long are they staying?
No.
Is just Alice.
And she can stay as long as she'd like.
Well, are the rest coming back?
No.
Not that I know of.
(BELLA SCOFFS)
Anything else?
Thas it.
Well, if thas all, then you'd better go run back to Sam.
I've done it again.
I keep breaking my promise.
We don't have to do this to each other.
Yes, we do.
(SOFTLY) Bella...

(SIGHS)
He's not here right now.
He's arranging a funeral.
(CELL PHONE CRACKING)
Who was that?
What?
Always in the way.
Who was that?
Bella, step back.
- Jake, who was that?
- Bella!
Bella, is Edward.
He thinks you're dead.
Rosalie told him why I came here.
Why would you...
Why didn't you let me speak to him?
- He didn't ask for you.
- Bella.
- I don't care!
- Bella.
Bella!
He's going to the Volturi.
He wants to die, too.
JACOB:
He left you, Bella.
He didn't want you anymore.
Remember?
No, I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt.
What about your dad?
I'm 18.
I'm legally free to go, and I left a note.
Please, Bella, just stay here.
For Charlie.
Or for me.
I have to go.
I'm begging you.
Please.
Goodbye, Jacob.
Okay.

(CAR ACCELERATING)
So you've made up your minds.
I'm afraid your particular gifts are too valuable to destroy.
But if you're unhappy with your lot, join us.
We would be delighted to utilize your skills.
Won't you consider staying with us?
You know it will happen anyway.
Not without cause.
Such a waste.
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?
I figured you wouldn't be opposed to grand theft auto.
Not today.
What?
What do you see?
They refused him.
- So?
- He's gonna make a scene.
- Show himself to the humans.
- No!
When?
ALICE:
He's gonna wait until noon, when the sun's at its highest.
(GRUNTS)
God, Alice, you got to hurry up.
There's Volterra.
(HORN HONKING)
(TIRES SQUEALING)
(HONKING CONTINUES)
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
- Why are they all in red?
- San Marco's Day festival.
They're commemorating the expulsion of vampires from the city.
Is the perfect setting.
The Volturi will never let him get far enough to reveal himself.
(PANTING) We have five minutes.
I know, Bella, just breathe.
(HORN HONKING)
Alice!
Bella, you're the only one he can't see coming.
If I go, he'll read my thoughts.
He'll think I'm lying.
He'll rush into it.
- Where do I go?
- He'll be under the clock tower.
Go!
(CROWD CHANTING)
(BELL TOLLS)
Don't!
(BELLA PANTING)
Heaven.
You have to move.
Open your eyes.
Look at me.
I'm alive.
You have to move.
Bella.
- You're here.
- I'm here.
You're alive.
Yes.
I needed to make you see me once.
You had to know that I was alive, that you didn't have to feel guilty about anything.
I can let you go now.
I never acted out of guilt.
I just couldn't live in a world where you don't exist.
- But you said...
- I lied.
I had to lie.
But you believed me so easily.
Because it doesn't make sense for you to love me.
I mean, I'm nothing.
I'm human.
I'm nothing.
Bella, you're everything to me.
You're everything.
(GATE OPENS)
I won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen.
Aro wants to speak with you again.
No rules were broken.
Nonetheless, we should take this conversation to a more appropriate venue.
Fine.
Bella, why don't you go and enjoy the rest of the festival?
The girl comes with us.
No.
You can go to hell.
(LOCK BREAKS)
Come on, guys.
Is a festival.
You wouldn't want to make a scene.
We wouldn't.
Enough.
Jane.
Aro sent me to see what was taking so long.
Just do as she says.
Go ahead.
Don't be scared.
Are you?
No.
(JANE SCOFFS)
(OPERA PLAYING)
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
- Is she human?
- Yes.
Does she know?
Yes.
Then, why would...
She wants to be.
And so she will be.
Or dessert.
ALEC:
Sister.
They send you out to get one and you bring back two.
And a half.
Such a clever girl.
What a happy surprise!
Bella is alive after all.
Isn't that wonderful?
I love a happy ending.
ARO:
Ah.

They are so rare.

- Is not without difficulty.
- Yes, I can see that.
ARO CHUCKLING)
Aro can read every thought I've ever had with one touch.
And now you know everything.
So get on with it.
You are quite a soul reader yourself, Edward.
Though you can't read Bella's thoughts.
Fascinating.
I would love to see if you are an exception to my gifts, as well.
Would you do me the honor?
Interesting.
Hmm.
I see nothing.
I wonder if...
Let us see if she's immune to all our powers.
Shall we, Jane?
- No!
- Pain.
(GROANS)
BELLA:
Stop!
Stop!
Please!
Stop!
(GRUNTS) Stop!
Just stop hurting him!
Please!
Please!
Jane?
Master?

Go ahead, my dear.
This may hurt just a little.
(LAUGHING EXCITEDLY)
Remarkable!
She confounds us all.
So what do we do with you now?
You already know what you're going to do, Aro.
She knows too much.
She's a liability.
Hmm.
Thas true.
Felix?
EDWARD:
No!
(GASPS)
Please!
No!
No!
Please, please!
Kill me!
Kill me!
Not him.
How extraordinary.
You would give up your life for someone like us.
A vampire.
A soulless monster.
Just get away from her!
You don't know a thing about his soul.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
This is a sadness.
If only it were your intention to give her immortality.
Wait!
Bella will be one of us.
I've seen it.
I'll change her myself.
Mesmerizing.
To see what you have seen before it has happened.
Your gifts will make for an intriguing immortal,
Isabella.
Go now.
Make your preparations.
Let us be done with this.
Heidi will arrive any moment.
Thank you for your visit.

We will return the favor.
I would advise that you follow through on your promise soon.
We do not offer second chances.

(SCREAMS ECHOING)
Stop!
Stop!
You're here.
You can sleep.
I'll still be here when you wake up.
Bella, the only reason I left was because I thought I was protecting you.
I needed you to have a chance at a normal, happy life.
It was so easy for you to leave.
Leaving you was the hardest thing I've done in 100 years.
(SIGHING)
And I swear,
I will never fail you again.
I'm so sorry.
- Charlie's coming.
- Hey.
You okay?
I'm fine.
Dad, you don't have to worry.
You know, last time you said that, you took off.
I didn't see you for three days.
I'm really sorry, Dad.
Bella, do not ever do that to me again.
Ever.
And you're grounded for the rest of your life.
Okay.
I'm not technically breaking any of his rules.
He did say I couldn't take a step inside the door.
I came in through the window.
He's not gonna forgive me easily.
I know.
Can you?
I hope you can, 'cause I honestly don't know how to live without you.
Come here.
Once Alice changes me,
you can't get rid of me.
She won't need to change you.
There are always ways to keep the Volturi in the dark.
No.
No.
You all know what I want.
And I know how much I'm asking for.
The only thing that I can think of for it to be fair is to just vote.
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Shut up.
Alice?
I already consider you my sister.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
JASPER:
I vote "yes."
It would be nice to not want to kill you all the time.
Hmm.
ROSALIE:
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry to both of you for how I've acted, and I'm really grateful that you were brave enough to go and save my brother.
But this isn't a life I would have chosen for myself.
And I wish that there'd been someone to vote "no" for me.
So, no.
I vote "Hell, yeah."
And we can pick a fight with these Volturi some other way.
I already consider you a part of the family.
Yes.
(DR. CULLEN SIGHS)
Why are you doing this to me?
You know what this means.
You've chosen not to live without her, which leaves me no choice.
I won't lose my son.
BELLA:
I'll wait until after graduation to make it easier on Charlie.
Edward, I want you to be the one to do it.
(TIRES SCREECH)
He wants to talk to me.
JACOB:
So you're still alive for now.
EDWARD:
He thinks is me keeping you away.
JACOB:
You stay the hell out of my head.
Jacob, I know you have something to say to me.
But I want to say something to you first, if thas all right.
Thank you.
Thank you for keeping Bella alive when I didn't.
No.
You didn't.
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.
I'm still grateful.
But I'm here now.
I'm not gonna leave her side until she orders me away.
We'll see.
Hey, my turn to talk.
I'm here to remind you about a key point in the treaty.
I haven't forgotten.
What key point?
If any of them bites a human, the truce is over.
But if I choose it, it has nothing to do with you.
No.
No, I won't let you.
You're not gonna be one of them, Bella.
Is not up to you.
You know what we'll do to you.
I won't have a choice.
Bella, please, come.
Wait.
Is he gonna hurt me?
Read his mind.
Jake,
I love you.
(JACOB BREATHES DEEPLY)
So, please,
don't make me choose,
'cause ill be him.
Is always been him.
Bella...
- Goodbye, Jacob.
- No, you don't speak for her!
(GROWLING)
(ROARS)
Bella, get out of here.
BELLA:
Stop!
Stop!
You can't hurt each other without hurting me.
Jake.
He's right.
You shouldn't become what I am.
I can't do this alone.
Then, please, just wait.
Just give me five years.
Thas too long.
(SIGHS)
Then three?
You're so stubborn.
What are you waiting for?
I have one condition if you want me to do it myself.
Whas the condition?
And then forever.
Thas what I'm asking.
Marry me, Bella.

It's to put your pictures in from senior year.

- ALICE:
Bella!
- Happy birthday!
- Shh, shh!
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
I thought I said no presents.
I've already seen you open it, and guess what, you love it.
You're gonna wear it tonight.
Our place.
Come on.
Please?
It'll be fun.
- Okay.
All right.
- Great!
Okay, I'll see you at 7:00.
Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing.
(ALICE LAUGHS)
Sorry, Bella.
Happy...
Never mind.
You can't trust vampires.
Trust me.
ROMEO: (ON VIDEO) O my love!
My wife!
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Thou art not conquered.
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks.
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
BELLA:
I hate being celebrated.
EDWARD:
There are worse tragedies.
I mean, look at Romeo.
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.
BELLA:
Yeah.
Though I do envy him one thing.
BELLA:
Juliet is, like, perfect.
If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.
(EDWARD LAUGHS)
Not the girl, the suicide.
It's nearly impossible for...
For some people.
For humans, a little poison, a dagger to the heart.
There's so many different options.
Why would you say that?
Because I had to consider it once.
(BELLA SCREAMING)
I didn't know if I'd get to you in time.
I had to come up with some kind of plan.
What was the plan?
That I'd go to Italy and provoke the Volturi.
- The what?
- The Volturi.
MR. BERTY:
Now, who'd like to repeat the last few lines of iambic pentameter just to show they were paying attention?
Mr. Cullen?
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Yes, Mr. Berty.
"O here will I set up my everlasting rest
"and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.
"Eyes, look your last.
"Arms, take your last embrace!
"And, lips, O you, the doors of breath,
"seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death!"
Eyes on the screen, people.
ROMEO:
Thus with a kiss I die.
The Volturi are a very old, very powerful family.
I guess they're the closest thing to royalty my world has.
- Is that Carlisle?
- Yeah.
He lived with them for a few decades.
Described them as very refined.
No respect for human life, of course, but a respect for the arts and the sciences, at least.
And the law.
Above all, the law.
BELLA:
Vampires have laws?
EDWARD:
Not very many.
And only one that's regularly enforced.
BELLA:
What is it?
EDWARD:
That we keep the existence of our kind a secret.
We don't make spectacles of ourselves, and we don't kill conspicuously.
Unless, of course, you want to die.
(SCREAMS)
You gotta stop talking about that.
I can't even think about someone hurting you.
Bella, the only thing that can hurt me is you.
And I don't have anything else to be afraid of.
That's not true.
Victoria?
She'll come for me one day.
Alice will see when she decides, and we'll be ready.
I could protect you if you change me.
Bella, you already do protect me.
You're my only reason to stay alive, if that's what I am.
But it's my job to protect you.
(BELLA SIGHS)
From everyone except my sister.
It's time!
It's time.
It's time.
It's time!

(BELLA GASPS)
I'm sorry, I can't.
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.
Check on Jasper.
I'm sure he's very upset with himself, and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.
Edward.
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY)
BELLA:
I never wanted to have a party.
DR. CULLEN:
It's not your fault.
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.
How do you do it?
Years and years of practice.
Did you ever think of just doing it the easy way?
No.
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.
It brings me happiness, even if I am damned regardless.
Damned?
Like hell?
Carlisle, you couldn't be damned.
You couldn't.
It's impossible.
Thank you, Bella.
You've always been very gracious about us.
So that's it?
That's why he won't change me?
Imagine the situation in reverse.
Hmm.
If you believed as Edward does, could you take away his soul?
You can't protect me from everything.
At some point, something's gonna separate us.
It's gonna be an accident or illness or old age,
as long as I'm human.
And the only solution is to change me.
That's not a solution.
That's a tragedy.
You're not gonna want me when I look like a grandmother.
Bella, do you not understand my feelings for you at all?
Carlisle told me
how you feel about your soul.
I don't believe that.
So don't worry about mine.
You should go inside.
It's still my birthday.
So can I ask one thing?
Kiss me?
(BELLA GASPS)

Carlisle's supposed to be 10 years older than he looks, and people are starting to notice.
Okay, I've gotta think of something to say to Charlie.
When you say "we"...
I mean my family and myself.
Edward, what happened with Jasper, it's nothing.
You're right.
It was nothing, nothing but what I always expected and nothing compared to what could have happened.
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.
I belong with you.
No.
You don't.
I'm coming.
Bella,
I don't want you to come.
(SIGHS)
You don't want me?
No.
That changes things a lot.
But if it's not too much to ask, can you just promise me something?
Don't do anything reckless.
For Charlie's sake.
And I'll promise something to you in return.
This is the last time you'll ever see me.
I won't come back, and you can go on with your life without any interference from me.
It will be like I never existed, I promise.
If this is about my soul, take it.
I don't want it without you.

It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest.

Bella.

But in a way I'm glad.
The pain is my only reminder that he was real, that you all were.
All right.
That's it.
What?
You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother.
I'm not leaving Forks.
Bells, he's not coming back.
I know.
It's just not normal, this behavior.
Quite frankly, it's scaring the hell out of me and your mother.
Baby, I don't want you to leave.
I don't, but just go.
Go to Jacksonville.
Make some new friends.
I like my old friends.

I'm gonna go shopping tomorrow with Jessica.

Yeah, Bella Swan.
JESSICA:
I don't know why you want to sit through all those zombies eating people and no hot guys kissing anybody.
It's gross.
Like...
And why are there that many zombie movies anyway?
'Cause if it's supposed to, like, draw a parallel about leprosy, my cousin had leprosy.
It's not funny, you know?
And, like, is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism?
Because don't be so pleased with your own, like, self-referential cleverness, you know?
Like, some girls like to shop.
Not all girls, apparently.
Although I was surprised you even called at all.
You know?
Like, your depression thing, I get it.
I'm totally, totally worried.
But after a while it's like,

Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?
Just curious.
- I thought that I saw something.
- You...
Oh.
You're insane, actually.
Or suicidal.
That homeboy could've been a psycho.
I was about to end up in an FBI interview room like some lame TV show.
God, that was such a rush.
Awesome.
So you're an adrenaline junkie now?
That's cool.
You can go bungee jumping.
You don't get on the back of some random loser's motorcycle.
Crazy.
BELLA:
Alice, I saw him.
Maybe I'm crazy now.
I guess that's okay.
If a rush of danger is what it takes to see him, then that's what I'll find.
Bella!
Where the hell have you been, loca?
(BELLA LAUGHING)

Wow.

- That's right.
- Since when are you into motorcycles?
- Since now.
I get it if you think that this is really stupid and reckless.
Yeah, I mean, it's completely stupid and reckless.
When do we start?
Um.
Now.
- Please?
- (CHUCKLES) All right.
Oh, hey, be careful.
Those things are actually really heavy, so...
Jake, you're, like, buff.
How did that happen?
You're, like, 16.
I don't get it.
Mmm-hmm.
Age is just a number, baby.
What are you, like, 40 now?
It feels like that sometimes.

That song's good.
You don't like it?
I don't really like music anymore, kind of.
Okay.
No more music.
So I was thinking, if we're gonna do this every day, and hopefully we will, we have to, like, fit some homework in there somewhere.
I don't want Billy thinking that I'm a bad influence on you.
You?
Influence me?
Please.
Are you...
I'm older than you, so that makes me the influencer and you the influence.
(LAUGHS) No, no, no.
My size and knowledge base actually makes me older than you because of your general paleness and lack of know-how.
I convinced you to build two-wheeled death machines with me.
Don't you think that makes you kind of young and naïve?
Okay.
So where do we stand?
- I'm 35.
And you might be, like, 32.
- Come on.

- Hi.
I'm Quil Ateara.
So the bike building story is true.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I taught him everything he knows.
What about the part where you're his girlfriend?
Uh...
We're friends, you know.
- (LAUGHS) Burn.
- Actually, remember I said she's a girl and a friend.
Embry, do you remember him making that distinction?
Nope.
So you guys have girlfriends?
That's awesome.
(JACOB LAUGHING)
Yeah, right.
Quil's actually taking his cousin to prom.
Yeah, that's still a riot.

Can I ask you something?
Hanging out with Jacob, that seems to take your mind off things a bit, doesn't it?
You know, sometimes you gotta learn to love what's good for you.
You know what I mean?
Of course, what do I know?
I'm just a terminal bachelor.

Okay.
I'm gonna go to bed.
Uh...
I love you.
If I told you I couldn't have fixed these bikes, what would you have said?
Are you doubting your mad skills?
No.
Definitely not.
I mean, they'll run fine.
It's just, maybe if I was smart, I would have dragged out the rebuild a bit.
If you told me you couldn't fix these bikes, I would say that that's really too bad, but that we're just gonna have to find something else to do.
(LAUGHS)
Is that Sam Uley?
Yeah.

He missed some school.
Now all of a sudden, he started following Sam around like a little puppy.
Same thing happened with Paul and Jared.
Sam keeps giving me this look, like he's waiting for me or something.
It's kind of starting to freak me out.
Well, you should just avoid him.

Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah, I do.
Cool.

I mean, that's an action movie.
Yeah, that's perfect.

That's my thing.

Face Punch, yeah!

Not really.

He probably has that flu that's going around.
What?
I can't hold your hand?
No, of course you can.
I just think it means, you know, something a little different to you.
So...
Okay, well, tell me something.
You like me, right?
And you think I'm sort of beautiful?
(SOFTLY) Jacob, please, don't do this.
(BELLA SIGHS)
Why?
Because you're about to ruin everything.
And I need you.
(SIGHS)
Well, I've got loads of time.
I'm not gonna give up.
I don't want you to, but it's just 'cause I don't want you to go anywhere.
And that's really selfish.
You know, I'm not like a car that you can fix up.
I'm never gonna run right.
So I should be fair to you.
It's because of him, right?

I know what he did to you.
But, Bella, I would never ever do that.
I won't ever hurt you.
I promise.
I won't let you down.

You want me to put you in the hospital?

You're really hot.
Like, you feel like you have a fever.

I'm sorry about what I said at the movie theater.
I just wanted to hear your voice, so no pressure.
Jacob, please...

Okay.
We should be back around 3:00.

Hey.
Look, I don't have to go fishing today.
Yes, you do.
Yeah, you do.
Go.
What are you talking about?
Just be careful.
Always am.
Those bears won't get the drop on me, Bella.
My kung fu is strong.
Jake!
Hey!
You cut your hair off?
And got a tattoo?
Bella.
I thought you were too sick to come outside or pick up the phone when I call.
Go away.
What?
Go away.
What happened to you?
What's...
Hey!
What happened?
Did Sam get to you?
Is that what's happening?
Sam's trying to help me.
Don't blame him.
But if you want somebody to blame, how about those filthy bloodsuckers you love, the Cullens?
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
You've been lying to everyone.
Charlie.
But you can't lie to me.
- Not anymore, Bella.
- SAM:
Jacob!
Jacob!
Look, Bella, we can't be friends anymore.
(CRYING) Look, Jake, I know that I've been hurting you.
It's killing me.
It kills me.
I just need...
Maybe give me, like,
- some time or something.
- Look, don't.
It's not you.
It's not you, it's me, right?
Really?
It's true.
It is me.
I'm not good.
I used to be a good kid.
Not anymore.
This doesn't even matter.
All right?
This is over.
You can't break up with me.
I mean...
I mean, you're my best friend.
You promised me.
I know.
I promised I wouldn't hurt you, Bella.
And this is me keeping that promise.
Go home and don't come back or you're gonna get hurt.
BELLA:
Alice, things are...
Things are bad again.
Without Jake, I just...
I can't stand it.
I don't see Edward anymore.
Will it really feel like he never existed?
I will find the place where I can see him again.
(SOBBING)
Bella.
Laurent.
I didn't expect to find you here.
I went to visit the Cullens, but the house is empty.
I'm surprised they left you behind.
Weren't you sort of a pet of theirs?
Yeah.
You could say that.
Do the Cullens visit often?
Lie.
(GASPS)
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.
Lie better.
I'll tell them that you stopped by.
But I probably shouldn't tell Edward,
'cause he's pretty protective.
But he's far away, isn't he?
Why are you here?
I came as a favor to Victoria.
- Victoria?
- She asked me to see if you were still under the protection of the Cullens.
Victoria feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate, given he killed hers.
An eye for an eye.
Threaten him.
Edward would know who did it.
And he'd come after you.
I don't think he will.
After all, how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected?
(LAURENT SIGHS)
Victoria won't be happy about my killing you, but I can't help myself.
You are so mouth-watering.
- Please, don't.
I mean, you helped us.
- No, no, no, no.
(SHUSHING)
Don't be afraid.
I'm doing you a kindness.
(SOFTLY) Victoria plans on killing you slowly, painfully, whereas I'll make it quick.
I promise.
You will feel nothing.
Edward, I love you.

I saw them.
- What's the matter?
- In the woods.
They're not bears.
- What do you mean "in the woods"?
Bell, what the hell were you doing out in the woods?
They're wolves.
I mean, they're like huge wolves.
Are you sure about that, Bella?
Yeah!
I just saw them.
They were after something.
(HARRY CLEARS THROAT)
Wolves?
You saw them?
All right, well, Harry, feel like going hunting?
Get some of your guys together?
Sure, yeah, I'll just...
BELLA:
By now, those wolves will be dead, and Laurent would have told her I'm unprotected.
Victoria.
I should go to the station.
Yeah, you should.
You should go.

Can you just stay in the house?

Hey.
Look, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- I wish I could explain.
But I literally can't.
(SIGHS)
Have you ever had a secret you couldn't tell anyone, one that wasn't yours to share?
Well, that's what it's like for me.
But worse.
You have no idea how tight I'm bound.
I hate this.
I hate what they've done to you.
I mean, the killer part is, you already know.
Bella, do you remember when we walked on the beach at La Push?
The...
The story.
The story about the cold ones.
I guess I understand why that's the only part you remember.
There's gotta be something that you can do.
No.
I'm in it for life.
Well, maybe we should just get out of here for a while.
Just leave, just you and me.
You'd do that?
I would do it for you.
It's not something I can just run away from, Bella.
But I would run away with you
if I could.
I gotta go.
They'll start wondering where I am.
Come here.
(SOFTLY) Please, try to remember.
It'd be so much easier if you knew.
I'll try.
But, Jake...
Jake, what are you doing?
Wait, Jake.
(GASPS)
Jake.
(GASPS)
Edward, I'm scared.
You should be.
JACOB:
Really, it's just like an old story.
I'm not really supposed to say anything about it.
Did you know Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?
(WEREWOLF SNARLS)
Bella?
I need to see him.
He's not in.
- Okay, I'm sorry, I really need to see him.
- Bella!
What did you do?
- Okay, what did you do?
- Hey.
- What did you do to him?
- Easy!
He didn't want this.
What did we do?
What did he do?
What'd he tell you?
- Both of you calm down.
- Nothing.
He tells me nothing because he's scared of you.
(SNICKERING)
- Too late now.
- SAM:
Bella, get back!
(PAUL GROWLING SOFTLY)

Paul, calm down, now!
Bella!

Hey!
Take Bella back to Emily's place.
EMBRY:

BELLA:
Alice, is it possible that everything is true?
The fairy tales and horror stories?
Is it possible that there isn't anything sane or normal at all?
(BOTH WHOOP)
Hey, I think we should go back and see if Jacob's okay.
I hope Paul sinks some teeth in him.
Serves him right.
No way.
Jacob's a natural.
You see him phase on the fly?
I got five says Paul doesn't touch him.
Come on in, Bella.
We won't bite.
Speak for yourself.

Who's this?

Bella Swan.
Who else?
Hmm.
So, you're the vampire girl.
So, you're the wolf girl.
Guess so.
Well, I'm engaged to one.
Save some for your brothers.
And ladies first.
Muffin?
Sure.
Thanks.
Leave it to Jacob to find a way around Sam's gag order.
He didn't say anything to me.
That's a wolf thing.
Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want them to or not.
And check it out.
We can hear each other's thoughts.
Would you shut up?
These are trade secrets.
Damn it!
This chick runs with vampires.
You can't really run with vampires.
(EMILY GIGGLES)
'Cause they're fast.
Yeah?
Well, we're faster.

You're not the first monsters I've met.
SAM:
Jake's right.
You're good with weird.
Hey.
(EMILY GIGGLING)
Sorry.
So you're a werewolf?
Yeah.
Last time I checked.
A few lucky members of the tribe have the gene.
A bloodsucker moves into town and the fever sets in.
Mono.
Yeah.
I wish.
Well, can't you find a way to just stop?
I mean, it's wrong.
It's not a lifestyle choice, Bella.
I was born this way.
I can't help it.
You're such a hypocrite.
What, I'm not the right kind of monster for you?
It's not what you are.
It's what you do.
They never hurt anybody.
You've killed people, Jake.
Bella, we're not killing anyone.
Then who is?
What we're trying to protect you people from, the only thing we do kill,
vampires.
Wait, Jake, you can't.
Don't worry.
We can't touch your little precious Cullens unless they violate the treaty.
That's not what I'm saying.
You can't kill vampires.
They'll...
They'll kill you.
Really?
We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough.
(WEREWOLVES GROWLING)
Laurent?
And his red-headed girlfriend is next.
Victoria's here?
Was.
We chased her all the way to the Canadian border the other night.
She keeps coming back.
We don't know what she's after.
I do.
Me.
Don't worry.
We've got this place covered.
She won't get near you or Charlie.
Look, you've got to be careful.
She's fast.
You don't know how fast she is.
You know, your lack of confidence in us is a little insulting.
All right, I'd better go.
You gotta go?
Yeah.
Got a vampire to kill.
BELLA:
Alice, I'm all right.
Until I'm alone.
And lately, that's all the time.
Jacob's gone.
He's hunting Victoria.
And Charlie's hunting Jacob.
And you're gone.
And so is Edward.
And there's just nothing now.
You got something, Harry?
Nope.
Nothing.
But I realize where I have to go, what I have to do to see him again.

Get her home!
I'm gonna go help out over at Harry's place.

I can smell it.
I'm getting you out of here.
That's Carlisle's car.
They're here.
Bella, it's a trick!
Stop!
You gotta come with me!
(BELLA GRUNTS)
They won't hurt me.
If a Cullen is back here, this is their territory.
Treaty says we can only defend on our own lands.
- I can't protect you here.
- Okay.
That's okay.
You don't have to.
You're about to cross a line.
Then don't draw one.
Please?

- Oh, my God!
What are you...
- Bella!
I'm sorry, I just, I can't believe you're here.
Is...
Would you like to explain to me how you're alive?
What?
I saw a vision of you.
You jumped off a cliff.
Why in the hell would you try and kill yourself?
I mean, what about Charlie?
- What about...
- I didn't try to kill myself.
I was cliff jumping.
Recreationally.
It was fun.
(EXHALES)
I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy.
Does...
Did you tell him?
No.
He only calls in once every few months.
He said he wants to be alone.
Bella, what is that God-awful wet dog smell?
Um...
That's probably me.
Or it's Jacob.
Jacob who?
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.
Bella!
Werewolves are not good company to keep.
Speak for yourself.
I had to see you were safe.
I thought you couldn't protect me here.
Guess I don't care.
Well, I'm not gonna hurt her.
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.
I'm talking about the other bloodsucker who tried to kill Bella because of you.
Victoria?
Yeah, Victoria's been around.
I didn't see her.
I didn't see you get pulled out of the water, either.
I can't see past you and your pack of mutts.
Don't get me upset...
- Hey, stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
- Or things are gonna get very ugly.
I'll give you a minute.
Hey.
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna come back,
- right?
- As soon as you put the dog out.
Is he...
Are there others?
How many Cullens are here and how long are they staying?
No.
It's just Alice.
And she can stay as long as she'd like.
Well, are the rest coming back?
No.
Not that I know of.

He's going to the Volturi.
He wants to die, too.

He didn't want you anymore.

No, I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt.
What about your dad?

- I'm here.
You're alive.
Yes.
I needed to make you see me once.
You had to know that I was alive, that you didn't have to feel guilty about anything.
I can let you go now.
I never acted out of guilt.
I just couldn't live in a world where you don't exist.
- But you said...
- I lied.
I had to lie.
But you believed me so easily.
Because it doesn't make sense for you to love me.
I mean, I'm nothing.
I'm human.
I'm nothing.
Bella, you're everything to me.
You're everything.

The girl comes with us.
No.
You can go to hell.

It's a festival.
You wouldn't want to make a scene.
We wouldn't.

And now you know everything.
So get on with it.
You are quite a soul reader yourself, Edward.
Though you can't read Bella's thoughts.
Fascinating.
I would love to see if you are an exception to my gifts, as well.
Would you do me the honor?
Interesting.
Hmm.
I see nothing.
I wonder if...
Let us see if she's immune to all our powers.
Shall we, Jane?
- No!
- Pain.

Stop!
Please!
Stop!

Please!
No!
No!
Please, please!

You would give up your life for someone like us.
A vampire.
A soulless monster.
Just get away from her!
You don't know a thing about his soul.

This is a sadness.
If only it were your intention to give her immortality.
Wait!
Bella will be one of us.
I've seen it.
I'll change her myself.
Mesmerizing.
To see what you have seen before it has happened.
Your gifts will make for an intriguing immortal,
Isabella.
Go now.
Make your preparations.
Let us be done with this.
Heidi will arrive any moment.
Thank you for your visit.

We do not offer second chances.

Stop!

You're here.
You can sleep.
I'll still be here when you wake up.
Bella, the only reason I left was because I thought I was protecting you.
I needed you to have a chance at a normal, happy life.
It was so easy for you to leave.
Leaving you was the hardest thing I've done in 100 years.
(SIGHING)
And I swear,
I will never fail you again.
I'm so sorry.
- Charlie's coming.
- Hey.
You okay?
I'm fine.
Dad, you don't have to worry.
You know, last time you said that, you took off.
I didn't see you for three days.
I'm really sorry, Dad.
Bella, do not ever do that to me again.
Ever.
And you're grounded for the rest of your life.
Okay.
I'm not technically breaking any of his rules.
He did say I couldn't take a step inside the door.
I came in through the window.
He's not gonna forgive me easily.
I know.
Can you?
I hope you can, 'cause I honestly don't know how to live without you.
Come here.
Once Alice changes me, you can't get rid of me.
She won't need to change you.
There are always ways to keep the Volturi in the dark.
No.
No.
You all know what I want.
And I know how much I'm asking for.
The only thing that I can think of for it to be fair is to just vote.
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Shut up.
Alice?
I already consider you my sister.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
JASPER:
I vote "yes."
It would be nice to not want to kill you all the time.
Hmm.
ROSALIE:
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry to both of you for how I've acted, and I'm really grateful that you were brave enough to go and save my brother.
But this isn't a life I would have chosen for myself.
And I wish that there'd been someone to vote "no" for me.
So, no.
I vote "Hell, yeah."
And we can pick a fight with these Volturi some other way.
I already consider you a part of the family.
Yes.
(DR. CULLEN SIGHS)
Why are you doing this to me?
You know what this means.
You've chosen not to live without her, which leaves me no choice.
I won't lose my son.
BELLA:
I'll wait until after graduation to make it easier on Charlie.
Edward, I want you to be the one to do it.
(TIRES SCREECH)
He wants to talk to me.
JACOB:
So you're still alive for now.
EDWARD:
He thinks it's me keeping you away.
JACOB:
You stay the hell out of my head.
Jacob, I know you have something to say to me.
But I want to say something to you first, if that's all right.
Thank you.
Thank you for keeping Bella alive when I didn't.
No.
You didn't.
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.
I'm still grateful.
But I'm here now.
I'm not gonna leave her side until she orders me away.
We'll see.
Hey, my turn to talk.
I'm here to remind you about a key point in the treaty.
I haven't forgotten.
What key point?
If any of them bites a human, the truce is over.
But if I choose it, it has nothing to do with you.
No.
No, I won't let you.
You're not gonna be one of them, Bella.
It's not up to you.
You know what we'll do to you.
I won't have a choice.
Bella, please, come.
Wait.
Is he gonna hurt me?
Read his mind.
Jake,
I love you.
(JACOB BREATHES DEEPLY)
So, please,
don't make me choose,
'cause it'll be him.
It's always been him.
Bella...
- Goodbye, Jacob.
- No, you don't speak for her!
(GROWLING)
(ROARS)
Bella, get out of here.
BELLA:
Stop!
Stop!
You can't hurt each other without hurting me.
Jake.
He's right.
You shouldn't become what I am.
I can't do this alone.
Then, please, just wait.
Just give me five years.
That's too long.
(SIGHS)
Then three?
You're so stubborn.
What are you waiting for?
I have one condition if you want me to do it myself.
What's the condition?
And then forever.
That's what I'm asking.
Marry me, Bella.

"which, as they kiss, consume."
Gran?
Edward, don't!
She'll see you.
Hmm.
Okay.
Gran, I'd like you to meet...
Happy birthday, Bella.
Happy birthday.
I thought we agreed, no presents.
Well, the one from me's not wrapped, so it doesn't count.
That's actually great.
Thanks, Dad.
It goes with this one from your mom.
We coordinated.
Well, she coordinated me.
It's to put your pictures in from senior year.
Senior year.
-How'd you get so old so fast?
-l didn't.
It's not that old.
I don't know.
Is that a gray hair?
No.
No way.
Happy birthday.
That's really funny.
Another missing hiker brings the total to three presumed dead.
Rangers are searching for the killer animal...
Situation's a!
critica!
You've got to look first before you go
It's Bella.
Bella!
-Hi.
- I'm...
Today's the big day, Bella.
A and J essay due.
-Oh, yeah.
-Wherefore art thou, Bella?
)
Let me take a picture of you guys.
My mom wants me to put together, like, a scrapbook full of memories.
Oh.
Cool.
Yeah.
I take them.
I'm not in them.
-No, no, no, come here.
- Well, you are today.
You'll photoshop this if my nose looks big, right?
Don't worry, I'm in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.
That's good.
Oh, good.
Cullen's here.
Well, talk to you later.
-Happy birthday.
-Don't remind me.
Mmm.
Bella, your birth is definitely something to celebrate.
-Yeah, but my aging's not.
-Your aging?
I think 18 is a little young to start worrying about that.
Its one year older than you.
No, it isn't.
I'm 109.
Well, maybe I shouldn't be dating such an old man.
-Mmm.
-It's gross.
I should be thoroughly repulsed.
Uh-huh.
-We have to go to class.
-Okay.
Wait a second.
Someone wants you.
- Bella!
-Jacob!
What?
I'll leave you to talk.
Hello, biceps!
You know, anabolic steroids are really bad for you.
Well, I'm just filling out, Bella.
You know, it wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more.
You should switch schools.
You can come hang out with the palefaces.
I'm all right.
I prefer the rez school's exclusivity.
They let any old riffraff into this place.
-I see.
Then why are you slumming it?
-Mmm-hmm.
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.
You should really come take a ride when it's done.
Is it fast?
Um.
It's decent.
-I'm kidding.
-Okay.
Good.
Hey, happy birthday.
Your dad told my dad, so...
Yeah, of course he did.
I saw this the other day and thought of you.
Catches bad dreams.
That's kind of perfect.
Thank you.
No problem.
-Good seeing you.
-Yeah, I'll see you later.
Bye.
So how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?
Because I have nothing to give back to you.
Bella, you give me everything just by breathing.
See?
Thank you.
-That's all I want.
- Bella!
-Happy birthday!
-Shh, shh!
I thought I said no presents.
I've already seen you open it, and guess what, you love it.
You're gonna wear it tonight.
Our place.
Come on.
Please?
It'll be fun.
-Okay.
All right.
-Great!
Okay, I'll see you at 7:00.
Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing.
)
Sorry, Bella.
Happy...
Never mind.
You can't trust vampires.
Trust me.
O my love!
My wife!
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Thou art not conquered.
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks.
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
I hate being celebrated.
There are worse tragedies.
I mean, look at Romeo.
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.
Yeah.
Though I do envy him one thing.
Juliet is, like, perfect.
If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.
Not the girl, the suicide.
It's nearly impossible for...
For some people.
For humans, a little poison, a dagger to the heart.
There's so many different options.
Why would you say that?
Because I had to consider it once.
I didn't know if I'd get to you in time.
I had to come up with some kind of plan.
What was the plan?
That I'd go to Italy and provoke the Volturi.
-The what?
-The Volturi.
.
Now, who'd like to repeat the last few lines of iambic pentameter just to show they were paying attention?
Mr. Cullen?
Yes, Mr. Berty.
"O here will I set up my everlasting rest
"and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.
"Eyes, look your last.
"Arms, take your last embrace!
"And, lips, O you, the doors of breath,
"seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death!"
Eyes on the screen, people.
Thus with a kiss I die.
The Volturi are a very old, very powerful family.
I guess they're the closest thing to royalty my world has.
-Is that Carlisle?
-Yeah.
He lived with them for a few decades.
Described them as very refined.
No respect for human life, of course, but a respect for the arts and the sciences, at least.
And the law.
Above all, the law.
Vampires have laws?
Not very many.
And only one that's regularly enforced.
What is it?
That we keep the existence of our kind a secret.
We don't make spectacles of ourselves, and we don't kill conspicuously.
Unless, of course, you want to die.
You gotta stop talking about that.
I can't even think about someone hurting you.
Bella, the only thing that can hurt me is you.
And I don't have anything else to be afraid of.
That's not true.
Victoria?
She'll come for me one day.
Alice will see when she decides, and we'll be ready.
I could protect you if you change me.
Bella, you already do protect me.
You're my only reason to stay alive, if that's what I am.
But it's my job to protect you.
From everyone except my sister.
It's time!
It's time.
It's time.
It's time!
Your lips are nettles
Your tongue is wine
You're left as liquid But your body's pine
.
Sorry about all this.
-We tried to rein Alice in.
-As if that were even possible.
-Happy birthday, Bella.
-Thanks.
I found it in your bag.
You mind?
Dating an older woman.
Hot.
-What?
-You first, Rosalie.
It's a necklace.
Alice picked it out.
Thanks.
Show me the love.
This one's from Emmett.
Already installed it in your truck.
Finally a decent sound system
-for that piece of...
-Hey!
Don't hate the truck.
)
Open Esme and Carlisle's.
.
Just a little something to brighten your day.
Yes, you've been looking kind of pale lately.
Ow.
Paper cut.
Jaz, Jaz.
It's okay.
It's just a little blood.
.
Get Jasper out of here.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.
Check on Jasper.
I'm sure he's very upset with himself, and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.
Edward.
I never wanted to have a party.
.
It's not your fault.
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.
How do you do it?
Years and years of practice.
Did you ever think of just doing it the easy way?
No.
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.
It brings me happiness, even if I am damned regardless.
Damned?
Like hell?
Carlisle, you couldn't be damned.
You couldn't.
It's impossible.
Thank you, Bella.
You've always been very gracious about us.
So that's it?
That's why he won't change me?
Imagine the situation in reverse.
Hmm.
If you believed as Edward does, could you take away his soul?
You can't protect me from everything.
At some point, something's gonna separate us.
It's gonna be an accident or illness or old age,
as long as I'm human.
And the only solution is to change me.
That's not a solution.
That's a tragedy.
You're not gonna want me when I look like a grandmother.
Bella, do you not understand my feelings for you at all?
Carlisle told me
how you feel about your soul.
I don't believe that.
So don't worry about mine.
You should go inside.
It's still my birthday.
So can I ask one thing?
Kiss me?
I love you.
Up with your turret
Aren't we just terrified?
Shale, screen your worry
From what you won't ever find
Don't let it fool you
Down
Hey.
Just come take a walk with me.
We have to leave Forks.
Why?
Carlisle's supposed to be 1 0 years older than he looks, and people are starting to notice.
Okay, I've gotta think of something to say to Charlie.
When you say "we"...
I mean my family and myself.
Edward, what happened with Jasper, it's nothing.
You're right.
It was nothing, nothing but what I always expected and nothing compared to what could have happened.
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.
I belong with you.
No.
You don't.
I'm coming.
Bella,
I don't want you to come.
You don't want me?
No.
That changes things a lot.
But if it's not too much to ask, can you just promise me something?
Don't do anything reckless.
For Charlie's sake.
And I'll promise something to you in return.
This is the last time you'll ever see me.
I won't come back, and you can go on with your life without any interference from me.
It will be like I never existed, I promise.
If this is about my soul, take it.
I don't want it without you.
It's not about your soul.
You're just not good for me.
Not good enough for you.
I'm just sorry I let this go on for so long.
Please...
Don't...
Goodbye.
Edward.
Edward!
Edward.
I'm gonna try the Cullens' place again.
- The Cullens left town, Charlie.
-Good riddance.
Where'd they go?
We'll find her, Charlie.
-Thanks, Harry.
-Charlie!
Hey.
She's all right.
I got her.
Thank you, Sam.
There's a possibility
All that I had
Was all I'm gonna get
Alice, you've disappeared, like everything else.
Now who else can I talk to?
I'm lost.
When you left, and he left,
you took everything with you.
But the absence of him is everywhere I look.
It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest.
Bella.
But in a way I'm glad.
The pain is my only reminder that he was real, that you all were.
All right.
That's it.
What?
You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother.
I'm not leaving Forks.
Bells, he's not coming back.
I know.
It's just not normal, this behavior.
Quite frankly, it's scaring the hell out of me and your mother.
Baby, I don't want you to leave.
I don't, but just go.
Go to Jacksonville.
Make some new friends.
I like my old friends.
-Well, you never see them anymore.
-I do.
I'm gonna go shopping tomorrow with Jessica.
-You hate shopping.
-I...
I need a girls' night out.
All right.
Girls' night.
Shopping.
I like it.
Go buy some stuff.
Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.
Yeah, Bella Swan.
I don't know why you want to sit through all those zombies eating people and no hot guys kissing anybody.
It's gross.
Like...
And why are there that many zombie movies anyway?
'Cause if it's supposed to, like, draw a parallel about leprosy, my cousin had leprosy.
It's not funny, you know?
And, like, is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism?
Because don't be so pleased with your own, like, self-referential cleverness, you know?
Like, some girls like to shop.
Not all girls, apparently.
Although I was surprised you even called at all.
You know?
Like, your depression thing, I get it.
I'm totally, totally worried.
But after a while it's like,
-you're still bumming...
- You want a ride, girls?
...and I'm going through stuff, too.
You know?
Like Mike deciding he just wants to be friends.
What's up?
Look what we found.
It's hard, you know?
Like, and since when does "just friends"... 1 :
What's up guys?
2:
Look what we found.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, where you going?
Keep walking.
This is dangerous.
-Dude, come on.
- Come here for a sec!
I think I know those guys.
We got beer!
We got bikes!
Well, they seem great.
Can we go?
I'm just gonna see something.
Hey, girlie!
All right, all right.
We got a taker.
Turn around.
2:
Shut up!
3:
You shut up!
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
No, that's cool.
I'll be whoever you want me to be, honey.
So, what do you say?
You promised me, nothing reckless.
You promised it would be as if you never existed.
-You lied.
-You say something, babe?
You know what?
Never mind.
Stop!
Stop, stop, stop!
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?
Just curious.
-l thought that I saw something.
-You...
Oh.
You're insane, actually.
Or suicidal.
That homeboy could've been a psycho.
I was about to end up in an interview room like some lame show.
God, that was such a rush.
Awesome.
So you're an adrenaline junkie now?
That's cool.
You can go bungee jumping.
You don't get on the back of some random loser's motorcycle.
Crazy.
Alice, I saw him.
Maybe I'm crazy now.
I guess that's okay.
If a rush of danger is what it takes to see him, then that's what I'll find.
Bella!
Where the hell have you been, loca?
I brought you something.
-Okay.
-It's a little crazy.
Wow.
Scrap metal.
You shouldn't have.
I saved it from the junkyard.
I think they'll probably cost more to fix than they're worth, but then I thought that if I had a mechanic friend
-to help me out then...
-Ah!
-Me being the mechanic-type friend?
-That's right.
-Since when are you into motorcycles?
-Since now.
I get it if you think that this is really stupid and reckless.
Yeah, I mean, it's completely stupid and reckless.
When do we start?
Um.
Now.
-Please?
- All right.
Oh, hey, be careful.
Those things are actually really heavy, so...
Jake, you're, like, buff.
How did that happen?
You're, like, 16.
I don't get it.
Mmm-hmm.
Age is just a number, baby.
What are you, like, 40 now?
It feels like that sometimes.
That song's good.
You don't like it?
I don't really like music anymore, kind of.
Okay.
No more music.
So I was thinking, if we're gonna do this every day, and hopefully we will, we have to, like, fit some homework in there somewhere.
I don't want Billy thinking that I'm a bad influence on you.
You?
Influence me?
Please.
Are you...
I'm older than you, so that makes me the influencer and you the influence.
No, no, no.
My size and knowledge base actually makes me older than you because of your general paleness and lack of know-how.
I convinced you to build two-wheeled death machines with me.
Don't you think that makes you kind of young and naive?
Okay.
So where do we stand?
-I'm 35.
And you might be, like, 32.
-Come on.
- Yo, Jake, you in there?
-It's okay.
It's just my boys.
-Hey, Jake.
-Hey.
Guys, this is Bella.
-Bella, that's Quil and Embry.
-Hi.
I'm Quil Ateara.
So the bike building story is true.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I taught him everything he knows.
What about the part where you're his girlfriend?
Uh...
We're friends, you know.
- Burn.
-Actually, remember I said she's a girl and a friend.
Embry, do you remember him making that distinction?
Nope.
So you guys have girlfriends?
That's awesome.
Yeah, right.
Quil's actually taking his cousin to prom.
Yeah, that's still a riot.
You want funny, Black?
I'll give you funny.
Jeez.
Hey, that hold's illegal!
I got five bucks on Quil.
You're on.
All of the astronauts Champagne in plastic cups
Waiting for the big hero to show
Outside the door he stands His head in his hands
And his heart in his throat
What can he tell them now
Dear Alice,
I wish I had your real address.
I wish I could tell you about Jake.
He makes me feel better.
I mean, he makes me feel alive.
The hole in my chest, well, when I'm with Jake, it's like it's almost healed
for a while.
So, Quil keeps asking to come over.
I think he likes you a little too much.
Oh.
Well, I'm really not into the whole cougar thing.
You know?
What's up with you and age?
I mean, how old was that Cullen guy, anyway?
But even Jake can't keep the dreams away.
Hey, hey, hey!
Wake up, Bella.
You're okay.
You're okay.
I thought this thing was starting to work, but I guess not.
Can I ask you something?
Hanging out with Jacob, that seems to take your mind off things a bit, doesn't it?
You know, sometimes you gotta learn to love what's good for you.
You know what I mean?
Of course, what do I know?
I'm just a terminal bachelor.
Famous ladies' man.
Okay.
I'm gonna go to bed.
Uh...
I love you.
If I told you I couldn't have fixed these bikes, what would you have said?
Are you doubting your mad skills?
No.
Definitely not.
I mean, they'll run fine.
It's just, maybe if I was smart, I would have dragged out the rebuild a bit.
If you told me you couldn't fix these bikes, I would say that that's really too bad, but that we're just gonna have to find something else to do.
Is that Sam Uley?
Yeah.
Him and his cult.
Oh, my God.
Did you see that?
They're not really fighting, Bella.
They're cliff diving.
Scary as hell, but a total rush.
-A rush?
-Most of us jump from lower down.
We leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples.
You have some kind of beef with him or something?
I don't know.
They just think they run this place.
Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids.
-Now look at him.
-That's Embry?
-Yeah.
-What happened to him?
He missed some school.
Now all of a sudden, he started following Sam around like a little puppy.
Same thing happened with Paul and Jared.
Sam keeps giving me this look, like he's waiting for me or something.
It's kind of starting to freak me out.
Well, you should just avoid him.
I try.
Okay.
-You look scared.
-I'm not.
All right.
-Brake?
-That one.
Clutch?
Good.
Gas?
Ready?
Now, slowly release the clutch.
Bella.
Stop.
Whoa!
You all right?
I'm gonna go again.
Okay.
Ah!
Whoa!
Hit the brake!
I wanna go again.
Are you trying to get yourself killed?
-No. I want to go again.
-No.
Forget it.
No more bikes.
Man, your head.
Ow.
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
What, you're apologizing for bleeding?
Yeah.
I guess I am.
Well, it's just blood, Bella.
No big deal.
There.
What are you staring at?
You're sort of beautiful.
How hard did you hit your head?
I don't know.
Let's go.
I did see something in the woods.
Totally.
Baby, I believe you.
No, he doesn't.
He's just trying to get lucky.
No, okay.
It was jet black and huge.
On all fours, it was still taller than a person.
A bear, maybe?
Or an alien.
You're lucky you didn't get probed.
Well, I saw it.
You know, you're not the only one.
My dad's been getting reports at the station.
Like, five hikers have been killed by some bear.
But they can't find the bear.
Hmm.
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.
Um...
So?
I mean,
Bella's back?
Yeah, I guess so.
All right, that's...
Well, welcome.
So, listen, now that you're talking and eating again, which, you know, you've got to get that protein in there,
I was just wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me.
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah, I do.
Cool.
Let me see, we could check out
Love Spelled Backwards Is Love.
You know, it's a dumb title, but it's a romantic comedy.
-I mean, it's supposed to be pretty...
-No.
No romance.
How about Face Punch?
Have you heard of that?
I mean, that's an action movie.
Yeah, that's perfect.
Guns, adrenaline.
That's my thing.
Okay.
We should get a bunch of people to go.
Do you guys want to go see Face Punch?
Face Punch, yeah!
Mike, hey, we were supposed to watch that.
Remember, the trailer's like...
-"Punch faces."
-I remember.
Yeah!
Movie night with Bella.
So Face Punch, huh?
You like action movies?
Not really.
I heard it sucks.
Bad.
Are you even old enough to see this movie?
I mean, you know, without, like, adult supervision.
Right, yeah, well, she's buying my ticket for me.
She's buying it.
Okay.
Jessica bailed, and Angela got the stomach flu, so Eric's taking care of her.
-It's just us three.
-Great!
-Great.
-Yeah.
1 Put your gun down.
2 Put your gun down or I'm gonna blow your frickin' head off.
3 Both of you put both of your guns down or I'm gonna blow both of your frickin' heads off.
1 All right, forget it, let's do this!
Okay, I think I'm gonna throw up.
He's...
What a marshmallow!
You should hold out for someone with a stronger stomach.
Someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit.
Yeah.
I'll keep my eye open for that.
I feel bad.
He probably has that flu that's going around.
What?
I can't hold your hand?
No, of course you can.
I just think it means, you know, something a little different to you.
So...
Okay, well, tell me something.
You like me, right?
And you think I'm sort of beautiful?
Jacob, please, don't do this.
Why?
Because you're about to ruin everything.
And I need you.
Well, I've got loads of time.
I'm not gonna give up.
I don't want you to, but it's just 'cause I don't want you to go anywhere.
And that's really selfish.
You know, I'm not like a car that you can fix up.
I'm never gonna run right.
So I should be fair to you.
It's because of him, right?
Look,
I know what he did to you.
But, Bella, I would never ever do that.
I won't ever hurt you. I promise.
I won't let you down.
You can count on me.
Well,
I need to go home.
I was feeling sick before the movie.
Okay?
What is your problem?
Right now?
You're my problem.
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.
You want me to put you in the hospital?
Jake!
Jake.
Jake, the movie's over.
What are you doing?
You're really hot.
Like, you feel like you have a fever.
Are you okay?
I don't know what's happening.
I gotta go.
That dude is weird.
Jake, your dad says you have mono.
He won't let me visit, but would you call me?
Hey, it's me again.
I just...
I'm sorry about what I said at the movie theater.
I just wanted to hear your voice, so no pressure.
Jacob, please...
Call me.
Okay.
We should be back around 3:00.
Hey.
Look, I don't have to go fishing today.
Yes, you do.
Yeah, you do.
Go.
What are you talking about?
Just be careful.
Always am.
Those bears won't get the drop on me, Bella.
My kung fu is strong.
Jake!
Hey!
You cut your hair off?
And got a tattoo?
Bella.
I thought you were too sick to come outside or pick up the phone when I call.
Go away.
What?
Go away.
What happened to you?
What's...
Hey!
What happened?
Did Sam get to you?
Is that what's happening?
Sam's trying to help me.
Don't blame him.
But if you want somebody to blame, how about those filthy bloodsuckers you love, the Cullens?
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
You've been lying to everyone.
Charlie.
But you can't lie to me.
-Not anymore, Bella.
- Jacob!
Jacob!
Look, Bella, we can't be friends anymore.
Look, Jake, I know that I've been hurting you.
It's killing me.
It kills me.
I just need...
Maybe give me, like,
-some time or something.
-Look, don't.
It's not you.
It's not you, it's me, right?
Really?
It's true.
It is me.
I'm not good.
I used to be a good kid.
Not anymore.
This doesn't even matter.
All right?
This is over.
You can't break up with me.
I mean... I mean, you're my best friend.
You promised me.
I know.
I promised I wouldn't hurt you, Bella.
And this is me keeping that promise.
Go home and don't come back or you're gonna get hurt.
Alice, things are...
Things are bad again.
Without Jake, I just...
I can't stand it.
I don't see Edward anymore.
Will it really feel like he never existed?
I will find the place where l can see him again.
Bella.
Laurent.
I didn't expect to find you here.
I went to visit the Cullens, but the house is empty.
I'm surprised they left you behind.
Weren't you sort of a pet of theirs?
Yeah.
You could say that.
Do the Cullens visit often?
Lie.
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.
Lie better.
I'll tell them that you stopped by.
But I probably shouldn't tell Edward,
'cause he's pretty protective.
But he's far away, isn't he?
Why are you here?
I came as a favor to Victoria.
-Victoria?
-She asked me to see if you were still under the protection of the Cullens.
Victoria feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate, given he killed hers.
An eye for an eye.
Threaten him.
Edward would know who did it.
And he'd come after you.
I don't think he will.
After all, how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected?
Victoria won't be happy about my killing you, but I can't help myself.
You are so mouth-watering.
-Please, don't. I mean, you helped us.
-No, no, no, no.
Don't be afraid.
I'm doing you a kindness.
Victoria plans on killing you slowly, painfully, whereas I'll make it quick.
I promise.
You will feel nothing.
Edward, I love you.
I don't believe it.
-Dad!
I saw them.
-What's the matter?
-In the woods.
They're not bears.
-What do you mean "in the woods"?
Bell, what the hell were you doing out in the woods?
They're wolves.
I mean, they're like huge wolves.
Are you sure about that, Bella?
Yeah!
I just saw them.
They were after something.
Wolves?
You saw them?
All right, well, Harry, feel like going hunting?
Get some of your guys together?
Sure, yeah, I'll just...
By now, those wolves will be dead, and Laurent would have told her I'm unprotected.
Victoria.
I should go to the station.
Yeah, you should.
You should go.
Can you just stay in the house?
Bella!
You scared me.
-What the hell are you doing?
-Back up.
I'm coming up.
Hey.
Look, I'm sorry.
-For what?
-l wish I could explain.
But I literally can't.
Have you ever had a secret you couldn't tell anyone, one that wasn't yours to share?
Well, that's what it's like for me.
But worse.
You have no idea how tight I'm bound.
I hate this.
I hate what they've done to you.
I mean, the killer part is, you already know.
Bella, do you remember when we walked on the beach at La Push?
The...
The story.
The story about the cold ones.
I guess I understand why that's the only part you remember.
There's gotta be something that you can do.
No.
I'm in it for life.
Well, maybe we should just get out of here for a while.
Just leave, just you and me.
You'd do that?
I would do it for you.
It's not something I can just run away from, Bella.
But I would run away with you
if I could.
I gotta go.
They'll start wondering where l am.
Come here.
Please, try to remember.
It'd be so much easier if you knew.
I'll try.
But, Jake...
Jake, what are you doing?
Wait, Jake.
Jake.
Edward, I'm scared.
You should be.
Really, it's just like an old story.
I'm not really supposed to say anything about it.
Did you know Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?
Bella?
I need to see him.
He's not in.
-Okay, I'm sorry, I really need to see him.
-Bella!
What did you do?
-Okay, what did you do?
-Hey.
-What did you do to him?
-Easy!
He didn't want this.
What did we do?
What did he do?
What'd he tell you?
-Both of you calm down.
-Nothing.
He tells me nothing because he's scared of you.
-Too late now.
- Bella, get back!
Paul, calm down, now!
Bella!
Run!
Jake, run!
Paul!
Hey!
Take Bella back to Emily's place.
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.
Alice, is it possible that everything is true?
The fairy tales and horror stories?
Is it possible that there isn't anything sane or normal at all?
Hey, I think we should go back and see if Jacob's okay.
I hope Paul sinks some teeth in him.
Serves him right.
No way.
Jacob's a natural.
You see him phase on the fly?
I got five says Paul doesn't touch him.
Come on in, Bella.
We won't bite.
Speak for yourself.
I done me wrong
And done all wrong
All the wrong I've done I'm sure I'll live quite long
Oh, hey, about Emily, Sam's fiancée?
Don't stare.
It bugs Sam.
Why would I stare?
Are you guys hungry?
Like I have to ask.
Who's this?
Bella Swan.
Who else?
Hmm.
So, you're the vampire girl.
So, you're the wolf girl.
Guess so.
Well, I'm engaged to one.
Save some for your brothers.
And ladies first.
Muffin?
Sure.
Thanks.
Leave it to Jacob to find a way around Sam's gag order.
He didn't say anything to me.
That's a wolf thing.
Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want them to or not.
And check it out.
We can hear each other's thoughts.
Would you shut up?
These are trade secrets.
Damn it!
This chick runs with vampires.
You can't really run with vampires.
'Cause they're fast.
Yeah?
Well, we're faster.
Freaked out yet?
You're not the first monsters I've met.
Jake's right.
You're good with weird.
Hey.
Sorry.
So you're a werewolf?
Yeah.
Last time I checked.
A few lucky members of the tribe have the gene.
A bloodsucker moves into town and the fever sets in.
Mono.
Yeah. I wish.
Well, can't you find a way to just stop?
I mean, it's wrong.
It's not a lifestyle choice, Bella.
I was born this way. I can't help it.
You're such a hypocrite.
What, I'm not the right kind of monster for you?
It's not what you are.
It's what you do.
They never hurt anybody.
You've killed people, Jake.
Bella, we're not killing anyone.
Then who is?
What we're trying to protect you people from, the only thing we do kill,
vampires.
Wait, Jake, you can't.
Don't worry.
We can't touch your little precious Cullens unless they violate the treaty.
That's not what I'm saying.
You can't kill vampires.
They'll...
They'll kill you.
Really?
We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough.
Laurent?
And his red-headed girlfriend is next.
Victoria's here?
Was.
We chased her all the way to the Canadian border the other night.
She keeps coming back.
We don't know what she's after.
I do.
Me.
Don't worry.
We've got this place covered.
She won't get near you or Charlie.
Look, you've got to be careful.
She's fast.
You don't know how fast she is.
You know, your lack of confidence in us is a little insulting.
All right, I'd better go.
You gotta go?
Yeah.
Got a vampire to kill.
Alice, I'm all right.
Until I'm alone.
And lately, that's all the time.
Jacob's gone.
He's hunting Victoria.
And Charlie's hunting Jacob.
And you're gone.
And so is Edward.
And there's just nothing now.
You got something, Harry?
Nope.
Nothing.
But I realize where l have to go, what I have to do to see him again.
A tear in my brain
Allows the voices in
They wanna push you off the path
With their frequency wires
And you can do no wrong
In my eyes
You can do no wrong
In my eyes
A drunken salesman
Your hearing damage
Your mind is restless
They say you're getting better
But you don't feel any better
Your speakers are blowing
Your ears are wrecking
Your hearing damage
You wish you felt better
You can do no wrong
In my eyes
Don't do this.
You wanted me to be human.
Watch me.
Please.
For me.
You won't stay with me any other way.
Bella, please.
This constant noise all the time
Even though you're the only one I see
Breathe!
Breathe!
Come on, Bella, breathe!
Bella?
Bella, can you hear me?
Jake?
Come here.
What the hell were you thinking?
I just wanted to see something.
Get her home!
I'm gonna go help out over at Harry's place.
What happened at Harry's?
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.
Charlie and my dad are over at his place with his family.
Is he okay?
He's gone.
Come on.
I'll get you something dry and drive you home.
1 08 degrees over here.
God!
My hands are freezing.
It must be nice, never getting cold.
It's a wolf thing.
It's not.
It's a Jacob thing.
You're just warm.
You're like your own sun.
This is better, now that you know about me.
But...
You saw what happened to Emily.
Sam got angry.
Lost it for a split second.
Em was standing too close.
He'll never be able to take that back.
What if I got mad at you?
Sometimes, I feel like I'm gonna disappear.
Okay, not that you need me to tell you something like this,
but I always will.
You're not gonna lose yourself.
I wouldn't let that happen.
How?
I'll tell you all the time
how special you are.
Thank you.
For everything.
Wait.
There's a vampire.
How do you know?
I can smell it.
I'm getting you out of here.
That's Carlisle's car.
They're here.
Bella, it's a trick!
Stop!
You gotta come with me!
They won't hurt me.
If a Cullen is back here, this is their territory.
Treaty says we can only defend on our own lands.
-l can't protect you here.
-Okay.
That's okay.
You don't have to.
You're about to cross a line.
Then don't draw one.
Please?
Alice?
-Oh, my God!
What are you...
-Bella!
I'm sorry, I just, I can't believe you're here.
Is...
Would you like to explain to me how you're alive?
What?
I saw a vision of you.
You jumped off a cliff.
Why in the hell would you try and kill yourself?
I mean, what about Charlie?
-What about...
-l didn't try to kill myself.
I was cliff jumping.
Recreationally.
It was fun.
I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy.
Does...
Did you tell him?
No.
He only calls in once every few months.
He said he wants to be alone.
Bella, what is that God-awful wet dog smell?
Um...
That's probably me.
Or it's Jacob.
Jacob who?
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.
Bella!
Werewolves are not good company to keep.
Speak for yourself.
I had to see you were safe.
I thought you couldn't protect me here.
Guess I don't care.
Well, I'm not gonna hurt her.
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.
I'm talking about the other bloodsucker who tried to kill Bella because of you.
Victoria?
Yeah, Victoria's been around.
I didn't see her.
I didn't see you get pulled out of the water, either.
I can't see past you and your pack of mutts.
Don't get me upset...
-Hey, stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
-...or things are gonna get very ugly.
I'll give you a minute.
Hey.
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna come back,
-right?
-As soon as you put the dog out.
Is he...
Are there others?
How many Cullens are here and how long are they staying?
No.
It's just Alice.
And she can stay as long as she'd like.
Well, are the rest coming back?
No.
Not that I know of.
Anything else?
That's it.
Well, if that's all, then you'd better go run back to Sam.
I've done it again.
I keep breaking my promise.
We don't have to do this to each other.
Yes, we do.
Bella...
Swan residence.
He's not here right now.
He's arranging a funeral.
Who was that?
What?
Always in the way.
Who was that?
Bella, step back.
-Jake, who was that?
-Bella!
Bella, it's Edward.
He thinks you're dead.
Rosalie told him why I came here.
Why would you...
Why didn't you let me speak to him?
-He didn't ask for you.
-Bella.
-l don't care!
-Bella.
Bella!
He's going to the Volturi.
He wants to die, too.
He left you, Bella.
He didn't want you anymore.
Remember?
No, I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt.
What about your dad?
I'm 1 8.
I'm legally free to go, and I left a note.
Please, Bella, just stay here.
For Charlie.
Or for me.
I have to go.
I'm begging you.
Please.
Goodbye, Jacob.
Okay.
)
So you've made up your minds.
I'm afraid your particular gifts are too valuable to destroy.
But if you're unhappy with your lot, join us.
We would be delighted to utilize your skills.
Won't you consider staying with us?
You know it will happen anyway.
Not without cause.
Such a waste.
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?
I figured you wouldn't be opposed to grand theft auto.
Not today.
What?
What do you see?
They refused him.
-So?
-He's gonna make a scene.
-Show himself to the humans.
-No!
When?
He's gonna wait until noon, when the sun's at its highest.
God, Alice, you got to hurry up.
There's Volterra.
-Why are they all in red?
-San Marco's Day festival.
They're commemorating the expulsion of vampires from the city.
It's the perfect setting.
The Volturi will never let him get far enough to reveal himself.
We have five minutes.
I know, Bella, just breathe.
Alice!
Bella, you're the only one he can't see coming.
If I go, he'll read my thoughts.
He'll think I'm lying.
He'll rush into it.
-Where do I go?
-He'll be under the clock tower.
Go!
Don't!
Heaven.
You have to move.
Open your eyes.
Look at me.
I'm alive.
You have to move.
Bella.
-You're here.
-I'm here.
You're alive.
Yes.
I needed to make you see me once.
You had to know that I was alive, that you didn't have to feel guilty about anything.
I can let you go now.
I never acted out of guilt.
I just couldn't live in a world where you don't exist.
-But you said...
-l lied.
I had to lie.
But you believed me so easily.
Because it doesn't make sense for you to love me.
I mean, I'm nothing.
I'm human.
I'm nothing.
Bella, you're everything to me.
You're everything.
I won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen.
Aro wants to speak with you again.
No rules were broken.
Nonetheless, we should take this conversation to a more appropriate venue.
Fine.
Bella, why don't you go and enjoy the rest of the festival?
The girl comes with us.
No.
You can go to hell.
Come on, guys.
It's a festival.
You wouldn't want to make a scene.
We wouldn't.
Enough.
Jane.
Aro sent me to see what was taking so long.
Just do as she says.
Go ahead.
Don't be scared.
Are you?
No.
-Is she human?
-Yes.
Does she know?
Yes.
Then, why would...
She wants to be.
And so she will be.
Or dessert.
Sister.
They send you out to get one and you bring back two.
And a half.
Such a clever girl.
What a happy surprise!
Bella is alive after all.
Isn't that wonderful?
I love a happy ending.
Ah.
They are so rare.
Her blood appeals to you so much it makes me thirsty.
How can you stand to be so close to her?
-It's not without difficulty.
-Yes, I can see that.
)
Aro can read every thought I've ever had with one touch.
And now you know everything.
So get on with it.
You are quite a soul reader yourself, Edward.
Though you can't read Bella's thoughts.
Fascinating.
I would love to see if you are an exception to my gifts, as well.
Would you do me the honor?
Interesting.
Hmm.
I see nothing.
I wonder if...
Let us see if she's immune to all our powers.
Shall we, Jane?
-No!
-Pain.
Stop!
Stop!
Please!
Stop!
Stop!
Just stop hurting him!
Please!
Please!
Jane?
Master?
Go ahead, my dear.
This may hurt just a little.
Remarkable!
She confounds us all.
So what do we do with you now?
You already know what you're going to do, Aro.
She knows too much.
She's a liability.
Hmm.
That's true.
Felix?
No!
Please!
No!
No!
Please, please!
Kill me!
Kill me!
Not him.
How extraordinary.
You would give up your life for someone like us.
A vampire.
A soulless monster.
Just get away from her!
You don't know a thing about his soul.
This is a sadness.
If only it were your intention to give her immortality.
Wait!
Bella will be one of us.
I've seen it.
I'll change her myself.
Mesmerizing.
To see what you have seen before it has happened.
Your gifts will make for an intriguing immortal,
Isabella.
Go now.
Make your preparations.
Let us be done with this.
Heidi will arrive any moment.
Thank you for your visit.
We will return the favor.
I would advise that you follow through on your promise soon.
We do not offer second chances.
Goodbye, my young friends.
Nice fishing, Heidi.
Yes, they do look rather juicy.
Save some for me.
This way, please.
Stay together.
Stop!
Stop!
You're here.
You can sleep.
I'll still be here when you wake up.
Bella, the only reason I left was because I thought I was protecting you.
I needed you to have a chance at a normal, happy life.
It was so easy for you to leave.
Leaving you was the hardest thing I've done in 1 00 years.
And I swear, I will never fail you again.
I'm so sorry.
-Charlie's coming.
-Hey.
You okay?
I'm fine.
Dad, you don't have to worry.
You know, last time you said that, you took off.
I didn't see you for three days.
I'm really sorry, Dad.
Bella, do not ever do that to me again.
Ever.
And you're grounded for the rest of your life.
Okay.
I'm not technically breaking any of his rules.
He did say I couldn't take a step inside the door.
I came in through the window.
He's not gonna forgive me easily.
I know.
Can you?
I hope you can, 'cause I honestly don't know how to live without you.
Come here.
Once Alice changes me, you can't get rid of me.
She won't need to change you.
There are always ways to keep the Volturi in the dark.
No.
No.
You all know what I want.
And I know how much I'm asking for.
The only thing that I can think of for it to be fair is to just vote.
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-Shut up.
Alice?
I already consider you my sister.
-Yes.
-Thank you.
I vote "yes."
It would be nice to not want to kill you all the time.
Hmm.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry to both of you for how I've acted, and I'm really grateful that you were brave enough to go and save my brother.
But this isn't a life I would have chosen for myself.
And I wish that there'd been someone to vote "no" for me.
So, no.
I vote "Hell, yeah."
And we can pick a fight with these Volturi some other way.
I already consider you a part of the family.
Yes.
Why are you doing this to me?
You know what this means.
You've chosen not to live without her, which leaves me no choice.
I won't lose my son.
I'll wait until after graduation to make it easier on Charlie.
Edward, I want you to be the one to do it.
He wants to talk to me.
So you're still alive for now.
He thinks it's me keeping you away.
You stay the hell out of my head.
Jacob, I know you have something to say to me.
But I want to say something to you first, if that's all right.
Thank you.
Thank you for keeping Bella alive when I didn't.
No.
You didn't.
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.
I'm still grateful.
But I'm here now.
I'm not gonna leave her side until she orders me away.
We'll see.
Hey, my turn to talk.
I'm here to remind you about a key point in the treaty.
I haven't forgotten.
What key point?
If any of them bites a human, the truce is over.
But if I choose it, it has nothing to do with you.
No.
No, I won't let you.
You're not gonna be one of them, Bella.
It's not up to you.
You know what we'll do to you.
I won't have a choice.
Bella, please, come.
Wait.
Is he gonna hurt me?
Read his mind.
Jake,
I love you.
So, please,
don't make me choose,
'cause it'll be him.
It's always been him.
Bella...
-Goodbye, Jacob.
-No, you don't speak for her!
Bella, get out of here.
Stop!
Stop!
You can't hurt each other without hurting me.
Jake.
He's right.
You shouldn't become what I am.
I can't do this alone.
Then, please, just wait.
Just give me five years.
That's too long.
Then three?
You're so stubborn.
What are you waiting for?
I have one condition if you want me to do it myself.
What's the condition?
And then forever.
That's what I'm asking.
Marry me, Bella.
White demon love song down the hall
White demon shadow on the road
Back up your mind, there is a call
He isn't coming after all
Love this time
She likes the way he sings
White demon love song's in her dreams
White demon, where's your selfish kiss?
White demon sorrow will arrange
Let's not forget about the fear
Black invitation to this place that cannot change
While strangely holy
Come for a rain
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friend go?
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friend go?
-Let us be in love
-Let us be in love
-Let's do old and gray
-Let's do old and gray
-I won't make you cry
-I won't make you cry
-I will never stray
-I will never stray
-I will do my part
-I will do my part
Let us be in love tonight
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friend go?
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friend go?
Stand it anymore, darling
Stand it
Meet me on the equinox
Meet me halfway
When the sun is perched at its highest peak
In the middle of the day
Let me give my love to you
Let me take your hand
As we walk in the dimming light
Oh, darling, understand
That everything, everything ends
Meet me on your best behavior
Meet me at your worst
For there will be no stone unturned
Or bubble left to burst
Let me lay beside you, darling
Let me be your man
And let our bodies intertwine
But always understand
That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything, everything ends
A window
An opened tomb
The sun crawls
Across your bedroom
A halo
A waiting room
Your last breaths
Moving through you
As everything, everything ends
As everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything ends
Meet me on the equinox
Meet me halfway
When the sun is perched at its highest peak
In the middle of the day
Let me give my love to you
Let me take your hand
And as we walk in the dimming light
Oh, darling, understand
That everything, everything ends
BELLA: "These violent delights have violent ends,
"and in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
"which, as they kiss, consume."
(indistinct chattering)
(BELL TOLLS)
(panting)
Gran?
(GASPS SOFTL¤
Edward, don't!
She'll see you.
Hmm.
Okay.
(lN BELLA'S voice) Gran, I'd like you to meet...
(GASPS)
Happy birthday, Bella.
(GASPS)
(knocking ON DOOR)
Happy birthday.
(BELLA clicks TONGUE) I thought we agreed, no presents.
Well, the one from me's not wrapped, so it doesn't count.
That's actually great.
Thanks, Dad.
It goes with this one from your mom.
We coordinated.
Well, she coordinated me.
It's to put your pictures in from senior year.
(sighs) Senior year.
-How'd you get so old so fast?
-l didn't. lt's not that old.
I don't know. ls that a gray hair?
No.
No way.
(sighs)
Happy birthday.
That's really funny.
ANNOUNCER ON RADIO:
Another missing hiker brings the total to three presumed dead.
Rangers are searching for the killer animal... (switching radio station)
MONSTERS playing)
Situation's all critical
You've got to look first before you go
eric:
It's Bella.
Bella!
-Hi.
-mike:
I'm...
jessica:
Today's the big day, Bella.
R and J essay due.
-Oh, yeah.
-Wherefore art thou, Bella?
ALL LAUGH)
Let me take a picture of you guys.
My mom wants me to put together, like, a scrapbook full of memories.
eric:
Oh.
mike:
Cool.
Yeah.
I take them. I'm not in them.
-No, no, no, come here.
-BELLA:
Well, you are today.
You'll photoshop this if my nose looks big, right?
eric:
Don't worry, I'm in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.
BELLA:
That's good.
Oh, good.
Cullen's here.
(eric CHEERS WEAKLY)
Well, talk to you later.
-Happy birthday.
-Don't remind me.
EDWARD:
Mmm.
Bella, your birth is definitely something to celebrate.
-Yeah, but my aging's not.
-Your aging?
(CHUCKLES) I think 1 8 is a little young to start worrying about that.
It's one year older than you.
No, it isn't. I'm 109.
Well, maybe I shouldn't be dating such an old man.
-Mmm.
-lt's gross. I should be thoroughly repulsed.
Uh-huh.
(BOTH sighing)
-We have to go to class.
-Okay.
(EDWARD MOANS SOFTLY)
Wait a second.
Someone wants you.
-JACOB:
Bella!
-Jacob!
What?
I'll leave you to talk.
Hello, biceps!
You know, anabolic steroids are really bad for you.
(JACOB LAUGHS)
Well, I'm just filling out, Bella.
You know, it wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more.
You should switch schools.
You can come hang out with the palefaces.
I'm all right.
I prefer the rez school's exclusivity.
They let any old riffraff into this place.
-l see.
Then why are you slumming it?
-Mmm-hmm.
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.
You should really come take a ride when it's done.
is it fast?
Um.
It's decent.
(BOTH LAUGH)
-l'm kidding.
-Okay.
Good.
Hey, happy birthday.
Your dad told my dad, so...
Yeah, of course he did.
I saw this the other day and thought of you.
Catches bad dreams.
That's kind of perfect.
Thank you.
No problem.
-Good seeing you.
-Yeah, I'll see you later.
Bye.
So how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?
Because I have nothing to give back to you.
Bella, you give me everyhing just by breathing.
(EXHALES)
See?
Thank you.
-That's all I want.
-alice:
Bella!
-Happy birthday!
-Shh, shh!
(SCHOOL BELL rings) I thought I said no presents.
I've already seen you open it, and guess what, you love it.
You're gonna wear it tonight.
Our place.
Come on.
Please?
It'll be fun.
-Okay.
All right.
-Great!
Okay, I'll see you at 7:00.
Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing.
(alice LAUGHS)
Sorry, Bella.
Happy...
Never mind.
You can't trust vampires.
Trust me.
ROMEO: (ON video) O my love!
My wife!
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Thou art not conquered.
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks.
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
BELLA:
I hate being celebrated.
EDWARD:
There are worse tragedies.
I mean, look at Romeo.
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.
BELA:
Yeah.
Though I do envy him one thing.
BELLA:
Juliet is, like, perfect.
If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.
(EDWARD LAUGHS)
Not the girl, the suicide.
It's nearly impossible for...
For some people.
For humans, a little poison, a dagger to the heart.
There's so many different options.
Why would you say that?
Because I had to consider it once.
(BELLA screaming) I didn't know if I'd get to you in time.
I had to come up with some kind of plan.
What was the plan?
That I'd go to Italy and provoke the Volturi.
-The what?
-The Volturi.
MR. BERTY:
Now, who'd like to repeat the last few lines of iambic pentameter just to show they were paying attention?
Mr. Cullen?
(lNHALES DEEPLY)
Yes, Mr. Berty.
"O here will I set up my everlasting rest
"and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.
"Eyes, look your last.
"Arms, take your last embrace!
"And, lips, O you, the doors of breath,
"seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death!"
Eyes on the screen, people.
ROMEO:
Thus with a kiss I die.
The Volturi are a very old, very powerful family.
I guess they're the closest thing to royalty my world has.
-ls that Carlisle?
-Yeah.
He lived with them for a few decades.
Described them as very refined.
No respect for human life, of course, but a respect for the arts and the sciences, at least.
And the law.
Above all, the law.
BELLA:
Vampires have laws?
EDWARD:
Not very many.
And only one that's regularly enforced.
BELLA:
What is it?
EDWARD:
That we keep the existence of our kind a secret.
We don't make spectacles of ourselves, and we don't kill conspicuously.
Unless, of course, you want to die.
(SCREAMS)
You gotta stop talking about that.
I can't even think about someone hurting you.
Bella, the only thing that can hurt me is you.
And I don't have anything else to be afraid of.
That's not true.
Victoria?
She'll come for me one day.
Alice will see when she decides, and we'll be ready.
I could protect you if you change me.
Bella, you already do protect me.
You're my only reason to stay alive, if that's what I am.
But it's my job to protect you.
(BELLA sighs)
From everyone except my sister.
It's time!
It's time. lt's time. lt's time!
(THE VIOLET HOUR playing)
Your lips are nettles
Your tongue is wine
You're left as liquid But your body's pine
DR. CULLEN:
Sorry about all this.
-We tried to rein Alice in.
-As if that were even possible.
-Happy birthday, Bella.
-Thanks.
I found it in your bag.
You mind?
Dating an older woman.
Hot.
(sighs EXASPERATEDLY)
-What?
-You first, Rosalie.
It's a necklace.
Alice picked it out.
Thanks.
Show me the love.
This one's from Emmett.
Already installed it in your truck.
Finally a decent sound system
-for that piece of...
-Hey!
Don't hate the truck.
(alice LAUGHS)
Open Esme and Carlisle's.
DR. CULLEN:
Just a little something to brighten your day.
Yes, you've been looking kind of pale lately.
Ow.
Paper cut.
(GLASS shattering)
(JASPER GROWLS)
Jaz, Jaz. lt's okay. lt's just a little blood.
(GASPS SOFTLY)
(JASPER SNARLS)
DR. CULLEN:
Get Jasper out of here.
(BELLA GASPS)
I'm sorry, I can't.
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.
Check on Jasper.
I'm sure he's very upset with himself, and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.
Edward.
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY)
BELLA:
I never wanted to have a party.
DR. CULLEN:
It's not your fault.
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.
How do you do it?
Years and years of practice.
Did you ever think ofjust doing it the easy way?
No.
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.
It brings me happiness, even if I am damned regardless.
Damned?
Like hell?
Carlisle, you couldn't be damned.
You couldn't. lt's impossible.
Thank you, Bella.
You've always been very gracious about us.
So that's it?
That's why he won't change me?
Imagine the situation in reverse.
Hmm.
If you believed as Edward does, could you take away his soul?
You can't protect me from everything.
At some point, something's gonna separate us.
It's gonna be an accident or illness or old age,
as long as I'm human.
And the only solution is to change me.
That's not a solution.
That's a tragedy.
You're not gonna want me when I look like a grandmother.
Bella, do you not understand my feelings for you at all?
Carlisle told me
how you feel about your soul.
I don't believe that.
So don't worry about mine.
You should go inside.
It's still my birthday.
So can I ask one thing?
Kiss me?
(BELLA GASPS)
(BOTH gasping)
I love you.
(ROSLYN playing)
Up with your turret
Aren't we just terrified?
Shale, screen your worry
From what you won't ever find
Don't let it fool you
Down
Hey.
Just come take a walk with me.
We have to leave Forks.
Why?
Carlisle's supposed to be 10 years older than he looks, and people are starting to notice.
Okay, I've gotta think of something to say to Charlie.
When you say "we"... I mean my family and myself.
Edward, what happened with Jasper, it's nothing.
You're right. lt was nothing, nothing but what I always expected
and nothing compared to what could have happened.
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.
I belong with you.
No.
You don't.
I'm coming.
Bella, I don't want you to come.
(sighs)
You don't want me?
No.
That changes things a lot.
But if it's not too much to ask, can you just promise me something?
Don't do anything reckless.
For Charlie's sake.
And I'll promise something to you in return.
This is the last time you'll ever see me.
I won't come back, and you can go on with your life without any interference from me.
It will be like I never existed, I promise.
If this is about my soul, take it.
I don't want it without you.
It's not about your soul.
You're just not good for me.
Not good enough for you.
I'm just sorry I let this go on for so long.
(SOBS)
Please...
Don't...
Goodbye.
(BELLA sobbing)
Edward.
Edward!
Edward.
(BELLA crying)
(SOFT growling)
(GRASS rustling)
(CHATTERING OVER POLICE RADIO) I'm gonna try the Cullens' place again.
-billy:
The Cullens left town, Charlie.
-Good riddance.
Where'd they go?
We'll find her, Charlie.
-Thanks, Harry.
-Charlie!
billy:
Hey.
She's all right.
I got her.
Thank you, Sam.
(POSSIBILITY playing)
There's a possibility
All that I had
Was all I'm gonna get
BELLA:
Alice, you've disappeared, like everything else.
Now who else can I talk to?
I'm lost.
When you left, and he left,
you took everything with you.
But the absence of him is everywhere I look.
It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest.
(BELLA screaming)
Bella.
(inaudible)
(BELLA screaming)
BELLA:
But in a way I'm glad.
The pain is my only reminder that he was real, that you all were.
All right.
That's it.
What?
You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother.
I'm not leaving Forks.
Bells, he's not coming back.
I know.
It's just not normal, this behavior.
Quite frankly, it's scaring the hell out of me and your mother.
Baby, I don't want you to leave.
I don't, but just go.
Go to Jacksonville.
Make some new friends.
I like my old friends.
-Well, you never see them anymore.
-l do.
I'm gonna go shopping tomorrow with Jessica.
-You hate shopping.
-l... I need a girls' night out.
All right.
Girls' night.
Shopping.
I like it.
Go buy some stuff.
(I BELONG TO YOU playing)
BELLA: (ON PHONE) Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.
Yeah, Bella Swan.
jessica:
I don't know why you want to sit through all those zombies eating people and no hot guys kissing anybody.
It's gross.
Like...
And why are there that many zombie movies anyway?
'Cause if it's supposed to, like, draw a parallel about leprosy, my cousin had leprosy.
It's not funny, you know?
And, like, is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism?
Because don't be so pleased with your own, like, self-referential cleverness, you know?
Like, some girls like to shop.
Not all girls, apparently.
Although I was surprised you even called at all.
You know?
Like, your depression thing, I get it. I'm totally, totally worried.
But after a while it's like,
-you're still bumming...
-CHET:
You want a ride, girls?
...and I'm going through stuff, too.
You know?
Like Mike deciding he just wants to be friends.
CHET:
What's up?
Look what we found.
jessica:
It's hard, you know?
Like, and since when does "just friends"...
biker 1:
What's up guys?
biker 2:
Look what we found.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, where you going?
(tires screeching)
Keep walking.
(gasping)
This is dangerous.
-Dude, come on.
-CHET:
Come here for a sec!
I think I know those guys.
CHET:
We got beer!
We got bikes!
Well, they seem great.
Can we go?
I'm just gonna see something.
CHET:
Hey, girlie!
All right, all right.
We got a taker.
Turn around.
(GASPS)
(FRIENDS PLAYING)
biker 2:
Shut up!
biker 3:
You shut up!
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
No, that's cool.
I'll be whoever you want me to be, honey.
So, what do you say?
You promised me, nothing reckless.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
You promised it would be as if you never existed.
(CHET CLEARS THROAT)
-You lied.
-You say something, babe?
You know what?
Never mind.
(engine roaring)
Stop!
Stop, stop, stop!
(BRAKES screeching)
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?
Just curious.
-l thought that I saw something.
-You...
Oh.
You're insane, actually.
Or suicidal.
That homeboy could've been a psycho.
I was about to end up in an fbi interview room like some lame TV show.
God, that was such a rush.
Awesome.
So you're an adrenaline junkie now?
That's cool.
You can go bungee jumping.
You don't get on the back of some random loser's motorcycle.
Crazy.
BELLA:
Alice, I saw him.
Maybe I'm crazy now. I guess that's okay.
If a rush of danger is what it takes to see him, then that's what I'll find.
Bella!
Where the hell have you been, loca?
(BELLA laughing)
(sighs) I brought you something.
-Okay.
-lt's a little crazy.
Wow.
Scrap metal.
You shouldn't have.
I saved it from the junkyard.
(BELLA CLEARS THROAT) I think they'll probably cost more to fix than they're worth, but then I thought that if I had a mechanic friend
-to help me out then...
-Ah!
-Me being the mechanic-type friend?
-That's right.
-Since when are you into motorcycles?
-Since now.
I get it if you think that this is really stupid and reckless.
Yeah, I mean, it's completely stupid and reckless.
When do we start?
Um.
Now.
-Please?
-(CHUCKLES) All right.
Oh, hey, be careful.
Those things are actually really heavy, so...
Jake, you're, like, buff.
How did that happen?
You're, like, 16. I don't get it.
Mmm-hmm.
Age is just a number, baby.
What are you, like, 40 now?
It feels like that sometimes.
(ROMANTIC SONG PLAYING ON STEREO)
(TURNS OFF STEREO)
That song's good.
You don't like it?
I don't really like music anymore, kind of.
Okay.
No more music.
So I was thinking, if we're gonna do this every day, and hopefully we will, we have to, like, fit some homework in there somewhere.
I don't want Billy thinking that I'm a bad influence on you.
You?
lnfluence me?
Please.
Are you...
I'm older than you, so that makes me the influencer and you the influencee.
(LAUGHS) No, no, no.
My size and knowledge base actually makes me older than you because of your general paleness and lack of know-how.
I convinced you to build two-wheeled death machines with me.
Don't you think that makes you kind of young and naive?
Okay.
So where do we stand?
-l'm 35.
And you might be, like, 32.
-Come on.
(knocking ON DOOR)
-quil:
Yo, Jake, you in there?
-lt's okay. lt's just my boys.
-Hey, Jake.
-Hey.
Guys, this is Bella.
-Bella, that's Quil and Embry.
-Hi.
I'm Quil Ateara.
So the bike building story is true.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I taught him everything he knows.
What about the part where you're his girlfriend?
Uh...
We're friends, you know.
-(LAUGHS) Burn.
-Actually, remember I said she's a girl and a friend.
Embry, do you remember him making that distinction?
Nope.
So you guys have girlfriends?
That's awesome.
(JACOB laughing)
Yeah, right.
Quil's actually taking his cousin to prom.
Yeah, that's still a riot.
You want funny, Black?
I'll give you funny.
(JACOB AND QUlL laughing)
Jeez.
JACOB:
Hey, that hold's illegal!
EMBRY:
I got five bucks on Quil.
You're on.
(SHOOTING THE MOON PLAYING)
All of the astronauts Champagne in plastic cups
Waiting for the big hero to show
Outside the door he stands His head in his hands
And his heart in his throat
What can he tell them now
BELLA:
Dear Alice, I wish I had your real address.
I wish I could tell you about Jake.
He makes me feel better.
I mean, he makes me feel alive.
The hole in my chest, well, when I'm with Jake, it's like it's almost healed
for a while.
So, Quil keeps asking to come over.
I think he likes you a little too much.
Oh.
Well, I'm really not into the whole cougar thing.
You know?
(CHUCKLES)
What's up with you and age?
I mean, how old was that Cullen guy, anyway?
BELLA:
But even Jake can't keep the dreams away.
(BELLA WHlMPERlNG)
(screaming)
Hey, hey, hey!
Wake up, Bella.
(SHUSHlNG) You're okay.
You're okay.
I thought this thing was starting to work, but I guess not.
(charlie sighs)
Can I ask you something?
Hanging out with Jacob, that seems to take your mind off things a bit, doesn't it?
You know, sometimes you gotta learn to love what's good for you.
You know what I mean?
Of course, what do I know?
I'm just a terminal bachelor.
Famous ladies' man.
Okay.
I'm gonna go to bed.
Uh... I love you.
If I told you I couldn't have fixed these bikes, what would you have said?
Are you doubting your mad skills?
No.
Definitely not. I mean, they'll run fine.
It's just, maybe if I was smart, I would have dragged out the rebuild a bit.
If you told me you couldn't fix these bikes, I would say that that's really too bad, but that we're just gonna have to find something else to do.
(LAUGHS) ls that Sam Uley?
Yeah.
Him and his cult.
(shouting lNDlSTlNCTLY)
(WHOOPS)
Oh, my God.
Did you see that?
(JACOB laughing)
They're not really fighting, Bella.
They're cliff diving.
Scary as hell, but a total rush.
-A rush?
-Most of us jump from lower down.
We leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples.
You have some kind of beef with him or something?
I don't know.
They just think they run this place.
Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids.
-Now look at him.
-That's Embry?
(continue whooping)
-Yeah.
-What happened to him?
He missed some school.
Now all of a sudden, he started following Sam around like a little puppy.
Same thing happened with Paul and Jared.
Sam keeps giving me this look, like he's waiting for me or something.
It's kind of starting to freak me out.
Well, you should just avoid him.
I try.
Okay.
-You look scared.
-l'm not.
All right.
-Brake?
-That one.
Clutch?
Good.
Gas?
(engine ROARS)
Ready?
Now, slowly release the clutch.
EDWARD:
Bella.
Stop.
(BELLA GASPS)
Whoa!
You all right?
I'm gonna go again.
Okay.
(GASPS)
Ah!
Whoa!
Hit the brake!
(GRUNTS)
I wanna go again.
Are you trying to get yourself killed?
-No. I want to go again.
-No.
Forget it.
No more bikes.
Man, your head.
Ow.
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
What, you're apologizing for bleeding?
Yeah. I guess I am.
Well, it's just blood, Bella.
No big deal.
There.
What are you staring at?
You're sort of beautiful.
How hard did you hit your head?
I don't know.
(JACOB CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Let's go.
ANGELA:
I did see something in the woods.
Totally.
Baby, I believe you.
No, he doesn't.
He's just trying to get lucky.
(eric LAUGHS)
ANGELA:
No, okay. lt was jet black and huge.
On all fours, it was still taller than a person.
A bear, maybe?
Or an alien.
You're lucky you didn't get probed.
(eric AND mike SNlCKERlNG)
ANGELA:
Well, I saw it.
You know, you're not the only one.
My dad's been getting reports at the station.
Like, five hikers have been killed by some bear.
But they can't find the bear.
Hmm.
(LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.
mike:
Um... (mike CLEARS THROAT)
So?
I mean,
Bella's back?
(LAUGHS)
Yeah, I guess so.
All right, that's...
Well, welcome.
So, listen, now that you're talking and eating again, which, you know, you've got to get that protein in there,
I was just wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me.
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah, I do.
Cool.
Let me see, we could check out
Love Spelled Backwards Is Love.
You know, it's a dumb title, but it's a romantic comedy.
-l mean, it's supposed to be pretty...
-No.
No romance.
How about Face Punch?
Have you heard of that?
I mean, that's an action movie.
Yeah, that's perfect.
Guns, adrenaline.
That's my thing.
Okay.
We should get a bunch of people to go.
Do you guys want to go see Face Punch?
eric:
Face Punch, yeah!
Mike, hey, we were supposed to watch that.
Remember, the trailer's like...
-"Punch faces." -l remember.
(sarcastically) Yeah!
Movie night with Bella.
JACOB:
So Face Punch, huh?
You like action movies?
Not really.
(JACOB SCOFFlNG) I heard it sucks.
Bad.
Are you even old enough to see this movie?
I mean, you know, without, like, adult supervision.
Right, yeah, well, she's buying my ticket for me.
She's buying it.
Okay.
Jessica bailed, and Angela got the stomach flu, so Eric's taking care of her.
-lt's just us three.
-Great!
-Great.
-Yeah.
(GUN COCKING ON SCREEN)
MAN 1 ON SCREEN:
Put your gun down.
MAN 2 ON SCREEN:
Put your gun down or I'm gonna blow your frickin' head off.
MAN 3 ON SCREEN:
Both of you put both of your guns down or I'm gonna blow both of your frickin' heads off.
MAN 1 ON SCREEN:
All right, forget it, let's do this!
(GUNS FIRING)
(MAN SCREAMS)
(GUNS FIRING)
(WOMAN SCREAMS)
Okay, I think I'm gonna throw up.
(SCREAMING CONTINUES)
He's... (SCOFFS) What a marshmallow!
You should hold out for someone with a stronger stomach.
Someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit.
Yeah. I'll keep my eye open for that.
(JACOB CHUCKLES) I feel bad.
He probably has that flu that's going around.
What?
I can't hold your hand?
No, of course you can.
I just think it means, you know, something a little different to you.
So...
Okay, well, tell me something.
You like me, right?
And you think I'm sort of beautiful?
(SOFTLY) Jacob, please, don't do this.
(BELLA sighs)
Why?
Because you're about to ruin everything.
And I need you.
(sighs)
Well, I've got loads of time.
I'm not gonna give up.
I don't want you to, but it's just 'cause I don't want you to go anywhere.
And that's really selfish.
You know, I'm not like a car that you can fix up.
I'm never gonna run right.
So I should be fair to you.
It's because of him, right?
(JACOB sighs DEEPLY)
Look, I know what he did to you.
But, Bella, I would never ever do that.
I won't ever hurt you. I promise.
I won't let you down.
You can count on me.
mike:
Well,
(SNlFFLES)
(sighs)
I need to go home.
I was feeling sick before the movie.
Okay?
(JACOB SCOFFS)
What is your problem?
Right now?
You're my problem.
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.
You want me to put you in the hospital?
Jake!
Jake.
Jake, the movie's over.
What are you doing?
You're really hot.
Like, you feel like you have a fever.
Are you okay?
I don't know what's happening.
(breathing heavily) I gotta go.
That dude is weird.
BELLA: (ON PHONE) Jake, your dad says you have mono.
He won't let me visit, but would you call me?
Hey, it's me again. I just... I'm sorry about what I said at the movie theater.
I just wanted to hear your voice, so no pressure.
Jacob, please...
Call me.
Okay.
We should be back around 3:00.
(sighs)
Hey.
Look, I don't have to go fishing today.
Yes, you do.
Yeah, you do.
Go.
What are you talking about?
Just be careful.
Always am.
Those bears won't get the drop on me, Bella.
My kung fu is strong.
Jake!
Hey!
You cut your hair off?
And got a tattoo?
Bella.
I thought you were too sick to come outside or pick up the phone when I call.
Go away.
What?
Go away.
What happened to you?
What's...
Hey!
What happened?
Did Sam get to you?
is that what's happening?
Sam's trying to help me.
Don't blame him.
But if you want somebody to blame, how about those filthy bloodsuckers you love, the Cullens?
(THUNDER rumbling)
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
You've been lying to everyone.
Charlie.
But you can't lie to me.
-Not anymore, Bella.
-SAM:
Jacob!
Jacob!
Look, Bella, we can't be friends anymore.
(crying) Look, Jake, I know that I've been hurting you.
It's killing me. lt kills me.
I just need...
Maybe give me, like,
-some time or something.
-Look, don't.
It's not you.
It's not you, it's me, right?
Really?
It's true. lt is me.
I'm not good.
I used to be a good kid.
Not anymore.
This doesn't even matter.
All right?
This is over.
You can't break up with me.
I mean... I mean, you're my best friend.
You promised me.
I know.
I promised I wouldn't hurt you, Bella.
And this is me keeping that promise.
Go home and don't come back or you're gonna get hurt.
BELLA:
Alice, things are...
Things are bad again.
Without Jake, I just...
I can't stand it.
I don't see Edward anymore.
Will it really feel like he never existed?
I will find the place where l can see him again.
(sobbing)
Bella.
Laurent.
I didn't expect to find you here.
I went to visit the Cullens, but the house is empty.
I'm surprised they left you behind.
Weren't you sort of a pet of theirs?
Yeah.
You could say that.
Do the Cullens visit often?
Lie.
(GASPS)
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.
Lie better.
I'll tell them that you stopped by.
But I probably shouldn't tell Edward,
'cause he's pretty protective.
But he's far away, isn't he?
Why are you here?
I came as a favor to Victoria.
-Victoria?
-She asked me to see if you were still under the protection of the Cullens.
Victoria feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate, given he killed hers.
An eye for an eye.
Threaten him.
Edward would know who did it.
And he'd come after you.
I don't think he will.
After all, how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected?
(LAURENT sighs)
Victoria won't be happy about my killing you, but I can't help myself.
You are so mouth-watering.
-Please, don't. I mean, you helped us.
-No, no, no, no.
(SHUSHlNG)
Don't be afraid. I'm doing you a kindness.
(SOFTLY) Victoria plans on killing you slowly, painfully, whereas I'll make it quick.
I promise.
You will feel nothing.
Edward, I love you.
(TWlGS snapping) I don't believe it.
(LOW growling)
(ROARS)

-Dad!
I saw them.
-What's the matter?
-ln the woods.
They're not bears.
-What do you mean "in the woods"?
Bell, what the hell were you doing out in the woods?
They're wolves.
I mean, they're like huge wolves.
Are you sure about that, Bella?
Yeah!
I just saw them.
They were after something.
(HARRY CLEARS THROAT)
Wolves?
You saw them?
All right, well, Harry, feel like going hunting?
Get some of your guys together?
Sure, yeah, I'll just...
BELLA:
By now, those wolves will be dead, and Laurent would have told her I'm unprotected.
Victoria.
I should go to the station.
Yeah, you should.
You should go.
charlie:
Can you just stay in the house?
(THUNDER rumbling)
(CLATTERlNG)
(CLATTERlNG continues)
JACOB: (whispers) Bella!
You scared me.
-What the hell are you doing?
-Back up. I'm coming up.
(GASPS)
Hey.
Look, I'm sorry.
-For what?
-l wish I could explain.
But I literally can't.
(sighs)
Have you ever had a secret you couldn't tell anyone, one that wasn't yours to share?
Well, that's what it's like for me.
But worse.
You have no idea how tight l'm bound.
I hate this.
I hate what they've done to you.
I mean, the killer part is, you already know.
Bella, do you remember when we walked on the beach at La Push?
The...
The story.
The story about the cold ones.
I guess I understand why that's the only part you remember.
There's gotta be something that you can do.
No. I'm in it for life.
Well, maybe we should just get out of here for a while.
Just leave, just you and me.
You'd do that?
I would do it for you.
It's not something I can just run away from, Bella.
But I would run away with you
if I could.
I gotta go.
They'll start wondering where l am.
Come here.
(SOFTLY) Please, try to remember.
It'd be so much easier if you knew.
I'll try.
But, Jake...
Jake, what are you doing?
Wait, Jake.
(GASPS)
Jake.
(GASPS)
Edward, I'm scared.
You should be.
JACOB:
Really, it's just like an old story.
I'm not really supposed to say anything about it.
Did you know Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?
(WEREWOLF SNARLS)
Bella?
I need to see him.
He's not in.
-Okay, I'm sorry, I really need to see him.
-Bella!
What did you do?
-Okay, what did you do?
-Hey.
-What did you do to him?
-Easy!
He didn't want this.
What did we do?
What did he do?
What'd he tell you?
-Both of you calm down.
-Nothing.
He tells me nothing because he's scared of you.
(SNlCKERlNG)
-Too late now.
-SAM:
Bella, get back!
(PAUL growling SOFTLY)
SAM:
Paul, calm down, now!
Bella!
Run!
Jake, run!
(GROWLlNG)
(WHlMPERS)
(BOTH SNARLlNG)
SAM:
Paul!
Hey!
Take Bella back to Emily's place.
EMBRY:
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.
BELLA:
Alice, is it possible that everything is true?
The fairy tales and horror stories?
is it possible that there isn't anything sane or normal at all?
(BOTH WHOOP)
Hey, I think we should go back and see if Jacob's okay.
I hope Paul sinks some teeth in him.
Serves him right.
No way.
Jacob's a natural.
You see him phase on the fly?
I got five says Paul doesn't touch him.
Come on in, Bella.
We won't bite.
Speak for yourself.
(DONE ALL WRONG playing) I done me wrong
And done all wrong
All the wrong I've done I'm sure I'll live quite long
Oh, hey, about Emily, Sam's fiancée?
Don't stare. lt bugs Sam.
Why would I stare?
Are you guys hungry?
Like I have to ask.
(emily laughing)
Who's this?
JARED:
Bella Swan.
Who else?
Hmm.
So, you're the vampire girl.
So, you're the wolf girl.
Guess so.
Well, I'm engaged to one.
Save some for your brothers.
And ladies first.
Muffin?
Sure.
Thanks.
Leave it to Jacob to find a way around Sam's gag order.
He didn't say anything to me.
That's a wolf thing.
Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want them to or not.
And check it out.
We can hear each other's thoughts.
Would you shut up?
These are trade secrets.
Damn it!
This chick runs with vampires.
You can't really run with vampires.
(emily giggles)
'Cause they're fast.
Yeah?
Well, we're faster.
Freaked out yet?
You're not the first monsters I've met.
SAM:
Jake's right.
You're good with weird.
Hey.
(emily giggling)
Sorry.
So you're a werewolf?
Yeah.
Last time I checked.
A few lucky members of the tribe have the gene.
A bloodsucker moves into town and the fever sets in.
Mono.
Yeah. I wish.
Well, can't you find a way to just stop?
I mean, it's wrong.
It's not a lifestyle choice, Bella.
I was born this way. I can't help it.
You're such a hypocrite.
What, I'm not the right kind of monster for you?
It's not what you are.
It's what you do.
They never hurt anybody.
You've killed people, Jake.
Bella, we're not killing anyone.
Then who is?
What we're trying to protect you people from, the only thing we do kill,
vampires.
Wait, Jake, you can't.
Don't worry.
We can't touch your little precious Cullens unless they violate the treaty.
That's not what I'm saying.
You can't kill vampires.
They'll...
They'll kill you.
Really?
We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough.
(WEREWOLVES growling)
Laurent?
And his red-headed girlfriend is next.
Victoria's here?
Was.
We chased her all the way to the Canadian border the other night.
She keeps coming back.
We don't know what she's after.
I do.
Me.
Don't worry.
We've got this place covered.
She won't get near you or Charlie.
Look, you've got to be careful.
She's fast.
You don't know how fast she is.
You know, your lack of confidence in us is a little insulting.
All right, I'd better go.
You gotta go?
Yeah.
Got a vampire to kill.
BELLA:
Alice, I'm all right.
Until I'm alone.
And lately, that's all the time.
Jacob's gone.
He's hunting Victoria.
And charlie's hunting Jacob.
And you're gone.
And so is Edward.
And there's just nothing now.
You got something, Harry?
Nope.
Nothing.
But I realize where l have to go, what I have to do to see him again.
(HEARING DAMAGE PLAYING)
A tear in my brain
Allows the voices in
They wanna push you off the path
With their frequency wires
And you can do no wrong
In my eyes
You can do no wrong
In my eyes
A drunken salesman
Your hearing damage
Your mind is restless
They say you're getting better
But you don't feel any better
Your speakers are blowing
Your ears are wrecking
Your hearing damage
You wish you felt better
You can do no wrong
In my eyes
(GROWLlNG)
EDWARD:
Don't do this.
You wanted me to be human.
Watch me.
EDWARD:
Please.
For me.
You won't stay with me any other way.
Bella, please.
(gasping)
(SLOWLIFE playing)
This constant noise all the time
Even though you're the only one I see
JACOB:
Breathe!
Breathe!
Come on, Bella, breathe!
(BELLA SPLUTTERlNG)
Bella?
Bella, can you hear me?
Jake?
Come here.
What the hell were you thinking?
I just wanted to see something.
Get her home!
I'm gonna go help out over at Harry's place.
What happened at Harry's?
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.
Charlie and my dad are over at his place with his family.
is he okay?
He's gone.
Come on. I'll get you something dry and drive you home.
(BELLA shivering) 108 degrees over here.
God!
My hands are freezing.
It must be nice, never getting cold.
It's a wolf thing.
It's not.
It's a Jacob thing.
You're just warm.
You're like your own sun.
This is better, now that you know about me.
But...
You saw what happened to Emily.
Sam got angry.
Lost it for a split second.
Em was standing too close.
He'll never be able to take that back.
What if I got mad at you?
(JACOB sighs)
Sometimes, I feel like I'm gonna disappear.
Okay, not that you need me to tell you something like this,
but I always will.
You're not gonna lose yourself.
I wouldn't let that happen.
How?
I'll tell you all the time
how special you are.
(BELLA lNHALES SHARPLY)
Thank you.
For everything.
Wait.
There's a vampire.
How do you know?
I can smell it. I'm getting you out of here.
That's Carlisle's car.
They're here.
Bella, it's a trick!
Stop!
You gotta come with me!
(BELLA GRUNTS)
They won't hurt me.
If a Cullen is back here, this is their territory.
Treaty says we can only defend on our own lands.
-l can't protect you here.
-Okay.
That's okay.
You don't have to.
You're about to cross a line.
Then don't draw one.
Please?
(BELLA GASPS)
Alice?
-Oh, my God!
What are you...
-Bella!
I'm sorry, I just, I can't believe you're here. ls...
Would you like to explain to me how you're alive?
What?
I saw a vision of you.
You jumped off a cliff.
Why in the hell would you try and kill yourself?
I mean, what about Charlie?
-What about...
-l didn't try to kill myself.
I was cliffjumping.
Recreationally.
It was fun.
(EXHALES) I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy.
Does...
Did you tell him?
No.
He only calls in once every few months.
He said he wants to be alone.
Bella, what is that God-awful wet dog smell?
Um...
That's probably me.
Or it's Jacob.
Jacob who?
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.
Bella!
Werewolves are not good company to keep.
Speak for yourself.
I had to see you were safe.
I thought you couldn't protect me here.
Guess I don't care.
Well, I'm not gonna hurt her.
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.
I'm talking about the other bloodsucker who tried to kill Bella because of you.
Victoria?
Yeah, Victoria's been around.
I didn't see her.
I didn't see you get pulled out of the water, either.
I can't see past you and your pack of mutts.
Don't get me upset...
-Hey, stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
-...or things are gonna get very ugly.
I'll give you a minute.
Hey.
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna come back,
-right?
-As soon as you put the dog out.
is he...
Are there others?
How many Cullens are here and how long are they staying?
No.
It's just Alice.
And she can stay as long as she'd like.
Well, are the rest coming back?
No.
Not that I know of.
(BELLA SCOFFS)
Anything else?
That's it.
Well, if that's all, then you'd better go run back to Sam.
I've done it again.
I keep breaking my promise.
We don't have to do this to each other.
Yes, we do.
(SOFTLY) Bella...
(SPEAKS QUlLEUTE)
(PHONE ringing)
Swan residence.
(sighs)
He's not here right now.
He's arranging a funeral.
(CELL PHONE cracking)
Who was that?
What?
Always in the way.
Who was that?
Bella, step back.
-Jake, who was that?
-Bella!
Bella, it's Edward.
He thinks you're dead.
Rosalie told him why I came here.
Why would you...
Why didn't you let me speak to him?
-He didn't ask for you.
-Bella.
-l don't care!
-Bella.
Bella!
He's going to the Volturi.
He wants to die, too.
JACOB:
He left you, Bella.
He didn't want you anymore.
Remember?
No, I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt.
What about your dad?
I'm 18.
I'm legally free to go, and I left a note.
Please, Bella, just stay here.
For Charlie.
Or for me.
I have to go.
I'm begging you.
Please.
Goodbye, Jacob.
Okay.
(airplane WHOOSHlNG)
(CAR accelerating)
So you've made up your minds.
I'm afraid your particular gifts are too valuable to destroy.
But if you're unhappy with your lot, join us.
We would be delighted to utilize your skills.
Won't you consider staying with us?
You know it will happen anyway.
Not without cause.
Such a waste.
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?
I figured you wouldn't be opposed to grand theft auto.
Not today.
What?
What do you see?
They refused him.
-So?
-He's gonna make a scene.
-Show himself to the humans.
-No!
When?
ALICE:
He's gonna wait until noon, when the sun's at its highest.
(GRUNTS)
God, Alice, you got to hurry up.
There's Volterra.
(HORN HONKlNG)
(tires squealing)
(HONKlNG continues)
(PEOPLE chattering)
-Why are they all in red?
-San Marco's Day festival.
They're commemorating the expulsion of vampires from the city.
It's the perfect setting.
The Volturi will never let him get far enough to reveal himself.
(panting) We have five minutes.
I know, Bella, just breathe.
(HORN HONKlNG)
Alice!
Bella, you're the only one he can't see coming.
If I go, he'll read my thoughts.
He'll think I'm lying.
He'll rush into it.
-Where do I go?
-He'll be under the clock tower.
Go!
(CROWD chanting)
(BELL TOLLS)
Don't!
(BELLA panting)
Heaven.
You have to move.
Open your eyes.
Look at me. I'm alive.
You have to move.
Bella.
-You're here.
-l'm here.
You're alive.
Yes.
I needed to make you see me once.
You had to know that I was alive, that you didn't have to feel guilty about anything.
I can let you go now.
I never acted out of guilt.
I just couldn't live in a world where you don't exist.
-But you said...
-l lied.
I had to lie.
But you believed me so easily.
Because it doesn't make sense for you to love me.
I mean, I'm nothing. I'm human. I'm nothing.
Bella, you're everything to me.
You're everything.
(GATE OPENS)
I won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen.
Aro wants to speak with you again.
No rules were broken.
Nonetheless, we should take this conversation to a more appropriate venue.
Fine.
Bella, why don't you go and enjoy the rest of the festival?
The girl comes with us.
No.
You can go to hell.
(LOCK BREAKS)
Come on, guys.
It's a festival.
You wouldn't want to make a scene.
We wouldn't.
Enough.
Jane.
Aro sent me to see what was taking so long.
Just do as she says.
Go ahead.
Don't be scared.
Are you?
No.
(JANE SCOFFS)
(OPERA PLAYING)
(speaking Italian)
-ls she human?
-Yes.
Does she know?
Yes.
Then, why would...
She wants to be.
And so she will be.
Or dessert.
ALEC:
Sister.
They send you out to get one and you bring back two.
And a half.
Such a clever girl.
What a happy surprise!
Bella is alive after all.
Isn't that wonderful?
I love a happy ending.
ARO:
Ah.
(GASPS)
They are so rare.
(GASPS)
(speaking Italian)
Her blood appeals to you so much it makes me thirsty.
How can you stand to be so close to her?
-lt's not without difficulty.
-Yes, I can see that.
(ARO chuckling)
Aro can read every thought I've ever had with one touch.
And now you know everything.
So get on with it.
You are quite a soul reader yourself, Edward.
Though you can't read Bella's thoughts.
Fascinating.
I would love to see if you are an exception to my gifts, as well.
Would you do me the honor?
Interesting.
Hmm.
I see nothing.
I wonder if...
Let us see if she's immune to all our powers.
Shall we, Jane?
-No!
-Pain.
(GROANS)
BELLA:
Stop!
Stop!
Please!
Stop!
(GRUNTS) Stop!
Just stop hurting him!
Please!
Please!
Jane?
Master?
(GASPS)
Go ahead, my dear.
This may hurt just a little.
(laughing excitedly)
Remarkable!
She confounds us all.
So what do we do with you now?
You already know what you're going to do, Aro.
She knows too much.
She's a liability.
Hmm.
That's true.
Felix?
EDWARD:
No!
(GASPS)
Please!
No!
No!
Please, please!
Kill me!
Kill me!
Not him.
How extraordinary.
You would give up your life for someone like us.
A vampire.
A soulless monster.
Just get away from her!
You don't know a thing about his soul.
(speaking Italian)
This is a sadness.
If only it were your intention to give her immortality.
Wait!
Bella will be one of us.
I've seen it.
I'll change her myself.
Mesmerizing.
To see what you have seen before it has happened.
Your gifts will make for an intriguing immortal,
Isabella.
Go now.
Make your preparations.
Let us be done with this.
Heidi will arrive any moment.
Thank you for your visit.
CAlUS:
We will return the favor.
I would advise that you follow through on your promise soon.
We do not offer second chances.
ARO:
Goodbye, my young friends.
(PEOPLE chattering)
DEMETRl:
Nice fishing, Heidi.
Yes, they do look ratherjuicy.
Save some for me.
heidi:
This way, please.
Stay together.
(PEOPLE screaming)
(gasping)
(SCREAMS ECHOING)
Stop!
Stop!
You're here.
You can sleep.
I'll still be here when you wake up.
Bella, the only reason I left was because I thought I was protecting you.
I needed you to have a chance at a normal, happy life.
It was so easy for you to leave.
Leaving you was the hardest thing I've done in 100 years.
(sighing)
And I swear, I will never fail you again.
I'm so sorry.
-Charlie's coming.
-Hey.
You okay?
I'm fine.
Dad, you don't have to worry.
You know, last time you said that, you took off.
I didn't see you for three days.
I'm really sorry, Dad.
Bella, do not ever do that to me again.
Ever.
And you're grounded for the rest of your life.
Okay.
I'm not technically breaking any of his rules.
He did say I couldn't take a step inside the door.
I came in through the window.
He's not gonna forgive me easily.
I know.
Can you?
I hope you can, 'cause I honestly don't know how to live without you.
Come here.
Once Alice changes me, you can't get rid of me.
She won't need to change you.
There are always ways to keep the Volturi in the dark.
No.
No.
You all know what I want.
And I know how much I'm asking for.
The only thing that I can think of for it to be fair is to just vote.
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-Shut up.
Alice?
I already consider you my sister.
-Yes.
-Thank you.
JASPER:
I vote "yes."
It would be nice to not want to kill you all the time.
Hmm.
ROSALlE:
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry to both of you for how I've acted, and I'm really grateful that you were brave enough to go and save my brother.
But this isn't a life I would have chosen for myself.
And I wish that there'd been someone to vote "no" for me.
So, no.
I vote "Hell, yeah."
And we can pick a fight with these Volturi some other way.
I already consider you a part of the family.
Yes.
(DR. CULLEN sighs)
Why are you doing this to me?
You know what this means.
You've chosen not to live without her, which leaves me no choice.
I won't lose my son.
BELLA:
I'll wait until after graduation to make it easier on Charlie.
Edward, I want you to be the one to do it.
(tires SCREECH)
He wants to talk to me.
JACOB:
So you're still alive for now.
EDWARD:
He thinks it's me keeping you away.
JACOB:
You stay the hell out of my head.
Jacob, I know you have something to say to me.
But I want to say something to you first, if that's all right.
Thank you.
Thank you for keeping Bella alive when I didn't.
No.
You didn't.
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.
I'm still grateful.
But I'm here now.
I'm not gonna leave her side until she orders me away.
We'll see.
Hey, my turn to talk.
I'm here to remind you about a key point in the treaty.
I haven't forgotten.
What key point?
If any of them bites a human, the truce is over.
But if I choose it, it has nothing to do with you.
No.
No, I won't let you.
You're not gonna be one of them, Bella.
It's not up to you.
You know what we'll do to you.
I won't have a choice.
Bella, please, come.
Wait.
is he gonna hurt me?
Read his mind.
Jake,
I love you.
(JACOB BREATHES DEEPLY)
So, please,
don't make me choose,
'cause it'll be him.
It's always been him.
Bella...
-Goodbye, Jacob.
-No, you don't speak for her!
(GROWLlNG)
(ROARS)
Bella, get out of here.
BELLA:
Stop!
Stop!
You can't hurt each other without hurting me.
Jake.
He's right.
You shouldn't become what I am.
I can't do this alone.
Then, please, just wait.
Just give me five years.
That's too long.
(sighs)
Then three?
You're so stubborn.
What are you waiting for?
I have one condition if you want me to do it myself.
What's the condition?
And then forever.
That's what I'm asking.
Marry me, Bella.

Meet me on the equinox
Meet me halfway
When the sun is perched at its highest peak ln the middle of the day
Let me give my love to you
Let me take your hand
As we walk in the dimming light
Oh, darling, understand
That everything, everything ends
Meet me on your best behavior
Meet me at your worst
For there will be no stone unturned
Or bubble left to burst
Let me lay beside you, darling
Let me be your man
And let our bodies intertwine
But always understand
That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything, everything ends

An opened tomb
The sun crawls
Across your bedroom
A halo
A waiting room
Your last breaths
Moving through you
As everything, everything ends
As everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything ends

When the sun is perched at its highest peak ln the middle of the day
Let me give my love to you

We coordinated.
she coordinated me.
It's to put your pictures in from senior year.
Senior year.
How'd you get so old so fast?
I didn't.
It's not that old.
I don't know.
Is that a gray hair?
No.
No way.
Happy birthday.
That's really funny.

Bella? a scrapbook full of memories.
Oh.
Cool.
Yeah.
I take them.
I'm not in them.

I'm in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.
That's good.
good.
Cullen's here.
talk to you later.
Happy birthday.
Don't remind me.
your birth is definitely something to celebrate.
but my aging's not.
Your aging?
I think 18 is a little young to start worrying about that.
It's one year older than you.
it isn't.
I'm 109.
maybe I shouldn't be dating such an old man.
It's gross.
I should be thoroughly repulsed.
We have to go to class.
Okay.
Wait a second.
Someone wants you.
Bella!
Jacob!
What?
I'll leave you to talk.
anabolic steroids are really bad for you.
Bella.
it wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more.
You should switch schools.
You can come hang out with the palefaces.
I'm all right.
I prefer the rez school's exclusivity.
They let any old riffraff into this place.
I see.
Then why are you slumming it?
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.
You should really come take a ride when it's done.
Is it fast?
It's decent.
I'm kidding.
Okay.
Good.
happy birthday.
so of course he did.
I saw this the other day and thought of you.
Catches bad dreams.
That's kind of perfect.
Thank you.
No problem.
I'll see you later.
Bye.
So how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?
Because I have nothing to give back to you.
you give me everything just by breathing.
See?
Thank you.
That's all I want.
Bella!
Happy birthday!
I thought I said no presents. you love it.
You're gonna wear it tonight.
Our place.
Come on.
Please?
It'll be fun.
Okay All right.
Great!
I'll see you at 7:00.
no fair with the mood control thing.
Bella.
Happy
Never mind.
You can't trust vampires.
Trust me.
O my love!
My wife!
that hath sucked the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Thou art not conquered.
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks.
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
I hate being celebrated.
look at Romeo.
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.
Yeah.
Though I do envy him one thing.
perfect.
If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.
the suicide.
It's nearly impossible for
For some people. a dagger to the heart.
There's so many different options.
Why would you say that?
Because I had to consider it once.
I didn't know if I'd get to you in time.
I had to come up with some kind of plan.
What was the plan?
That I'd go to Italy and provoke the Volturi.
The what?
The Volturi.
who'd like to repeat the last few lines of iambic pentameter just to show they were paying attention?
Mr. Cullen?
Mr. Berty.
O here will I set up my everlasting rest and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.
look your last.
take your last embrace! seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death!
people.
Thus with a kiss I die.
very powerful family.
I guess they're the closest thing to royalty my world has.
Is that Carlisle?
Yeah.
He lived with them for a few decades. at least.
And the law.
the law.
Vampires have laws?
Not very many.
And only one that's regularly enforced.
What is it?
That we keep the existence of our kind a secret. and we don't kill conspicuously.
you want to die.
You gotta stop talking about that.
I can't even think about someone hurting you.
the only thing that can hurt me is you.
And I don't have anything else to be afraid of.
That's not true.
Victoria?
She'll come for me one day.
and we'll be ready.
I could protect you if you change me.
you already do protect me.
You're my only reason if that's what I am.
But it's my job to protect you.
From everyone except my sister.
It's time!
It's time.
It's time.
It's time!
Sorry about all this.
We tried to rein Alice in.
As if that were even possible.
Bella.
Thanks.
I found it in your bag.
You mind?
Dating an older woman.
Hot.
Rosalie.
It's a necklace.
Alice picked it out.
Thanks.
Show me the love.
This one's from Emmett.
Already installed it in your truck.
Finally a decent sound system for that piece of Hey!
Don't hate the truck.
Open Esme and Carlisle's.
Just a little something to brighten your day.
you've been looking kind of pale lately.
Paper cut.
Jaz.
It's okay.
It's just a little blood.
Get Jasper out of here.
I can't.
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.
Check on Jasper. and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.
Edward.
I never wanted to have a party.
It's not your fault.
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.
How do you do it?
Years and years of practice.
Did you ever think of just doing it the easy way?
No.
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.
even if I am damned regardless.
Damned?
Like hell?
you couldn't be damned.
You couldn't.
It's impossible.
Bella.
You've always been very gracious about us.
So that's it?
That's why he won't change me?
Imagine the situation in reverse.
Hmm. could you take away his soul?
You can't protect me from everything.
something's gonna separate us.
It's gonna be an accident or illness as long as I'm human.
And the only solution is to change me.
That's not a solution.
That's a tragedy.
You're not gonna want me when I look like a grandmother.
do you not understand my feelings for you at all?
Carlisle told me
how you feel about your soul.
I don't believe that.
So don't worry about mine.
You should go inside.
It's still my birthday.
So can I ask one thing?
Kiss me?
I love you.
I love you.
Hey.
Just come take a walk with me.
We have to leave Forks.
Why? and people are starting to notice.
I've gotta think of something to say to Charlie.
When you saywe
I mean my family and myself.
it's nothing. nothing but what I always expected
and nothing compared to what could have happened.
Bella.
I belong with you.
No.
You don't.
I'm coming.
I don't want you to come.
You don't want me?
No.
That changes things a lot.
can you just promise me something?
Don't do anything reckless.
For Charlies sake.
And I'll promise something to you in return.
This is the last time you'll ever see me.
and you can go on with your life without any interference from me.
I promise.
take it.
I don't want it without you.
It's not about your soul.
You're just not good for me.
Not good enough for you.
I'm just sorry I let this go on for so long.
Please
Don't
Goodbye.
Edward.
Edward.
Edward.
Edward!
Edward.
I'm gonna try the Cullens' place again.
Charlie.
Good riddance.
Where'd they go?
Charlie.
Harry.
Charlie!
Hey.
She's all right.
Sam.
like everything else.
Now who else can I talk to?
I'm lost.
you took everything with you.
But the absence of him is everywhere I look.
It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest.
Bella.
But in a way I'm glad.
that you all were.
All right.
That's it.
What?
You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother.
I'm not leaving Forks.
he's not coming back.
I know.
this behavior.
it's scaring the hell out of me and your mother.
I don't want you to leave.
but just go.
Go to Jacksonville.
Make some new friends.
I like my old friends.
you never see them anymore.
I do.
I'm gonna go shopping tomorrow with Jessica.
You hate shopping.
I
I need a girls' night out.
All right.
Girls' night.
Shopping.
I like it.
Go buy some stuff.
it's Bella.
Bella Swan.
I don't know why you want to sit through all those zombies eating people and no hot guys kissing anybody.
It's gross.
Like And why are there that many zombie movies anyway? you know?
is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism? you know?
apparently.
Although I was surprised you even called at all.
You know?
totally worried. girls?
too.
You know?
Like Mike deciding he just wants to be friends.
What's up?
Look what we found.
you know?
and since when doesjust friends
What's up guys?
Look what we found.
where you going?
Keep walking.
This is dangerous.
come on.
I think I know those guys.
We got beer!
We got bikes!
they seem great.
Can we go?
I'm just gonna see something.
girlie!
all right.
We got a taker.
Turn around.
Shut up!
You shut up!
I thought you were somebody else.
honey.
what do you say?
nothing reckless.
You promised it would be as if you never existed.
babe?
You know what?
Never mind.
stop!
what the hell's wrong with you?
Just curious.
I thought that I saw something.
You Oh.
actually.
Or suicidal.
That homeboy could've been a psycho.
I was about to end up in an FBI interview room like some lame TV show.
that was such a rush.
Awesome.
So you're an adrenaline junkie now?
That's cool.
You can go bungee jumping.
You don't get on the back of some random loser's motorcycle.
Crazy.
I saw him.
Maybe I'm crazy now.
I guess that's okay.
then that's what I'll find.
Bella!
loca?
I brought you something.
Okay It's a little crazy.
Wow.
Scrap metal.
You shouldn't have.
I saved it from the junkyard. but then I thought that if I had a mechanic friend to help me out then Ah!
Me being the mechanictype friend?
That's right.
Since when are you into motorcycles?
Since now.
I get it if you think that this is really stupid and reckless.
it's completely stupid and reckless.
When do we start?
Now.
Please?
All right.
so
buff.
16.
I don't get it.
40 now?
It feels like that sometimes.
That song's good.
You don't like it?
kind of.
Okay.
No more music. fit some homework in there somewhere.
I don't want Billy thinking that I'm a bad influence on you.
You?
Influence me?
Please. so that makes me the influencer and you the influencee.
no.
My size and knowledge base actually makes me older than you because of your general paleness and lack of know-how.
I convinced you to build two-wheeled death machines with me.
Don't you think that makes you kind of young and naive?
Okay.
So where do we stand?
32.
Come on.
you in there?
It's okay.
It's just my boys.
this is Bella.
that's Quil and Embry.
Hi.
I'm Quil Ateara.
So the bike building story is true.
I taught him everything he knows.
What about the part where you're his girlfriend?
you know. remember I said she's a girl and a friend.
do you remember him making that distinction?
Nope.
So you guys have girlfriends?
That's awesome.
right.
Quil's actually taking his cousin to prom.
that's still a riot.
Black?
I'll give you funny.
Jeez.
that hold's illegal!
I got five bucks on Quil.
You're on.
I wish I had your real address.
I wish I could tell you about Jake.
He makes me feel better.
he makes me feel alive.
it's like it's almost healed
for a while.
Quil keeps asking to come over.
I think he likes you a little too much.
I'm really not into the whole cougar thing.
You know?
What's up with you and age?
anyway?
But even Jake can't keep the dreams away.
hey!
Bella.
You're okay.
You're okay.
but I guess not.
Can I ask you something? doesn't it?
sometimes you gotta learn to love what's good for you.
You know what I mean?
what do I know?
I'm just a terminal bachelor.
Famous ladies' man.
Okay.
I'm gonna go to bed.
I love you.
what would you have said?
Are you doubting your mad skills?
they'll run fine.
I would have dragged out the rebuild a bit. but that we're just gonna have to find something else to do.
Is that Sam Uley?
Yeah.
Him and his cult.
my God.
Did you see that?
Bella.
They're cliff diving.
but a total rush.
A rush?
Most of us jump from lower down.
We leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples.
You have some kind of beef with him or something?
I don't know.
They just think they run this place.
Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids.
Now look at him.
That's Embry?
Yeah.
What happened to him?
He missed some school.
he started following Sam around like a little puppy.
Same thing happened with Paul and Jared. like he's waiting for me or something.
It's kind of starting to freak me out.
you should just avoid him.
I try.
Okay.
You look scared.
I'm not.
All right.
Brake?
That one.
Clutch?
Good.
Gas?
Ready?
slowly release the clutch.
Bella.
Stop.
Whoa!
You all right?
I'm gonna go again.
Okay.
Ah!
Whoa!
Hit the brake!
I wanna go again.
Are you trying to get yourself killed?
No.
I want to go again.
No.
Forget it.
No more bikes.
your head.
I'm sorry.
you're apologizing for bleeding?
Yeah.
I guess I am.
Bella.
No big deal.
There.
What are you staring at?
You're sort of beautiful.
How hard did you hit your head?
I don't know.
Let's go.
I did see something in the woods.
I believe you.
he doesn't.
He's just trying to get lucky.
okay.
It was jet black and huge.
it was still taller than a person.
maybe?
Or an alien.
You're lucky you didn't get probed.
I saw it.
you're not the only one.
My dad's been getting reports at the station.
five hikers have been killed by some bear.
But they can't find the bear.
Hmm.
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.
Bella's back?
I guess so.
welcome.
now that you're talking I was just wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me.
I do.
Cool.
we could check out
Love Spelled Backwards Is Love.
but it's a romantic comedy.
it's supposed to be pretty No.
No romance.
How about Face Punch?
Have you heard of that?
that's an action movie.
that's perfect.
adrenaline.
That's my thing.
Okay.
We should get a bunch of people to go.
Do you guys want to go see Face Punch?
yeah!
we were supposed to watch that.
the trailer's like
Punch faces.
I remember.
Yeah!
Movie night with Bella.
huh?
You like action movies?
Not really.
I heard it sucks.
Bad.
Are you even old enough to see this movie?
adult supervision.
she's buying my ticket for me.
She's buying it.
Okay. so Eric's taking care of her.
It's just us three.
Great!
Great.
Yeah.
Put your gun down.
Put your gun down or I'm gonna blow your frickin' head off.
Both of you put both of your guns down or I'm gonna blow both of your frickin' heads off.
let's do this!
I think I'm gonna throw up.
He's
What a marshmallow!
You should hold out for someone with a stronger stomach.
Someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit.
Yeah.
I'll keep my eye open for that.
I feel bad.
He probably has that flu that's going around.
What?
I can't hold your hand?
of course you can.
something a little different to you.
So right?
And you think I'm sort of beautiful?
don't do this.
Why?
Because you're about to ruin everything.
And I need you.
I've got loads of time.
I'm not gonna give up. but it's just 'cause I don't want you to go anywhere.
And that's really selfish.
I'm not like a car that you can fix up.
I'm never gonna run right.
So I should be fair to you.
right? I know what he did to you.
I would never ever do that.
I won't ever hurt you.
I promise.
I won't let you down.
You can count on me.
Well.
I need to go home.
I was feeling sick before the movie.
Okay?
What is your problem?
Right now?
You're my problem.
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.
You want me to put you in the hospital?
the movie's over.
What are you doing?
You're really hot.
you feel like you have a fever.
Are you okay?
I don't know what's happening.
I gotta go.
That dude is weird.
your dad says you have mono.
but would you call me?
it's me again.
I just
I'm sorry about what I said at the movie theater.
so no pressure.
please
Call me.
Okay.
We should be back around 3:00.
Hey.
I don't have to go fishing today.
you do.
you do.
Go.
What are you talking about?
Just be careful.
Always am.
Bella.
My kung fu is strong.
Jake!
Hey!
You cut your hair off?
And got a tattoo?
Bella.
I thought you were too sick to come outside or pick up the phone when I call.
Go away.
What?
Go away.
What happened to you?
What's
Hey!
What happened?
Did Sam get to you?
Is that what's happening?
Sam's trying to help me.
Don't blame him. the Cullens?
I don't know what you're talking about.
you know exactly what I'm talking about.
You've been lying to everyone.
Charlie.
But you can't lie to me.
Bella.
Jacob!
Jacob! we can't be friends anymore.
I know that I've been hurting you.
It's killing me.
It kills me. don't.
It's not you.
right?
Really?
It's true.
It is me.
I'm not good.
I used to be a good kid.
Not anymore.
This doesn't even matter.
All right?
This is over.
You can't break up with me.
I mean you're my best friend.
You promised me.
I know.
Bella.
And this is me keeping that promise.
Go home and don't come back or you're gonna get hurt.
things are
Things are bad again.
I just I can't stand it.
I don't see Edward anymore.
Will it really feel like he never existed?
I will find the place where I can see him again.
Bella.
Laurent.
I didn't expect to find you here.
but the house is empty.
I'm surprised they left you behind.
Weren't you sort of a pet of theirs?
Yeah.
You could say that.
Do the Cullens visit often?
Lie.
all the time.
Lie better.
I'll tell them that you stopped by.
But I probably shouldn't 'cause he's pretty protective.
isn't he?
Why are you here?
I came as a favor to Victoria.
Victoria?
She asked me to see if you were still under the protection of the Cullens. given he killed hers.
An eye for an eye.
Threaten him.
Edward would know who did it.
And he'd come after you.
I don't think he will.
how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected? but I can't help myself.
You are so mouth-watering.
no.
Don't be afraid.
I'm doing you a kindness. whereas I'll make it quick.
I promise.
You will feel nothing.
I love you.
I don't believe it.
Dad!
I saw them.
What's the matter?
In the woods.
They're not bears.
What do you meaning the woods?
what the hell were you doing out in the woods?
they're like huge wolves.
Bella?
Yeah!
I just saw them.
They were after something.
Wolves?
You saw them? feel like going hunting?
Get some of your guys together?
I'll just
and Laurent would have told her I'm unprotected.
Victoria.
I should go to the station.
you should.
You should go.
Can you just stay in the house?
Bella!
You scared me.
What the hell are you doing?
Back up.
I'm coming up.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
For what?
I wish I could explain.
But I literally can't. one that wasn't yours to share?
that's what it's like for me.
But worse.
You have no idea how tight I'm bound.
I hate this.
I hate what they've done to you.
you already know.
do you remember when we walked on the beach at La Push?
The
The story.
The story about the cold ones.
I guess I understand why that's the only part you remember.
There's gotta be something that you can do.
No.
I'm in it for life.
maybe we should just get out of here for a while. just you and me.
You'd do that?
I would do it for you.
Bella.
But I would run away with you
if I could.
I gotta go.
They'll start wondering where I am.
Come here. try to remember.
It'd be so much easier if you knew.
Jake
Jake.
I'm scared.
You should be.
it's just like an old story.
I'm not really supposed to say anything about it.
Did you know Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?
Bella?
I need to see him.
He's not in.
I really need to see him.
Bella!
What did you do?
what did you do?
Hey.
What did you do to him?
Easy!
He didn't want this.
What did we do?
What did he do?
What'd he tell you?
Both of you calm down.
Nothing.
He tells me nothing because he's scared of you.
get back!
now!
Bella!
Run!
run!
Paul!
Hey!
Take Bella back to Emily's place.
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.
is it possible that everything is true?
The fairy tales and horror stories?
Is it possible that there isn't anything sane or normal at all?
I think we should go back and see if Jacob's okay.
I hope Paul sinks some teeth in him.
Serves him right.
No way.
Jacob's a natural.
You see him phase on the fly?
I got five says Paul doesn't touch him.
Bella.
We won't bite.
Speak for yourself.
Sam's fiancée?
Don't stare.
It bugs Sam.
Why would I stare?
Are you guys hungry?
Like I have to ask.
Who's this?
Bella Swan.
Who else?
Hmm.
you're the vampire girl.
you're the wolf girl.
Guess so.
I'm engaged to one.
Save some for your brothers.
And ladies first.
Muffin?
Sure.
Thanks.
Leave it to Jacob to find a way around Sam's gag order.
He didn't say anything to me.
That's a wolf thing.
Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want them to or not.
And check it out.
We can hear each others thoughts.
Would you shut up?
These are trade secrets.
Damn it!
This chick runs with vampires.
You can't really run with vampires.
'Cause they're fast.
we're faster.
Freaked out yet?
You're not the first monsters I've met.
Jake's right.
You're good with weird.
Hey.
Sorry.
So you're a werewolf?
Yeah.
Last time I checked.
A few lucky members of the tribe have the gene.
A bloodsucker moves into town and the fever sets in.
Mono.
Yeah.
I wish.
can't you find a way to just stop?
it's wrong.
Bella.
I was born this way.
I can't help it.
I'm not the right kind of monster for you?
It's not what you are.
It's what you do.
They never hurt anybody.
Jake.
we're not killing anyone.
Then who is? vampires.
you can't.
Don't worry.
We can't touch your little precious Cullens unless they violate the treaty.
That's not what I'm saying.
You can't kill vampires.
They'll
They'll kill you.
Really?
We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough.
Laurent?
And his redheaded girlfriend is next.
Victoria's here?
Was.
We chased her all the way to the Canadian border the other night.
She keeps coming back.
We don't know what she's after.
I do.
Me.
Don't worry.
We've got this place covered.
She won't get near you or Charlie.
you've got to be careful.
She's fast.
You don't know how fast she is.
your lack of confidence in us is a little insulting.
I'd better go.
You gotta go?
Yeah.
Got a vampire to kill.
I'm all right.
until I'm alone.
that's all the time.
Jacob's gone.
He's hunting Victoria.
And Charlie's hunting Jacob.
And you're gone.
And so is Edward.
And there's just nothing now.
Harry?
Nope.
Nothing.
what I have to do to see him again.
Don't do this.
You wanted me to be human.
Watch me.
Please.
For me.
You won't stay with me any other way.
please.
Breathe!
Breathe!
breathe!
can you hear me?
Jake?
Come here.
What the hell were you thinking?
I just wanted to see something.
Get her home!
I'm gonna go help out over at Harry's place.
What happened at Harry's?
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.
Charlie and my dad are over at his place with his family.
Is he okay?
He's gone.
Come on.
I'll get you something dry and drive you home.
108 degrees over here.
God!
My hands are freezing.
never getting cold.
It's a wolf thing.
It's not.
It's a Jacob thing.
You're just warm.
You're like your own sun.
now that you know about me.
But
You saw what happened to Emily.
Sam got angry.
Lost it for a split second.
Em was standing too close.
He'll never be able to take that back.
What if I got mad at you? I feel like I'm gonna disappear.
not that you need me but I always will.
You're not gonna lose yourself.
I wouldn't let that happen.
How?
I'll tell you all the time
how special you are.
Thank you.
For everything.
Wait.
There's a vampire.
How do you know?
I can smell it.
I'm getting you out of here.
That's Carlisle's car.
They're here.
it's a trick!
Stop!
You gotta come with me!
They won't hurt me.
this is their territory.
Treaty says we can only defend on our own lands.
I can't protect you here.
Okay.
That's okay.
You don't have to.
You're about to cross a line.
Then don't draw one.
Please?
Alice?
my God!
What are you Bella!
I can't believe you're here.
Is
Would you like to explain to me how you're alive?
What?
I saw a vision of you.
You jumped off a cliff.
Why in the hell would you try and kill yourself?
what about Charlie?
What about I didn't try to kill myself.
I was cliff jumping.
Recreationally.
It was fun.
I have never met anyone more prone to lifethreatening idiocy.
Does
Did you tell him?
No.
He only calls in once every few months.
He said he wants to be alone.
what is that God-awful wet dog smell?
Um
That's probably me.
Or it's Jacob.
Jacob who?
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.
Bella!
Werewolves are not good company to keep.
Speak for yourself.
I had to see you were safe.
I thought you couldn't protect me here.
Guess I don't care.
I'm not gonna hurt her.
you're just a harmless Cullen.
I'm talking about the other bloodsucker who tried to kill Bella because of you.
Victoria?
Victoria's been around.
I didn't see her.
either.
I can't see past you and your pack of mutts.
Don't get me upset stop.
or things are gonna get very ugly.
I'll give you a minute.
Hey. right?
As soon as you put the dog out.
Is he
Are there others?
How many Cullens are here and how long are they staying?
No.
It's just Alice.
And she can stay as long as she'd like.
are the rest coming back?
No.
Not that I know of.
Anything else?
That's it.
then you'd better go run back to Sam.
I've done it again.
I keep breaking my promise.
We don't have to do this to each other.
we do.
Bella
Swan residence.
He's not here right now.
He's arranging a funeral.
Who was that?
What?
Always in the way.
Who was that?
step back.
it's Edward.
He thinks you're dead.
Rosalie told him why I came here.
Why would you Why didn't you let me speak to him?
He didn't ask for you.
Bella.
I don't care!
Bella.
Bella!
He's going to the Volturi.
too.
Bella.
He didn't want you anymore.
Remember?
I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt.
What about your dad?
and I left a note. just stay here.
For Charlie.
Or for me.
I have to go.
I'm begging you.
Please.
Jacob.
Okay.
So you've made up your minds.
I'm afraid your particular gifts are too valuable to destroy.
join us.
We would be delighted to utilize your skills.
Won't you consider staying with us?
You know it will happen anyway.
Not without cause.
Such a waste.
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?
I figured you wouldn't be opposed to grand theft auto.
Not today.
What?
What do you see?
They refused him.
So?
He's gonna make a scene.
Show himself to the humans.
No!
When?
when the sun's at its highest.
you got to hurry up.
There's Volterra.
Why are they all in red?
San Marco's Day festival.
They're commemorating the expulsion of vampires from the city.
It's the perfect setting.
The Volturi will never let him get far enough to reveal himself.
We have five minutes.
just breathe.
Alice!
you're the only one he can't see coming.
he'll read my thoughts.
He'll think I'm lying.
He'll rush into it.
Where do I go?
He'll be under the clock tower.
Go!
Don't!
Heaven.
You have to move.
Open your eyes.
Look at me.
I'm alive.
You have to move.
Bella.
You're here.
I'm here.
You're alive.
Yes.
I needed to make you see me once. that you didn't have to feel guilty about anything.
I can let you go now.
I never acted out of guilt.
I just couldn't live in a world where you don't exist.
But you said I lied.
I had to lie.
But you believed me so easily.
Because it doesn't make sense for you to love me.
I'm nothing.
I'm human.
I'm nothing.
you're everything to me.
You're everything.
gentlemen.
Aro wants to speak with you again.
No rules were broken.
we should take this conversation to a more appropriate venue.
Fine.
why don't you go and enjoy the rest of the festival?
The girl comes with us.
No.
You can go to hell.
guys.
It's a festival.
You wouldn't want to make a scene.
We wouldn't.
Enough.
Jane.
Aro sent me to see what was taking so long.
Just do as she says.
Go ahead.
Don't be scared.
Are you?
No.
Is she human?
Yes.
Does she know?
Yes.
why would
She wants to be.
And so she will be.
Or dessert.
Sister.
They send you out to get one and you bring back two.
And a half.
Such a clever girl.
What a happy surprise!
Bella is alive after all.
Isn't that wonderful?
I love a happy ending.
They are so rare.
Her blood appeals to you so much it makes me thirsty.
How can you stand to be so close to her?
I can see that.
Aro can read every thought I've ever had with one touch.
And now you know everything.
So get on with it.
Edward.
Though you can't read Bella's thoughts.
Fascinating.
as well.
Would you do me the honor?
Interesting.
I see nothing.
I wonder if
Let us see if she's immune to all our powers.
Jane?
No!
Pain.
Stop!
Stop!
Please!
Stop!
Stop!
Just stop hurting him!
Please!
Please!
Jane?
Master?
my dear.
This may hurt just a little.
Remarkable!
She confounds us all.
So what do we do with you now?
Aro.
She knows too much.
She's a liability.
That's true.
Felix?
No!
please!
Kill me!
Kill me!
Not him.
How extraordinary.
You would give up your life for someone like us.
A vampire.
A soulless monster.
Just get away from her!
You don't know a thing about his soul.
This is a sadness.
If only it were your intention to give her immortality.
Wait!
Bella will be one of us.
I've seen it.
I'll change her myself.
Mesmerizing.
To see what you have seen before it has happened.
Your gifts will make for an intriguing Isabella.
Go now.
Make your preparations.
Let us be done with this.
Heidi will arrive any moment.
Thank you for your visit.
We will return the favor.
I would advise that you follow through on your promise soon.
We do not offer second chances.
my young friends.
Heidi.
they do look rather juicy.
Save some for me.
please.
Stay together.
Stop!
Stop!
You're here.
You can sleep.
I'll still be here when you wake up.
the only reason I left was because I thought I was protecting you.
I needed you happy life.
It was so easy for you to leave.
Leaving you was the hardest thing I've done in 100 years.
I will never fail you again.
I'm so sorry.
Charlie's coming.
Hey.
You okay?
I'm fine.
you don't have to worry.
you took off.
I didn't see you for three days.
Dad.
do not ever do that to me again.
Ever.
And you're grounded for the rest of your life.
Okay.
I'm not technically breaking any of his rules.
He did say I couldn't take a step inside the door.
I came in through the window.
He's not gonna forgive me easily.
I know.
Can you? 'cause I honestly don't know how to live without you.
Come here. you can't get rid of me.
She won't need to change you.
There are always ways to keep the Volturi in the dark.
No.
No.
You all know what I want.
And I know how much I'm asking for.
The only thing that I can think of for it to be fair is to just vote.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Shut up.
Alice?
I already consider you my sister.
Yes.
Thank you.
I voteyes.
It would be nice to not want to kill you all the time.
I'm sorry. and I'm really grateful that you were brave enough to go and save my brother.
But this isn't a life I would have chosen for myself.
And I wish that there'd been someone to voteno for me.
no.
yeah.
And we can pick a fight with these Volturi some other way.
I already consider you a part of the family.
Yes.
Why are you doing this to me?
You know what this means.
which leaves me no choice.
I won't lose my son.
I'll wait until after graduation to make it easier on Charlie.
I want you to be the one to do it.
He wants to talk to me.
So you're still alive for now.
He thinks it's me keeping you away.
You stay the hell out of my head.
I know you have something to say to me.
if that's all right.
Thank you.
Thank you for keeping Bella alive when I didn't.
No.
You didn't.
trust me.
I'm still grateful.
But I'm here now.
I'm not gonna leave her side until she orders me away.
We'll see.
my turn to talk.
I'm here to remind you about a key point in the treaty.
I haven't forgotten.
What key point? the truce is over.
it has nothing to do with you.
I won't let you.
Bella.
It's not up to you.
You know what we'll do to you.
I won't have a choice.
come.
Wait.
Is he gonna hurt me?
Read his mind.
I love you.
please. 'cause it'll be him.
It's always been him.
Bella
you don't speak for her!
get out of here.
Stop!
Stop!
You can't hurt each other without hurting me.
Jake.
He's right.
You shouldn't become what I am.
I can't do this alone.
just wait.
Just give me five years.
That's too long.
Then three?
You're so stubborn.
What are you waiting for?
I have one condition if you want me to do it myself.
What's the condition?
And then forever.
That's what I'm asking.
Bella.

Well, she coordinated me.
It's to put your pictures in from senior year.

Oh.

Cool.
Yeah.
I take them.
I'm not in them.

Don't worry, I'm in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.

EDWARD:
Mmm.
Bella, your birth is definitely something to celebrate.
-Yeah, but my aging's not.
-Your aging?
(CHUCKLES)
I think 18 is a little young to start worrying about that.
It's one year older than you.
No, it isn't.
I'm 109.
Well, maybe I shouldn't be dating such an old man.
It's gross.
I should be thoroughly repulsed.

Well, I'm just filling out, Bella.
You know, it wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more.
You should switch schools.
You can come hang out with the palefaces.
I'm all right.
I prefer the rez school's exclusivity.
They let any old riffraff into this place.
-I see.
Then why are you slumming it?
-Mmm-hmm.
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.
You should really come take a ride when it's done.
Is it fast?
Um.
It's decent.
(BOTH LAUGH)
-I'm kidding.
-Okay.
Good.
Hey, happy birthday.
Your dad told my dad, so...
Yeah, of course he did.
I saw this the other day and thought of you.
Catches bad dreams.
That's kind of perfect.
Thank you.
No problem.
-Good seeing you.
-Yeah, I'll see you later.
Bye.
So how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?
Because I have nothing to give back to you.

My wife!
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Thou art not conquered.
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks.
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
BELLA:
I hate being celebrated.
EDWARD:
There are worse tragedies.
I mean, look at Romeo.
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.
BELLA:
Yeah.
Though I do envy him one thing.
BELLA:
Juliet is, like, perfect.
If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.
(EDWARD LAUGHS)
Not the girl, the suicide.
It's nearly impossible for...
For some people.
For humans, a little poison, a dagger to the heart.
There's so many different options.
Why would you say that?
Because I had to consider it once.
(BELLA SCREAMING)
I didn't know if I'd get to you in time.
I had to come up with some kind of plan.
What was the plan?
That I'd go to Italy and provoke the Volturi.
-The what?
-The Volturi.
MR. BERTY:
Now, who'd like to repeat the last few lines of iambic pentameter just to show they were paying attention?
Mr. Cullen?
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Yes, Mr. Berty.
"O here will I set up my everlasting rest
"and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.
"Eyes, look your last.
"Arms, take your last embrace!
"And, lips, O you, the doors of breath,
"seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death!"
Eyes on the screen, people.
ROMEO:
Thus with a kiss I die.
The Volturi are a very old, very powerful family.
I guess they're the closest thing to royalty my world has.
-Is that Carlisle?
-Yeah.
He lived with them for a few decades.
Described them as very refined.
No respect for human life, of course, but a respect for the arts and the sciences, at least.
And the law.
Above all, the law.
BELLA:
Vampires have laws?
EDWARD:
Not very many.
And only one that's regularly enforced.
BELLA:
What is it?
EDWARD:
That we keep the existence of our kind a secret.
We don't make spectacles of ourselves, and we don't kill conspicuously.
Unless, of course, you want to die.
(SCREAMS)
You gotta stop talking about that.
I can't even think about someone hurting you.
Bella, the only thing that can hurt me is you.
And I don't have anything else to be afraid of.
That's not true.
Victoria?
She'll come for me one day.
Alice will see when she decides, and we'll be ready.
I could protect you if you change me.
Bella, you already do protect me.
You're my only reason to stay alive, if that's what I am.
But it's my job to protect you.
(BELLA SIGHS)
From everyone except my sister.

Edward.
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY)
BELLA:
I never wanted to have a party.
DR. CULLEN:
It's not your fault.
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.
How do you do it?
Years and years of practice.
Did you ever think of just doing it the easy way?
No.
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.
It brings me happiness, even if I am damned regardless.
Damned?
Like hell?
Carlisle, you couldn't be damned.
You couldn't.
It's impossible.
Thank you, Bella.
You've always been very gracious about us.
So that's it?
That's why he won't change me?
Imagine the situation in reverse.
Hmm.
If you believed as Edward does, could you take away his soul?
You can't protect me from everything.
At some point, something's gonna separate us.
It's gonna be an accident or illness or old age,
as long as I'm human.
And the only solution is to change me.
That's not a solution.
That's a tragedy.
You're not gonna want me when I look like a grandmother.
Bella, do you not understand my feelings for you at all?
Carlisle told me
how you feel about your soul.
I don't believe that.
So don't worry about mine.
You should go inside.
It's still my birthday.
So can I ask one thing?
Kiss me?
(BELLA GASPS)
(BOTH GASPING)
I love you.
I love you.

Hey.
Just come take a walk with me.
We have to leave Forks.
Why?
Carlisle's supposed to be 10 years older than he looks, and people are starting to notice.
Okay, I've gotta think of something to say to Charlie.
When you say "we"...
I mean my family and myself.
Edward, what happened with Jasper, it's nothing.
You're right.
It was nothing, nothing but what I always expected and nothing compared to what could have happened.
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.
I belong with you.
No.
You don't.
I'm coming.
Bella,
I don't want you to come.
(SIGHS)
You don't want me?
No.
That changes things a lot.
But if it's not too much to ask, can you just promise me something?
Don't do anything reckless.
For Charlie's sake.
And I'll promise something to you in return.
This is the last time you'll ever see me.
I won't come back, and you can go on with your life without any interference from me.
It will be like I never existed, I promise.
If this is about my soul, take it.
I don't want it without you.
It's not about your soul.
You're just not good for me.
Not good enough for you.
I'm just sorry I let this go on for so long.

Alice, you've disappeared, like everything else.
Now who else can I talk to?
I'm lost.
When you left, and he left,
you took everything with you.
But the absence of him is everywhere I look.
It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest.
(BELLA SCREAMING)
Bella.
(INAUDIBLE)
(BELLA SCREAMING)
BELLA:
But in a way I'm glad.
The pain is my only reminder that he was real, that you all were.
All right.
That's it.
What?
You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother.
I'm not leaving Forks.
Bells, he's not coming back.
I know.
It's just not normal, this behavior.
Quite frankly, it's scaring the hell out of me and your mother.
Baby, I don't want you to leave.
I don't, but just go.
Go to Jacksonville.
-Make some new friends.
-I like my old friends.
-Well, you never see them anymore.
-I do.
I'm... gonna go shopping tomorrow with Jessica.
-You hate shopping.
-I...
I need a girls' night out.
All right.
Girls' night.
Shopping.
I like it.
Go buy some stuff.
(I BELONG TO YOU PLAYING)
BELLA: (ON PHONE) Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.
Yeah, Bella Swan.
JESSICA:
I don't know why you want to sit through all those zombies eating people and no hot guys kissing anybody.
It's gross.
Like...
And why are there that many zombie movies anyway?
'Cause if it's supposed to, like, draw a parallel about leprosy, my cousin had leprosy.
It's not funny, you know?
And, like, is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism?
Because don't be so pleased with your own, like, self-referential cleverness, you know?
Like, some girls like to shop.
Not all girls, apparently.
Although I was surprised you even called at all.
You know?
Like, your depression thing, I get it.
I'm totally, totally worried.
But after a while it's like,
-you're still bumming...
-CHET:
You want a ride, girls?
and I'm going through stuff, too.
You know?
Like Mike deciding he just wants to be friends.

I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
No, that's cool.
I'll be whoever you want me to be, honey.
So, what do you say?
You promised me, nothing reckless.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
You promised it would be as if you never existed.
(CHET CLEARS THROAT)
-You lied.
-You say something, babe?
You know what?
Never mind.
(ENGINE ROARING)
Stop!
Stop, stop, stop!
(BRAKES SCREECHING)
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?
Just curious.
-I thought that I saw something.
-You...
Oh.
You're insane, actually.
Or suicidal.
That homeboy could've been a psycho.
I was about to end up in an FBI interview room like some lame TV show.
God, that was such a rush.
Awesome.
So you're an adrenaline junkie now?
That's cool.
You can go bungee jumping.
You don't get on the back of some random loser's motorcycle.
Crazy.
BELLA:
Alice, I saw him.
Maybe I'm crazy now.
I guess that's okay.
If a rush of danger is what it takes to see him, then that's what I'll find.
Bella!
Where the hell have you been, loca?
(BELLA LAUGHING)
(SIGHS) I brought you something.
-Okay.
-It's a little crazy.
Wow.
Scrap metal.
You shouldn't have.
I saved it from the junkyard.
(BELLA CLEARS THROAT)
I think they'll probably cost more to fix than they're worth, but then I thought that if I had a mechanic friend
-to help me out then...
-Ah!
-Me being the mechanic-type friend?
-That's right.
-Since when are you into motorcycles?
-Since now.
I get it if you think that this is really stupid and reckless.
Yeah, I mean, it's completely stupid and reckless.
When do we start?
Um.
Now.
-Please?
-(CHUCKLES) All right.
Oh, hey, be careful.
Those things are actually really heavy, so...
Jake, you're, like, buff.
How did that happen?
You're, like, 16.
I don't get it.
Mmm-hmm.
Age is just a number, baby.
What are you, like, 40 now?
It feels like that sometimes.
(ROMANTIC SONG PLAYING ON STEREO)
(TURNS OFF STEREO)
That song's good.
You don't like it?
I don't really like music anymore, kind of.
Okay.
No more music.
So I was thinking, if we're gonna do this every day, and hopefully we will, we have to, like, fit some homework in there somewhere.
I don't want Billy thinking that I'm a bad influence on you.
You?
Influence me?
Please.
Are you...
I'm older than you, so that makes me the influencer and you the influencee.
(LAUGHS) No, no, no.
My size and knowledge base actually makes me older than you because of your general paleness and lack of know-how.
I convinced you to build 2-wheeled death machines with me.
Don't you think that makes you kind of young and naive?
Okay.
So where do we stand?
-I'm 35.
And you might be, like, 32.
-Come on.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
-QUIL:
Yo, Jake, you in there?
-It's okay.
It's just my boys.
-Hey, Jake.
-Hey.
Guys, this is Bella.
-Bella, that's Quil and Embry.
-Hi.
I'm Quil Ateara.
So the bike building story is true.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I taught him everything he knows.
What about the part where you're his girlfriend?
Uh...
We're friends, you know.
-(LAUGHS) Burn.
-Actually, remember I said she's a girl and a friend.
Embry, do you remember him making that distinction?
Nope.
So you guys have girlfriends?
That's awesome.
(JACOB LAUGHING)
Yeah, right.
Quil's actually taking his cousin to prom.
Yeah, that's still a riot.
You want funny, Black?
I'll give you funny.
(JACOB AND QUIL LAUGHING)
Jeez.
JACOB:
Hey, that hold's illegal!
EMBRY:
I got 5 bucks on Quil.
You're on.
(SHOOTING THE MOON PLAYING)
All of the astronauts Champagne in plastic cups
Waiting for the big hero to show
Outside the door he stands His head in his hands
And his heart in his throat
What can he tell them now
BELLA:
Dear Alice,
I wish I had your real address.
I wish I could tell you about Jake.
He makes me feel better.
I mean, he makes me feel alive.
The hole in my chest, well, when I'm with Jake, it's like it's almost healed
for a while.
So, Quil keeps asking to come over.
I think he likes you a little too much.
Oh.
Well, I'm really not into the whole cougar thing.
You know?
(CHUCKLES)
What's up with you and age?
I mean, how old was that Cullen guy, anyway?
BELLA:
But even Jake can't keep the dreams away.
(BELLA WHIMPERING)
(SCREAMING)
Hey, hey, hey!
Wake up, Bella.
(SHUSHING) You're okay.
You're okay.
I thought this thing was starting to work, but I guess not.
(CHARLIE SIGHS)
Can I ask you something?
Hanging out with Jacob, that seems to take your mind off things a bit, doesn't it?
You know, sometimes you gotta learn to love what's good for you.
You know what I mean?
Of course, what do I know?
I'm just a terminal bachelor.
Famous ladies' man.
Okay.
I'm gonna go to bed.
Uh...
I love you.
If I told you
I couldn't have fixed these bikes, what would you have said?
Are you doubting your mad skills?
No.
Definitely not.
I mean, they'll run fine.
It's just, maybe if I was smart, I would have dragged out the rebuild a bit.
If you told me you couldn't fix these bikes, I would say that that's really too bad, but... that we're just gonna have to find something else to do.
(LAUGHS)
Is that Sam Uley?
Yeah.
Him and his cult.
(SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
(WHOOPS)
Oh, my God.
Did you see that?
(JACOB LAUGHING)
They're not really fighting, Bella.
They're cliff diving.
Scary as hell, but a total rush.
-A rush?
-Most of us jump from lower down.
We leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples.
You have some kind of beef with him or something?
I don't know.
They just think they run this place.
Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids.
-Now look at him.
-That's Embry?
(CONTINUE WHOOPING)
-Yeah.
-What happened to him?
He missed some school.
Now all of a sudden, he started following Sam around like a little puppy.
Same thing happened with Paul and Jared.
Sam keeps giving me this look, like he's waiting for me or something.
It's kind of starting to freak me out.
Well, you should just avoid him.
I try.
Okay.
-You look scared.
-I'm not.
All right.
-Brake?
-That one.
Clutch?
Good.
Gas?
(ENGINE ROARS)
Ready?
Now, slowly release the clutch.
EDWARD:
Bella.
Stop.
(BELLA GASPS)
Whoa!
You all right?
I'm gonna go again.
Okay.
(GASPS)
Ah!
Whoa!
Hit the brake!
(GRUNTS)
I wanna go again.
Are you trying to get yourself killed?
-No.
I want to go again.
-No.
Forget it.
No more bikes.
Man, your head.
Ow.
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
What, you're apologizing for bleeding?
Yeah.
I guess I am.
Well, it's just blood, Bella.
No big deal.
There.
What are you staring at?
You're sort of beautiful.
How hard did you hit your head?
I don't know.
(JACOB CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Let's go.
ANGELA:
I did see something in the woods.
Totally.
Baby, I believe you.
No, he doesn't.
He's just trying to get lucky.
(ERIC LAUGHS)
ANGELA:
No, okay.
It was jet black and huge.
On all 4s, it was still taller than a person.
A bear, maybe?
Or an alien.
You're lucky you didn't get probed.
(ERIC AND MIKE SNICKERING)
ANGELA:
Well, I saw it.
You know, you're not the only one.
My dad's been getting reports at the station.
Like, 5 hikers have been killed by some bear.
But they can't find the bear.
Hmm.
(LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.
MIKE:
Um... (MIKE CLEARS THROAT)
So?
I mean,
Bella's back?
(LAUGHS)
Yeah, I guess so.
All right, that's...
Well, welcome.
So, listen, now that you're talking and eating again, which, you know, you've got to get that protein in there,
I was just wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me.
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah, I do.
Cool.
Let me see, we could check out
Love Spelled Backwards Is Love.
You know, it's a dumb title, but it's a romantic comedy.
-I mean, it's supposed to be pretty...
-No.
No romance.
How about Face Punch?
Have you heard of that?
I mean, that's an action movie.
Yeah, that's perfect.
Guns, adrenaline.
That's my thing.
Okay.
We should get a bunch of people to go.
Do you guys want to go see Face Punch?
ERIC:
Face Punch, yeah!
Mike, hey, we were supposed to watch that.
Remember, the trailer's like...
-"Punch faces."
-I remember.
(SARCASTICALLY) Yeah!
Movie night with Bella.
JACOB:
So Face Punch, huh?
You like action movies?
Not really.
(JACOB SCOFFING)
I heard it sucks.
Bad.
Are you even old enough to see this movie?
I mean, you know, without, like, adult supervision.
Right, yeah, well, she's buying my ticket for me.
She's buying it.
Okay.
Jessica bailed, and Angela got the stomach flu, so Eric's taking care of her.
-It's just us 3.
-Great!
-Great.
-Yeah.
(GUN COCKING ON SCREEN)
MAN 1 ON SCREEN:
Put your gun down.
MAN 2 ON SCREEN:
Put your gun down or I'm gonna blow your frickin' head off.
MAN 3 ON SCREEN:
Both of you put both of your guns down or I'm gonna blow both of your frickin' heads off.
MAN 1 ON SCREEN:
All right, forget it, let's do this!
(GUNS FIRING)
(MAN SCREAMS)
(GUNS FIRING)
(WOMAN SCREAMS)
Okay, I think I'm gonna throw up.
(SCREAMING CONTINUES)
He's... (SCOFFS) What a marshmallow!
You should hold out for someone with a stronger stomach.
Someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit.
Yeah.
I'll keep my eye open for that.
(JACOB CHUCKLES)
I feel bad.
He probably has that flu that's going around.
What?
I can't hold your hand?
No, of course you can.
I just think it means, you know, something a little different to you.
So...
Okay, well, tell me something.
You like me, right?
And you think I'm sort of beautiful?
(SOFTLY) Jacob, please, don't do this.
(BELLA SIGHS)
Why?
Because you're about to ruin everything.
And I need you.
(SIGHS)
Well, I've got loads of time.
I'm not gonna give up.
I don't want you to, but it's just 'cause I don't want you to go anywhere.
And that's really selfish.
You know, I'm not like a car that you can fix up.
I'm never gonna run right.
So I should be fair to you.
It's because of him, right?
(JACOB SIGHS DEEPLY)
Look,
I know what he did to you.
But, Bella, I would never ever do that.
I won't ever hurt you.
I promise.
I won't let you down.
You can count on me.
MIKE:
Well,
(SNIFFLES)
(SIGHS)
I need to go home.
I was feeling sick before the movie.
Okay?
(JACOB SCOFFS)
What is your problem?
Right now?
You're my problem.
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.
You want me to put you in the hospital?
Jake!
Jake.
Jake, the movie's over.
What are you doing?
You're really hot.
Like, you feel like you have a fever.
Are you okay?
I don't know what's happening.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I gotta go.
That dude is weird.
BELLA: (ON PHONE) Jake, your dad says you have mono.
He won't let me visit, but would you call me?
Hey, it's me again.
I just...
I'm sorry about what I said at the movie theater.
I just wanted to hear your voice, so no pressure.
Jacob, please...
Call me.
Okay.
We should be back around 3:00.
(SIGHS)
Hey.
Look, I don't have to go fishing today.
Yes, you do.
Yeah, you do.
Go.
What are you talking about?
Just be careful.
Always am.
Those bears won't get the drop on me, Bella.
My kung fu is strong.
Jake!
Hey!
You cut your hair off?
And got a tattoo?
Bella.
I thought you were too sick to come outside or pick up the phone when I call.
Go away.
What?
Go away.
What happened to you?
What's...
Hey!
What happened?
Did Sam get to you?
Is that what's happening?
Sam's trying to help me.
Don't blame him.
But if you want somebody to blame, how about those filthy bloodsuckers you love, the Cullens?
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
You've been lying to everyone.
Charlie.
But you can't lie to me.
-Not anymore, Bella.
-SAM:
Jacob!
Jacob!
Look, Bella, we can't be friends anymore.
(CRYING) Look, Jake, I know that I've been hurting you.
It's killing me.
It kills me.
I just need...
Maybe give me, like,
-some time or something.
-Look, don't.
It's not you.
It's not you, it's me, right?
Really?
It's true.
It is me.
I'm not good.
I used to be a good kid.
Not anymore.
This doesn't even matter.
All right?
This is over.
You can't break up with me.
I mean...
I mean, you're my best friend.
You promised me.
I know.
I promised I wouldn't hurt you, Bella.
And this is me keeping that promise.
Go home and don't come back or you're gonna get hurt.
BELLA:
Alice, things are...
Things are bad again.
Without Jake, I just...
I can't stand it.
I don't see Edward anymore.
Will it really feel like he never existed?
I will find the place where I can see him again.
(SOBBING)
Bella.
Laurent.
I didn't expect to find you here.
I went to visit the Cullens, but the house is empty.
I'm surprised they left you behind.
Weren't you sort of a pet of theirs?
Yeah.
You could say that.
Do the Cullens visit often?
Lie.
(GASPS)
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.
Lie better.
I'll tell them that you stopped by.
But I probably shouldn't tell Edward,
'cause he's pretty protective.
But he's far away, isn't he?
Why are you here?
I came as a favor to Victoria.
-Victoria?
-She asked me to see if you were still under the protection of the Cullens.
Victoria feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate, given he killed hers.
An eye for an eye.
Threaten him.
Edward would know who did it.
And he'd come after you.
I don't think he will.
After all, how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected?
(LAURENT SIGHS)
Victoria won't be happy about my killing you, but I can't help myself.
You are so mouth-watering.
-Please, don't.
I mean, you helped us.
-No, no, no, no.
(SHUSHING)
Don't be afraid.
I'm doing you a kindness.
(SOFTLY) Victoria plans on killing you slowly, painfully, whereas I'll make it quick.
I promise.
You will feel nothing.
Edward, I love you.
(TWIGS SNAPPING)
I don't believe it.
(LOW GROWLING)
(ROARS)
(GASPS)
(WEREWOLVES RUNNING)
(YELPING)
(GASPS)
-Dad!
I saw them.
-What's the matter?
-In the woods.
They're not bears.
-What do you mean "in the woods"?
Bell, what the hell were you doing out in the woods?
They're wolves.
I mean, they're like huge wolves.
Are you sure about that, Bella?
Yeah!
I just saw them.
They were after something.
(HARRY CLEARS THROAT)
Wolves?
You saw them?
All right, well, Harry, feel like going hunting?
Get some of your guys together?
Sure, yeah, I'll just...
BELLA:
By now, those wolves will be dead, and Laurent would have told her I'm unprotected.
Victoria.
I should go to the station.
Yeah, you should.
You should go.
CHARLIE:
Can you just stay in the house?
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
(CLATTERING)
(CLATTERING CONTINUES)
JACOB: (WHISPERS) Bella!
You scared me.
-What the hell are you doing?
-Back up.
I'm coming up.
(GASPS)
Hey.
Look, I'm sorry.
-For what?
-I wish I could explain.
But I literally can't.
(SIGHS)
Have you ever had a secret you couldn't tell anyone, one that wasn't yours to share?
Well, that's what it's like for me.
But worse.
You have no idea how tight I'm bound.
I hate this.
I hate what they've done to you.
I mean, the killer part is, you already know.
Bella, do you remember when we walked on the beach at La Push?
The...
The story.
The story about the cold ones.
I guess I understand why that's the only part you remember.
There's gotta be something that you can do.
No.
I'm in it for life.
Well, maybe we should just get out of here for a while.
Just leave, just you and me.
You'd do that?
I would do it for you.
It's not something I can just run away from, Bella.
But I would run away with you
if I could.
I gotta go.
They'll start wondering where I am.
Come here.
(SOFTLY) Please, try to remember.
It'd be so much easier if you knew.
I'll try.
But, Jake...
Jake, what are you doing?
Wait, Jake.
(GASPS)
Jake.
(GASPS)
Edward, I'm scared.
You should be.
JACOB:
Really, it's just like an old story.
I'm not really supposed to say anything about it.
Did you know Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?
(WEREWOLF SNARLS)
Bella?
I need to see him.
He's not in.
-Okay, I'm sorry, I really need to see him.
-Bella!
What did you do?
-Okay, what did you do?
-Hey.
-What did you do to him?
-Easy!
He didn't want this.
What did we do?
What did he do?
What'd he tell you?
-Both of you calm down.
-Nothing.
He tells me nothing because he's scared of you.
(SNICKERING)
-Too late now.
-SAM:
Bella, get back!
(PAUL GROWLING SOFTLY)
SAM:
Paul, calm down, now!
Bella!
Run!
Jake, run!
(GROWLING)
(WHIMPERS)
(BOTH SNARLING)
SAM:
Paul!
Hey!
Take Bella back to Emily's place.
EMBRY:
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.
BELLA:
Alice, is it possible that everything is true?
The fairy tales and horror stories?
Is it possible that there isn't anything sane or normal at all?
(BOTH WHOOP)
Hey, I think we should go back and see if Jacob's okay.
I hope Paul sinks some teeth in him.
Serves him right.
No way.
Jacob's a natural.
You see him phase on the fly?
I got 5 says Paul doesn't touch him.
Come on in, Bella.
We won't bite.
Speak for yourself.
(DONE ALL WRONG PLAYING)
I done me wrong
And done all wrong
All the wrong I've done I'm sure I'll live quite long
Oh, hey, about Emily, Sam's fiancée?
Don't stare.
It bugs Sam.
Why would I stare?
Are you guys hungry?
Like I have to ask.
(EMILY LAUGHING)
Who's this?
JARED:
Bella Swan.
Who else?
Hmm.
So, you're the vampire girl.
So, you're the wolf girl.
Guess so.
Well, I'm engaged to one.
Save some for your brothers.
And ladies first.
Muffin?
Sure.
Thanks.
Leave it to Jacob to find a way around Sam's gag order.
He didn't say anything to me.
That's a wolf thing.
Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want them to or not.
And check it out.
We can hear each other's thoughts.
Would you shut up?
These are trade secrets.
Damn it!
This chick runs with vampires.
You can't really run with vampires.
(EMILY GIGGLES)
'Cause they're fast.
Yeah?
Well, we're faster.
Freaked out yet?
You're not the first monsters I've met.
SAM:
Jake's right.
You're good with weird.
Hey.
(EMILY GIGGLING)
Sorry.
So you're a werewolf?
Yeah.
Last time I checked.
A few lucky members of the tribe have the gene.
A bloodsucker moves into town and the fever sets in.
Mono.
Yeah.
I wish.
Well, can't you find a way to just stop?
I mean, it's wrong.
It's not a lifestyle choice, Bella.
I was born this way.
I can't help it.
You're such a hypocrite.
What, I'm not the right kind of monster for you?
It's not what you are.
It's what you do.
They never hurt anybody.
You've killed people, Jake.
Bella, we're not killing anyone.
Then who is?
What we're trying to protect you people from, the only thing we do kill,
vampires.
Wait, Jake, you can't.
Don't worry.
We can't touch your little precious Cullens unless they violate the treaty.
That's not what I'm saying.
You can't kill vampires.
They'll...
They'll kill you.
Really?
We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough.
(WEREWOLVES GROWLING)
Laurent?
And his red-headed girlfriend is next.
Victoria's here?
Was.
We chased her all the way to the Canadian border the other night.
She keeps coming back.
We don't know what she's after.
I do.
Me.
Don't worry.
We've got this place covered.
She won't get near you or Charlie.
Look, you've got to be careful.
She's fast.
You don't know how fast she is.
You know, your lack of confidence in us is a little insulting.
All right, I'd better go.
You gotta go?
Yeah.
Got a vampire to kill.
BELLA:
Alice, I'm all right.
Until I'm alone.
And lately, that's all the time.
Jacob's gone.
He's hunting Victoria.
And Charlie's hunting Jacob.
And you're gone.
And so is Edward.
And there's just nothing now.
You got something, Harry?
Nope.
Nothing.
But I realize where I have to go, what I have to do to see him again.
(HEARING DAMAGE PLAYING)
A tear in my brain
Allows the voices in
They wanna push you off the path
With their frequency wires
And you can do no wrong
In my eyes
In my eyes
You can do no wrong
In my eyes
In my eyes
A drunken salesman
Your hearing damage
Your mind is restless
They say you're getting better
But you don't feel any better
Your speakers are blowing
Your ears are wrecking
Your hearing damage
You wish you felt better
You wish you felt better
You can do no wrong
In my eyes
In my eyes
In my eyes
(GROWLING)
EDWARD:
Don't do this.
You wanted me to be human.
Watch me.
EDWARD:
Please.
For me.
You won't stay with me any other way.
Bella, please.
(GASPING)
(SLOW LIFE PLAYING)
This constant noise all the time
Even though you're the only one I see
JACOB:
Breathe!
Breathe!
Come on, Bella, breathe!
(BELLA SPLUTTERING)
Bella?
Bella, can you hear me?
Jake?
Come here.
What the hell were you thinking?
I just wanted to see something.
Get her home!
I'm gonna go help out over at Harry's place.
What happened at Harry's?
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.
Charlie and my dad are over at his place with his family.
Is he okay?
He's gone.
Come on.
I'll get you something dry and drive you home.
(BELLA SHIVERING) 108 degrees over here.
God!
My hands are freezing.
It must be nice, never getting cold.
It's a wolf thing.
It's not.
It's a Jacob thing.
You're just warm.
You're like your own sun.
This is better, now that you know about me.
But...
You saw what happened to Emily.
Sam got angry.
Lost it for a split second.
Em was standing too close.
He'll never be able to take that back.
What if I got mad at you?
(JACOB SIGHS)
Sometimes,
I feel like I'm gonna disappear.
Okay, not that you need me to tell you something like this,
but I always will.
You're not gonna lose yourself.
I wouldn't let that happen.
How?
I'll tell you all the time
how special you are.
(BELLA INHALES SHARPLY)
Thank you.
For everything.
Wait.
There's a vampire.
How do you know?
I can smell it.
I'm getting you out of here.
That's Carlisle's car.
They're here.
Bella, it's a trick!
Stop!
You gotta come with me!
(BELLA GRUNTS)
They won't hurt me.
If a Cullen is back here, this is their territory.
Treaty says we can only defend on our own lands.
-I can't protect you here.
-Okay.
That's okay.
You don't have to.
You're about to cross a line.
Then don't draw one.
Please?
(BELLA GASPS)
Alice?
-Oh, my God!
What are you...
-Bella!
I'm sorry, I just, I can't believe you're here.
Is...
Would you like to explain to me how you're alive?
What?
I saw a vision of you.
You jumped off a cliff.
Why in the hell would you try and kill yourself?
I mean, what about Charlie?
-What about...
-I didn't try to kill myself.
I was cliff jumping.
Recreationally.
It was fun.
(EXHALES)
I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy.
Does...
Did you tell him?
No.
He only calls in once every few months.
He said he wants to be alone.
Bella, what is that God-awful wet dog smell?
Um...
That's probably me.
Or it's Jacob.
Jacob who?
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.
Bella!
Werewolves are not good company to keep.
Speak for yourself.
I had to see you were safe.
I thought you couldn't protect me here.
Guess I don't care.
Well, I'm not gonna hurt her.
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.
I'm talking about the other bloodsucker who tried to kill Bella because of you.
Victoria?
Yeah, Victoria's been around.
I didn't see her.
I didn't see you get pulled out of the water, either.
I can't see past you and your pack of mutts.
Don't get me upset...
-Hey, stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
-...or things are gonna get very ugly.
I'll give you a minute.
Hey.
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna come back,
-right?
-As soon as you put the dog out.
Is he...
Are there others?
How many Cullens are here and how long are they staying?
No.
It's just Alice.
And she can stay as long as she'd like.
Well, are the rest coming back?
No.
Not that I know of.
(BELLA SCOFFS)
Anything else?
That's it.
Well, if that's all, then you'd better go run back to Sam.
I've done it again.
I keep breaking my promise.
We don't have to do this to each other.
Yes, we do.
(SOFTLY) Bella...

He's not here right now.
He's arranging a funeral.
(CELL PHONE CRACKING)
Who was that?
What?
Always in the way.
Who was that?
Bella, step back.
-Jake, who was that?
-Bella!
Bella, it's Edward.
He thinks you're dead.
Rosalie told him why I came here.
Why would you...
Why didn't you let me speak to him?
-He didn't ask for you.
-Bella.
-I don't care!
-Bella.
Bella!
He's going to the Volturi.
He wants to die, too.
JACOB:
He left you, Bella.
He didn't want you anymore.
Remember?
No, I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt.
What about your dad?
I'm 18.
I'm legally free to go, and I left a note.
Please, Bella, just stay here.
For Charlie.
Or for me.
I have to go.
I'm begging you.
Please.
Goodbye, Jacob.
Okay.
(AIRPLANE WHOOSHING)
(CAR ACCELERATING)
So you've made up your minds.
I'm afraid your particular gifts are too valuable to destroy.
But if you're unhappy with your lot, join us.
We would be delighted to utilize your skills.
Won't you consider staying with us?
You know it will happen anyway.
Not without cause.
Such a waste.
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?
I figured you wouldn't be opposed to grand theft auto.
Not today.
What?
What do you see?
They refused him.
-So?
-He's gonna make a scene.
-Show himself to the humans.
-No!
When?
ALICE:
He's gonna wait until noon, when the sun's at its highest.
(GRUNTS)
God, Alice, you got to hurry up.
There's Volterra.
(HORN HONKING)
(TIRES SQUEALING)
(HONKING CONTINUES)
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
-Why are they all in red?
-San Marco's Day festival.
They're commemorating the expulsion of vampires from the city.
It's the perfect setting.
The Volturi will never let him get far enough to reveal himself.
(PANTING) We have 5 minutes.
I know, Bella, just breathe.
(HORN HONKING)
Alice!
Bella, you're the only one he can't see coming.
If I go, he'll read my thoughts.
He'll think I'm lying.
He'll rush into it.
-Where do I go?
-He'll be under the clock tower.
Go!
(CROWD CHANTING)
(BELL TOLLS)
Don't!
(BELLA PANTING)
Heaven.
You have to move.
Open your eyes.
Look at me.
I'm alive.
You have to move.
Bella.
-You're here.
-I'm here.
You're alive.
Yes.
I needed to make you see me once.
You had to know that I was alive, that you didn't have to feel guilty about anything.
I can let you go now.
I never acted out of guilt.
I just couldn't live in a world where you don't exist.
-But you said...
-I lied.
I had to lie.
But you believed me so easily.
Because it doesn't make sense for you to love me.
I mean, I'm nothing.
I'm human.
I'm nothing.
Bella, you're everything to me.
You're everything.
(GATE OPENS)
I won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen.
Aro wants to speak with you again.
No rules were broken.
Nonetheless, we should take this conversation to a more appropriate venue.
Fine.
Bella, why don't you go and enjoy the rest of the festival?
The girl comes with us.
No.
You can go to hell.
(LOCK BREAKS)
Come on, guys.
It's a festival.
You wouldn't want to make a scene.
We wouldn't.
Enough.
Jane.
Aro sent me to see what was taking so long.
Just do as she says.
Go ahead.
Don't be scared.
Are you?
No.
(JANE SCOFFS)
(OPERA PLAYING)
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
-Is she human?
-Yes.
Does she know?
Yes.
Then, why would...
She wants to be.
And so she will be.
Or dessert.
ALEC:
Sister.
They send you out to get 1 and you bring back 2.
And a half.
Such a clever girl.
What a happy surprise!
Bella is alive after all.
Isn't that wonderful?
I love a happy ending.
ARO:
Ah.
(GASPS)
They are so rare.
(GASPS)
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
Her blood appeals to you so much it makes me thirsty.
How can you stand to be so close to her?
-It's not without difficulty.
-Yes, I can see that.
(ARO CHUCKLING)
Aro can read every thought I've ever had with one touch.
And now you know everything.
So get on with it.
You are quite a soul reader yourself, Edward.
Though you can't read Bella's thoughts.
Fascinating.
I would love to see if you are an exception to my gifts, as well.
Would you do me the honor?
Interesting.
Hmm.
I see nothing.
I wonder if...
Let us see if she's immune to all our powers.
Shall we, Jane?
-No!
-Pain.
(GROANS)
BELLA:
Stop!
Stop!
Please!
Stop!
(GRUNTS) Stop!
Just stop hurting him!
Please!
Please!
Jane?
Master?
(GASPS)
Go ahead, my dear.
This may hurt just a little.
(LAUGHING EXCITEDLY)
Remarkable!
She confounds us all.
So what do we do with you now?
You already know what you're going to do, Aro.
She knows too much.
She's a liability.
Hmm.
That's true.
Felix?
EDWARD:
No!
(GASPS)
Please!
No!
No!
Please, please!
Kill me!
Kill me!
Not him.
How extraordinary.
You would give up your life for someone like us.
A vampire.
A soulless monster.
Just get away from her!
You don't know a thing about his soul.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
This is a sadness.
If only it were your intention to give her immortality.
Wait!
Bella will be one of us.
I've seen it.
I'll change her myself.
Mesmerizing.
To see what you have seen before it has happened.
Your gifts will make for an intriguing immortal,
Isabella.
Go now.
Make your preparations.
Let us be done with this.
Heidi will arrive any moment.
Thank you for your visit.
CAIUS:
We will return the favor.
I would advise that you follow through on your promise soon.
We do not offer second chances.
ARO:
Goodbye, my young friends.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
DEMETRI:
Nice fishing, Heidi.
Yes, they do look rather juicy.
Save some for me.
HEIDI:
This way, please.
Stay together.
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
(GASPING)
(SCREAMS ECHOING)
Stop!
Stop!
You're here.
You can sleep.
I'll still be here when you wake up.
Bella, the only reason I left was because I thought I was protecting you.
I needed you to have a chance at a normal, happy life.
It was so easy for you to leave.
Leaving you was the hardest thing I've done in 100 years.
(SIGHING)
And I swear,
I will never fail you again.
I'm so sorry.
-Charlie's coming.
-Hey.
You okay?
I'm fine.
Dad, you don't have to worry.
You know, last time you said that, you took off.
I didn't see you for 3 days.
I'm really sorry, Dad.
Bella, do not ever do that to me again.
Ever.
And you're grounded for the rest of your life.
Okay.
I'm not technically breaking any of his rules.
He did say I couldn't take a step inside the door.
I came in through the window.
He's not gonna forgive me easily.
I know.
Can you?
I hope you can, 'cause I honestly don't know how to live without you.
Come here.
Once Alice changes me, you can't get rid of me.
She won't need to change you.
There are always ways to keep the Volturi in the dark.
No.
No.
You all know what I want.
And I know how much I'm asking for.
The only thing that I can think of for it to be fair is to just vote.
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-Shut up.
Alice?
I already consider you my sister.
-Yes.
-Thank you.
JASPER:
I vote "yes."
It would be nice to not want to kill you all the time.
Hmm.
ROSALIE:
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry to both of you for how I've acted, and I'm really grateful that you were brave enough to go and save my brother.
But this isn't a life I would have chosen for myself.
And I wish that there'd been someone to vote "no" for me.
So, no.
I vote "Hell, yeah."
And we can pick a fight with these Volturi some other way.
I already consider you a part of the family.
Yes.
(DR. CULLEN SIGHS)
Why are you doing this to me?
You know what this means.
You've chosen not to live without her, which leaves me no choice.
I won't lose my son.
BELLA:
I'll wait until after graduation to make it easier on Charlie.
Edward, I want you to be the one to do it.
(TIRES SCREECH)
He wants to talk to me.
JACOB:
So you're still alive for now.
EDWARD:
He thinks it's me keeping you away.
JACOB:
You stay the hell out of my head.
Jacob, I know you have something to say to me.
But I want to say something to you first, if that's all right.
Thank you.
Thank you for keeping Bella alive when I didn't.
No.
You didn't.
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.
I'm still grateful.
But I'm here now.
I'm not gonna leave her side until she orders me away.
We'll see.
Hey, my turn to talk.
I'm here to remind you about a key point in the treaty.
I haven't forgotten.
What key point?
If any of them bites a human, the truce is over.
But if I choose it, it has nothing to do with you.
No.
No, I won't let you.
You're not gonna be one of them, Bella.
It's not up to you.
You know what we'll do to you.
I won't have a choice.
Bella, please, come.
Wait.
Is he gonna hurt me?
Read his mind.
Jake,
I love you.
(JACOB BREATHES DEEPLY)
So, please,
don't make me choose,
'cause it'll be him.
It's always been him.
Bella...
-Goodbye, Jacob.
-No, you don't speak for her!
(GROWLING)
(ROARS)
Bella, get out of here.
BELLA:
Stop!
Stop!
You can't hurt each other without hurting me.
Jake.
He's right.
You shouldn't become what I am.
I can't do this alone.
Then, please, just wait.
Just give me 5 years.
That's too long.
(SIGHS)
Then 3?
You're so stubborn.
What are you waiting for?
I have one condition if you want me to do it myself.
What's the condition?
And then forever.
That's what I'm asking.

Welcome.
This is Chris Weitz, director of New Moon.
I have with me, by magic, from London, Peter Lambert, my accomplice in crime, the editor of New Moon.
PETER LAMBERT.:
Hello.
WEITZ.:
That was the Summit logo, delightful.
Now, part of the reason that...
Okay, here's a moon.
(LAMBERT LAUGHING)
Now, the reason that we started this way was because I felt that in the theaters, there would be nothing but screaming for about the first 30 seconds of the movie.
And so, interesting point, actually, this is the proper way that a moon phases, from right to left, in the northern hemisphere, and I know this because I was at a science and film conference
in which someone complained that they'd gotten it wrong in every film ever.
Ironically, though, it reads like a palindrome, Noom Wen, not New Moon.
LAMBERT.:
This actually took the DP an entire month to film.
He had to stand very still with the camera pointing at the sky all that time.
(WEITZ LAUGHING)
It's not actually true.
WEITZ.:
Okay, so then in pops the sun.
Here comes Bella, and this is like in the book where she is seeing the clock at 12.:00.
It's her worst nightmare.
Yes, and then we use that red flag as what we call a wipe to transition us into the meadow.
Now here we are in the meadow, and those things on the right are called god rays by the CGI people.
-LAMBERT.:
They're beautiful.
-They're beautiful, but they're not real.
More god rays.
We see Gran in the distance out of focus.
LAMBERT.:
I remember we talked about how there was Team Jacob and Team Edward.
I always wanted to mount a campaign for Team Gran, based on this scene, for the more mature gentlemen Twilight fans.
They could go to conventions and support Team Gran.
WEITZ.:
It was a demographic we were trying to hit desperately.
I'm not sure that we've managed to do that.
LAMBERT.: (LAUGHING) Hit them hard at the start of the movie.
WEITZ.:
Okay, first diamond shot of the movie.
Pretty good, I think, as far as our diamond shots go.
Some are better, I think, when we get to Italy, but, obviously, this was a very big deal to kind of re-imagine the diamond shots and get the effect both of subsurface scattering, which is the light under the skin,
and also to have these rays of light coming out.
LAMBERT.:
You guys looked at lots of references, didn't you?
I remember there were loads of diamonds and things like that.
WEITZ.:
We did, and it turns out diamonds don't actually scatter light outwards, but people think they do.
So that's what we did.
And in fact, when we first shot this,
Rob had these kind of black dots all over his face to mark positions, and he looked like a plague victim.
(LAMBERT LAUGHING)
If you can imagine Rob ever, ever looking not incredibly super handsome, that might be the time.
LAMBERT.:
The shot coming out of the mirror, that was like a...
We made a mistake with that visual effect originally.
We forgot that Edward's not meant to sparkle in it to start with,
I seem to remember.
And then we got a note from Stephenie saying he shouldn't be sparkling in the reflection.
WEITZ.:
Wow, this film is going quickly.
Okay, notice in the book here on the left that you see Montepulciano, or rather Volterra, in the illustration of the Romeo and Juliet book.
LAMBERT.:
That took me about two months before I noticed that.
(WEITZ LAUGHING)
WEITZ.:
Bella doesn't seem very grateful about her presents.
I don't know why.
I think Kristen was in a bad mood that day.
By the way, the reason that the kids aren't here today is because at the after party for the premiere, they ordered some burgers, right.
They took quite a while to come, and they left them sitting there, and I think I ate Kristen's hamburger, and when she came back, it was all gone.
So there's a bit of an actor revolt against me, which is why I had to call in Peter.
The old gray hair joke.
He slays them.
(LAMBERT LAUGHING)
Happy birthday.
-WEITZ.:
Lovely Billy Burke.
-He's great.
WEITZ.:
Very funny and not as old as his mustache would imply.
Actually quite a sexy young guy, if I do say so.
LAMBERT.:
It's amazing how a 'tache can age a man.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, it is.
It is.
I think when I want to look more sophisticated, I'm gonna wear one.
LAMBERT.:
This top shot of the truck is the sort of...
It was not the top shot of the truck anymore,
I just realized from the dialogue I'm hearing.
But it's the one little bit that reminds me of Twilight.
It's like the start of Twilight, that shot.
-Oh, yeah.
-Wherefore art thou, Bella?
(ALL LAUGH)
Let me take a picture of you guys.
My mom wants me to put together, like, a scrapbook full of memories.
eric:
Oh.
mike:
Cool.
Yeah.
I take them. I'm not in them.
-No, no, no, come here.
-BELLA:
Well, you are today.
You'll photoshop this if my nose looks big, right?
eric:
Don't worry, I'm in the picture.
No one will...
WEITZ.:
Volvo, one of our sponsors, offered us a new car for Edward, and I thought, well, if I leave the car the same color as before, you know, people are gonna think that I'm treating them like idiots,
like they can't tell the difference between one model of car and another.
So I thought, well, we'll make it black.
We won't make it too glossy black.
It'll be kind of coal black, and that'll show depression and sorrow.
And, yes, and here comes dream boat.
Bella, your birth is definitely something to celebrate.
Yeah, but my aging's not.
WEITZ.:
And for the longest time, Peter thought he said,
"Your breath is something to celebrate, " not "your birth. "
LAMBERT.:
I thought it was just creepy.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, well, she does have very good breath, I'm sure, Bella, but it was her birth.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah, I kind of like that sort of slow motion shot of him walking towards Kristen.
When we saw it with an audience at the premiere for the first time, everyone cheered when Rob came on, and then almost like a perfect response to them cheering, he does that little sort of self-effacing smile
and looks down like he's actually responding to the audience.
It was good timing.
WEITZ.:
I have to say, I have to take credit for it.
I always knew that was gonna happen, and I knew that his smile would almost seem to be in response
-to an audience actually reacting to him.
-LAMBERT.:
You're pretty clever.
WEITZ.:
Okay, now this is another example of my genius.
In that two-shot, when Jacob comes into the two-shot, he completely blocks out Edward, showing the possibility that he may be a threat to him.
LAMBERT.:
Is that what they call foreshadowing
-in the directing business?
-WEITZ.:
Yes, it is, actually.
Yeah, in the directing biz, we call it "being really obvious. "
(BO TH LAUGHING)
No, we were shooting this over the course of an entire day and...
LAMBERT.:
This was a monster to shoot.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, in Vancouver.
And the light conditions were changing, so what you do is in the DI, which is the digital intermediate where you can manipulate colors and light variations, we made it as even as possible, so that it didn't seem like a sunny day
and that Edward should be glowing and all.
And...
Oh, poor Edward.
Edward, yeah, in some way, senses that Jacob might be a better match for Bella, and so, to me, he's a bit sad here.
And here, me being obvious again, when Jacob talks about bad dreams and lifts the dream catcher, it's practically obscuring Edward.
And I've often thought how this is very much like the Brady Bunch episode where the tiki is introduced.
You could actually say that this movie is about what happens when Jacob gives Bella an evil dream catcher and everything starts to go wrong in her life.
LAMBERT.:
We should have changed the music for that to a kind of... (LAMBERT MIMICKING DRAMATIC MUSIC) ...when he brought it out.
(WEITZ LAUGHING)
WEITZ.:
Hello, Alice.
Here she comes.
People cheer.
-LAMBERT.:
She's just been in the art class.
-Yes, lovely smock, Alice.
And there's old Jackson hanging back there.
Now, there is some controversy over whether Jasper's mood control powers could actually work on Bella, given that she's so resistant to vampire powers, but it turns out that Jasper's powers work on her adrenal glands, not on her brain.
Therefore, it can calm her down, which is why she found herself willing to agree to go to this gathering at the Cullens', so that's why, really.
You can't trust vampires.
Trust me.
WEITZ.:
And this was an ad-lib by Rob, which he subsequently hated, but I think it's quite nice.
...hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Thou art not conquered.
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks.
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
BELLA:
I hate being celebrated.
EDWARD:
There are worse tragedies.
I mean, look at Romeo.
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.
BELLA:
Yeah.
Though I do envy him one thing.
BELLA:
Juliet is, like, perfect.
If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.
(EDWARD LAUGHS)
Not the girl, the suicide.
WEITZ.:
Now, here's this kind of rather odd discussion about suicide where
Edward is surprisingly upbeat about the notion.
And I thought it was an interesting way for them to play it.
I mean, for him, the idea of dying has its own sort of appeal, except that he'd have to say goodbye to Bella.
But as an immortal who has doubts about his own soul, the idea of ending his existence is less upsetting than it is to Bella who, of course, can't stand the notion.
Flashback to Twilight, and we're back.
What was the plan?
WEITZ.:
Moment of silence as I think of what to say.
Anyway, I quite enjoy Rob's performance here, and I can't let a sentimental moment go by without interrupting it with a bit of comedy.
So, Mr. Berty messes with Edward, and the entire class turns, and then suddenly we realize that vampires have perfect recall.
So, for him, he's been through high school a bunch of times.
Probably everyone who's listening to this, by the way, is like,
"Shut up and just let me listen to Rob, "
but you can just turn this off and watch the regular DVD.
LAMBERT.:
This is a classic Edward Cullen moment, I think, and I remember we actually experimented, we flirted with cutting it out in order to get through to the next section of the movie as quickly as possible,
but we realized it was a mistake, 'cause Rob completely nails it.
WEITZ.:
Well, and also, this is not in the book, but I think Stephenie rather liked it, and that's actually one of the fun things of working with Stephenie is that occasionally you come up with a little bit that she likes,
and she's like, "That's a really cool idea.
Let's have more of that. "
So, now we're in Carlisle's room, and you can see sort of the...
Well, inside his room, you'll see later all of the art that he's accumulated throughout his life, but here come the Volturi.
LAMBERT.:
Can you explain how the painting was done, this visual effect?
WEITZ.:
I can't explain it.
It's magic.
(BO TH LAUGHING)
Oh, my God, how did we do it?
Well, first we had an idea of what the painting's dimensions were gonna be like, but there's a big green screen that they're looking at as they're talking about it, and saying, "Is Carlisle there?"
Then we shot the actual performance of the Volturi later, and then we chose a starting frame, freeze-frame, which was then painted by the painter as a separate oil painting, which was then composited into the green screen in the first place.
So, really very, very complicated, and a lot of other people doing hard work, which is how I like it.
There's the wonderful Christopher Heyerdahl, Canadian actor, amazing face, fantastic performer, and, of course, Jamie Campbell Bower, who shocked people by saying that the Volturi scenes were going to be shot in the nude,
and then I had to go online to convince people that that was not gonna happen.
(BO TH LAUGHING)
At any rate, Carlisle really shouldn't have been hanging around with the Volturi, given that he doesn't seem to hold the same ideas about capital punishment as they do, but such is life.
-LAMBERT.:
That's why he went to Forks.
-Yeah.
LAMBERT.:
What was the name of the rogue vampire, the actor?
-He had a great name, I remember.
-WEITZ.:
Curtis Caravaggio is his name.
-It's a fantastic name.
-LAMBERT.:
Great name, great guy.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, great guy, didn't mind getting his head torn off.
(BO TH CHUCKLING)
He was willing to end his career on that one moment.
No, just kidding, he's still alive.
Hire him.
He's brilliant.
(IN FRENCH ACCENT) Now, what do we have to say here?
It's a beautiful love scene.
But it's my job to protect you.
LAMBERT.:
This was a Chris Weitz line.
I remember, you were proud of this.
-WEITZ.:
Is it?
-Yeah.
WEITZ.:
What, "It's my job to protect you"?
LAMBERT.:
Yeah, "It's my job to protect you from everything except my sister. "
WEITZ.:
No, no, I think that was in the script.
LAMBERT.:
Was it?
Maybe the line before was a Chris Weitz line.
There was something you were proud about in that area.
WEITZ.: (CHUCKLES) Well, I'm a prideful person.
All right, now we arranged this shot, which is Bella's PO V, as kind of almost like a conversation piece, which is a certain 18th century kind of painting where a family is arranged in a very specific way,
and our wonderful cinematographer, Javier Aguirresarobe, lit this in such a way that it's kind of got a lovely golden mood to it, and part of our intention was to make the colors in this film much more golden and red and warm
than in the first film just to kind of switch things up.
And also because I think there's a sort of an epic romantic feel to this, and I wanted things to look like a Pre-Raphaelite painting.
Look it up on Wikipedia, "Pre-Raphaelites. "
LAMBERT.:
That's what I did.
That's what Javier did.
WEITZ.:
Yeah.
(BO TH LAUGHING)
LAMBERT.:
This was the first night of night shooting, wasn't it?
WEITZ.:
Yeah, and the funny thing was, about halfway through the night,
I realized that most of the shots were against walls, so we could have shot this during the day, and because Javier and I were communicating through high school French, because he speaks mostly Spanish and I speak mostly English,
there had been a misunderstanding.
And there we were, in the middle of the night, really not having to be there, so sleepless.
Okay, big moment.
Woops.
World's worst paper cut.
(WEITZ EXCLAIMING)
What can we say about this?
You will notice, this is giving away all of the magic, that in a lot of these stunt scenes, people are looking away, and that's because they are not the actual actors.
They are the stunt actors, the stuntcators.
LAMBERT.:
I've got to say, they were pretty convincing, though.
-WEITZ.:
Yeah, they were very good.
-Jasper's double looked amazing.
WEITZ.:
I love that shot, by the way, where she's looking up and her hair is kind of mussed in such a way that it curls up around her eye.
Now, when Carlisle rushes over to Bella, it's called a whip pan, and it's a very, very old-fashioned way of showing someone getting somewhere quickly.
There's no CGI involved.
You just take the camera, whip it quickly off someone, and then later sit them down and whip it onto them.
It looks like they've moved very quickly.
So, part of the issue in this movie was how to establish vampire speed and make it realistic and fun and dynamic.
And part of it was to just do it in camera.
Okay, so that's a Hogarth engraving, by the way.
More art for you guys.
I know you're big art fans.
That is part of The Rake's Progress.
And you'll see throughout Carlisle's study, there's a Tibetan Buddhist Thangka, spelled T-H-A-N-G-K-A.
I mean, I know there are a lot of Thangka fans out there who are really pleased about that.
The Dalai Lama, huge Twihard fan, so he will definitely appreciate that.
LAMBERT.:
It's actually product placement from the Dalai Lama.
-WEITZ.: (LAUGHS) Yeah.
-He paid a lot of money for that.
WEITZ.:
He said that our next incarnation would be much better if we just put it in.
Lovely little moment, actually, between Peter and Kristen.
I like these sort of scenes where characters are interacting in a way you wouldn't necessarily expect, and it's a nice fatherly sort of moment.
LAMBERT.:
The music is also appropriate in this scene.
Sorry to interrupt, Chris.
WEITZ.:
No, please, go ahead.
LAMBERT.: 'Cause I just remember, we spent a lot of time looking for the right track for this, and I was pleased when we found one that the translation is about sort of things being in peace or implying dying.
It's like a Goethe poem that ends on, "Soon you, too, will be at rest, "
which seems appropriate for those Goethe fans, as well.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, I know, we are making big fans.
LAMBERT.:
That's the most pretentious scene in the movie.
(WEITZ LAUGHS)
WEITZ.:
I rather love that shot of the bowl, of the flaming bowl, and partly because the gauze there looks like a heart, and so it evokes, to me, some of this kind of wonderful old-fashioned imagery,
but also you can see an upside-down wolf engraving in the shot, if you look carefully.
Anya Marina's Satellite Heart is playing on the radio here, a really lovely, lovely song.
...or old age...
WEITZ.:
And what I really like about these sorts of scenes between Kristen and Rob is that the situations are utterly bizarre.
I mean, she's talking about being turned into a vampire, and he's thinking about leaving because he's going to kill her, but in some ways, it's like these horrible pre-breakup conversations that you have.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah, they play it so well, 'cause they just play it completely straight.
WEITZ.:
And here, this is a nice little shot where they're separated by the door, there.
I think Kristen just has this wonderful ability to make lines which are about the soul or big ideas, but to somehow sell them.
There's gonna be a lovely moment here where even though Edward is usually the strong one, the aggressor,
Bella, just by kind of force of character, backs him up.
You know, she is the one who's forcing the issue here, really, and although Edward cannot be moved, you know, he's practically made of stone, she backs him up here.
So can l ask one thing?
WEITZ.: "What, Bella?
What do you want?"
Okay, now, when...
Usually in these kisses, we're on Bella's side, as it were.
So, you have two sides to choose from when you're shooting a kiss, and I would say...
Now I'm gonna get myself in trouble.
Bella looks better when she's kissing than Rob does.
Kristen looks better when she's kissing than Rob does.
LAMBERT.:
You're only saying that because you ate her burger the other day.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, that's true.
Sorry, Kristen.
I know you were hungry, but it was so delicious.
That burger was just...
There are burger salvage rights.
If you leave a burger for long enough, someone's allowed to eat it.
Anyway...
LAMBERT.:
The "I love you, " should we give the game away about that line,
-"I love you, " from Kristen?
-WEITZ.:
Yes.
Absolutely.
LAMBERT.:
It's a little bit of a sneaky cheat.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, well, that's an ADR line, which is a line that was recorded after the fact, in which Bella says, "I love you. " And in fact, she's saying something else at that moment,
but you can barely tell.
LAMBERT.:
I don't think she's saying anything.
I think she's just taking a breath and about to say something completely different.
WEITZ.:
Interesting.
Okay.
So we wanted this moment.
And, you know, in the first film, they hadn't said, "I love you, " at all, and we thought that it would be very, very interesting to have her say that.
It's actually Kristen and Rob who came up with the idea.
At this moment where things are really just going wrong, rather than in the moment where things are going quite right.
And it's kind of, you know, strange and upsetting, but the whole point about this sequence of the movie is things going wrong and sort of what happens after "happily ever after"
and the kind of weird, tragic beauty of a romance going wrong.
-I'm sure you know all about that, Peter.
-LAMBERT.:
I certainly do, yeah.
Yeah.
This music's beautiful.
WEITZ.:
This is Bon Iver, and it is a beautiful track.
And St. Vincent, and it is a gorgeous, gorgeous track.
And this shot of Kristen is fantastic in the way that she transitions between the relief of seeing Edward, and then realizing something's wrong, in part because he's still wearing the same clothes.
Now, it should be pointed out that vampires do not have body odor, so when he wears clothes for several days in a row, or for months, in fact,
it's okay.
It's all right.
It's just the clothes are getting worn down.
Anyway, here we are, and I believe this is near Capilano Gorge in Vancouver.
And this is the big breakup scene, and this is the scene that killed me when it got out on the Net.
I was so sad, because I wanted audiences to see it for the first time as part of the whole picture.
Why?
LAMBERT.:
I love the way the camera works on this scene, the kind of slightly sort of nauseous sense of it moving in and then falling back again and then moving in.
It's kind of like waves of badness.
WEITZ.:
There's...
We had Dave Crone, who's a fantastic Steadicam operator.
Steadicam is a system whereby you've got a guy who's essentially holding up the camera, and it kind of floats.
And you can see there's a floatiness to this.
And it works here because her world is sort of floating away from her.
And, you know, we started with them together, we're separating them gradually, forcing into them so that we get the impact.
Then we'll jump back, and you'll feel sort of a distance in an over-the-shoulder shot like this.
And then you'll see we cut to a two-shot.
We cut to the two-shot just when Edward says,
"You don't belong in my world, " I think.
And you know, a two-shot is a very emotionally inert shot, and you get this feeling...
Here we go, there's that two-shot.
There's no emotion at this moment, and then we cut right back in to her, close.
Feeling it very, very, very seriously.
And the camera is always moving in this kind of queasy way.
LAMBERT.:
There's something queasy about the music, as well, I think, the way it kind of swells in waves, and it's like the waves of bad news that Edward keeps kind of crashing down on Bella,
and she keeps trying to sort of deflect or defend it.
-WEITZ.:
Yeah.
-Defend herself from it, but it just keeps swelling again.
WEITZ.:
And here where he says, "No, " we're tighter than we've been ever, more fascinated with him, the camera's more fascinated on him than it ever has been before.
But if it's not too much to ask...
WEITZ.:
And you'll see eventually that it gets so much for Bella that the actual kind of access of the camera starts to tilt into what is called a Dutch angle, where the camera isn't parallel to the ground.
It starts kind of tilting off in a somewhat sickening way.
LAMBERT.:
Not something that we used very often, in the end.
WEITZ.:
No, I don't like Dutch angles except when it's for a good purpose.
It's coming in a while.
Now I've kind of...
LAMBERT.:
You've pre-empted the Dutch angle.
WEITZ.:
I did.
I pre-empted the Dutch.
(BO TH LAUGHING)
-LAMBERT.:
Never pre-empt a Dutch.
-No.
And you can see, also, that the backgrounds in these shots, having established what the forest looked like, now become these kind of impressionistic colors, and it's really...
Here we go.
It's shifting so that she's looking right up at him at this sort of angle, and something feels quite wrong about it.
He's quite static and controlled.
She is off angle.
And now it's righting itself as he comes in, and when he leaves, there's a discontinuity here.
Normally you'd show him in space, but he actually leaves quicker than...
He's gone.
Normally, if you were trying to convey continuity of a person walking away, you'd see him in this shot, you'd see him in the previous shot.
But that's another way that we kind of conveyed vampire speed was just in the cut, where suddenly someone's not there anymore or someone is there when they hadn't been moments ago.
Now, these are jump cuts, which, you either like them or you don't, but when you do them, they're very obvious, and this conveys the kind of frantic nature of things.
Pete, you talk about jump cuts a bit.
LAMBERT.:
Jump cuts convey the frantic nature of things, and that's why we used them there, 'cause it's frantic.
WEITZ.:
Wow, that's really incisive.
LAMBERT.:
Okay.
They're jump cuts because the camera is at the same angle in relation to Bella and the composition is the same.
Normally, when you'd make a cut, you would cut a different angle and maybe a different lens, so there would be, in fact, a huge visual discontinuity between one shot and the next, which your brain would interpret as a kind of fluid cut.
When you actually cut from one angle to another identical angle, it creates a kind of visual jolt, which gives you a sense of anxiety.
Is that right?
-Have I nailed it?
-WEITZ.:
There you go.
Yeah, yeah, no, and then we just had another jump cut right there.
And also, I should say, okay, there was a rather groovy shot where we turned down the light on this long walking shot, so that we transitioned from day into night within one shot.
And here now is a shot that I love to do, which is a crane shot, pushing down on someone, circling.
I mean, I feel that audiences understand where someone is oriented in space, so they're not going to be like, "Whoa, Bella is floating upside down. "
LAMBERT.: "The whole floor is moving. "
WEITZ.:
So, they know that, okay, Bella ends up upside down, obviously her world has been turned upside down, and this thing is forcing down on her, just the horrific moment, and so we use the camera to kind of convey that.
And here's our first shot of the wolves, and the tough thing was to make it seem like it might be a wolf, it might be a bear, what the heck is it?
LAMBERT.:
We had a whole little mini scene here, didn't we, of Bella waking up and actually explicitly seeing the shape in the woods.
WEITZ.:
And then she runs off, and then she falls asleep again, but it was really hard to believe that she fell asleep again having been so scared.
LAMBERT.:
It was also kind of...
When you saw it that explicitly rather than in that kind of dreamy way that we actually ended up cutting it, it just felt like too direct a connection between the werewolf and Sam Uley, didn't it?
WEITZ.:
Yeah, it did.
We wanted to preserve a bit of mystery to it.
There is lovely Graham Greene.
LAMBERT.:
There's also Bob Marks in that scene, who deserves a shout out because he doesn't appear elsewhere in the film.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, you'll see him in deleted scenes, and he was not deleted for any reason other than for time.
Bob Marks, played by Adrien Dorval, good man.
Now, Graham Greene and Chaske Spencer having a little moment 'cause they both know about the werewolves.
Jacob doesn't know what the heck is going on, and Chaske is giving him the stink eye, and he walks off.
LAMBERT.:
There's this creepy naked guy looking at him.
(BO TH LAUGHING)
WEITZ.:
So now we're going into this lovely Lykke Li song, and also this very complicated CG sequence, which involved first shooting the element of Bella with a Steadicam, but having markers on the set so that we could match exactly the move
that Dave Crone did with the Steadicam, with a robotic camera, which moved precisely the way that he did, so that we could do multiple passes and that every time we looked out the window, we would see a new month.
This corresponds directly to these chapter headings in the book, which were rather clever and fun, where time just doesn't pass, but you see the name of another month.
It's also worth noting that each time you go around there are fewer and fewer photographs and paintings up on the wall.
You just see the marks that sun makes when it's covered up the absence of photos, so that her life is kind of becoming less and less full.
She's losing touch with her friends.
She is just becoming kind of dead to the world, really.
And this shot is still going on, and this is just a match dissolve.
Okay, no CG here.
Just very carefully positioning her on two totally different days so that her position matches.
You get the sense of her not moving ahead.
Now some people think that Bella screams like a stuck pig here.
I rather enjoyed Kristen's first instinct, which was that she was in so much pain that, you know, it wasn't just waking up from a nightmare, but it was really like being stabbed in the gut.
LAMBERT.:
I think it's great, and she's been so restrained in a way in terms of trying to keep it in throughout the break up, it's like a big moment, I think,
-when that happens.
-WEITZ.:
Yeah.
I think it's a nice kind of jolt.
Oh, Charlie, asleep on the couch after watching his favorite sports team.
LAMBERT.: (LAUGHING) A night on the beer!
WEITZ.:
And, yes,
so, very kind of Norman Rockwelly framing here...
I don't believe Norman Rockwell's a trademark, so I'm allowed to say that.
You know, the house, the very straight on shot of the house there, but things are not so good with family at all.
And Bella is going to lie now, leading to a disastrous night out at the movies.
Movies don't really go well in this movie.
I don't, but just go.
Go to Jacksonville.
WEITZ.:
Go on, say something interesting, Peter.
LAMBERT.:
I think that Bella looks amazing in this scene.
-She looks so emaciated and unhappy.
-WEITZ.:
Yeah, yeah.
LAMBERT.:
It's great the way her hair and makeup transforms throughout the movie.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, very nice makeup by Robin Mathews, very nice hair by Thom MacIntyre.
Yeah, and also I think the way that Tish Monaghan designed her clothing at this point, she's really not bothering to put herself together, and a nice 'stache by Billy, still there, the 'stache remains.
LAMBERT.:
The 'tache always remains.
Muse, the music of a liar.
WEITZ.:
The music of a liar?
LAMBERT.:
Yeah, when someone lies, Muse always plays in the background.
(WEITZ LAUGHING)
That's the rule.
jessica:
I don't know why you want to sit through...
WEITZ.:
I don't know what that means, but I'll go with it.
Okay, so they've seen a zombie movie.
We cleared this one title as the one zombie movie title that's never been used, and, of course, it refers back to the possibility, or Bella's hope, that someday that Edward would come back.
-And actually...
-LAMBERT.:
This was all...
Sorry, this was all ad-libbing from Anna Kendrick, wasn't it?
WEITZ.:
It was, except that I told her to do the thing where her cousin has leprosy.
I take full credit for that.
LAMBERT.:
Well, there were lots of different versions of this, I remember.
She gave lots of different things.
WEITZ.:
They're quite funny.
Now we're flashing back to the frat boys in Twilight.
LAMBERT.:
This was the first sequence I cut because I could cut it before any dailies came in from the shoot.
WEITZ.:
Of course, there you go.
And here's our first view of Edward.
Controversially, we used visuals of Edward as well as just the aural,
A-U-R-A-L, hallucinations that Bella experiences.
I thought it was a worthwhile use of the power of film and enough Edward without being too much.
Well, they seem great.
Can we go?
WEITZ.:
I think that that's a very funny line reading by Anna there.
CHET:
Hey, girlie!
WEITZ.:
You may have noticed that Port Angeles has become a larger city recently and also a bit more of a post-industrial town.
(BO TH LAUGHING)
It was a charming town in Twilight, but it's really seen better days now.
LAMBERT.:
This is like the dark end of Port Angeles.
The bit you don't wanna hang out in.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, right near the movie theater.
(LAMBERT CHUCKLING)
LAMBERT.:
There's also a completely empty street just around the corner.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
No, that's cool.
I'll be whoever you want me to be, honey.
So, what do you say?
You promised me, nothing reckless.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
You promised it would be as if you never existed.
(CHET CLEARS THROAT)
-You lied.
-You say something, babe?
You know what?
Never mind.
(engine roaring)
Stop!
Stop, stop, stop!
(BRAKES screeching)
WEITZ.:
Anyway, all that stuff that we just saw, of course, was using CGI and modulating it as much as we could to give Bella the notion that she needed to put herself in danger, which leads her to Jacob via the bikes, basically.
I was about to end up in an fbi interview room like some lame TV show.
God, that was such a rush.
Awesome.
So you're an adrenaline junkie now?
That's cool.
You can go bungee jumping.
You don't get on the back of some random loser's motorcycle.
Crazy.
BELLA.:
Alice, I saw him.
Maybe I'm crazy now.
I guess that's okay.
WEITZ.:
So here she comes to Jacob's house, which we now see for the first time, this lovely barn, which was green, which we repainted red to be like in the book, and we put a lot of Quileute-type fishing gear around it
even though this was once a goat pasture, actually.
LAMBERT.:
Wow.
WEITZ.:
We moved away all the goats and replaced it with actors.
LAMBERT.:
And Bella's house was next to a turkey abattoir, as well.
WEITZ.:
Yes, abattoir being a slaughterhouse, by the way, for the non-British world.
Taylor hates this wig, and in a way, I can't blame him, because I suppose it's kind of like, you know, being Chewbacca.
LAMBERT.:
Michael Sheen, of course, loved it, and that's why he is wearing it at the end of the movie.
(WEITZ EXCLAIMS)
(BO TH LAUGHING)
WEITZ.:
Oh, yes, we like to joke about reusing wigs, but we didn't.
We really didn't.
-LAMBERT.:
No, it's a different wig.
-Yeah.
...really stupid and reckless.
Yeah, I mean, it's completely stupid...
WEITZ.:
So, we're gonna do a little thing here where Jacob manages to lift this bike, and what it involves is having it on a very strong crane rig which can lift it, making it look as though Jacob is actually putting in
just enough force to lift it, and then erasing the wires that were holding it up.
And that thing is fricking heavy.
I tried lifting it myself.
There is no way that even Taylor Lautner, with his improved Taylor Lautner 2.0 body, could have done it.
So, it's a nice little moment there.
It feels like that sometimes.
WEITZ.:
And this song is by the Magic Numbers, but what you don't get to in this part of it is the part by Amadou and Mariam, who are this Senegalese duo, and I recommend their music very highly.
They're on our soundtrack.
Did I just see a mike?
I thought I saw a boom up there.
Oh, wait, never mind, anyway.
LAMBERT.:
Maybe you're looking at it in the wrong aspect ratio.
WEITZ.:
I think I'm probably looking at the wrong aspect ratio, yeah.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah, that'll be it.
WEITZ.:
Okay, well, this lovely barn here, designed by David Brisbin, our production designer, and his wonderful crew, filled with lovely stuff, and when you build these interiors, you want it to be full of detail and interest
and lovely, crunchy texture for the light to play off of, but you don't want things to pop out so much that you're not paying attention to the actors.
And so now we're establishing this lovely friendship that's forming between him and Kristen.
I think it conveys very well the life that he's kind of infusing into her, and that's kind of what Taylor is like.
He's just such a wonderful, warm person.
Now, here come Quil and Embry.
The guy who's playing Quil, Tyson Houseman...
I love this joke, by the way, where he's just so keen on himself.
I think he was just kind of walking around and saw a big line of people and said, "What's going on?"
And they're like, "Somebody's lining up, people are lining up
"to audition for this movie, "
and then he found himself, about a week later, cast as Quil.
-LAMBERT.:
That's pretty cool.
-Yeah.
And Kiowa does not have hair like that.
That is a wig, also.
A rather good wig.
You want funny, Black?
I'll give you funny.
WEITZ.:
The thing here, I think, was to cast guys who just seemed like regular kids.
All the Quileutes were played by First Nations, as they call them in Canada, or Native American actors.
And also, they don't talk about "my tribe" and "my people" all the time, which I think Native Americans and First Nations people are really sick of hearing in everything, every piece of popular culture that involves an Indian,
as they're often called.
Okay, this is another motion control shot, which means that you can sort of stay within the same atmosphere, but pick it up at very different times of day with the actors in positions it would have been impossible for them to reach.
So, very subtly, you see their relationship developing as this bike comes together, as the time of day changes.
And you hardly notice it happening, but they're changing positions, they're changing relative to one another, and things are coming together, especially motorbikes.
(LAMBERT LAUGHING)
-And I think...
-LAMBERT.:
Until Jacob messes it up.
WEITZ.:
I know.
Poor Jake.
He's kind of always saying the wrong thing at the time.
Why is he talking about Edward Cullen now?
He's like, "I shouldn't have said that.
That was a mistake. "
LAMBERT.:
And it did lead to an entire nightmare scene, didn't it?
WEITZ.:
Yeah.
LAMBERT.:
Which we took out for various reasons.
We felt that it kind of lessened the impact of the apparitions if you saw Edward too much, as you had done in a nightmare, which we cut from that.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, and also, I think that with film, there's always a danger
-of one dream sequence too many.
-LAMBERT.:
Yeah.
WEITZ.:
Some films that I love, they just put in one darn dream sequence too many.
There's the evil dream catcher again.
(WEITZ MIMICKING DRAMATIC MUSIC)
This is a sweet little scene with Billy and Kristen where he gives the conventional wisdom of love the one you're with.
And for a second, you'll see in the very first shot of the next scene, she'll even consider it.
She'll be thinking, "Should I settle?"
And I think that that's part of the book of New Moon, the notion that...
I mean, she knows in her mind, she feels so low.
She feels Edward is way above her and will never come back.
And here is Jacob who is warm and special and loves her, and what should she do?
But she never does.
She never quite does.
There, she's looking at him.
She's thinking about it.
And then her head quickly goes away as she notices Jacob possibly catching her in that moment.
Are you doubting your mad skills?
WEITZ.:
Now, it should be said that this was shot against a green screen.
None of these trees that are currently kind of flying across the windscreen.
There is no windscreen.
That windscreen was put in digitally.
The trees were put in digitally.
Anything that runs by the window is digital.
It was all shot in a barn, which we had to use when it was snowing one day
-in the middle of the sequence...
-LAMBERT.:
Right.
It was a meadow.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, in the middle of the meadow sequence with Laurent and Kristen, it snowed, and we showed up one day at 5.:00 in the morning, and there was no way to shoot there.
LAMBERT.:
But there was a barn with a green screen ready to put in it.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, and so we did all of our green screen car work during that time.
Here is a cliff, which was put together from a real cliff,
CG additions to the cliff, guys shot against green screen, now that is Alex Meraz first jumping, but about half way down, he's taken over by CGI and turned into a CGI Alex who splashes into CGI water.
I don't know.
They just think they run this place.
Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, now you'll notice that Sam Uley favors Capri length shorts, and that's because the guy who was gonna do the groovy stunt that's coming up had injured his knee recently and had to wear a brace.
So, JJ, the stunt coordinator came to me and said,
"Is it possible for Sam to wear extra long shorts?"
And I said, "Okay. "
(BO TH LAUGHING)
Hence Sam's fashion choice.
Now, I've taken a lot of flak in the press recently for why the Quileutes are always shirtless,
as though I were some creepy old man who just wanted to show guys with abs and six-packs.
That was the shot, by the way.
That was put together from about three different elements, a guy jumping off a huge tower and...
But let me finish talking about these lack of shirts.
My answer's always that the Quileutes do not have a lot of money to waste on T-shirts, so if you're running 108 fever, you're gonna walk around in a bunch of shorts.
LAMBERT.:
And more to the point, if you're gonna turn into a wolf the whole time and lose your T-shirt every time you transform...
WEITZ.:
Exactly.
LAMBERT.: ...that's gonna start getting expensive.
WEITZ.:
It will get costly, and it gets tiresome to have stashes of clothes all around the woods.
I love this shot 'cause it looks like a Magritte painting.
LAMBERT.:
That's my favorite apparition.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, I think it's mine, too.
I think it's mine, too.
I think it's rather nice how the bike's stalling out kind of conveys her shock at that moment.
And also Alexandre's weird music here conveys adrenaline and blood sort of pumping through her head.
Notice, is this Kristen?
-Not so much.
-LAMBERT.:
It's Christopher.
(BO TH LAUGHING)
WEITZ.:
Okay, that was a dude.
-But you know...
-LAMBERT.:
The rest is all Kristen.
WEITZ.:
The rest is all Kristen.
LAMBERT.:
And the person driving the motorbike when Jacob comes up is, in fact, a woman.
No, it's not.
That's Taylor.
(BO TH LAUGHING)
No more bikes.
-LAMBERT.:
Here comes a big moment.
-Here comes a big moment.
Now, this used to be a wider shot.
All you ladies who wanted a wider shot of Taylor taking his shirt off,
I had it in and then Stephenie Meyer called it
Jacob's Chippendales audition, and so we went to a tighter shot of it.
LAMBERT.:
A tighter and quicker shot, as well, where he kind of does it all a bit quicker.
The one we originally had, which I think you could probably see in the Comic-Con footage online,
-he kind of labors it a little.
-WEITZ.:
He sort of luxuriates in it.
It is a bit much.
It's true.
LAMBERT.:
Good for Comic-Con but not necessary at this stage.
You're sort of beautiful.
LAMBERT.:
Now this is when he should kiss her.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, here's where Jacob loses another great chance, but he's too nice a guy.
She's just hit her head, so...
LAMBERT.:
No, you don't kiss a girl when she's just hit her head.
WEITZ.:
Why don't we count out the number of times he has missed opportunities?
Twice so far, I'd say, at least.
LAMBERT.:
What was the first time again?
I've forgotten.
WEITZ.:
I think it was when he started talking about Edward Cullen.
He couldn't have kissed her then, but he really shouldn't have said that, so two mistakes, two Jacob romantic mistakes, guys, anyone out there listening.
So now, Kristen has been sort of pulled back into the world by her association with Jacob.
She's ready to deal with
-humanity again.
-LAMBERT.:
It's nice the way the music that's kind of represented her sort of tender feelings towards Jacob at the end of the last scene continues through to the moment where she decides to join her friends.
It's like somehow there's a link.
WEITZ.:
And she goes to join her unfeasibly attractive normal friends.
(BO TH LAUGHING)
And I really like this bit with Mike here.
It's really well-delivered, his kind of...
I don't know.
It's terribly funny, but it's also rather touching at the moment.
I mean, the guy who really loses in all of this is Mike,
-much worse than Jacob, I think, in a way.
-LAMBERT.:
Yeah.
WEITZ.:
Although, Jacob goes through a lot more with Bella, so I suppose he's got more to lose, but Mike, Mike is just...
LAMBERT.:
And Jacob also has to turn into a wolf, as well.
Mike doesn't have to live with that.
WEITZ.:
And also, Mike could have gone out with Jessica, and he dumped her.
That was probably
-the biggest mistake of his life.
-LAMBERT.:
Douche.
Douche move.
WEITZ.:
They might get back together.
Who knows?
Do they?
LAMBERT.:
I'm trying to remember.
We'll have to watch The Twilight Saga:
Eclipse to find out.
(WEITZ LAUGHING)
Coming out in June 2010.
WEITZ.:
I love this moment here where...
Oh, no, we missed it.
Where Kristen says, "Yeah, I'd like to go, " and then she has nothing to add, and you sort of see her opening her mouth and closing it.
Now, Face Punch is a title that my brother and I always thought would be a great name for a hockey movie, and so I had to give a list of clearable titles for action movies, and Face Punch was one of the two that cleared.
You'd be surprised the number of stupid names for action movies that have actually been turned into stupid action movies.
The only choices we had were Face Punch and Kill Hunt.
We went with Face Punch.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah, I think that was the right choice.
WEITZ.:
Yeah.
Definitely.
LAMBERT.:
I love this scene, as well.
-WEITZ.:
I do, too, where Jacob is kind of...
-He's so sweet.
WEITZ.:
Jacob's sweet, but he's also sort of messing with Mike, and Mike is really being a bit pissy with Jacob, but Jacob is unflappable.
LAMBERT.:
Did you just use our one curse word?
WEITZ.:
Was that our one swear word?
I don't think that counts, does it?
LAMBERT.:
I don't know.
I'm not gonna say it again, though.
WEITZ.:
Well, if I haven't, I'm just gonna swear at you.
I think we get one swear word in this entire commentary, so I'm just gonna swear at you at the end of this whole thing.
LAMBERT.:
Okay, okay.
MAN 2 ON SCREEN.:
Put your gun down or I'm gonna blow your frickin' head off.
MAN 3 ON SCREEN.:
Both of you put both of your guns down or I'm gonna blow both of your frickin' heads off.
MAN 1 ON SCREEN.:
All right, forget it, let's do this!
(GUNS FIRING)
(MAN SCREAMS)
(GUNS FIRING)
(WOMAN SCREAMS)
Okay, I think I'm gonna throw up.
(SCREAMING CONTINUES)
He's... (SCOFFS) What a marshmallow!
LAMBERT.:
Always gets a line, that laugh.
WEITZ.:
I think you just did a spoonerism.
"Always gets a laugh, that line, " you meant, surely?
-LAMBERT.:
What did I say?
-Always get a line, that laugh.
-LAMBERT.:
Did I?
-Yeah.
-LAMBERT.:
Okay, can I explain why?
-Yeah.
LAMBERT.:
It's 'cause I haven't slept for 32 hours 'cause I flew back from Los Angeles to London yesterday.
WEITZ.:
Oh, I see.
All right.
LAMBERT.:
That's why.
There'll be more of those.
WEITZ.:
Now, funny...
We just saw the premiere, and people laugh when Bella disengages her hand from Jacob's.
I think perhaps because girls feel that's a very identifiable moment for them, when a guy kind of gets a bit closer than you are ready for them to be.
LAMBERT.:
I would add that that is probably a third mistaken moment from Jacob, because I think he times it very badly,
-the hand-holding.
-WEITZ.:
Yeah, what he should do is...
Well, I don't know.
I rather admire Jacob's persistence at this moment, because I think sometimes if you're gonna go for it, you should just lay out your case and not try to play any games and just tell someone what you feel about them.
-I admire him for how he does that here.
-LAMBERT.:
Okay.
I'll retract that.
WEITZ.:
Well, I don't know, I mean, maybe you wanna go about it differently, Pete.
-It's up to you.
-LAMBERT.:
Okay.
WEITZ.:
But all I'm saying is that's, I think, how I first got to date my wife,
-was just by being straight with her.
-LAMBERT.:
Belligerent.
WEITZ.:
And grabbing her.
No, it was by...
I said, you know, "I like you and I think
"that we could have a relationship, and I'd like to see if that's possible. "
-LAMBERT.:
Wow, that's amazing.
-Yeah.
-LAMBERT.:
That's really touching.
-And it worked, I think.
-She's still here.
-LAMBERT.:
I think it did.
WEITZ.:
She's waving at me right now, yeah, yeah.
LAMBERT.:
Aw...
Should we explain that we're not in the same room at the moment?
-WEITZ.:
I think we did at the beginning.
-Oh, we did, really?
Okay.
WEITZ.:
Yeah.
But, yeah, you are connected via the magic of ISDN.
I don't even know what the heck that means.
LAMBERT.:
I'm not actually watching the movie at the moment.
WEITZ.:
All you can do is hear it, so that's why occasionally I describe what's happening.
LAMBERT.:
Now, maybe we should talk about the movie.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, okay, now Jacob's doing what he should do, I think.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah, definitely.
WEITZ.:
But Bella can't.
Bella can't do it.
And this is a very sad moment here.
They're both trapped, really.
LAMBERT.:
This music, which is Jacob's theme, has a great quality of being kind of unresolved.
You get a lot with the music that accompanies him a sort of a repetitive motif that never quite lands where you hope it will, which I think is a really nice way
-of illustrating Jacob's feelings.
-WEITZ.:
Notice also, though, if you go back about five seconds, old Jacob had snuck his left hand onto Bella's right knee.
-LAMBERT.:
Yeah.
-You know, cheeky.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah, there's a couple of little cheeky continuity errors, as well, if you wanna look carefully around that area.
WEITZ.:
Continuity, by the way, being in editing terms, making sure that things match, so you don't cut from one moment where a guy is standing with his arms crossed, and then the next moment his hands are up in the air.
Now, when I worked on this scene in the script,
I pushed for Jacob to be suddenly and unexpectedly aggressive.
And people were like, "Well, that's weird.
Why would he do that?"
And I thought, "Well, this will be good.
"It'll signal something is up, something's wrong here,
"and this usually very sweet-natured Jacob is acting very odd. "
BELLA.: (ON PHONE) He won't let me visit, but would you call me?
LAMBERT.:
And it's a little gesture towards the sort of sudden nature of the transformation from human being to wolf, which is gonna come later, as well, isn't it?
WEITZ.:
Yeah, that it's very, very rapid-fire.
BELLA.:
I just wanted to hear your voice, so no pressure.
Jacob, please...
Call me.
WEITZ.:
Okay, so that was fake rain, by the way, amazing fake rain.
What the heck is going on with that salmon up there, which seems to be swimming around without any skin?
He's a pre-smoked salmon.
It's amazing that you can catch pre-smoked salmon in Forks, Washington.
Anyway...
So, okay, Bella's very much realizing how much of a lifesaver Jacob has been, and is about to go over to him.
But meanwhile, we're still trying to press the fact that people are dying in Forks, leading to the question, why is Charlie going fishing?
Why isn't he on the case?
Okay, well, this moment usually leads to some hoots and hollers.
Jacob, short hair, buffed out, tattoo, damn.
I think that was my swear, wasn't it?
LAMBERT.:
I don't know.
I think you may have used two now, Chris.
WEITZ.:
Oh, no.
Oh, dear.
LAMBERT.:
We'll have to do the whole thing again.
WEITZ.:
Well, now, I love this sequence, although it really involved torturing the poor actors, because all this rain is fake rain, but it's very, very cold.
Imagine, it's very cold here in British Columbia.
I'm all dressed up in a parka, you know, with a scarf and a nice hat, and poor Taylor is naked from the waist up, and we're dumping ice cold water from these towers onto them.
For about the first few takes, Kristen's contacts, because you know she has these hazel eyes, which are, you know, quite a special color, and they're re-colored with brown contacts, they were getting washed out.
So, eventually the eye color that was put back in was done with CGI.
Yeah, poor Taylor here is...
I mean, you can tell, actually, from some of these shots that the water's so cold that steam is rising off him, which only works to my advantage because, of course, he's supposed to be a wolf running a very high temperature.
But there are moments where you can almost tell that he's shivering with the cold, but I see it as intense emotion.
LAMBERT.:
I remember this was shot within the first week of shooting, I think.
-WEITZ.:
Yeah.
-And I remember it was definitely one of Taylor's first big scenes, and I remember just watching, the day after in the dailies trailer, all of the material that was shot for this and there just being this kind of palpable feeling of excitement
that he was really nailing it.
-It's a good scene.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, it's a really lovely one, and Taylor is great in it, and I always knew he was gonna bring it home, which makes me so proud of him.
Maybe give me, like, some time or something.
LAMBERT.:
Incidentally, there's a little musical motif coming up, which is almost my favorite bit of music in the movie, and it never recurs anywhere else in it,
-but it's an absolute humdinger.
-WEITZ.:
Which bit?
LAMBERT.:
It's literally about to happen if I'm hearing this at the same time as you are.
It's coming up now.
It's just amazing.
It kind of swells.
They swell it in the mix, and here it goes.
Now.
Not anymore.
This doesn't even matter.
All right?
LAMBERT.:
And Alexandre's only used it once, so he could probably get away with ripping himself off
-and putting it in another film a lot.
-WEITZ.:
Why not?
Yeah, no, that is nice, the way those strings are sort of competing with each other and swelling.
I don't know much about music.
Anyway, this is a very sad scene.
LAMBERT.:
Should we talk about what the rain did to the microphones,
-that it made it a little difficult?
-WEITZ.:
Oh, yeah, of course.
We had to rerecord all the dialogue here because the rain was hitting the microphones.
Taylor couldn't wear a microphone on his body because there's nothing to attach it to.
So all of this is rerecorded, but it's rerecorded to match exactly the sort of tone in which they said it the first time.
So, it's pretty much just what we had.
LAMBERT.:
Now, is there something hanging off the back of Bella's rucksack?
WEITZ.:
There is something, which might refer to a previous movie of mine, which did not go as well as this one.
(BO TH LAUGHING)
LAMBERT.:
That's right.
There's an American Pie in her backpack.
WEITZ.:
Yes.
Okay, so... (WEITZ SNORTS)
Sorry that was just me snorting.
I think some of these diamond shots are not our best, I'll be honest about it.
And, you know, you get the effect and then it goes...
Oh, that's a nice one, though.
-This is nice, when he's doing this.
-LAMBERT.:
The one on the side is amazing,
-the top shots...
-WEITZ.:
Yeah.
LAMBERT.:
We were just like, "If we'd had one more day before our deadline... "
WEITZ.:
Yeah, the top shots we dialed up too high, and I apologize to Susan MacLeod, our visual effects supervisor, for having done that.
You have to be very careful when these effects come in and then you start treating things in the DI, the digital intermediate, where you can change the lighting and color on things, and these effects are very fragile when you receive them,
and just one little tweak one way or the other can make them kind of buzz or can completely make them disappear.
Anyway, Bella has a terrible stomachache at this moment, and then who should appear but Laurent?
Well, of course, we did all this stuff, all this beautiful reshooting of this meadow, in order to then establish that it looked terrible and depressing and dead now.
So, the garden sequences from the first movie we reshot in this place in order to proliferate it with flowers and what not.
And here comes Edi Gathegi, very good man.
Not a Rastafarian, actually, that is also a wig.
And, again, the danger brings on the apparition of Edward.
One thing we should say about the apparition shots is that when we decided to do it,
I wanted them to be as subtle as possible and impose some kind of elegant metaphor on them, visual metaphor, so that they turned out a certain way.
And in this case, we used elements of a candle's flame moving very slowly, so that when he flickers, the bits of him that are opaque and the bits that are translucent
are mapped onto an image of a candle's flame.
So that is what is determining the kind of physics of how we're seeing him and not seeing him.
Now, Laurent, wearing what I like to call his vampire pimp outfit.
(BO TH LAUGHING)
'Cause I think that's what a vampire pimp would wear.
-LAMBERT.:
Totally.
-Yeah.
Here to inject a little fright into the proceedings.
Rather fun because, of course, we seem to remember him as a positive figure from the last one, where he was cooperative with the Cullens.
-LAMBERT.:
He's fickle.
-Yeah.
He is fickle.
Well, you can't depend on Laurent.
We're not gonna have to worry about him much anymore after this 'cause the wolves are gonna get him.
You'll notice that there was a little bit there where we changed Bella's eye line to represent it as though she were looking at someone far away and then at someone very close.
Another very simple in-camera way to show the vampires moving quickly without having to show them.
-WEITZ.: "I don't believe it. " -"I don't believe it. "
WEITZ.:
Here come the wolves.
So, here is Sam-wolf, and this went through hundreds of iterations to make him dark enough, to make him reflect the light in the right way, to make the wind move him enough, to make sure that when he breathed, it'd reflect the cold of the atmosphere.
And in this shot, he always reminds me of a friend of mine's, now passed away, Pomeranian.
(LAMBERT CHUCKLES)
LAMBERT.:
But not for long.
WEITZ.:
Okay, here's our first vampire speed shot.
Well, actually, we've seen little bits of it here.
I love this shot.
This is gorgeous.
That's a gorgeous little CGI shot with Bella reflected.
We took an element of Bella and mapped it onto an eye.
The iris was colored based upon Taylor's, and it all turned out lovely.
Here is Laurent ready to pimp slap a wolf.
LAMBERT.:
Great bit of sound work there from Scott Hecker and the sound guys.
WEITZ.:
Lovely stuff of the galloping wolves coming up.
And so now we're gonna...
You know, Bella has run away before she's seen the conclusion of this fight, so there's kind of a Laurent wolf fight Rashomon thing that's gonna go on.
Where she perceives it as impossible that the wolves could have killed Laurent.
Also notice Harry looking very antsy about the wolves having been discovered.
Not stoked.
LAMBERT.:
We notice it, but Charlie doesn't.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, Charlie, Charlie...
LAMBERT.:
He's the least perceptive policeman.
WEITZ.:
Super cop Charlie, not noticing these subtleties.
Okay, here's Bella's imagining, I love this shot, of what Laurent's gonna do to these guys, which is, you know, take them out.
LAMBERT.:
This was a kind of completely unscripted thing, wasn't it?
As I remember it, there was a weather issue when this stuff was being shot of Laurent running from the wolves with the visual effects guys.
-WEITZ.:
Correct.
-And they had a bit of extra time, and Edi said, "I would love to fight the wolves. "
So they shot a bunch of stuff, and then later in the edit we sort of...
-WEITZ.:
We added in some wolves.
-...just suddenly realized it would be really cool to drop it in in different places.
WEITZ.:
I mean, Edi basically said,
"Laurent would not go out like that, just running.
He would turn and fight. "
And so we ended up with this kind of cool stuff.
LAMBERT.:
And then, prudent actor that he is, he then gave a series of interviews where he told people that we were gonna see him being attacked by the wolves at the end of the movie, at which point we were pretty much tied into doing it,
and it works well.
WEITZ.:
So there's this lovely parkour moment or free running moment, where Jacob jumps up.
And that's really Taylor doing his own stunt.
He had a wire on him, but only to keep him from falling to his death, not to help him jump.
And the tree outside Bella's window was constructed specifically, it was made in order to allow for that gag.
And I always wanted to put a little music over this shot of the...
-LAMBERT.:
The evil Brady Bunch music?
-Yeah.
But it seemed a bit too much.
LAMBERT.:
Alexandre did write something for that.
WEITZ.:
He did.
LAMBERT.:
But we'd had music so recently that it was just a real push.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, it seemed like we were trying to push it too much.
But people sort of get it that Jacob is heartened by this view and the fact that she's actually got it hanging over her head when she sleeps is very touching to him.
And now they realize how much they have in common.
How they've both been trapped in this kind of web of supernatural terror,
I suppose, when he sees the bite
-that James inflicted on Bella.
-LAMBERT.:
Yes, yes.
Bella, do you remember when we walked on the beach at La Push?
WEITZ.:
Yeah, there's a rather touching moment now where Bella can't remember Jacob's side of the story.
He's trying to tell her, but she can only remember the Eddy part of it, the Ed part of it, the Edward part of it, rather.
I guess I understand why that's the only part you remember.
WEITZ.:
This is very sweet, the way he says that.
And then Bella says the most extraordinary thing, which is, "Let's run away. "
And I think it's allowable.
You know, you think she wouldn't say that, what with Ed and her mind the way it is, but she says it before she even realizes what she's saying.
And it's out of the deep, you know, friendship, the love that comes from friendship.
And I think she says it before she's realized she has.
-And then it kind of leads...
-LAMBERT.:
Then you see her, and she does a good job of then double-taking almost,
-as she realizes what she said.
-WEITZ.:
Yeah.
But I would run away with you
if I could.
WEITZ.:
This is another "Aw" moment for me.
-LAMBERT.:
Back in with the color.
-I think Alexandre's music is
-very lovely here, the way it comes back in.
-LAMBERT.:
Yeah, yeah.
WEITZ.:
Now we stay out in the two-shot here, rather than going to close-ups.
Why?
Because...
Well, because you can see the way that Bella's touching his back, you can see the way that she leans against his chest and you can guess at their emotions rather than seeing it in their faces.
I think there's something rather touching about that.
Uh-oh, nightmare coming.
LAMBERT.:
Again, no CG there.
He really jumped out of that window
-with a cable.
-WEITZ.:
He really jumped.
He really jumped on a cable.
He's very daring.
I would not do that.
LAMBERT.:
So the leaves that we keep coming back to, to represent nightmares,
I can't even remember where we found those in the dailies.
-WEITZ.:
But they were from...
-They became a kind of shorthand,
-didn't they?
-WEITZ.:
Yeah.
LAMBERT.:
You know what, they were from the actual...
They were outtakes from when Sam is carrying her.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, exactly.
They were the moment when the camera is sliding into position, but not quite there yet.
And, well, this dream is, of course, about Bella's realizing that Jacob is a wolf, somehow, although not fully viscerally realizing it, 'cause that's yet to come.
But she's starting to put the pieces together.
And in the book in fact, though, vis-a-vis the leaves, her nightmares are really about emptiness, I think.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah, they're about her being in the woods, aren't they?
WEITZ.:
Indeed they are.
Okay, I'm sorry, I really need to see him.
LAMBERT.:
This is great, this little set.
-So, then anytime you see...
-WEITZ.:
Yeah, fantastic set which functions for what, seven seconds.
But when the kids who are cast as the Quileutes came and saw it, they said "Wow, this is like... "
-LAMBERT.:
Were they?
Oh, that's good.
-"This is like it is on the rez. "
-Okay, what did you do?
-Hey.
-What did you do to him?
-Easy!
WEITZ.:
Now, Bella's getting a bit aggro here, but I love it, because she's defending her friend.
He tells me nothing because he's scared of you.
(SNlCKERlNG)
WEITZ.:
Oh, you're gonna get a smack.
(BO TH EXCLAIMING)
-WEITZ.:
Oh, no, you didn't.
-Face punch.
WEITZ.:
That was a face punch.
-LAMBERT.:
Actually it was a face slap.
-It was a face slap, yeah.
Well, it was slunch.
A plap.
Yeah, that was, you know, obviously a mistake on her part, because now he turned into a werewolf.
Run!
WEITZ.:
And here we're setting up this kind of hug moment, which doesn't happen.
I rather like setting it up as though they're going to embrace, and then over he goes.
And, of course, this would have been a great moment had it been seen first in the movie, but instead we showed it in the first trailer.
(BO TH LAUGHING)
LAMBERT.:
And then again in the second and third and several other trailers.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, so that everybody knew.
LAMBERT.:
But probably if you looked at each of those trailers now, you could see the development of the wolf from one to another, 'cause it's definitely different now than at the start.
WEITZ.:
Definitely that shot went through 550 something different versions.
And each time, as you progress, the musculature moves differently, the fur behaves differently, the wind goes through the fur.
And here I played a little trick where the camera gets knocked over by the wolves, and you sort of hardly notice it, but it was to sort of lend a little extra credibility to the moment.
I suppose it's a bit of a joke, too, an in-joke to oneself.
Of course the wolves are not real and they wouldn't knock over a camera ever, but it's as though it's a camera standing there on a tripod and the wolves knock it over.
Now that sound they just made... (MIMICKS SOUND) ...is actually a Quileute thing, and it's actually at a higher pitch than I can do with my voice, but it's the kind of thing that young Quileute dudes do to say hey to each other.
Oh, hey, about Emily, Sam's fiancee?
Don't stare. lt bugs Sam.
Why would I stare?
Are you guys hungry?
Like I have to ask.
(emily laughing)
Who's this?
JARED:
Bella Swan
WEITZ.:
This is Tinsel Korey, who does a lovely job as Emily.
LAMBERT.:
She's about to call Bella "Muffin, "
as was always our joke in the cutting rooms.
-Or has she done it already?
-WEITZ.:
Nope.
She's going to, and we always laughed.
-We snickered like a couple of school girls.
-LAMBERT.:
Oh, how we laughed.
WEITZ.:
Now, of course she's really offering Bella a muffin, but we thought it almost seemed like she was calling her muffin, and that was the funniest thing we'd ever heard in our lives.
LAMBERT.: (LAUGHING) I still laugh thinking about it now.
You've got to understand that we spent a lot of hours in the cutting rooms on this movie.
WEITZ.:
Yeah.
We go a little crazy in a dark room looking at footage again and again.
Would you shut up?
These are trade secrets.
Damn it!
LAMBERT.:
Bella makes a little joke here.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, she tries to be funny, "You can't run with vampires. "
Emily gets it.
The other kids don't.
Now this is a beautiful decoration job done by the production design team, set decoration team, because this was a kind of abandoned little shed that was turned into this lovely,
you know, homey, sort of fairy tale little cottage.
And here it was very important to me that we see that Bella can't look, but it's not because of the scar.
It's because Sam and Emily are in love and are together.
Sorry.
WEITZ.:
I love that little moment.
That was an ad-lib by Alex, very, very funny.
Now they have the werewolf talk.
LAMBERT.:
First day of shooting was this, the wolf talk?
WEITZ.:
Yeah, this was the first day of shooting on Vancouver Island.
Those were skip dissolves where you maintain exactly the same frame but you position and dissolve the actors into different places.
LAMBERT.:
If we hadn't dissolved, they would be jump cuts.
-WEITZ.:
They would be.
But they're not.
-To continue the lesson, yeah.
WEITZ.:
Or it would have been an extraordinarily long shot.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah.
Okay, yeah.
WEITZ.:
So, yes, this is our very first day, and while we were shooting this scene...
We shot this scene and the beach rescue scene on the same day.
And during the time that we were shooting this scene, there was this overcast, there was direct sunshine, there was hail, unbelievably, there was hail, and I just thought, what more can Mother Nature throw at us
to mess up our shooting day?
But somehow we managed.
You know, the shot back towards Jacob was actually much more sunny, and what we did was take the blue from the sky and desaturate it, so that it's gray, which matches with the look back at Bella,
and it all kind of matches together.
Now we're gonna find out what really happened to Laurent.
-The one thing we do kill, Rastafarians.
-LAMBERT.:
Rastafarians.
(BO TH LAUGHING)
Wait, Jake, you can't.
Don't worry.
We can't touch your little precious Cullens...
WEITZ.:
A little reference to the treaty and then we'll see Laurent getting ripped up.
LAMBERT.:
I think the flash of Laurent was really also a useful way of us cutting some unnecessary dialogue out of this scene, wasn't it?
We used it as a way to skip around a bit.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, well, there is a bit where
Bella thinks for quite a long time that Jacob is responsible for all the deaths that have been occurring, having just encountered Laurent.
So I think that it was better to move on quickly to the fact that
Laurent is the murderer in question.
The butler did it.
And now, this is just pushing in on Jacob.
He's mad.
Now he's got it in for Victoria big time.
So that shot, rather nicely opened with Bella alone before we rejoined Jacob, so it had a sense of her vulnerability before he shows up.
And now this great Thom Yorke...
Oh, wait, okay, here's another mistake by Jacob.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah, yeah, go inside.
Unbelievable.
WEITZ.: "Come in for a cup of tea, Jacob. "
Have some tea before you go off chasing vampires.
See what happens.
Something might happen.
Look, she wants you to hang around.
Don't go.
-Oh, he's gone.
-LAMBERT.:
He's got a vampire to kill.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, I know, but I mean, it can wait 10 minutes.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah, I'd let Sam do that.
Let Sam take that on.
WEITZ.:
I know, she's like, "Why did he just...
All right. "
BELLA.:
Until I'm alone.
-LAMBERT.:
This track is great.
-This track is great.
This shot is very nicely done by Javier Aguirresarobe, because it doesn't just go from dark to light, it goes through the different color temperatures that it would go through.
And she's trying to imagine Edward but can't, and there are happy couples all around.
And so this song from Thom Yorke came in, and it was a surprising song, because it was kind of a bit techno, and yet it had a tremendous amount of soul, but it also had a beat,
and weirdly, it just fit perfectly into this kind of action sequence.
LAMBERT.:
As our temporary music score, we'd had much more kind of conventional action-y music under the whole wolf-chasing-Victoria sequence.
And then we put this on, and it turned it into something a bit more dreamy
-and strange.
And lovely, yeah.
-WEITZ.:
And weird, yeah.
LAMBERT.:
And the whole sentiment of the lyrics if you pick it up being,
"You can do no wrong in my eyes, "
seems very appropriate for everything that's going on.
WEITZ.: 'Cause this sequence, you know, really is about
Jacob protecting Bella.
LAMBERT.:
And meanwhile Bella trying to get Edward.
WEITZ.:
Bella seeking Edward.
LAMBERT.:
And Victoria mourning James.
WEITZ.:
Victoria mourning James.
-And then...
-LAMBERT.:
Yeah, and of course, poor Charlie's love for Harry.
WEITZ.:
Charlie's friend dying, which is Vsad.
LAMBERT.: (LAUGHS) Vsad.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make light.
-WEITZ.:
Yeah, don't laugh.
-I'm sorry.
WEITZ.:
All right, so here's Jacob.
He's had enough of this red-haired chick.
Okay, there's the shot that's too cool for school for me.
You know, I always like CGI shots to not be too cool.
LAMBERT.:
What was that shot?
Sorry?
WEITZ.:
The first shot where Jacob-wolf is charging towards Victoria...
LAMBERT.:
And it goes in slow mo.
WEITZ.:
And there's some distortion and slow mo.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah.
WEITZ.:
But it is beautiful.
That's the very first shot of the movie that we're looking at right now.
The very first shot that we took on Vancouver Island.
Love this shot because you show how she's moving so much faster than the crow who's just moving backwards in the screen.
Here comes Victoria running towards us, camera drops down.
I should say, I didn't film any of this shot.
This is all Phil Neilson, our amazing second unit director, and all this stunt-y stuff, all the great stuff is done by someone other than me.
But...
LAMBERT.:
We should talk about the vampire speed effect, 'cause that was a kind of a last-minute addition, really, wasn't it?
WEITZ.:
Yeah.
LAMBERT.:
We always planned that we would never make the vampires run any faster than, effectively, as if they'd been shot at 24 frames per second.
-WEITZ.:
Right.
-So in other words, faster than a human being would run, we would only go slower
-and go into slow motion.
-WEITZ.:
Right.
LAMBERT.:
But we suddenly realized that we could, well, we couldn't, but the visual effects guys could do these cool little effects
-to sort of shoot them forward.
-WEITZ.:
Yeah.
LAMBERT.:
And suddenly they did it once, and we were like, "That's cool, "
and then Susan MacLeod, the visual effects supervisor, kept pushing.
And then suddenly it was everywhere.
WEITZ.:
Her jumping off the cliff.
Yeah, at first, the technique was to slow them down in order show them going faster.
We would only shoot them in slow mo, as it were.
And then we saw some kind of time-space distortion effects that conveyed the idea of someone going so quickly that the space around them was kind of warped, which worked rather nicely.
And here's just the really perverse moment where Bella is doing something extraordinarily dangerous and near suicidal, just to get another taste of Edward's presence.
LAMBERT.:
It's kind of interesting the music choice that ended up for the score here, as well.
'Cause I always thought this would be kind of a big adrenaline-y thing of her at the top of the cliff.
And then Alexandre wrote this really lush, romantic music, the kind of music of longing, which comes up every now and again in the movie, and, again, it changes, it transforms it into something kind of romantic and beautiful.
WEITZ.:
Right.
Yeah, very weird stuff happening here.
Okay, so, now we're in a swimming pool in Vancouver.
And anything that you see which doesn't look like a swimming pool in Vancouver is added with CGI.
So, the color of the water, those waves in the background, CGI.
That cliff there, CGI.
This wave, CGI.
This is real, because poor Kristen, with a cold, was slammed with hundreds of gallons of water, producing these beautiful kind of bubble effects that are going on.
But this, however is Rachelle Lefevre swimming in a swimming pool in Vancouver.
But with all the water around her turned into what looks like murky, cliff side water.
And now we go into sort of a dream state where she's close to death.
She's close to drowning and...
LAMBERT.:
This again was Kristen and Rob with weights in their pockets, wasn't it?
-WEITZ.:
Yes.
-Just dragging them down.
WEITZ.:
Although, Rob actually did sit at the bottom of the pool.
-LAMBERT.:
That's right.
-We filmed them separately.
-LAMBERT.:
Someone had to hold him down.
-Rob was at the bottom of the pool with weights in his pockets.
And then Kristen was feeling a bit worried about that, so I said, "Oh, that's no big deal, come on, "
and I got into the pool with some weights on me, went to the bottom of the pool and started panicking immediately.
And so I thought, "Okay, I'm not gonna make Kristen do this. "
So we actually filmed her laterally, sideways, but of course, you know, when you can't tell the background, you don't know.
So she looks like she's floating downwards, Edward's floating upwards, and since he was shot separately, we could dissolve him in that manner.
And that beautiful Grizzly Bear track keeps on going at a very, very, very, very subtle level until she wakes up, so even when she's on the beach there.
And this again was what we shot that first day, when I was saying that we had all this kind of crazy, crazy weather, and was the beginning of the torture that I was inflicting on our actors.
Because, there's poor Taylor, on Vancouver Island, it is cold, it is cold, cold, cold, and they're wet down.
And now here's the hardest line to say in the movie.
"Harry Clearwater had a heart attack. " Four H's in very quick succession.
LAMBERT.:
It was good that the Clearwater was put in there, 'cause I think originally it was, "Harry had a heart attack. "
WEITZ.:
Harry had a heart attack.
LAMBERT.:
It sounded like a kind of ABC primer.
WEITZ.:
Actually, it sounds like sort of a band that plays at your prom or something.
Come on. I'll get you something dry and drive you home.
WEITZ.:
Anyway.
A beautiful beach.
LAMBERT.:
A little outtake there, that wide shot of him, lifting her up.
WEITZ.:
Outtake.
It wasn't.
It was after we had said cut, wasn't it?
LAMBERT.:
Yeah, it was indeed, yeah.
WEITZ.:
Okay, again, we're shooting in a barn on a green screen, but, you know, CG is able to put in this lovely road, and the beautiful kind of sense of shadow of these trees above them
and passing over them and the opacity of them and the translucence of them.
It's a Jacob thing.
You're just warm.
You're like your own sun.
LAMBERT.:
I always think it sounds like she says, "You like your own son. "
WEITZ.:
Oh, right.
LAMBERT.:
Which is ironic 'cause he's gonna end up liking her daughter.
WEITZ.:
Well, I thought it was even more confusing, "You are like your own son, "
which would be deeply, deeply confusing.
LAMBERT.:
Okay, yeah.
Is that compliment?
You saw what happened to Emily.
-WEITZ.:
Now we deal with...
-Now, we're not in a barn.
-Now we're in real.
-WEITZ.:
No, this is real.
This is real, and we are shooting, you know, one single long take of the two of them together, as Jacob kind of explains his fears
of hurting her really.
And there were several takes to choose from here, and it was really about choosing the near kiss that was
I suppose the most tortuous, really, and one in which it didn't seem like she was suddenly saying talk to the hand.
But where you could tell in her thought processes that this was a possibility for her.
And, in the book, I believe Edward pops up over Jacob's shoulder and says, "Be happy. "
-LAMBERT.: "Be happy. " -"Be happy. "
Thereby totally spoiling the moment in a kind of passive aggressive apparition sort of way.
But here it's just sort of Bella recalling herself from this moment of intense gratitude of emotionalism and of deep, deep friendship, which almost pulls her into Jacob's orbit.
Now Jake's making the right move here for once in his life.
Still doesn't work, though.
Close, no.
No cigar.
That little micro movement there by Bella, that says, no, no, thanks.
LAMBERT.:
II think we put a little sound, a kind of...sound.
I don't know if that can be picked up
-on the microphone.
-WEITZ.:
Yeah.
LAMBERT.:
Which actually, amazingly, is Taylor making that noise, but we shifted it so it sounded like it was Bella as a kind of...
-WEITZ.:
Oh, how creepy.
-A little rejection sound.
WEITZ.:
This look here, before he says there's a vampire, almost looks like Bella is saying, "Wow, he's actually gonna go for it. "
LAMBERT.:
Yeah, yeah, it's cool.
WEITZ.:
It's kind of a cool, confusing moment.
There's Carlisle's car.
Now here, this is kind of an interesting moment, where he actually hurts her.
He grabs her so hard that he hurts her, and it's kind of this little reminder of the moment earlier where he said that he's a bit afraid of the danger that he might pose to her.
LAMBERT.:
Amazingly, coincidentally, he grabs her in roughly the place where I believe a bruise ends up on Kristen's arm, which you can see later in the movie, in Italy, which actually came from her running into the fountain.
WEITZ.:
Yes, we'll talk about that later.
-That's a good one.
-LAMBERT.:
That will be a fun one.
WEITZ.:
You can actually hear Alice give a little "huh" of surprise when Bella is surprised, which I find kind of charming, which we had to position very carefully when it came to doing the sound.
Now, there are moments where they're just about to talk about Edward but they don't, here,
which is probably very frustrating to the audience, but don't want to get them to quite talking about him yet.
I was cliff jumping.
Recreationally.
It was fun.
(EXHALES) I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy.
Does...
Did you tell him?
No.
He only calls in once every few months.
He said he wants to be alone.
Bella, what is that God-awful wet dog smell?
Um...
That's probably me.
WEITZ.:
There's a lovely look that we kind of cheated in there, where Bella looks just so terribly defeated at the mention of Edward.
And it's like when, you know, someone has broken your heart and their name comes up, and there's just nothing to do about it.
And here, to me, is a really nice moment where this theme comes in, and so she's just been slammed again with the fact of Edward's seeming non-interest in her, and here comes Jacob,
who, against the treaty, against all odds, is still coming back for her, which to me, justifies the moment that we're about to have in the kitchen.
I'm talking about the other bloodsucker who tried to kill Bella because of you.
Victoria?
Yeah, Victoria's been around.
I didn't see her.
LAMBERT.:
This always, for me, kind of puts paid to Edward's theory that he was going away to protect her.
It's like, he really should have picked up on the fact that Victoria was in town, rather than going to South America to hunt her.
WEITZ.:
Yeah.
Well, not a great decision by Edward.
-LAMBERT.:
Bad decision.
-Not one of the great decisions of all time, let's be honest.
But without that, we wouldn't have a movie, really.
LAMBERT.:
Good point, yeah, okay, yeah, fair enough.
WEITZ.:
So, thank you, Edward.
And I think in a weird way...
That's part of the reason that Romeo and Juliet sort of plays a big function in this movie, because in Romeo and Juliet, there are just a bunch of horrible mistakes that people make.
-LAMBERT.:
Yeah, yeah.
-And misunderstandings, which could be rectified in about 10 seconds or by just waiting for just a minute.
And yet things go awfully, terribly wrong.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah.
WEITZ.:
And that Edward is very kind of snooty about Romeo at the beginning of the movie, just saying how stupid he was, and yet he does exactly the same thing.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah.
And she can stay as long as she'd like.
WEITZ.:
Bella's kind of annoyed at Jake now, 'cause it seems like all Jacob cares about is the Cullens.
She hasn't quite twigged to the fact that he's just threatened by the possibility of Edward coming.
Anything else?
WEITZ.:
All right, Jacob's both about to make his best move in the movie and his worst.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah.
Well, if that's all, then you'd better go run back to Sam.
LAMBERT.:
This is exactly the same little sting, musically here, that we heard when Jacob comes in.
It's like he's picking it back up again,
-and then it develops.
-WEITZ.:
Now,
I think that her annoyance here, you can interpret it any way you like, but part of it is her annoyance at Jake for not giving himself enough credit in her life, in a weird way,
and being more of a werewolf than a suitor.
Okay, now, he's about to say something...
LAMBERT.:
Yeah, are you gonna tell people what he's saying?
-WEITZ.:
No.
-Okay, good.
WEITZ.:
But I will tell you that it is genuine Quileute, a language spoken fluently by only a few people in the world.
LAMBERT.:
And we hope that they've told us the correct translation of what we wanted them to say.
'Cause otherwise he might be saying something terrible.
WEITZ.:
So somewhere in the background, I am controlling the telephone.
Don't answer the phone, Jacob.
You idiot.
Okay.
-LAMBERT.:
So, that ring, actually, you timed.
-Yeah.
LAMBERT.:
So you could decide how long to let them nearly kiss.
WEITZ.:
Well, that ring was on a two second delay, so I had to decide, actually...
-LAMBERT.:
Two seconds beforehand.
-...two seconds beforehand
-how close their lips would be.
-LAMBERT.:
Wow.
WEITZ.:
And they just, just, just, just touch or appear to touch.
LAMBERT.:
People think directing is easy,
-but when you hear stories like that...
-WEITZ.:
No, it's not easy.
It's not easy.
It's very stressful.
Edward, a mistake by him, too, destroying his cell phone.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah, they could have just done
-the reverse call thing.
-WEITZ.:
Instead of calling back.
-Yeah.
-LAMBERT.:
Otherwise, couldn't they?
She could have just done whatever the American equivalent of 147 1 is, yeah.
-It's star 69, and she doesn't do that.
-LAMBERT.:
Not that.
-Yeah.
-WEITZ.:
Yeah.
LAMBERT.:
She probably did do it, but in the sort of time transition
-that we cut around...
-WEITZ.:
Yeah, we don't see that.
LAMBERT.:
But he'd smashed the phone by then.
-She would have got voicemail.
-WEITZ.:
Yeah, yeah.
"Hi, this is Edward Cullen.
I'm away from the phone at the moment
"or I've crushed it in despair. "
(LAMBERT LAUGHING)
Okay, here comes another whip pan.
(WEITZ CHUCKLES)
The old whip pan, my fave.
Notice that Bella has a passport.
We just wanna make sure that you know that.
-LAMBERT.:
Wow, I never even noticed that.
-Yeah.
LAMBERT.:
Where's she got her passport?
-WEITZ.:
In her hand.
-Oh, okay.
WEITZ.:
You mean, where'd she get it?
I don't know.
LAMBERT.:
No, no.
Where is it?
I can't see the shot.
WEITZ.:
In Seattle.
LAMBERT.:
I don't know why I didn't notice it before.
WEITZ.: (EXCLAIMS) Jacob takes a pounding again.
How much emotional letdown can this kid take?
And I just realized, watching this at the premiere, when he says,
"I'm begging you, " he's in the position of a dog and he's begging like a dog.
(BO TH LAUGHING)
Which I suppose is either funny or sad.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah.
-WEITZ.:
And I rather like the look that...
-Alice gives.
WEITZ.:
That Alice gives when Jacob first reaches in, which is like "Girlfriend, what is he doing?"
Anyway, transition shot to this plane.
Let's just get them to Italy quickly, shall we?
It was kind of the idea, 'cause we didn't really want to see them in the waiting lounge at Seattle Sea-Tac airport and doing duty free shopping and all that kind of stuff.
LAMBERT.:
Alice playing Tetris on her phone while they wait.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, let's just get them there.
And the beloved yellow Porsche.
And here we are with the Volturi.
LAMBERT.:
We only added this scene back into the movie at the last minute.
Amazingly, we were stupid enough to cut it out
-for a long time, weren't we?
-WEITZ.:
Yeah, we did think for a while that we shouldn't see Edward until Bella sees him and that we didn't want any back-at-the-ranch scenes.
But this was a good way to break up the rush, the headlong rush.
And so now, when Bella first encounters Aro, we know a bit more about him.
He isn't just some weirdo who pops up.
LAMBERT.:
I like the way you introduce the Volturi so gradually throughout the movie.
And not just them as their characters, but also the set.
The way, both in the first flashback in the painting and in this scene, you don't really get a sense of the scale of the set.
Such a waste.
WEITZ.:
But in the movie, we very...
LAMBERT.:
But I don't think anyone was doing it,
-to be honest.
-WEITZ.:
We very carefully...
No, people don't use the Internet.
We very carefully rationed out what bits of that set that we would see and in what degree of elimination, so that when you finally saw it, it was like, "Wow, this is really something. "
He's gonna make a scene.
Show himself to the humans.
LAMBERT.:
This was a great moment of genius on your part, throwing in this little vision.
WEITZ.:
Oh, was it?
Thank you.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah, it was you.
You thought of it.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, we cheated a little vision there.
Well, now...
Ashley used her hands on the steering wheel quite well, and then someone told me that it looked like she wasn't driving.
And then I told her to move it more, which then became a bit looking as though she was Toonces, the driving cat,
making it very hard to composite in the background.
LAMBERT.:
You'll notice that that sequence is cut very fast, mostly in singles, because we're trying to avoid it being on her and the road long enough, to see that the road does not match her movements.
WEITZ.:
Now, there's the famous bruise which we say was made by Jacob grabbing her.
-LAMBERT.:
Is it on the same arm?
-These are real Italian cops acting, actually, relatively unconcerned given the speed at which...
LAMBERT.:
Did they know that they were being filmed?
-WEITZ.:
They did.
They did, yes.
-They were just doing their job.
WEITZ.:
Just doing their job.
Okay, notice now that we actually, throughout this movie, saved the color red for use here, so that now you've suddenly got this sense of blood and danger.
We really rarely, rarely, rarely used red.
There was kind of a prohibition against red throughout the film, until this point.
And here we are in Italy, of course, by the way.
Having finished in Vancouver, we flew to Italy for a week's work, four days of shooting, two days of prep.
And voila.
(WEITZ SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
And about a thousand extras, and this thing which is called a palanchino, that saint's processional, palanquin thing.
And you'll see that that's a vampire being chained by a golden saint, which accords with what's talked about in the book, and here we're going in and out of various speeds to get Bella to that moment.
That's where she scratched her arm, and voila, noon.
Now, very difficult to shoot, over the course of several days, a shot which is supposed to take place at exactly noon.
You have to be careful to plan your camera angles, so that it falls just at the right time.
And poor Peter wasn't here for the Italian part of the shoot.
LAMBERT.:
I was in LA having a great time.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, well, I was eating pasta at the Relais San Bruno, buddy, with homemade mozzarella.
-LAMBERT.:
That sounds good, though.
-Yeah.
LAMBERT.:
I can go to Italy whenever I want.
-I'm English.
It's just around the corner.
-WEITZ.:
That's true.
-LAMBERT.:
LA was more exciting to me.
-It's a two hour drive.
Now these are the beautiful diamond effects, and now why is this little kid suddenly interested.
I wanted to give some sense of threat that somebody had noticed but that they wouldn't ever be believed, so that we were constantly kind of riding the line between the possibility of being noticed or not.
I thought it would be odd if you see him and then nobody's looking at him.
But then we had this sweet little girl who just couldn't stop smiling 'cause she was so happy to be in the movie.
We tried to make her look surprised or amazed, but all she could just do is smile.
Sweet little Italian girl.
I rather love this scene.
LAMBERT.:
Unfortunately, she will now, of course, have to be assassinated by the Volturi, having seen this.
WEITZ.:
Now, the colors here, you know, certainly if you compare this to the first movie, golds, gold, gold and red.
And, well, I don't know, I mean, it's just a lovely little intimate scene.
And this is actually played out in the city hall of Montepulciano,
-while business was being conducted.
-LAMBERT.:
Really?
WEITZ.:
Yeah, in between shots, there are guys rushing around with papers to Xerox and things.
And they're doing this incredibly emotional scene.
And also, between every shot, Kristen would run...
-LAMBERT.:
Kristen would run around.
-...up and down the corridor in order to get as out of breath as she would have been having just arrived.
We did some work on this dialogue.
I do love that she just says she's human, she's nothing, which I think we all sort of feel, at certain points, in relationships, when we've been missing someone or lacking someone.
"I'm nothing.
I'm human. "
And, of course, that's what's most important to him.
LAMBERT.:
Epic, epic kissing here.
-WEITZ.:
Yeah.
Yeah.
-Epic snog.
WEITZ.:
Epic snogage with dissolve, snog dissolve, and also Alexandre hitting his strings at the highest.
Now, those guys were actually wearing hoods, which was supposed to keep them out of the sunlight, but actually just looks like they scratched their heads in concert as they come in.
LAMBERT.:
I think it looks like they're doing sort of teapot impressions when they walk in.
Bella, why don't you go and enjoy the rest of the festival?
The girl comes with us.
WEITZ.:
The very large, intimidating, but extraordinarily sweet Daniel Cudmore.
-6'8".
-LAMBERT.:
He's a big man.
WEITZ.:
All Canadian, all nice guy, actually.
And here comes Dakota, who the moment she walks onto the screen, it's just pow.
You know, the camera's fascinated with her.
She's absolutely brilliant, and her crazy praying mantis eyes, and there's just a nice moment where Bella's like,
"Why the heck are we following this chick?"
And the only explanation is Jane's power, really.
And this is like, "Put some clothes on for God's sake. "
Now then you see the little popping of diamond on him and Ashley, explaining why, because in between that shot and this shot where they're walking down the stairs, they will have popped in the sun, the diamond effect.
And there's Dakota snickering at the idea that Edward would not be afraid.
So now here, when they walk into the...
This is sort of a series of transitions from sort of what you expect of Dracula's castle to something more modern, dark to light, menacing to clinical, and there's this music from Die Fladermaus, which, of course, means "the bat, " playing in the elevator.
And at first I thought it was a bit of a risky, cheeky thing to do, but then Stephenie Meyer said, "I love the vampire elevator music.
"Can we have more of it?"
So, then we see the sort of strange office-like environment and a human.
LAMBERT.:
I love the fact that it's got computer drives in it, that office.
WEITZ.:
Oh, yeah, it's got a couple of servers there, so the Volturi keep track of,
I don't know what they do, the vampire population or something.
LAMBERT.:
There's like a vampire whose special skill is databasing, in the background.
WEITZ.:
He's the world's best system administrator.
LAMBERT.:
He was good at databasing as a human being.
As a vampire, he's amazing.
(BO TH LAUGHING)
WEITZ.:
And here is the set.
Gorgeous, gorgeous set designed by David Brisbin, with his architectural background, and here is wonderful Michael Sheen, and this shot, I just love.
Right here, this is a painting, you know.
I happen to despise smoke, which cinematographers use to layer diffusion into the background, right.
It puts things out of focus in a progressive fashion.
But Javier used smoke here in order to kind of give a sense of depth to the background, and it gives a kind of a softness to the background while in the front it's rather crisp.
LAMBERT.:
And it doesn't feel like smoke, I don't think.
WEITZ.:
No, it doesn't.
LAMBERT.:
I don't think it feels like atmosphere
-in the way you thought it was gonna.
-WEITZ.:
It doesn't.
Yeah.
So get on with it.
WEITZ.:
Now, I talked with Michael Sheen about Aro before doing this.
And I said, "Well, I think, you know,
"after about 2,000 years, you'd start to go kind of crazy. "
And so he plays him sort of like a mad man.
I mean he is both intrigued by this relationship between Edward and Bella and has this kind of vicarious pleasure in them, but is, at the same time, ready to kill them at any moment.
And it's kind of one of the great mad villain portrayals since Hannibal Lecter I think.
And at this point in the movie...
Jamie Campbell Bower, Christopher Heyerdahl, brilliant.
LAMBERT.:
Not naked.
WEITZ.:
Not naked, as you can see.
Proof positive.
LAMBERT.: "In not-naked shocker!"
(WEITZ LAUGHING)
WEITZ.:
So, what the heck was I saying?
LAMBERT.:
You were talking about Michael Sheen being Hannibal.
WEITZ.:
Oh, yeah.
I just love these looks that he's giving.
There's so much going on in his eyes and in his expression.
And, you know, he's really quite kind of sadistic, really.
But to him, he's not really doing that much harm.
Here's evil little Dakota Fanning showing her true self.
No.
Actually, she's a delightful young lady.
Not at all like Jane, but I think she enjoyed playing that part.
LAMBERT.:
Rob was on a cable, wasn't he, for this?
WEITZ.:
Yeah, Rob was on a cable, which kind of kept him suspended, as though his whole body had gone so rigid that he was standing in this unnatural position before he dropped to the ground.
And I love the way that the sound effects here end just as she blinks.
Wonderful job by Scott Hecker and his guys, again.
Go ahead, my dear.
WEITZ.:
And lovely just reading Dakota's face here as she realizes that her powers are just not happening.
LAMBERT.:
Kristen's very good in this, as well.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, like, yeah, "What the H?"
LAMBERT.:
Sort of, she's taking her on, in a way and then...
WEITZ.:
Yeah, there's some defiance there.
And Michael says he was channeling the Blue Meanies from Yellow Submarine, but I think it's rather important that we get to the point in this movie and then something really strange and new happens, but which still somehow fits into the context of the rest of the film,
but, you know, kind of reboots the entire story at this point.
That's true.
WEITZ.:
Now, I worked on a bit that's coming up here.
Oh, no, it's later.
No, it's coming up later.
Okay, so, big fight scene, yeah.
We use everything that we've learned, up to this point.
We use high speed, we use sound effects of stones smashing together.
LAMBERT.:
We used some whip pans, I'm gonna mention that.
-WEITZ.:
Some whip pans.
-Yeah, for Alice, I think.
WEITZ.:
CG crack on Edward's face, vampire speed, the whole nine yards, really.
Wire work in which somebody's thrown on a wire but the wire is later removed, like there, boom.
The old Styrofoam table gag.
CG dome up there, on top of the set.
LAMBERT.:
I think the...
Almost the most exciting thing about this sequence is the fact that there's no music and just this amazing sound.
-WEITZ.:
Right.
-Which becomes kind of...
It's so percussive that it almost becomes like a soundtrack.
WEITZ.:
Right.
LAMBERT.:
It's quite an unusual choice I think, in a way, in that very often you would have big music over this kind of thing.
WEITZ.:
Right.
LAMBERT.:
And it becomes a bit more sadistic and sort of real in a way when you don't play music underneath.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, you do get sort of vicariously involved.
Now, I love this look that Michael gives as he's coming down.
He's utterly confused by the willingness of a human to give their life up, and fascinated by her.
You would give up your life...
WEITZ.:
This bit of dialogue, we worked on, and it means a lot to me that Bella says, and this is just a big F you to Aro and to all the Volturi,
"You don't know a thing about his soul. "
Because they'd been talking about the soul earlier.
You don't know a thing about his soul.
WEITZ.:
And I think when you love someone, that's what you believe, that you know about their soul more than anyone else does.
That kind of sums up the movie for me, or her feelings for him, for me.
Makes you understand why she's obsessed with him.
It's not just about the surface of it.
And here was a cheat, where we went for the traditional vampire-about-to-bite-someone-on-the-neck thing, rather than, as Stephenie called it, the vampire high five attack, which Laurent employs, where the vampire holds up his hand in readiness
to slash someone's throat.
And here's the moment, interestingly, which provokes the only moment, or at least when I saw it at the premiere, the only moment of unintentional laughter.
-LAMBERT.:
Yeah.
-And I entirely blame Rob.
(LAMBERT LAUGHING)
-LAMBERT.:
Why'd you blame Rob?
-'Cause I think he runs like a girl.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah.
I think it's hard to run in slow motion without looking a bit like a girl, unless, as your assistant, Dave Roker, said, you are Sylvester Stallone, in which case you can pull it off.
WEITZ.:
We should have used Sylvester Stallone for that moment.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah, you're right.
Yeah.
WEITZ.:
Well, hold on, Chariots of Fire, they're running in slow motion the whole time.
-LAMBERT.:
Good point, good point.
Yeah.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
-LAMBERT.:
They did look a bit like girls.
-Oh, all right, good point.
Anyways.
Yes, so Aro discovers that she'll be turned into a vampire.
Let us be done with this.
-LAMBERT.:
This guy is great, by the way.
-He just gives so much.
So much.
LAMBERT.:
My hope is that his line, "Not without cause"
from the earlier scene will actually become a catch phrase which people will have on T-shirts with pictures of his face, after this movie.
WEITZ.:
Yeah.
Or like it'll become a meme on the Internet.
-"Not without cause. "
-LAMBERT.: "Cause. "
WEITZ.:
And when we first shot it, we just loved that line so much, that we'd make up things like, "Have you ever met a cat?"
"Not without paws. "
LAMBERT.:
Again, that's the kind of comedy which takes place in the New Moon cutting rooms.
WEITZ.:
That is the kind of hilarity which goes on.
That was an all too brief shot of Noot Seear, the lovely Canadian model, now actress, who plays Heidi, the girl who was sent out to fish for tourists for the vampires to go and eat.
Now this scene, for a while, we called the schnozberry scene, because it was...
Let me see, how to explain?
-LAMBERT.:
I can explain this.
-Okay, please explain it.
LAMBERT.:
So, when your film has been shot, it gets rushed to a laboratory where they do a very quick version of it, which you can edit on your computer at a sort of not-perfect resolution just so that you can get to work on it straight away.
And they have to make their own quick decisions based purely on some notes from the camera department as to how to color them.
And this was the one occasion where it didn't quite work perfectly.
And due to sort of an accident based on the pillow being lilac colored, the entire scene came out very blue.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, because the guy who was coloring it thought that that lilac pillow in back of her head was white.
So he thought that everything white was supposed to go lilac.
And suddenly this scene looked like they'd all been eating schnozberries, from, you know, that movie...
LAMBERT.:
Willie Wonka's Chocolate Factory.
WEITZ.:
I think we're not supposed to say the name of movies.
-And so...
-LAMBERT.:
It's a book.
It's a book.
WEITZ.:
Okay, well, whatever.
Anyway, everyone looked like they'd been eating schnozberries.
All right, too many blueberries.
LAMBERT.:
We called it the blueberry scene for a long time.
-WEITZ.:
The blueberry scene.
All right, yeah.
-Yeah.
-Anyway, it was soon rectified.
-WEITZ.:
Yeah.
And I hope that people don't think that Edward is now hiding in a cowering fashion underneath the bed so that Charlie can't see him.
That's what I suddenly thought when he opened the door there.
'Cause that would be a very undignified thing for a vampire to do.
LAMBERT.:
No, I think people have got used to the fact that he can sort of jump out of windows
-and dart around wherever.
-WEITZ.:
Right.
Right.
LAMBERT.:
I think he's actually on the ceiling.
If the camera just tilted up, you'd find him, just hanging there like a beetle.
WEITZ.:
Like a ninja.
Okay.
LAMBERT.:
Just like a bead of sweat's gonna drop down and Charlie'll be on to him.
WEITZ.:
Now, that, I think, was from the first film, that wolf painting, I assume.
But it's funny because it's as though you see Jacob, and then you see Edward.
Now here is where most fans of the books will be expecting the proposal.
But in an act of sadism,
I kept Edward from proposing here.
LAMBERT.:
When you got him to kneel down, was that on your mind?
Did you think, "People will think he's definitely gonna propose now?"
Or was that just a happy accident.
-You can tell the truth.
-WEITZ.:
A happy accident.
LAMBERT.:
It was probably your subconscious instinct was saying,
"Make him kneel down, "
'cause part of you knew.
WEITZ.:
Yes, it did.
I think so.
I think you're right.
LAMBERT.:
The mark of a true genius.
WEITZ.:
It is, when you don't even know what you're doing.
And for a bit, I didn't have a kiss here, but Gillian Bohrer at the studio insisted that they kiss.
Once you say something as romantic as, "I can't live without you, "
-you have to kiss.
-LAMBERT.:
Yeah.
-WEITZ.:
Yeah.
-She was right.
WEITZ.:
She was.
Yeah, she was right.
She was right.
Okay, so, why Edward keeps on insisting that she not turn into a vampire is a matter of much frustration to me, but anyway, he's again trying to get along without turning her into a vampire,
and now he's made her angry.
Now she's like, "All right, let's... "
Well, actually it's not like he wakes them up.
They're awake anyway.
-They're sort of hanging out, I guess.
-LAMBERT.:
Yeah.
They've been in the pool outside, which you can see through the back door.
-WEITZ.:
That is not a pool, Peter.
That is a...
-Is it not?
-WEITZ.:
A water feature.
-Oh, I'm sorry.
WEITZ.:
They don't swim for fun.
It's just, you know, they look at the water and contemplate it.
-LAMBERT.:
Kind of a Zen thing.
-Yeah, it's a Zen thing, exactly.
It would be nice to not want to kill you all the time.
WEITZ.:
Laughter ensues.
The vote is actually going pretty well for Bella.
I think she already has a...
-No, actually no...
-LAMBERT.:
No, she's gotta wait for...
-Yeah, she's gotta wait for Esme and...
-WEITZ.:
But it's actually...
When Kellan votes, that kind of tips it in her favor.
-LAMBERT.:
Who's Calum?
-So she's got most of the delegates.
-LAMBERT.:
Oh, Kellan.
-Kellan, yeah.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah, sorry, thought you said Calum.
WEITZ.:
Oh, no, Emmett.
Kellan.
-LAMBERT.:
Yep.
-So now she's even stevens here, two against two and Kellan, three to two, when Esme says yes, then, boom, she's got a majority.
LAMBERT.:
Unless Carlisle goes against her.
WEITZ.:
Interesting.
Interesting.
Wait, no, no, 'cause she...
How does this voting go?
There should be a big board, like at the presidential elections.
LAMBERT.:
Yeah.
-WEITZ.:
We should have had a little...
-A little commentator, as well,
-taking the count.
-WEITZ.:
Yeah, a counter, yeah.
Anyway, here's a lovely song by the Editors coming on, which is fantastic, and you should hear more of.
Edward is not very pleased at the notion of Bella becoming a vampire.
And there's Jacob.
The unresolved issue, here.
LAMBERT.:
Beautiful shot coming up of that.
WEITZ.:
Lovely shot, thank you Javier and Dave Crone.
Jacob, I know you have something to say to me.
But I want to say something to you first, if that's all right.
WEITZ.:
Well, now, this whole sort of confrontation is all about the last second of the movie to me.
You know, leading, sort of...
You know, playing on these emotions, crushing Jacob's heart once more
before the ultimate cliffhanger.
Hey, my turn to talk.
LAMBERT.:
There was an unfortunate sort of thing that happened when this scene was shot where, through a sort of freak accident of angles, it made it look like Taylor was absolutely tiny when he jumped off the log.
WEITZ.:
Yeah.
LAMBERT.:
And not because he is absolutely tiny.
He looked like he was about 2-feet tall, and it was some sort of trick of the depth of the shot or something, so he had to be CG'd up a bit.
(LAUGHING) I remember the first iteration of the visual effect, they made him absolutely vast.
-WEITZ.:
Oh, yeah, he looked...
-Which was kind of exciting.
WEITZ.:
He suddenly looked like a troll from The Lord of the Rings, or the Balrog or something.
LAMBERT.:
He's about perfect now, I would say.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, I'd say he's just about perfect, too.
Yeah.
This is the old "I love you, but... "
I love you.
LAMBERT.:
But...
She says, "So. "
-That's good management tactic.
-WEITZ.:
Yeah, the thing you do when you're disappointing someone, is you don't say "positive thing but, "
you say "positive thing and or so, " you know.
-So, it's not a big letdown.
-LAMBERT.:
Yeah. "I love you,
"so, I'm letting you go from your job. "
That would be an example in the workplace.
WEITZ.: "We really appreciate the job you're doing, so... "
LAMBERT.: "So please pack up and be out of the office within half an hour
"or security will escort you out. "
WEITZ.:
I'm sorry.
We shouldn't be laughing.
This is a very...
LAMBERT.:
Yeah, it's only 'cause it's so painful
-that I can't take it seriously.
-WEITZ.:
That you can't face it.
-This is a lovely moment from Taylor.
-LAMBERT.:
Otherwise, we see this every day,
-I'd be crying all the time.
-WEITZ.:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Things are about to get a bit sticky.
Yeah, vampire-wolf fight on the way unless someone stops them.
Stop!
You can't hurt each other without hurting me.
WEITZ.:
So true.
LAMBERT.:
The Jacob theme in the music at its most extreme.
WEITZ.:
Yeah.
And now a reprise of the eye shot, but there is frickin' Edward in the background.
Different.
Different times.
And off he goes.
Jake.
WEITZ.:
Sorry, Jake.
Now this is a 20-second-long shot on Bella's face, and it's rare the actor who could support that.
But you can sort of see what's going on in her mind.
She's giving up Jake.
She's realizing what she's sacrificed, and then, helpfully, we ADR'ed in this bit of Edward again, saying that he doesn't want her to become a vampire.
Okay, so from this moment, this is all about...
What I'm trying to do is manipulate the audiences' emotions to a fever pitch as the music swells, as we get more and more emotional, and it's gonna just come to this moment of sheer frenzy.
LAMBERT.:
I love the way Rob plays this.
I remember you saying, when we first watched dailies and you were suggesting how to assemble it, that you'd told him that he should be a little flirtatious and it's almost...
I think you said Darcy in Pride and Prejudice,
-like he's toying with her, almost.
-WEITZ.:
Well, he knows that he's got this...
LAMBERT.:
But he's also nervous.
He's also nervous.
WEITZ.:
Yeah, it's nice that he's got some hesitations, but he also knows that he's about to drop a nuclear bomb.
...if you want me to do it myself.
WEITZ.:
He's nervous about it.
He knows she loves him.
He knows this is gonna change everything, though.
That's what I'm asking.
WEITZ.:
And then I really wanted the end of the movie to be an intake of breath.
I don't know why.
LAMBERT.: 'Cause it's what vampires don't do.
WEITZ.:
Very good point.
-LAMBERT.:
That's what makes her human.
-You're so right.
LAMBERT.:
Again, you didn't know that, but your instinct did.
WEITZ.:
That has been...
Oh, me.
Let's wait until...
Melissa!
LAMBERT.:
You know, I think as a bonus, Chris... (WEITZ CLAPPING SOFTLY)
Should we clap everyone?
I can't see this.
WEITZ.:
Stephenie.
There's Wyck and Karen, well done.
(BO TH CHEERING HALF-HEARTEDLY)
Marty, Greg, Mark, Guy.
Okay, Bill Bannerman.
Okay, so, Kerry, well done.
Obviously, I wanna thank all of these people.
I wanna thank Summit Entertainment for giving me the chance to do this.
I would like to thank Peter Lambert for being such a brilliant editor
-and a good friend through this process.
-LAMBERT.:
You're welcome.
Thank you.
WEITZ.:
Thank you for everyone who's worked on the making of DVD extras.
Thank you, guys.
Alexandre, well done by you with your music.
Alexandra, well done music supervising.
All of these people, lovely...
Thank you, Mercedes and Sebastian, for coming to Vancouver with me.
That's my wife and child, of course.
Thank you to all the actors, the extraordinary crews, both in Vancouver and in Italy.
Thank you to the Quileute Executive Council.
Gosh, the city of Vancouver, the city of Forks, Washington, the city of Montepulciano.
The city of Volterra, sorry.
Stephenie Meyer of course, gosh.
-All right.
-LAMBERT.:
All right, bye-bye.
WEITZ.:
Bye-bye.
Thanks.
Have a good dinner.
LAMBERT.:
Thanks.
(A WHITE DEMON LO VE SONG playing)
White demon love song down the hall
White demon shadow on the road
Back up your mind, there is a call
He isn't coming after all
Love this time
She likes the way he sings
White demon love song's in her dreams
White demon, where's your selfish kiss?
White demon sorrow will arrange
Let's not forget about the fear
Black invitation to this place that cannot change
While strangely holy
Come for a rain
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friend go?
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friend go?

-I won't make you cry
-I will never stray
-I will never stray
-I will do my part
-I will do my part
Let us be in love tonight

White demon, who let your friend go?
Stand it anymore, darling
Stand it
(MEET ME ON THE EQUINOX playing)
Meet me on the equinox
Meet me halfway
When the sun is perched at its highest peak
In the middle of the day
Let me give my love to you
Let me take your hand
As we walk in the dimming light
Oh, darling, understand
That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything ends
Meet me on your best behavior
Meet me at your worst
For there will be no stone unturned
Or bubble left to burst
Let me lay beside you, darling
Let me be your man
And let our bodies intertwine
But always understand
That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything, everything ends
A window
An opened tomb
The sun crawls
Across your bedroom
A halo
A waiting room
Your last breaths
Moving through you
As everything, everything ends
As everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything ends
Meet me on the equinox
Meet me halfway
When the sun is perched at its highest peak
In the middle of the day
Let me give my love to you
Let me take your hand
And as we walk in the dimming light
Oh, darling, understand
That everything, everything ends
"These violent delights have violent ends,
"and in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
"which, as they kiss, consume."
Gran?
Edward, don't!
She'll see you.
Okay.
Gran, I'd like you to meet...
Happy birthday, Bella.
Happy birthday.
I thought we agreed, no presents.
Well, the one from me's not wrapped, so it doesn't count.
That's actually great.
Thanks, Dad.
It goes with this one from your mom.
We coordinated.
Well, she coordinated me.
It's to put your pictures in from senior year.
Senior year.
-How'd you get so old so fast?
-I didn't.
It's not that old.
I don't know.
Is that a gray hair?
No.
No way.
Happy birthday.
That's really funny.
Another missing hiker brings the total to 3 presumed dead.
Rangers are searching for the killer animal...
Situation's all critical
You've got to look first before you go
It's Bella.
Bella!
-Hi.
-I'm...
Today's the big day, Bella.
R and J essay due.
-Yeah.
-Wherefore art thou, Bella?
Let me take a picture of you guys.
My mom wants me to put together, like, a scrapbook full of memories.
Cool.
Yeah.
I take them.
I'm not in them.
-No, no, no, come here.
-Well, you are today.
You'll photoshop this if my nose looks big, right?
Don't worry, I'm in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.
That's good.
Good.
Cullen's here.
Well, talk to you later.
-Happy birthday.
-Don't remind me.
Bella, your birth is definitely something to celebrate.
-Yeah, but my aging's not.
-Your aging?
I think 18 is a little young to start worrying about that.
It's one year older than you.
No, it isn't.
I'm 109.
Well, maybe I shouldn't be dating such an old man.
It's gross.
I should be thoroughly repulsed.
-We have to go to class.
-Okay.
Wait a second.
Someone wants you.
-Bella!
-Jacob!
What?
I'll leave you to talk.
Hello, biceps!
You know, anabolic steroids are really bad for you.
Well, I'm just filling out, Bella.
You know, it wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more.
You should switch schools.
You can come hang out with the palefaces.
I'm all right.
I prefer the rez school's exclusivity.
They let any old riffraff into this place.
I see.
Then why are you slumming it?
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.
You should really come take a ride when it's done.
Is it fast?
It's decent.
-I'm kidding.
-Okay.
Good.
Hey, happy birthday.
Your dad told my dad, so...
Yeah, of course he did.
I saw this the other day and thought of you.
Catches bad dreams.
That's kind of perfect.
Thank you.
No problem.
-Good seeing you.
-Yeah, I'll see you later.
Bye.
So how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?
Because I have nothing to give back to you.
Bella, you give me everything just by breathing.
See?
Thank you.
-That's all I want.
-Bella!
Happy birthday!
I thought I said no presents.
I've already seen you open it, and guess what, you love it.
You're gonna wear it tonight.
Our place.
Come on.
Please?
It'll be fun.
-Okay.
All right.
-Great!
Okay, I'll see you at 7:00.
Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing.
Sorry, Bella.
Happy...
Never mind.
You can't trust vampires.
Trust me.
O my love!
My wife!
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Thou art not conquered.
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks.
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
I hate being celebrated.
There are worse tragedies.
I mean, look at Romeo.
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.
Yeah.
Though I do envy him one thing.
Juliet is, like, perfect.
If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.
Not the girl, the suicide.
It's nearly impossible for...
For some people.
For humans, a little poison, a dagger to the heart.
There's so many different options.
Why would you say that?
Because I had to consider it once.
I didn't know if I'd get to you in time.
I had to come up with some kind of plan.
What was the plan?
That I'd go to Italy and provoke the Volturi.
-The what?
-The Volturi.
Now, who'd like to repeat the last few lines of iambic pentameter just to show they were paying attention?
Mr. Cullen?
Yes, Mr. Berty.
"O here will I set up my everlasting rest
"and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.
"Eyes, look your last.
"Arms, take your last embrace!
"And, lips, O you, the doors of breath,
"seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death!"
Eyes on the screen, people.
Thus with a kiss I die.
The Volturi are a very old, very powerful family.
I guess they're the closest thing to royalty my world has.
-Is that Carlisle?
-Yeah.
He lived with them for a few decades.
Described them as very refined.
No respect for human life, of course, but a respect for the arts and the sciences, at least.
And the law.
Above all, the law.
Vampires have laws?
Not very many.
And only one that's regularly enforced.
What is it?
That we keep the existence of our kind a secret.
We don't make spectacles of ourselves, and we don't kill conspicuously.
Unless, of course, you want to die.
You gotta stop talking about that.
I can't even think about someone hurting you.
Bella, the only thing that can hurt me is you.
And I don't have anything else to be afraid of.
That's not true.
Victoria?
She'll come for me one day.
Alice will see when she decides, and we'll be ready.
I could protect you if you change me.
Bella, you already do protect me.
You're my only reason to stay alive, if that's what I am.
But it's my job to protect you.
From everyone except my sister.
It's time!
It's time.
It's time.
It's time!
(The Violet Hour)
Your lips are nettles
Your tongue is wine
You're left as liquid But your body's pine
Sorry about all this.
-We tried to rein Alice in.
-As if that were even possible.
-Happy birthday, Bella.
-Thanks.
I found it in your bag.
You mind?
Dating an older woman.
Hot.
-What?
-You first, Rosalie.
It's a necklace.
Alice picked it out.
Thanks.
Show me the love.
This one's from Emmett.
Already installed it in your truck.
Finally a decent sound system
-for that piece of...
-Hey!
Don't hate the truck.
Open Esme and Carlisle's.
Just a little something to brighten your day.
Yes, you've been looking kind of pale lately.
Paper cut.
Jaz, Jaz.
It's okay.
It's just a little blood.
Get Jasper out of here.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.
Check on Jasper.
I'm sure he's very upset with himself, and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.
Edward.
-I never wanted to have a party.
-It's not your fault.
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.
How do you do it?
Years and years of practice.
Did you ever think of just doing it the easy way?
No.
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.
It brings me happiness, even if I am damned regardless.
Damned?
Like hell?
Carlisle, you couldn't be damned.
You couldn't.
It's impossible.
Thank you, Bella.
You've always been very gracious about us.
So that's it?
That's why he won't change me?
Imagine the situation in reverse.
If you believed as Edward does, could you take away his soul?
You can't protect me from everything.
At some point, something's gonna separate us.
It's gonna be an accident or illness or old age,
as long as I'm human.
And the only solution is to change me.
That's not a solution.
That's a tragedy.
You're not gonna want me when I look like a grandmother.
Bella, do you not understand my feelings for you at all?
Carlisle told me
how you feel about your soul.
I don't believe that.
So don't worry about mine.
You should go inside.
It's still my birthday.
So can I ask one thing?
Kiss me?
I love you.
I love you.
(Roslyn)
Up with your turret
Aren't we just terrified?
Shale, screen your worry
From what you won't ever find
Don't let it fool you
Don't let it fool you
Down
Hey.
Just come take a walk with me.
We have to leave Forks.
Why?
Carlisle's supposed to be 10 years older than he looks, and people are starting to notice.
Okay, I've gotta think of something to say to Charlie.
When you say "we"...
I mean my family and myself.
Edward, what happened with Jasper, it's nothing.
You're right.
It was nothing, nothing but what I always expected and nothing compared to what could have happened.
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.
I belong with you.
No.
You don't.
I'm coming.
Bella,
I don't want you to come.
You don't want me?
No.
That changes things a lot.
But if it's not too much to ask, can you just promise me something?
Don't do anything reckless.
For Charlie's sake.
And I'll promise something to you in return.
This is the last time you'll ever see me.
I won't come back, and you can go on with your life without any interference from me.
It will be like I never existed, I promise.
If this is about my soul, take it.
I don't want it without you.
It's not about your soul.
You're just not good for me.
Not good enough for you.
I'm just sorry I let this go on for so long.
Please...
Don't...
Goodbye.
Edward.
Edward.
Edward.
Edward!
Edward.
I'm gonna try the Cullens' place again.
-The Cullens left town, Charlie.
-Good riddance.
Where'd they go?
We'll find her, Charlie.
-Thanks, Harry.
-Charlie!
Hey.
She's all right.
I got her.
Thank you, Sam.
(Possibility)
There's a possibility
There's a possibility
All that I had
Was all I'm gonna get
Alice, you've disappeared, like everything else.
Now who else can I talk to?
I'm lost.
When you left, and he left,
you took everything with you.
But the absence of him is everywhere I look.
It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest.
Bella.
But in a way I'm glad.
The pain is my only reminder that he was real, that you all were.
All right.
That's it.
What?
You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother.
I'm not leaving Forks.
Bells, he's not coming back.
I know.
It's just not normal, this behavior.
Quite frankly, it's scaring the hell out of me and your mother.
Baby, I don't want you to leave.
I don't, but just go.
Go to Jacksonville.
Make some new friends.
I like my old friends.
-Well, you never see them anymore.
-I do.
I'm gonna go shopping tomorrow with Jessica.
-You hate shopping.
-I...
I need a girls' night out.
All right.
Girls' night.
Shopping.
I like it.
Go buy some stuff.
Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.
Yeah, Bella Swan.
I don't know why you want to sit through all those zombies eating people and no hot guys kissing anybody.
It's gross.
Like...
And why are there that many zombie movies anyway?
'Cause if it's supposed to, like, draw a parallel about leprosy, my cousin had leprosy.
It's not funny, you know?
And, like, is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism?
Because don't be so pleased with your own, like, self-referential cleverness, you know?
Like, some girls like to shop.
Not all girls, apparently.
Although I was surprised you even called at all.
You know?
Like, your depression thing, I get it.
I'm totally, totally worried.
But after a while it's like,
-you're still bumming...
-You want a ride, girls?
and I'm going through stuff, too.
You know?
Like Mike deciding he just wants to be friends.
What's up?
Look what we found.
It's hard, you know?
Like, and since when does "just friends"...
-What's up guys?
-Look what we found.
Hey, where you going?
Keep walking.
This is dangerous.
-Dude, come on.
-Come here for a sec!
I think I know those guys.
We got beer!
We got bikes!
Well, they seem great.
Can we go?
I'm just gonna see something.
Hey, girlie!
All right, all right.
We got a taker.
Turn around.
-Shut up!
-You shut up!
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
No, that's cool.
I'll be whoever you want me to be, honey.
So, what do you say?
You promised me, nothing reckless.
You promised it would be as if you never existed.
-You lied.
-You say something, babe?
You know what?
Never mind.
Stop!
Stop, stop, stop!
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?
Just curious.
-I thought that I saw something.
-You...
You're insane, actually.
Or suicidal.
That homeboy could've been a psycho.
I was about to end up in an FBI interview room like some lame TV show.
God, that was such a rush.
Awesome.
So you're an adrenaline junkie now?
That's cool.
You can go bungee jumping.
You don't get on the back of some random loser's motorcycle.
Crazy.
Alice, I saw him.
Maybe I'm crazy now.
I guess that's okay.
If a rush of danger is what it takes to see him, then that's what I'll find.
Bella!
Where the hell have you been, loca?
I brought you something.
-Okay.
-It's a little crazy.
Scrap metal.
You shouldn't have.
I saved it from the junkyard.
I think they'll probably cost more to fix than they're worth, but then I thought that if I had a mechanic friend to help me out then...
-Me being the mechanic-type friend?
-That's right.
